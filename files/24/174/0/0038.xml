; CONFIDENTIAL 1.1&apos;BRARY.CONFIDENTIAL. ;      2(25&apos;[T 6819/345/380]Memorandum submitted to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for Foreign. Affairs, with the concurrence of  the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.DURING the past fortnight resumed discussions have been in progress between representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Norwegian Government with a view to an agreement on the subject of Norwegian territorial waters and the protection of Norwegian fishery interests. The discussions have been conducted, so far as Great Britain is concerned, by representatives of the Admiralty and the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.2. The results of these discussions are embodied in the minutes of the Joint Anglo-Norwegian Conference attached to this memorandum as Appendix. I. The summary of conclusions will be found in the minutes of the eighth&apos; meeting&quot; on pages .;i and 6 of this appendix, and to these the attention of my colleagues is directed.3. I am of the opinion, in which the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries concur, that if Norway is willing to conclude agreements with Great Britain on the lines set forth on the pages referred to, His Majesty&apos;s Government should embrace the opportunity  id.) To put an end to disputes between the two countries regarding the seizure by Norway of British fishing vessels in places which His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot admit to be Norwegian waters. (6.) To secure the recognition  by Norway of the principle that the limit of territorial waters does not extend beyond 3 miles from the coast at low-water mark, and her support of this principle at any international conference which may hereafter take place.4 The Norwegian delegation attach importance to obtaining an explicit declaration from His Majesty&apos;s Government as to the terms upon which they are prepared to enter into agreements with Norway. There is reason to believe that, if the Norwegian delegation can he assured that His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to enter into agreements on the lines now suggested and have gone to the utmost limit of the concessions which they are prepared to make in order to settle existing differences, the Norwegian delegation will recommend to their Government the conclusion of the necessary conventions on these terms, and that there is a fair prospect of a favourable reception for these proposals in Norway. Unless, however, agreement is to be deferred fir approximately a year, it is essential that the Norwegian Government should be informed of the proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government in time for them to be submitted to and debated by the Storring, which adjourns at the end of the present month and will be immersed in financial business when it next meets in January ] 926. The chief Norwegian delegate is delaying his departure from London till Saturday, the 11th July, in the hope that by that time he may be informed of the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government.5. I do not. think that any exception can be taken to the terms of the proposed arrangements regarding fisheries. As regards the proposed recognition of Norwegian jurisdiction in the fjords and other inlets specified, I realise the necessity of considering very carefully whether the recognition of these waters, or some of them, as territorial inlets may at some time cause embarrassment to His Majesty&apos;s Government in their dealings with other Powers. Every case has, however, been carefully scrutinised by Admiralty experts, and I am advised that the reasons which are given for the concessions proposed, coupled with the long-standing historical claims of Norway over these waters, are adequate and can be effectively adduced against any attempt to treat these concessions as precedents for analogous concessions to other Powers.6. Having regard, therefore, to the importance attaching not only to the removal of the causes of friction regarding fisheries jurisdiction, which are the sole exception to 2957   [13308]
our otherwise cordial relations with Norway, but also to securing for the principle &quot;of the 3-mile limit of territorial jurisdiction the support of a country which has for more than a century maintained a claim to jurisdiction up to 4 miles, 1 strongly urge my colleagues to authorise a communication to the Norwegian delegation in the terms of the draft which forms Appendix II to this memorandum. The effect of this conununica-tion will be that His Majesty&apos;s Government will offer the Norwegian Government the opportunity of concluding Conventions with Great Britain embodying -the terms set out in the draft convention on territorial waters which forms Appendix III to this memorandum and a fisheries convention embodying the substance of the terms set forth in Appendix IV.7. In asking for this authority, I do not lose sight of the tact that, under the tetms of the resolution of the Imperial Conference of 1923, it will be necessary to give the Governments of the Dominions and India an opportunity of expressing their views. The probability of objection on their part is, however, remote ; and I suggest that the proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government might be communicated to the Norwegian Government as a firm offer, subject only to the result of communication with the Dominions and India.A.

Appendix I.Minutes of Meetingsof theAnglo-Norwegian Conference regarding Territorial Waters.
Minutes of Meetings of the Anglo-Norwegian Conference regarding Territorial Waters.FIRST MEETING.THE First Meeting was held at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries on the 23rd June, at 11 a.m.   There were present : On the Norwegian side Professor Johan Hjort. Kommandor Gade. Mr. Ingvald Smith-Kielland. Kaptein Per Ask i m.On the British side Mr. H. G. Maurice, C.B. Captain H. P. Douglas, C.M.G., R.N. Mr. E. M. B. Ingram, O.B.E. Commander B. C. Watson, D.S.O., R.N. Mr. H. S. Moss-BlundeH, C.B.E.Mr. Maurice opened the proceedings with a few words of welcome to the Norwegian delegates, on whose behalf Professor Hjort made a suitable reply. On the latter&apos;s proposal, it was agreed that Mr. Maurice should preside at the meetings of the Conference.Mb. MAURICE suggested that the best method of procedure would be to discuss first the Norwegian claims regarding the fjords.PROFESSOR HJORT concurred on behalf of his colleagues, stating that the Norwegian Government,&apos; on receipt of Mr. LindleyV note of the 10th June, 1925 (Annex I), had decided that it would be advantageous to ascertain in detail both the concessions which Great Britain was prepared to make in this connection and the arrangements which might be made for the extension of the North Sea Convention to the areas north of latitude 61The Norwegian Government had consequently nominated the present Norwegian delegation to proceed to London with this object in view, and had furnished them with instructions on the subject, a copy of which will be found in Annex II.CAPTAIN DOUGLAS then read a statement (Annex III) explaining the British attitude to the Norwegian claim that all N&apos;orway&apos;s so-called fjords should be regarded as coming within her territorial jurisdiction, and illustrated his statement by indicating on the tracings from Admiralty silhouettes the fjords which Great Britain is prepared to recognise as Norwegian territorial waters (viz., Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, (5 (with a modified line), 11 (with a modified line), 19 and 25).THE NORWEGIAN DELEGATES, took note of this statement, and the pro-ceedings were adjourned till 11 a.m. on the 24th June to enable them to prepare a reply to Captain Douglas&apos;s statement.SECOND  MEETING.THE second meeting was held at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries on the 2-ith June at 11 a.m. There were present the same as at the first meeting. The minutes of the first meeting were duly passed.The Norwegian delegates presented the reply (Annex IV) which they had prepared to the statement made by Captain Douglas at the first meeting. The British delegates took note of this reply and a general discussion ensued regarding the two points in the second paragraph of the Norwegian memorandum, upon which the Norwegian delegates based their attitude towards the wdiole question. The British delegates emphasised the two facts that the more water Norway claimed as territorial, the greater would be[13301]



her commitments and responsibilities in the event of a war ; while from the point of view of a belligerent the lesser the extent of territorial waters, the greater the facilities for pursuing enemy shipping.Allusion was made by the Norwegian delegates to the fact that other countries did not accept the British principle of the 3-mile limit. The British delegates made it clear that-whatever other countries might assert and maintain in this respect, Great Britain did not accept their contentions and notified them of the fact whenever such pretensions were made. Great Britain contested any principles other than the 3-mile principle when claimed as a right for purposes of international law, but were prepared to make exceptions by convention for special purposes and if warranted by special circumstances. They made it clear moreover that the configuration of the Norwegian coast was not peculiar to Norway but was similar in many respects to that of Chile and Patagonia, while the entrances to the Straits of Magellan offered a parallel to many of the sounds and channels which gave access to several Norwegian fjords. The general configuration of the coast of Norway did not, therefore, in itself offer an exceptional circumstance warranting Great Britain in departing from her principle.It became clear in the course of discussion that the Norwegian delegates held great store by retaining a &quot; lead &quot; behind the skerries along the whole Norwegian coast, through which Norwegian ships and coastal traffic could pass without emerging from Norwegian territorial waters. Next to the retention of this &quot; lead &apos;: came the approaches to it from the high seas, and in this connection they put forward the suggestion that without infringing the principles upon which Great Britain drew her 3-mile limit for territorial waters, some formula might be evolved which would enable base-lines to be drawn in certain specified areas from island to island, where such islands give access to territorial inlets. The British delegates agreed to consider such a suggestion, provided the Norwegian delegation could put forward in each individual case sufficiently exceptional circumstances to support their claim.The appropriate charts were then examined with a view to ascertain the degree to-which the British principle upon which the 3-mile limit is drawn would affect the maintenance intact by Norway of some such &quot;lead,&quot; as is outlined above.THIRD  MEETING.THE third meeting was held at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries on the 24th June at 3 p.m.   There were present the same as at the second meeting.The examination of the charts mentioned at the end of the minutes of the last meeting was continued. Both parties having arrived at a mutual understanding of the main factors and principles underlying their respective standpoints, it was decided that two sub-committees should be formed : a naval one and a fishery one.The former, which was to include Kommandor Gade and Kaptein Askim on the Norwegian side, and Captain Douglas, Commander Watson and Mr. Ingram on the British side, would go through the charts of the Norwegian coast and endeavour to reduce to a minimum the points of difference between the divergent views.The latter sub-committee, which was to comprise Professor Hjort and Mr. Smith Kieiland on the Norwegian side and Mr. Maurice aud Mr. Blundell on the British side, would begin to discuss the details of an eventual arrangement regarding the protection of Norwegian fishing interests on the supposition that agreement is reached on the subject of the fjords.FOURTH MEETING.THE fourth meeting was held at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries on the 26th. June at d p.m. There were present the same as at the third meeting. The minutes of the second and third meetings were duly passed.The Naval and Fishery Sub-Committees presented the reports of their respective proceedings, and the conference adjourned to enable both sides to consider these reports. The reports of these two sub-committees are attached as Annexes V and VI t.&apos;- I lie minutes of this meetinp-I 3301 j
FIFTH MEETING.THE fifth meeting was held at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries on the 29th June at 3&apos;15 p.m. There were present the same as at the fourth meeting. The minutes of the fourth meeting were duly passed.Mr. MAURICE proceeded to read out a statement prepared by the Admiralty in reply to the memorandum submitted by the Norwegian delegation which forms Annex IV to the minutes of the second meeting of the conference. This statement forms Annex VII to the minutes of this meeting.THE BRITISH DELEGATION then notified the Norwegian delegation of the result of the examination by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the arguments put forward by the Norwegian delegation in support of their claims to the seventeen inlets remaining to be discussed see Annex (D) to the second meeting of the Naval Sub-Gommittee (Annex V to the minutes of the fourth meeting of the conference). The British delegates stated that they were prepared to meet the Norwegian claims regarding the inlets numbered as follows according to the Admiralty silhouettes in the above-mentioned annex: 3, 7, 11, 16, 18a, 21, 24: and 25. The reasons in each individual case are set forth in Part I of Annex VIII to the minutes of this meeting. They were, however, unable to meet the Norwegian views regarding the following inlets, numbered in Annex (D) as follows: 8, 10, 13, 18, 19 a, 19b, 20, 22a and 24a. The reasons in each individual case are set forth in Part II of Annex VIII to the minutes of this meeting.THE NORWEGIAN DELEGATION took note of these statements.KOMMANDOR GADE raised the question of defining the rocks and islands which could be used as the points of departure from which territorial limits could he drawn. In this connection the Norwegian delegation submitted a memorandum (Annex IX to the minutes of this meeting) setting forth the definitions laid down by the Norwegian Government on this subject and the interpretation placed upon them by a Norwegian expert committee on territorial waters.SIXTH  MEETING-.THE sixth meeting was held at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries on the 30th June, at 3&apos;30 r.m. There were present the same as at the fifth meeting. The minutes of the fifth meeting were duly passed.The Norwegian delegates, having considered the statement by the British Com-lnittee (Annex VIII to the minutes of the fifth meeting) on. the claims advanced by the Norwegian Naval Sub-Committee, emphasised their regret that the British Committee had not seen their way to accede to the Norwegian claims in respect of the inlets numbered&apos; 10 and 20 on the Admiralty silhouettes, and briefly recapitulated the arguments already put forward in support of their claims thereto.Discussion was then opened on the British methods of drawing the 3-mile limit, with special reference to the rocks which might be used as points of departure for drawing the &quot; envelope.&quot; The British delegates promised to provide the Norwegian delegates with a statement to be annexed to the protocol defining these methods. A few large scale charts were examined on which the British method was drawn in green and the Norwegian method&quot; in red.Dr. Hjort finally suggested that the Fishery Sub-Committee should continue its labours by an examination of the Anglo-Danish Convention for Iceland and the Faroe Islands of 190.1. It was agreed that the object of this examination should be to sift in this convention the points of substance and principle from those of purely administrative machinery, with the object of endeavouring to arrive at formulae which could be mutually applied, as between Great Britain and Norway.* The Norwegian method is based on the principles denned in Annex IX to the minutes of the meeting.
SEVENTH MEETING.THE seventh meeting was held at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries on the-3rd July at .1.1 a.m. There were present the same as at the sixth meeting, with the exception of Kommandor Gade and Captain Douglas. The minutes of the sixth meeting were duly passed.The British delegation furnished the Norwegian delegation with .a statement defining the principles employed by Great Britain in determining the 3-mile limit of -territorial waters.&quot;  This statement forms Annex N to the minutes of this meeting.THE BRITISH DELEGATION explained that the phrase &quot; capable of use &quot; in this statement meant capable, without artificial addition, of being used throughout all seasons for some definite commercial or defence purpose.The Norwegian delegation handed the British delegation a questionnaire regarding the international aspect of any formal agreements which might be concluded between Great Britain and Norway regarding the fishery and territorial waters questions discussed at this conference. This questionnaire forms Annex XI to the minutes of this meeting.Dr. HJORT explained that what he and his colleagues apprehended was that the fact of an agreement with Great Britain, even of a provisional character, by which Norway was committed to the principle of the 3-mile limit, might be construed by other Powers as a departure by Norway from the principles she maintains, with the result that she would be embarrassed in opposing a claim on the part of such Powers to freedom of access up to the 3-mile limit and within the fjords without any-compensatory advantage in the form of protection for her fishery interests.The British delegates undertook to bring this questionnaire and Dr. Hjort&apos;s statement to the notice of the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and made it clear that these questions could only be dealt with through the normal diplomatic -channels.EIGHTH MEETING.THE eighth meeting was held at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries on the 6th July at 11 a.m. There were present the same as at the sixth meeting. The minutes of the seventh meeting were duly passed.The two delegations finally agreed upon the following resume of the principal points covered by their discussions : Early in the course of the discussions recorded in the preceding minutes it was patent that there were considerable difficulties in the way of reaching a satisfactory solution of the questions at issue.While the Norwegian delegation could only regard, as satisfying Norway&apos;s interests and the Norwegian point of view, provisions similar to those of the protocol signed at Oslo in December 1924, the British delegates were unable to reconcile them with the maintenance of the 3-mile principle for territorial waters to which so much importance was attached by the British Government.As, however, both delegations were convinced of the desirability and importance of agreement being reached between their respective countries on the fishery and territorial waters question, an attempt was made, despite the existing difficulties and differences of view, to investigate the grounds upon which conventions might be drawn up on these questions.As a result of these investigations, which are summarised in the minutes of the Conference, it became evident that the only possible basis of agreement was as follows : (A.) That a convention should   be  concluded  dealing with the  question of territorial waters;That by it Norway would agree to accept the principle of the 3-mile limit for her territorial waters, as defined in Annex X to the minutes of the seventh meeting of the conference ; while Great Britain would in return agree to accept as territorial inlets the so-called fjords and inlets specified in Annex (B) to the minutes of the first meeting of the Naval Sub-Com-mittee (see Annex V to the minutes of the fourth meeting of the Conference), and in Part I of Annex VIII to the minutes of the fifth meeting of the Conference ;
That at the entrance to the following inlets the seaward limit of the 3-mile belt of territorial waters should be the lines indicated hereunder in the case of each inlet, except at each end of the line where it approaches within 3 miles of the coast, and where, in consequence, the limits of territorial waters are determined by reference to the coast : Varangerfjord from Kibergnes to Grense Jakobselv. Andfjord from Maaneset to North Point of Andoy. Vestfjord from Skomvaer Light to Kalshohnen Light. Frohavet from Halten Light to Hosenoene Light.And that with regard to the following inlets the limit of territorial waters should be 3 miles to seaward of the lines by which the inlets are defined as hereunder : Sylte fjord, from Storskjaer to Klubbespiret. Kougs fjord, from Vesterneset to Naalneset.Tana fjord, from Tanahorn to north-east point of Omgangs-Klubben. Lakse fjord, from Store Finnkjerka to east point of Svaerholt-Klubben. Porsanger fjord, from north point of Svaerholt-Klubben to Helnesoclden. PIjelmsoy-Mageroy, from Sortvignaering to Gjaesvaernaering. Arnoy-Loppen, from Brynnilen to north point of Arnoy. Rostnavet, from Blsneset to Rostoy. Langesund fjord, from Straaholmen to Tvesten. Oslo fjord, from Faerder to Torbjornskjaer.(B.) That another convention should be concluded dealing with the question of fisheries north of latitude 61Q N. on the lines of the Anglo-Danish Convention of 1901, regulating fisheries outside territorial waters in the ocean surrounding Iceland and the Faroes, as amplified and modified by the resolutions of the Fishery Sub-Committee (see Annex VI to the minutes of the fourth meeting; of the conference).(C.) That Norway should accede to the North Sea Fisheries Convention of 1882.It was further agreed that the eventual form of the above conventions, if accepted by the Governments concerned, could only be determined by them, through the normal diplomatic channels. The conclusions of the two delegations were there-fore confined to the points of substance and questions of principle involved.Both delegations are, however, agreed that the conclusion of such conventions would be greatly facilitated if a satisfactory answer to the questionnaire on their international aspect (see Annex XI to the minutes of the seventh meeting of the conference) could be furnished by the British Government.HENRY G.

Annex T.Note from His Majesty s Minister to the Norwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs,June 10, 1925.M. le Ministre,1. I have the honour to state that His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government have given careful consideration to your Excellency&apos;s note of the 12th May on the subject of Norwegian territorial waters, and are prepared to make substantial concessions in regard to the recognition of Norwegian jurisdiction over the fjords.2. As regards the proposed extension of the North Sea Convention to the area north of latitude 61&quot;, Bis Majesty&apos;s Government have reason to believe that the arrangements which they have in view will be satisfactory to both parties.3. By direction, therefore, of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, I am to urge your Excellency to send Norwegian delegates over to London as soon as possible for the purpose of discussing in detail the question of these fjords and the arrangements to be made north of latitude 61Q.I avail, &amp;c.F. 0. LINDLEY.Annex II.(Strictly Confidential.) Instructions for the Delegates of the Norwegian Government in negotiating with the British Delegates in London relative to the Territorial Waters.The Norwegian delegates are charged with the task of endeavouring to obtain as exhaustive information as possible regarding the merits and extent, of the assurances given in the British Ministers note dated the 10th June, 1925, viz. :  1. What are the substantial concessions which the British intend to make in regard to the recognition of Norwegian jurisdiction over the fjords.2. How the arrangements as regards the proposed extension of the North Sea Convention to the areas north of latitude 61G are intended to be effected so that the same will be satisfactorjr to Norway.It shall further be the duty of the Norwegian delegates to endeavour to ascertain what base-lines the British are willing to establish in regard to a possible 3-mile limit, also what procedure is intended to be adopted for the purpose of arriving at an arrangement, internationally recognised, relative to the territorial waters.The delegates should make it clear to the British delegates that the said enquiries do not in any respect prejudice the view maintained by Norway in regard to her territorial waters.It is a matter of course that the Government will not be bound by the negotiations which are to take place.Annex III.Admiralty Memorandum No. 1.If the question of Norwegian fjords could be isolated we should probably be prepared to concede nearly all Norway&apos;s claims in return for her adherence to the 3-mile limit, but we have to consider the effect on the demands made by other countries.A large number of the claims made by Norway are to waters which, prirrid facie, we should not regard as closed waters at all, but as forming part of the high seas. Recognition of them by us will lead to similar demands by other countries, which in some places may greatly restrict the operations of our war vessels in war time and seriously prej- udice the defence of the Empire and its communications.We consider that for an inlet to be regarded as territorial it should be to a very considerable degree enclosed by the mainland. Other factors, such as national defence, maintenance of neutrality, economic, historical, remoteness from general sea traffic, come into consideration, but they are secondary to that of configuration.in&apos;
In view of the peculiar character of the Norwegian coast, however, we are prepared to concede that it is not reasonable to insist that all inlets to be regarded as territorial must be enclosed by the mainland, but we find it impossible to discover any principle on which waters that are only enclosed by islands with navigable channels between them can be regarded as territorial, especially where these channels are of considerable width. .In some cases the area of water gained by Norway (that is, outside that covered by the 3-mile limit as drawn by us), if the whole of the so-called fjord is conceded, appears unimportant, and it is scarcely reasonable to expect this country to concede them and so give away an important principle which may lead to great difficulties with other countries.Annex IV.&quot; Memorandum by the Norwegian Delegation in reply to Annex III to the Minutes &apos;of the First Meeting.Introduction.REFERRING to the memorandum from the British delegation of the 23rd June, we beg to submit for consideration the following remarks : Apart from fishery points of view to be discussed at a later occasion, we consider the following principles decisive for the Norwegian standpoint as regards the extent of the territorial waters : 1. Belligerent countries in time of war should not be permitted to make use of Norwegian fjords and waters between the islands forming the belt outside-the mainland, nor should their warships be allowed to operate or take up positions in these waters. 2. From the point of view of navigation, the communications by sea along the coast should be maintained during any war in which Norway is not a belligerent.These two points may be better understood by the following explanation.It will certainly be admitted from all sides that a country like Norway, whose policy of war will have a defensive, character or the object of defending its neutrality, will desire to keep all warlike operations away from these coastal areas.It is further evident that the navigation along the coast needs a neutral belt of sufficient extent and with limits of a nature which can be determined without great difficulty.The British rules for determining the territorial limit will lead to very irregular lines when applied to the peculiar configuration of the coast and the complicated formation of islands, skerries and rocks off Norway. These are so irregular in reality that doubt will arise in many cases whether the position of a ship is within or outside the limit. We wish to draw attention to the vital importance for Norway of being able to maintain during a time of war reliable communications along the coast. The existing system of communications (railways, roads, &amp;c.) only permits the importation of goods to a very limited number of ports, and ^reat parts of the country will hardly be able to exist if the distribution of goods from these ports along the coast should be paralysed.The Norwegian delegation understands the standpoint of the British delegation.However, we want to put forward as our opinion that, without prejudicing the British view as a universal principle, it might be possible in certain given cases to modify it.On the part of Norway, the basis for such a modification might be built on the fact that the nation from olden times has looked upon as national waters the fjords, the bays and the inlets which have land on both sides which is Norwegian territory and which belong to the belt of skerries or geographical^ form part of the country.The reason for an eventual recognition by Great Britain of these waters might be sought in the consideration that the said waters, unlike the Channel and the Danish Belts, cannot be characterised as parts of any highways of the sea.
Annex V.First Meeting of the Naval Sub-Committee.IN accordance with the decision taken at the third meeting of the conference, the Naval Sub-Committee held its first meeting at the Admiralty on the 25th June at 11 a.m.It was established at the outset that there was a total of thirty-one so-called fjords or inlets round the Norwegian coast, which should form the subject of discussion. These fjords are tabulated in the Annex (A) to the minutes of this meeting.The British delegates reaffirmed stbeir willingness to accept the Norwegian claims in respect of seven of the above, see Annex (B) to the minutes of this meeting. The Norwegian delegates, however, advanced subsequently a further claim regarding the limits of the oslo fjord.The Norwegian delegates expressed a similar readiness to abandon eight of their former claims, as set forth in the protocol drawn up at the Oslo Conference in December 1924, see Annex (C) to the minutes of this meeting. One of these eight is the Listerfjord which was not discussed at Oslo.Before proceeding to discuss in detail the remaining seventeen fjords,* Kommandor Gade explained that the protocol drawn up at Oslo gave expression in general to the Norwegian views and sentiments regarding Norway&apos;s geographical unity.The British delegates made it clear that in applying the British principles to these fjords they were not rejecting the Norwegian claim to the interior waters of the fjords, but merely insisting on a method of drawing the territorial limits, which in the great majority of cases only involved the abandonment by Norway of a small area of waters at the entrances to these inlets.The delegates next proceeded to discuss in detail and tabulate their respective views regarding the above seventeen fjords.* Viz., sixteen plus the reopened question of the oslo fjord. [13301] 1 cWe want to draw attention to the tact that all the complexes of isles, rocks and skerries which, in connection with the mainland form those fjords and inlets claimed by Norway are directly, geographically and naturally combined with the mainland as a whole.Conclusion.In case the British delegation appreciate and make allowance for the views pointed out in the introduction, it seems to the Norwegian delegation that the discussion on fjords might be continued with advantage, on the basis that the British principles, as far as Norway is concerned, are modified in accordance with what &quot;might be expressed as our right claims, and in such a way an eventual agreement will not prejudice the position of Great Britain towards other countries, and will not compromise British interests. We venture to suggest that the delegates discuss the codification of a principle which gives special rules for &quot; Countries which are broken up in islands, constituting a lead, following the cuntour of the mainland; such lead giving direct communication through it between the different parts of the country, but not affording the only passage to other seas, and therefore not essential for the communications or supplies of other countries.&quot;If an agreement is reached on this principle, we would suggest its application to Norway.This principle should not conflict with the general method for the determination of the British territorial waters as defined by the delegates of Great Britain at the meeting in Oslo in December 1924. -June 24, 1925.

They were prepared to consider a base line drawn from Sortvignaering to Gjaesvaernaering. The above remarks were subject to any fishery require-ments which the sub-committee was not competent to discuss.Reasons of navigation, coastal communication and supplies made it essential for the Norwegians to retain the base line of the. Oslo Protocol.The Norwegian delegates suggested that, as the Breivik-fjord is 6 miles across tho entrance, it might be treated a-* a 6-mile bay, and that the base line across the Sound might be drawn from Haanebba to the northernmost point of Loppen in order that the direct line of Norwegian communications from the south to Hammer -fest might pass entirely within Norwegian territorial waters. The above suggestions were subject to any fishery requirements which the sub-committee Vvas not competent to discuss.The Norwegian delegates would prefer the protocol line, but were prepared to consider a line from I3rynnilen to the northernmost point of Arhby, as the former place is- the accepted point dividing the counties of Pinnmarken and Tromso. This latter line was necessary for them in order that &quot;their communications might hot pass outside Norwegian territorial waters.[13301]Annex (C).

There were also naval considerations to be taken into account.The Norwegian delegates understood that there were fishing considerations which would compel them lo press for the line drawn in the Oslo Protocol.The Norwegian delegates claimed this as being one of the natural outlets of the Vestf jord.The Norwegian delegates were anxious that the baselines for the limits of Norwegian tenitorial waters should be drawn through the points mentioned on the grounds of the general principles already enunciated. These two cases afforded an illustration of the principles, the formula-tion of which they had advocated in the same annex, of drawing base lines from island to island.Thei Norwegian delegates desired to press for the lines of the Oslo Protocol in order that their direct route of communication might remain within Norwegian territorial waters. If the British thesis was maintained, the diffi-culties of navigation would be greatly increased the Norwegian delegates desired the line of the Oslo Protocol on the grounds of the general principles which were enunciated in Annex IV to the minutes of the second meeting of the conference.The Norwegian delegates were anxious that this fjord should be included on the grounds of the general prin-ciples already enunciated, but agreed that the territorial limits as drawn by Great Britain did not unduly conflict with their interests.The Norwegian delegates pressed for this base line in order to protect the main route of navigation to and from the oslo fjord.The Norwegian delegates pressed for this base line in order to protect the main route of navigation to and from the oslo fjord.The Norwegian delegates explained that this line was laid down by Royal decree as the southernmost limit of the defences of Oslo ;md the oslo fjord, and for this reason pressed for its acceptance as the base line for Norwegian territorial waters in this area.Annex VI.Meeting of the Sub-Committee for Fishery Questions.IN accordance with the decision taken at the third meeting of the Conference, the Fishery Sub-Committee held its first meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries on the 25th June at 11 a.m.The question of safeguarding the Norwegian fishery interests north of latitude 61c north was considered with a view to deciding upon the necessary amplifications and modifications of the existing International Fishery Conventions, viz., that for the North Sea of 1882 and that made between Great Britain and Denmark for Iceland and the Faroe Islands in 1901.It was agreed that the convention should follow the general lines of that of 1901, subject to special provision being made for (a.) The exclusive fishery limits to be granted to Norway.(b.) The measures to be adopted for the protection of Norwegian fishery interests outside the agreed exclusive fishery limits.
With regard to (a), it was agreed that the exclusive fishery limits of Norway should comprise  (i.) Such waters as shall be agreed to be Norwegian territorial waters ; (ii.) Such  other  waters  as  are  included   in article 2 of  the Anglo-Danish Convention;and that for the purposes of article 2 neither of the expressions &quot;islets, rocks and hanks &quot; covers any islet, rock or bank which is permanently submerged, or which is neither exposed nor awash at high water.With a view to carrying out this agreement the following article was drafted in substitution for article 2 of the convention of 1901 :  The Subjects of His Majesty the King of Norway shall enjoy the exclusive right of fishery within the distance of three miles from low water mark along the whole extent of the coasts of Norway as well as of the dependent islets, rocks and banks, and within such waters as are specifically acknowledged by His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government to be within the territorial limits of Norway.As regards bays, the distance of three miles shall be measured from a straight line drawn across the bay in the part nearest the entrance at the first point where the width does not exceed ten miles.The present article shall not prejudice the freedom of navigation or anchoring in territorial waters accorded to fishing boats provided they conform to Norwegian laws and regulations whilst within territorial waters.The following article was also drafted to take the place of article 4 : The geographical limits for the application of the present convention shall be fixed as follows : On the south by a line along the parallel of 61Q of north latitude from the coast of Norway to a point where that parallel meets the 2nd meridian of east longitude.On the west by a line drawn from the last-mentioned point along the 2nd meridian of east longitude to a point where that meridian meets the 65th parallel of north latitude, and thence to a point where the 16th meridian of east longitude meets the 7^nd parallel of north latitude.On the north by a line drawn from the last-mentioned point along the 72nd parallel of north latitude to a point where that parallel intersects the meridian of 31D 50&apos; east longitude.On the east by a line drawn from the last-mentioned point along the meridian of 31D 50&apos; east longitude until it intersects the limit of the territorial waters of Finland..  With regard to (b), the following articles were drafted : In substitution for Article 15.(a.) Subject to paragraph (b) and articles8&quot; .... boats arriving on the fishing grounds shall not either place themselves or shoot their nets or other gear in such a way as to injure each other or to interfere with fishermen who have already commenced their operations.(&amp;.) Fishermen operating in the vicinity of other fishermen shall conform to any local customs or arrangements which are observed in the vicinity, so long as such customs and arrangements are consistent with good seamanship in the circumstances.(c.) The Norwegian Government will keep His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government informed of any such customs and arrangements as are referred to in the preceding-paragraph, and His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government will communicate such information to the British fishermen concerned.In substitution for Article 19.(a.) Trawl fishermen shall take all necessary steps in order to avoid doing injury to the nets or gear of net or long-line fishermen. They shall not come within 1 mile of any vessel engaged in fishing of these kinds or lying to nets or long lines, and shall not enter within any area which has been notified in accordance with paragraph (c).(6.) Where damage is caused to nets&apos; or long lines, the responsibility shall be on the trawlers unless, they can prove that they were under stress of compulsory circum-* (a), (i),.(c) and id) of those proposed in the next paragraph in substitution for Article 19.
stances or that they have complied with the terms of this article, and that the losses:, sustained did not result from their fault.(c.) The Norwegian Government shall from time to time notify to His Britannic Majestys Government the areas within which it is anticipated that concentrations of nets and lines will take place. Such notification shall reach His Britannic majesty&apos;s Government in time to enable them to inform fishermen of the areas therein contained, and His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government will communicate the contents of each such notification to fishermen forthwith.(d.) For the purposes of paragraph (c) a concentration shall be deemed to be a large number of vessels fishing in close proximity to one another and all employing the same method of net fishing or line fishing.It was also agreed that it should be open to either party to suggest modifications, of detail or wording in the remaining articles of the Convention.Annex VII.Admiralty Memorandum No. 2.WHILST we are prepared to make substantial concessions as regards Norwegian clairiis to fjords or inlets wherever these Waters can in any way be regarded as enclosed, we cannot agree to recognise jurisdiction over waters that are really quite outside such enclosed inlets and can only be regarded as encroachments on the high seas. We have gone a long way to meet the Norwegian point of view by accepting that such enclosed inlets may in certain cases be formed by islands or may have navigable straits (in general use for sea traffic) leading out of them, two factors which are generally regarded as primd facie evidence that the inlets in question are not territorial.We must, however, oppose claims which are mainly based on a theory of general enclosing lines (drawn from headland to headland) round the coast. This has no justification in international law, and the recognition of any such claims would lead to extraordinary difficulties with other countries.Whilst sympathising with the Norwegian desire to keep their coastal comnumica-tions within territorial waters, though from the naval point of view there would appear lo be no real advantage, we think that the ordinary 3-mile belt, together with such recognition of inlets as we are prepared to agree to, provides reasonable facilities for this.Doubt as tO whether a ship is within or outside the territorial limit is inevitable in many cases off all coasts, and it is impossible to avoid this. Where the coast line is irregular, we consider that it must be accepted that the limit of territorial waters must constitute an irregular line. Deep pockets will be almost entirely avoided by the substantial concessions that we are prepared to make, but the results of the peculiar configuration of the Norwegian coast cannot be entirely avoided on any recognised modern conception of territorial waters.We must emphasise the substantial concessions that we have already agreed to make, particularly in respect of the Vest Fjord, where wTe are accepting a line considerably farther out than would ordinarily be regarded as the closing line of the inlet.June 29, 1925.Annex VIII.Statement by the British Committee on the Claims Advanced by the Norwegian Naval Sub-Committee, as set out in Annex (D) attached to the Minutes of the Second Meeting of the Naval Sub-Committees (see Annex V to the Minutes of the Fourth Meeting of the Conference).Part I.WE propose to deal first with the cases in which we think that we can meet the views of the Norwegian Committee, using the silhouette charts, and referring to the waters discussed by the numbers employed thereon, as set forth in Annex (D) : 3. The inlet is insignificant and we can agree to recognition, although there is some conflict with the principle we uphold.
Annex IX.Memorandum submitted by the Norwegian Delegation explaining the Points of Departure from which Norwegian Territorial Waters are Reckoned by Norwegian Royal Decrees, &amp;c.1. IN a letter frum the Norwegian Ministry for Foreign Affairs to the Norwegian Ministries of Defence and Justice, dated the 24th March, 1908, the following definition is given for purposes of fishing regulations : &quot; from the outermost coastline at low tide or from the outermost island or rock which is not permanently submerged.&quot;2. By a Royal Decree of the 18th December, 1912 (see &quot; Norsk Lovtidende &quot; of 1912, p. 591), the following definition is given for purposes of neutrality : &quot; islands, rocks or skerries which are not permanently submerged.&quot;3. Subsequently the Norwegian Government set up a committee to report -on the question of territorial waters. This committee defined in a report, which has never been made public but which was completed in 1913, the above terms as follows : &quot; islands, skerries and rocks which are always above water at ordinary low tide.&quot;4. There is, moreover, a declaration between Norway, Denmark and Sweden concerning rules of neutrality which was issued on the 21st December, 1912 (see7. We can agree to recognition of this fjord with the modified line suggested in Annex (D), on the ground that the various channels enclosed within this line can be regarded as mere divisions of the general entrance to the fjord.11. This can be agreed to, subject to the drawing of the line from Brynnilen to the northernmost ppint of Arnoy. This line may be regarded as marking the entrance to a well-defined and narrow fjord.16. In this case we have been impressed by the important naval considerations advanced, and in view of these considerations we can accept the Norwegian line, viz., from Maaueset to the northernmost point of Andoy.18 a. We can agree to No. 18a. the recognition of which appears to follow from the recognition of Vest Fjord as defined by the Norwegian line.21. We agree to the recognition of Frohavet for the reasons set out in the Oslo Protocol, i.e., hat, it gives access to the fortified port of Trondhjem.24. Having regard to the great importance which the Norwegian Comm ttee attaches to this area, owing to its proximity to Oslo Fjord, we can in this case regard the clusters of islands as, in effect, an extension of the coast enclosing the fjord.25. We can accept the Norwegian Committee&apos;s correction of the line drawn at the meeting at Oslo in December 1924. We understand that the revised line marks the outer defences of the port.Part II.In the following cases we are unable to fall in with the views of the Norwegian Committee : 8. We can find no grounds for regarding these waters as a territorial inlet.10. The same objection applies as in the case of No. 8 The entrance is wide, and there is no bay or fjord involved.   Breivik Fjord is a 6-mile bay.13. We can find no grounds of necessity or principle which would justify the recognition of this area as a territorial inlet.18. The same remarks apply as to No. 13.19a and 19b. We are unable to recognise these areas, which are neither fjords nor bays.20. The same remarks apply as to Nos. 13 and 18. 22 a. The same remarks apply as to 19a and 19b. 24a. The same remarks apply as to 19 a and 19 b.June 29, 1925.
Annex X.Principles employed by Great Britain in determining the 3-mile Limit of territorial Waters.THE 3-mile limit of territorial waters is the envelope of all circles, 3 nautical miles in radius, whose centres are situated on the low-water mark. The coast line from the low-water mark of which this limit should be measured is that of the mainland and also that of all islands. The word &quot;island&quot; comprises all portions of territory capable of use and permanently above water in normal circumstances.The limit of territorial waters in the case of bays whose width at the entrance does not exceed 0 miles, is 3 miles to seaward of a straight line drawn across the entrance.Territorial rights may in addition be admitted in respect of a certain number of larger bayrs or inlets, to be known as territorial inlets, which must be specifically enumerated and geographically defined.(N.B. The word &quot; envelope &quot; is a mathematical term, and denotes a curve forming a common tangent to a number of other curves arranged according to some fixed principle. In the special case of the 3-mile limit, the envelope of the 3-mile circles, so long as the low-water mark is a smooth line, is a smoothed curve ; if the low-water mark is of indented character, the envelope becomes a succession of short arcs having a radius of 3 miles.)Annex XI.Questions addressed by the Norwegian Delegation to the British Delegation, on July 3, 1925, regarding the International Aspect of the Negotiations.^ 1. SHOULD formal agreement concerning the question of territorial waters be subject to the condition that an eventual agreement does not enter into force until the adherence of other sprcified Powers has been secured ? If so, what countries shoidd be specified ?2. Should a similar condition be attached to a convention for fishery purposes ?3. Would Great Britain approach the specified countries to obtain their adherence in either or both cases ?4. Would Great Britain leave it to the Norwegian Government to decide whether there should be an understanding regarding fisheries during the time necessary for negotiations with other Powers ?5. Should such an understanding be confined to regulaturns; whereby Norway would permit British trawlers to fish up to the limits proposed under (2), and Great Britain would warn British fishermen not to enter these waters ?o&quot;Norsk Lovtidende &quot; of 1912, p. 590;, and which arose out of the Royal Decree mentioned in (2) above.   It runs as follows : &quot; Les Gouvernements de Norvege, de Danemark et de Suede :&quot; ayant, en vue de fixer des regies similaires de neutralite s&apos;accordant avec les dispositions conventionnelles signees a La Haye, entame des negociations qui out abouti a un accord sur tous les points de principe comme le prouvent les textes ci-joints des regies adoptees separement par les trois Gouvernements respectifs ;&quot; et appreciant a sa juste valeur l&apos;importance qu&apos;il y aurait a ce que 1&apos;accord si heureusement existant soit maintenu egalement a 1 avenir :&quot; sont convenus qu&apos;aucun des trois Gouvernements n&apos;apportera des change-ments aux regies approuvees par lui sans avoir prealablenient averti les deux autres assez tot pour permettre un eehange de vues dans la matiere.&quot; En foi de quoi les soussignes, dument autorises a c.t. effet par leurs Gouvernements, ont signe la presente declaration et y unt appose leurs cachets.&quot;Fait en trois exemplaires a Stockholm, le 21 decembre 1912.&quot;
Appendix II.Draft of a Communication prom the British Delegation to theNorwegian Delegation.WE have submitted to His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government the summary of conclusions adopted at the eighth meeting of the Anglo-Norwegian Conference, and we are authorised to inform you that His Britannic Majesty will be prepared to enter into conventions with His Majesty the King of Norway in accordance therewith.With reference to the questions addressed to us by the Norwegian delegation at our seventh meeting, we are authorised to state that, should agreement be reached on the points at issue between His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government and the Norwegian Government, His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared, jointly with the Norwegian Government, to communicate the conventions concluded between them to other Governments interested and to invite their accession thereto. His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government would, moreover, be prepared to agree to the inclusion in the conventions of provisions reserving complete liberty to both the Norwegian and the British Government to denounce the agreements and to resume their existing claims regarding territorial waters and rights of fishing, should the interested Powers refuse to recognise Norwegian territorial claims to the same extent as His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, or to accede to the proposed convention about fisheries.The terms set forth in the drafts herewith represent the utmost limit of the concessions which His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to make.His Majesty&apos;s Government trust that the Norwegian Government will give instructions to the captains of its fishery-protection cruisers to act in accordance with the proposed Fisheries Convention without waiting for its formal ratification. His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government will enjoin a corresponding line of conduct upon the masters of all British fishing vessels fishing in waters adjacent to the coasts of Norway.Before entering into formal agreements with Norway, it will be necessary for His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government to secure the concurrence in them of the Governments of the British Dominions and of India.
Ci n r,Appendix III.Dba.pt of a Convention between. Norway and . Great Britain regarding the Limits oe Norwegian Territorial Waters.Preamble.Article .1.Norway agrees that the seaward limit of waters which by international law are within the maritime jurisdiction of any country, hereafter referred to as territorial waters, is that defined in article 2 of the convention, and undertakes to apply and support the principle of that definition.Article 2.The limit of territorial waters is the envelope of all circles, 3 nautical miles in radius, whose centres are situated on the low-water mark ; the coast-line from the low-water mark of which this limit is measured is that of the mainland and of all islands ; the word &quot; island&quot; comprises all portions of territory capable of use and permanently above water in normal circumstances ; the limit of territorial waters in the case of bays, whose width at the entrance does not exceed 6 miles, is 3 miles to seaward of a straight line drawn across the entrance.Article 3.Subject to the provisions of articles 4 and 5, Great Britain recognises the jurisdic-tion of Norway over the following fjords and inlets : Varanger Fjord.-Sylte Fjord. Kongs Fjord. Tana Fjord. Lakse Fjord. Porsanger Fjord. Hjelmsoy-Mageroy.Arnoy Loppen. And Fjord. Rbsthavet. &quot;V est Fjord. Frohavet. Langesund Fjord. Oslo&apos;Fjord.Article 4.It is agreed that at the entrance to the following of the fjords and inlets mentioned in article 3, the seaward limit of the 3-mile belt of territorial waters is the line indicated hereunder in the case of each fjord and inlet, except at each end of the line where it approaches within 3 miles of the coast, and where, in consequence, the limits of territorial waters are determined by reference to the coast:  Varanger Fjord from Kibergnes to Grense Jakobselv. And Fjord from Maaneset to the northernmost point of Andoy. Vest Fjord from Skomvaer Light to Kalshoimen Light. Frohavet from Halten Light to Hosenoene Light.
Article 5.It is agreed that, with regard to the remaining fjords and inlets mentioned in article 3, the limit of territorial waters is 3 miles to seaward of the lines by which they are defined as hereunder : Sylte Fjord -from Storskjaer to Klubbespiret. Kongs Fjord from Vesterneset to Naalneset.Tana Fjord from Tanahorn to north-east point of Omgangs-Klubben. Lakse Fjord from Store Finnkjerka to east point of Svaerholt-Klubben. Porsanger Fjord from north point of Svaerholt-Klubben to Helnesodden. Hjelmsoy-Mageroy -from Sortvignaering to Gjaesvaernaering. Arnby-Loppen from Brynnilen to north point of Arnby. Pibsthavet from Elsneset to Rostby. Langesund Fjord from Straaholmen to Tvesten. Oslo Fjord from Faerder to Torbjbrnskjaer.Article 6.At any international conference in which Great Britain and Norway are parties, Great Britain and Norway agree to act together in upholding the principles and stipulations contained in this convention.Article 7.In the event of Norway failing to secure the exclusion of foreign fishing vessels from the fjords and inlets specified in article 3, Great Britain shall be at liberty to denounce the present convention, and her recognition of Norwegian jurisdiction over these fjords and inlets shall for all purposes be regarded as null and void. Norway shall in that event be at liberty to resume her claim to the more extended territorial waters claimed by her before the conclusion of the present agreement.
9 C  appendix IV.Heads of an Anglo-Norwegian Convention regarding Fisheries outside the Territorial Waters off the Coast of Norway North of Latitude G1c North.THE convention will follow the general lines of the Anglo-Danish Convention of 1901 regulating-fisheries-outside? territorial waters in the ocean surrounding Iceland and the Faroe Islands, subject to special provision being made for : (A.) The exclusive fishery limits to be granted to Norway, r,    (B.) The measures to be adopted for the protection of Norwegian fishery interests . vv   -       outside the agreed exclusive fishery limits.(A.) The exclusive fishery limits to be granted to Norway shall comprise : (i.) Such waters as shall by convention be recognised as Norwegian territorial&quot;waters.(ii.) Such other waters as are included in a revision of article 2 of the Anglo-Danish Convention of 1901 drafted to meet the circumstances of the present . ..&apos; .case :- Draft in Substitution for Article 2.&quot;The subjects of His Majesty the King of Norway shall enjoy the - :: -   - exclusive right of fishery within the distance of 3 miles from low-water mark along the whole extent of the coasts of Norway as well as of the &apos; dependent islets, rocks and banks, and within such waters as are specifically , acknowledged by His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government to be within the ^territorial limits of Norway.0 &quot;As regards bays, the distance of 3 miles shall be measured from a straight line drawn across the bay in the part nearest the entrance at the first point where the width does not exceed 10 miles. : f -&quot;&quot;The present article shall not prejudice the freedom of navigation or Ixiicnbrihg in territorial waters accorded to fishing boats provided they conform to Norwegian laws and regulations whilst within territorial waters.&quot;and in a similar revision of article 4 of the same convention drafted as follows : Draft in Substitution for Article 4.&quot; The geographical limits for the application of the present convention shall be fixed as follows :-&quot; On the south by a line along the parallel of 610 of north latitude from the coast of Norway to a point where that parallel meets the 2nd meridian of east longitude.&quot; On the west by a line drawn from the last-mentioned point along the 2nd meridian of east longitude to a point where that meridian meets the 65th parallel of north latitude, and thence to a point where the 16th meridian of east longitude meets the 72nd parallel of north latitude.&quot; On the north by a line drawn from the last-mentioned point along the 72nd parallel of north latitude to a point where that parallel intersects the meridian of 31D 50&apos; east longitude.&quot;On the east by a line drawn from the last-mentioned point along the meridian of 3t0 50&apos; east longitude until it intersects the limit of the territorial waters of Finland.&quot;
(B.) As regards the special measures to be adopted for the protection of Norwegian fishery interests outside the agreed exclusive fishery limits, the following articles shal be substituted for articles 15 and 19 of the Anglo-Danish Convention of 1901 : Draft in Substitution for Article 15.&quot; (a.) Subject to paragraph (b) and article *, boats arriving on the , fishing grounds shall not either place themselves or shoot their nets or other gear in such a way as to injure each other or to interfere with fishermen who have already commenced their operations.&quot; (b.) Fishermen operating in the vicinity of other fishermen shall conform to any local customs or arrangements which are observed in the vicinity, so long as such customs and arrangements are consistent with good seamanship in the circumstances.&quot; (c.) The Norwegian Government will keep His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government informed of any such customs and arrangements as are referred to in the preceding paragraph, and His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government &quot; - &apos; will communicate such information to the British fishermen concerned.&quot;Draft in Substitution for Article 19.- &quot; (a.) Trawl fishermen shall take all necessary steps in order to avoiddoing injury to the nets or gear of net or long-line fishermen. They shall not come within 1 mile of any vessel engaged in fishing of these kinds or lying to nets or long lines, and shall not enter within any area which has been notified in accordance with paragraph (c).&quot; (6.) Where damage is caused to nets or long lines, the responsibility shall be on the trawlers unless they can prove that they were under stress of compulsory circumstances or that they have complied with the terms of this article, and that the losses sustained did not result from their fault.&quot; (c.) The Norwegian Government shall from time to time notify to His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government the areas within which it is anticipated that concentrations of nets and lines will take place. Such notification shall reach His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in time to enable them to inform fishermen of the areas therein contained, and His Britannic Majestys Government will communicate the contents of each such notification to fishermen forthwith.&quot; (d.) For the purposes of paragraph (c) a concentration shall be deemed to be a large number of vessels fishing in close proximity to one another, and all employing the same method of net fishing or line fishing.&quot;All questions of substance and principle being covered by the above articles, it is proposed that the drafting of the remaining articles of the contemplated convention should be left to the technical experts of the two Governments concerned..* Whatever the eventual number is of the article drafted below in substitution. for article 19 of Anglo-Danish Convention of 1901.
