[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Governmerk.1 xCONFIDENTIALmSUTHAii    !! SODAF1DENTIAL L[Circulated to the Cabinet by direction of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.][F 2550/194/10]Note of a Conversation with former United States Minister at Peking.THE American Ambassador came to see me to-day accompanied by Mr. Schurman, the new American Ambassador to Berlin, who is on his way to take up his new post after four years&apos; residence in Peking as American Minister.Mr. Schurman is decidedly of opinion that there is no general anti-foreign feeling in China. He thinks that the attacks on foreigners are sporadic, and feels confident that the naval forces of all the Powers should be able to cope with them, but he takes a gloomy view of the future in so far as the Powers, however friendly their intentions may be, will be unable to find anybody in China who can deliver the goods. He is all in favour of a tariff conference, of which we ought to take full advantage with a view to satisfying Chinese aspirations for independence and full sovereignty, even if they should be technically beyond the limits of the conference, but he does not know with whom we should be able to negotiate. The military leaders will only attend such a conference in the hope of securing whatever financial benefit it may yield to themselves ; should the Powers be so ill-advised as to hand over any money to them, they will at once begin to quarrel as regards distribution. He thinks them purely parochial and selfish in their outlook. On the other hand, the enlightened civilians who may attend lack the force to give effect to any decisions that may be arrived at ; in fact, he considers the gravity of the situation lies in the total absence of any governing force in China.He is, however, in favour of our continuing to make efforts for the assembly of such a conference, and in the meantime he thinks that a very good impression may be created and a powerful weapon taken out of the hands of the agitators if reforms could be introduced in the municipal and judicial institutions of Shanghai.Mr. Schurman volunteered the statement that he knows for a fact that Karakhan disposes of large sums of money for the purpose of fostering agitation. His method of procedure is not to make propaganda of Bolshevik or Communistic views, which find no favour with the Chinaman at large, but in a persistent encouragement of Chinese aspirations for full sovereignty and self-determination.W. T.June 22, 1925.2945   [13269]
