 THIS DOCUMENT OF THE&apos; PROPERTY OF Hi:, BRITAHHIC MAJESTY1 o SOVERMENT 3 SECRET.C.P. 377. (25) C A B I U E T. Copy Mo. ^UMttMPLOYMEKT POLICY AM) TRADE REVIVAL. Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.1.     With reference to the Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade, CP. 26S (25), I desire to call the attention of the Cabinet to certain Items in his proposals which affect Agriculture.2.       I TJelcome the last paragraph on page 4 of his Memorandum which refers to the national value of expenditure on Agriculture which oan be shewn to make a definite contribution to employment and increased production.S.       I feel bound however to enter a caveat with regard to specific subsidies for special contracts.    Any such proposal would at once produce a demand from Agriculture which we should find it difficult to resist.    If we start on such a policy of subsidies there is no logical stopping place, and, so far as Agriculture is concerned, no general subsidy policy that I have yet seen has succeeded in ovorooming the fatal defect that it involves the payment of public money to men who will do no more with subsidies than they will do without them.   This defect does not exist in the case of a subsidy for a new crop like sugar beet where the payment of the subsidy is dependent on production, but in the case of normal agricultural products it is unavoidable.    Ho demand for subsidies will be made by the national Farmers&apos; Union unless they are granted to other industries.4.        If the Cabinet decide to adopt the proposal for a State assisted campaign to stimulate the purchase of British goods it will be essential that British agricultural produce should be included
In the scheme.   vie must at all costs avoid any repetition of the grant of  1,000,000 a year for the marketing of Dominion produce without any corresponding assistance to home producers.    I doubt whether any action by any Government has ever excited more keen resentment among our farmers than this,S.F.L.V/.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, 21st July, 1925.
