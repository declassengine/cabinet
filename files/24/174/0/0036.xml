CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,HIS DOCUMSKT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS ERITAE3TIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERIME?JT^)S S C RE T.CABINET.CP, 337 (25).WIDOWS1ORPHANS&apos;, AMD OLD AGE CONTRIBUTORYEBBSIOES BILL.SERVICE WIDOWS&apos;  PEASIOiiS.Report Toy the First Commissioner of Works.1,At their meeting on the 8th July, 192 5, (Cabinet 36(2 5)Conclusion 7)i the Cabinet had under consideration,  in connec-tion with the position of the Navy, Array and Air Force Widows under the Widows, Orphans and Old Age Contributory Pensions Bill, a suggestion that provision  should be made for the widows and children of sailors, soldiers and airmen whose death is attributable to naval, military or air service, on lines similar to that provided in the proposed amendment of the Bill in the case of widows and children of persons for whom provision is made by the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts. It.was recognised, however, that this proposal could not be adopted if it was found that  it involved heavy expenditure on Ministry of Pensions cases.      On tlie understanding that such heavy expenditure on Ministry of Pensions cases could not be incurred, the Cabinet agreed that I should confer with the Ministers concerned,  including the Minister of Pensions, and should give a decision.2. I have reviewed the whole question in consultationwith the Minister of Health, the Secretary of State for Air, the Minister of Pensions, representatives of the Treasury, the Admiralty and the War Office and the Government Actuary.
found difficult to impose and. impossible to maintain any distinction between the case of a Post War Service Widow where the husband&apos;;., death is attributable to service and the case of a Great War Widow.      The grant to widows of sailors,  soldiers and airmen whose death is attributable to post v/ar service,  of the full Bill pension in addition to  the Service pension or the grant to such widows of the same bene fife which, under the Bill, it is proposed to give in Workmen&apos;s Compensation act civilian cases, would give rise to a most insistent demand for similar treatment, in/ministry of Pensions cases where the men are now drawing disability oension but are in insurable employment and must pay full contributions,      No logical  -distinction can be drawn between the last mentioned eases and cases cf Great. War Widows and I am satisfied that the grant of Bill pensions to future Service Widows in cases where death is attributable to service would in all  probability have to be extended, to all Great War oases.      As the Cabinet are aware,  the cost of such a concession is estimated by the Government Actuary at  4,000,000 Pe r an num.4. I have sympathetically examined other proposals&apos; designedto meet the wishes of the Service Departments, such for example as the proposal  that the widows in question should be given pensions in the manner and on the sliding scale indicated in paragraph 4 of   CP. 328 (25)    or the proposal that the widows should be given a Bill pension of less than 10/- a week say 2/6 or 5/- a week.      I can find, however,  no solution of the problem on these lines which  does not involve either differentiation between future Service Widows and V/ar Widows,  or a very substantial increase in the financial liabilities under the Bill - - -
5.       ,,hile no doubt Clause 24 ox the Bill as drafted willhe subjected to criticism, I consider that - the dangers fromthe financial point of view of any substantial departure from its -provisions outweigh any advantages, political orotherwise, which might result from it.; . odification.Broadly speaking the Clause as it stands can be defended by reference to the great benefits conferred by tho Bill onmen of the lighting Services, their widows and dependentsas a whole: ,undoubtedly the benefits in the early yearsgreatly exceed the value of any contributions which the men will be called upon to pay.   Moreover it can be pointed out that service Pensions for widows where death is attributable to service are on a substantially more generous scale than either the   ervice Pensions payable to a widow whose husband dies a natural death or a pension under the Bill0In all the circumstances of the case I have arrivedat the following conclusion of which I invite the Cabinetto take note:-That the wishes of the Service Departments respecting Service widows Pensions cannot be met without involving heavy expenditure on Linistry of Pensions cases and that, accordingly no modification should be made In the provisions of Clause 24 of the Widows, Orphans and Old ,.ge Contributory Pensions Bill,,( Signed)    PEEL.Office of works, 10th July,1925.
