(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAffiTIO MAJESTY&apos;S QQVERKM3HT) SECRET. ^  ,CP, Sib. 392(25). CABIN E T.IMPQRTATIOff QFni LIVE CATTLE PROM THE J^IWIOJS., Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisherleju1*        I desire to bring to the Immediate notice of mycolleagues the following paragraph which appears in the Report onMeat of the Imperial Economic Committee, which has within the past few days been presented to the Prime Ministert-n57.   In the United Kingdom there is undoubtedly a desire on the part of the consumer for fresh killed meat in preference to all other descriptions of meat. The obvious method of meeting this demand is through an extension of feeding operations by the farmers of the United Kingdom.   This implies increased breeding, or the increased importation of store animals, or both,   fa have net received any evidence on this subject on the side of British producers and we are, of course, aware that the matter has, in recent years, been the subject of considerable controversy in the United Kingdom.    We feel however, that apart from the restrictions imposed to prevent the introduction of disease it is undesirable from tho point of view of the interests of the United Kingdom consumer and of the producer in the Overseas parts of the empire to place restrictions on the entrance of store cattle and we further feel that it is especially undesirable to differentiate in restrictive legislation between one Dominion and another as at present.   Se therefore reoommend that the existing legislation in reference to the importation of live cattle into the United Kingdom be reconsidered.&quot;2.        The present position with regard to the importation of Cattle from the Dominions is as follows*3.        As regards Ireland, there is no prohibition on the importation into Great Britain of any class of cattle.4.        As regards Canada, pedigree stock may be imported under the Importation of Pedigree Animals Act, 1925; store cattle may be imported under the Importation of Animals Act, 1922, and fat stock may be landed for immediate slaughter in the landing place * The remaining category of cattle, vis. non-pedigree breeding1.
cattle could be imported if the Minister of Agriculture, wade ft general Order under Section 2 of tho Importation of Animals Aot, 1988, specifying tho conditions under which suoh importation night bo permitted.   For reasons whioh 1 give later, a general Order under thia section has never been made.5,       As regards the other Dominicna, only two classes of stock ean be sent here, vis. fat stock for slaughter at the port of landing and pedigree stock under the Importation of Pedigree Animals Act, 1925*6t       To meet the views of the Committee, therefot*a, an Aot of Parliament would be necessary permitting1 %hs Importation of ail classes of live cattle from all Dominions subject only to restrictions Imposed to prevent the introduction of disease.   Such action would be strenuously opposed by the vast majority of British agriculturists *7.       It is true that the Imperial Seonomio Committee is only an advisory body and that we are not bound by its recommendations, but the    mere publication of this paragraph woultf*be unfortunate for two reasons, vis.(1) it would lead to a renewed and immediate demand from Canada that a general Order under Section 2 of the Aot of 1922 permitting the importation of non-pedigree breeding cattle should be made by me, (11) it would cause bitter resentmentamongst English agriculturists who have repeatedly expressed their dissatisfaction because we are giving  1,000,000 a year to encourage the marketing of Dominion produce in competition with their own, and who are
very suspicious of the Imperial Sconomic Committee, which contains no representative of home producers.3.        The renewed demand from Canada for an Order under Section 2 of the Act of 1922 would immediately raise once again the old controversy with regard to Canadian cattle which, with the passing of the Importation of Pedigree Animals Act, 1925, British agriculturists regarded as closed. It will be remembered that in fulfilment of a pledge made to the Canadian representatives by Sir Arthur Griffith Boscawen in 1922, Sir Robert Sanders, who succeeded him as Minister of Agriculture, drafted an Order under Section 2 which he intended to lay on the tables of both Houses of Parliament in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The draft Order was, however, unanimously condemned by the parties interested and it was impossible to proceed with it.    Finally, at the suggestion - of the British Government, and with the concurrence of the Canadian Government the question was postponed until the meeting of the Imperial Sconomic Conference in the autumn of 1923.   At that Conference Sir Robert Sanders explained the difficulties of the situation and stated quite definitely that the British Government would not feel justified in doing more than under-taking to introduce legislation to deal with pedigree stock only.9. As a result the Conference came to the followingdecision:-That steps should be taken to promote inter-Imperial trade in pedigree stock throughout the Empire as a whole on reciprocal terms, subject always to satisfactory precautions being taken against disease .(Report of Proceedings of Imperial Economic Conference, Cmd. 2009, 1924, page 537).This decision was implemented by the Importation ofPedigree Animals Act, of 1925.
10.    British agriculturists, therefore, regard the Question as settled,    The Free Importation of Canadian Cattle Society, however, and the Canadian interests will certainly not fail to renew the agitation when the Renort of the Imperial Ecoromic Committee is published unless we announce at the same time that we cannot accept the recommendation.    If the agitation were renewed It would create an embarrassing situation between the Home and Canadian Governments.11.       It would moreover greatly Increase our exist lag difficulties with our own farmers.    As my colleagues are aware, several of our measures this year have caused great dissatisfaction amongst our agriculturists.    But none of these measures has created such bitterness as our proposal to grant  1,000,000 a year to assist the marketing of Dominion produce In competition with their own.   I have assured them repeatedly that their fears are groundless and that the Imperial Economic Committee had constantly in mind the interests of the home producer.    The Committee themselves profess to have had rwgari to this principle. 12.       It is incomprehensible, therefore, that they should, make a recommendation which they admit has in recent years been the subject of considerable controversy in the United Kingdom without,  as they specifically state, receiving a word of evidence on the subject on the side of British producers.13. I have, with the concurrence of the Presidentof the Board of Trade, endeavoured to secure the consent pf the members of the Committee to the deletion of the paragraph in question from their report with a view to reconsideration at a subsequent meeting of the Committee, at which the views of the home agriculturists should be heard.   They are, however, unable to assent to such a
course.     Publication of the recommendation Is consequently inevitable.14. I suggest therefore.    that when the Report is submitted to the PrimeMinisters of the   Dominions it should be aooompanied by a letter from the Prime Minister stating definitely that for the reasons given at the Imperial Economic Conference of 1923 the Home Government is not prepared to accept this recommendation of the Imperial E&amp;onomio Committeej2.    that the letter should be published simultaneously with the Meat Report, the publication of which has been deferred pending a Cabinet decision on this question.15. Such action will not retrieve the situation, butit will do much to mitigate the difficulties arising out of this unfortunate recommendation.E.P.L.W.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, 6th August 1925.
