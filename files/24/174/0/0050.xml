Copy Wo-u.........\&apos;f)Q..P. 351(25) CABINET,Development of the Beet Sugar foduAtry. note by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.With reference to CP. 225(25) I should like to bring to the notioe of my colleagues the following further letter I have received from Lord Weir on the subjoot.E*FeL.WeMinistry of Agriculture and Fisheries, 15th July, 1925.HOLM FOUNDRY, Cathcart, Glasgow.12th July, 1925.My dear Mr. Wood,With further reference to our recent talk on accelerating the Sugar Beet development, I trust that this question is receiving full consideration.     To enable us to handle six new factories for 1926, we would require to start in the next six weeks;   in fact, if a decision Is delayed until after you go away on holiday In August, then the effectiveness of the scheme for giving employment this winter would be Impaired,      I have j\ist visited the Sugar Machinery Works In Glasgow, and they have practically finished all the plant for our new factories,  and are paying off men every week.     Since 1 saw you my people have made a special investigation into two of our proposed new sites, and in both oases we can rely on getting a full crop for the first year - a matter of special importance.I have been thinking over our last conversation, and have to confirm to you that if you consider the first scheme rather too socialistic (the scheme under which we run
the factories on behalf of the Government   for a fee and percentage of profit), then I would like the Treasury to suggest alternative terms to whioh they could agree, under which the factories would not become the property of the Government.     For example, on what terms would they be prepared to lend the whole of the money?   vs on our part putting in&apos;the whole of our experience and organising ability, and repaying the loan under terms milch would provide that repayment took precedence over the   payment of a minimum dividend.     As an alternative, what is the maximum percentage of the total oapltal which they would be prepared to loan, and on what terms?I am very anxious, if possible, to have.this matter completely settled up before the holiday season.With kind regards,Yours sincerely,1BIR.Rt. Hon. Edward F.L. Wood, M.P.,Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, Whitehall Place, London, S.W.I.
