OCJTOHSK 1919.Memo by Ilr, G.N5 Bar re suThe Cabinet decided on the 7th instant,, to defer considero-tion of instructions to tho Britikh delegations on t fro &quot;&quot;quest ions to be discussed at Washington until Sir Robert Home could be pre-sent.     Hy views have already boon gitfon iri paper G/V/990, dated 15th August.     I have nothing.bo alter, and I may say that I submit-ted them to Sir David. Shackle ton, who agreed with me.     I doom it unnecessary to -ait longer on the cf f-chance of discussion with his chief.Elffht^honrs.   I believe that the Organising Committoo Draft Bill is&quot;&quot;beTter&quot;&quot;Than the one drafted for the Eouao of Commons because it is more definite.   It defines the statutory day even in the esoen-ted occupations, end&quot;it limits overtime.   1 think both of these things are necessary j or otherwise we may got; a convention agreed to at Washington, which will merely have the effect of expressing a basic principle, leaving loop holes for working unlimited overtime.O33 &quot;mioniployment tho -Committeehas, I thick wise&quot;?;:;, refrained Ifrom putting forward any far-reaching proposals bucau.se of the absence lof information; but they have proposed fmw-hor enquiry and meantime, fthe letting out of public work in such a way ay to even out the Ilemand for labour.In regard ,to the ejiploymeiit;.pf chi 1 firon the proposals do not go in any important rospe&quot;oT&quot;VoybnT*ear&quot; iourlesn and fifteen age limits and therefore, thoir adoption would place us relatively in a better position&apos;than at present0 * &apos;Tho same applies in regard to vmmpn^s^e^J^J^shtp    Our laws re better than any so far as I can gainer, &quot;and&quot; any lining dons at ashington will be mainly in the direct -.cn of bringing other countries p to our standard8   But in connection with this, India has to bo pocially considered,,In regard to msjernity, I have beon surprised to find&apos; that ;hor countries are&quot;at least abreast of us0   The Organising Committee * foposes prohibition of employment for a period of at least four )el:s after ohildbirth and adequate maternity benefit during absence * :om work before as well as after childbirth&quot;, the period being six )eks in all,lit is a matter of opinion if this goes beyond our present pro-sion; but in any case, it would be a good thing if such provision ould be regularised and standardised,,I endorse generally the Organising Committee1 s proposals.,   I [der stand tho Home Office agrees.. &apos;(Initialled) G,N0B.,Whitehall Gardens S0\/.lOctober 1919,
