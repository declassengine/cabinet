This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. / 4 9 3 SECRET. 1 war CABINET.MILITARY POLICY IN ASIA MINOR.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR, &apos; I circulate a memorandum which has been prepared by the General Staff.9th October, 1919. WINSTON S. CHURCHILL. &quot;1. The General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Constantinople, has reported that the Turkish Nationalist Movement is spreading towards the West, and that there is a constantly increasing risk of a collision between the Nationalist forces and the British detachments guarding the Anatolian Railway.He asks for instructions as to the attitude he is to adopt, and the amount of military support he is to give to the Civil Administration in opposing the Nationalists.2. The Nationalist Movement, which is controlled chiefly by Mustapha Kemal, may be fairly described as a patriotic organization, the main object of which is to oppose the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire. It is not directed against the Sultan, but it is opposed to the present Turkish Government wdiich, it claims, does not represent the people. It is not directly hostile to the British, its real purpose being to prevent the partition of Turkish territory amongst the Greeks, Italians and Armenians.3. The movement grows daily in strength, and if we show ourselves as definitely opposed to the ends it has in view, we must be prepared for the following conse-quences: (a.) A spread of Pan-Islamic feeling allied, perhaps, to Bolshevism, to Trans-Caspia,Persia Afghanistan and India. (b.) Fresh disturbances in Egypt in sympathy with the Nationalists, (c.) Increased unrest amongst the Arabs, (of.) A greater likelihood of a massacre of the Armenians.4. The preceding paragraphs deal briefly with the political aspect and indicate the need for a revision of our present attitude as regards Turkish interests. A modification of our policy, however, requires time to take shape and effect.Meanwhile, an immediate decision is needed regarding the military measures to be taken, and this decision is momentous as it must necessarily be the prelude to our future policy in Asia Minor.If we reinforce our troops on the Anatolian Railway, we must be prepared to find ourselves committed to operations on an indefinite scale against the Turkish Nationalists. Though not an inevitable consequence, this is a probable one, and, should it occur, we shall be fighting for the benefit of the Greeks and Italians and against our own best interests.If we withdraw our detachments, it saves us from becoming definitely embroiled with the Nationalists, it prevents us becoming committed to operations of an extended nature the troops for which will not easily be found and finally, it does not pledge us in advance to, any particular policy.It has hitherto been our object to avoid military operations in Asia Minor, and it seems particularly undesirable that we should become involved in such, solely for the benefit of alien and predatory races.. The objections urged by the High Commissioner against withdrawal are that it might entail the loss of the railway and consequent shortage of food in Constantinople, secondly that it means loss of prestige.As regards the railway, it should be sufficient for the British detachments to be replaced by troops of the Turkish Constitutional Forces, of which there must be enough available for the immediate needs of the situation.01525207
As regards possible loss of prestige, it is for consideration whether our prestige will not suffer still more if we withdraw later when the danger is more menacing than it is now, and such a withdrawal will be the only course then open to us unless we are prepared to send several divisions to Asia Minor.5. Finally it can not be too strongly urged that our present and future military commitments throughout the Middle East are inseparably bound up with the question of our relations with Turkey. It is not yet too late to reassure her, and there is not wanting evidence to show that she is prepared to accept our help and guidance The possibility of reducing our garrisons in Egypt, Palestine and Mesopotamia turns directly on this question, Which is, therefore, a matter of anxious concern to the General Staff. At present we are fast antagonizing the patriotic elements in Turkey, and it is no exaggeration to say that our attitude is costing unnecessary millions to the British taxpayer, besides sowing the seeds of unlimited financial liabilities for the future.
