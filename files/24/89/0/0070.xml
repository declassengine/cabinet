44 IAsim OF SURPLUS WARSHIPS TO FCK^IGN GOVITOENTS.Various Foreign Governments either have made definite Implications to purchase surplus British War Vessels or are known to be considering the question of making such applications.   A list of such ases is appended.   Further, some &quot;of the building firms who have had fossels stopped that were nearing completion have suggested that they hould be allowed to finish these for sale to Foreign Governments, hus diminishing their own labour difficulties and avoiding financial oss to tho country.2o-   The Admiralty have had under their consideration the policy lo be adopted in regard to such applications.3.-   In the opinion of the Admiralty, the question of selling (abmarines stands by itself, owing to the fact that Great Britain s declared herself strongly in favour of the abolition of submarine rfare.   It is considered that it would be inconsistent with this attitude to assist other countries to develop submarine forces by filing submarines to them,4.-   The selling of surplus surface ships of fighting value, bjject to the concurrence of the Foreign Office^ and to general msiderations of Naval Policy, is not open to the same objection, le immediate advantage of getting rid of as many of our surplus war issels as possible quickly and on the best terms obtainable Is ivious.   There is every probability that if we do not supply these dps. successful application will be made elsewhere and the interests I British Trade will suffer thereby.I 5e-    It is not considered that the general pronouncement in the venant of the League of Nations in favour of an all-round reduction national armaments should be rega-rded as preventing us from selling Jese surplus ships.   The Covenant fully recognises the fast that those all Powers which do not manufacture their own armaments must be able meet their requirements by purchase.   In any event, applications om Powers (such as Greece and Chili) whose ships building in British rds at the commencement of the war were ta-ken over by the Admiralty, ould receive special consideration: otherwise, we cannot hope that reign Government orders will be placed with British Firms in the Iture.HI 6.-    The Admiralty view, therefore, is that applications for the rchase of surplus surface ships of fighting value should be Svoura,bIy considered, particularly in the special cases abovo jerred to. but that applications for the sale of submarines should be fused, ana they desire the sanction of the War Cabinet to the joption of this policy,-   (Initialled)  W. H. L,4.10.19.fijffiu-  This is, of course, intended to cover compliance with any obligations assumed by this country under the new Arms Traffic Convention^ but it is much to be hoped that this Convention will not be so framed as to divert Foreign orders for warships to Germany.
