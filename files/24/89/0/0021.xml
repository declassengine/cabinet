Malleson telegraphs 20th September :--1. &quot; According to latest telegrams from Askabad frontier there has been further fighting near Keliata. Result not stated, but large numbers of Bolshevik wounded have arrived Askabad.&quot;2. &quot; Bokhara. According to my most recent reports, Amir of Bokhara during last six months has raised and armed (? 8,000) additional men. I am afraid, however, that quality of these troops is not very high.&quot;3. Kerki agent reports that three Afghan emissaries with papers signed by Afghan Mullah and Turkish Ulemas urging Jehad visited Khiva recently. Agent states that Khiva received these overtures coldly, and emissaries have now proceeded by Tashkend. Bokhara is urging Khiva to arm as many men as possible to guard frontiers against agitators and Bolshevik designs.
