I should be very grateful to my 7JbS colleagues if they could find it possible to read it.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.War Office,22nd September, 1919.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.1. The military situation, taking all the anti-Bolshevik fronts as a whole, was never more hopeful or more critical than at the present time. When this question was last considered by the Conference a definite promise of support within certain limits was made to Admiral Koltchak by the five Great Powers. Since then Admiral Koltchak has retreated six or seven hundred miles and has suffered very heavy and repeated losses of all kinds. This retreat and its losses have affected not only the. morale of his army but the stability of his Government. But the Government has hitherto stood and the army has maintained its organization and an unbroken front. The territory given up, though valuable, is small as compared with the vastness of Siberia. Admiral Koltchak&apos;s army resumed the offensive at the end of August, and a battle, which will probably be decisive upon the fortunes of the Siberian Government and army, has been in progress for the last fortnight. The issua of this battle is not yet clear. It is still going on. Each day, however, has turned, more in favour of Admiral Koltchak. General Knox&apos;s latest report, received yesterday and dated the 11th, states that the situation is &quot; improving daily.&quot; Having regard to the large numerical superiority of Admiral Koltchak&apos;s troops over the Bolsheviks, a complete victory on this front is possible, and such a victory might well be followed by a very great advance. It would be folly to take any decision now the effect of which would prejudice the issue of this battle.   At the very least we should wait to see what happens.2. The southern army of Admiral Koltchak, on what may be called the Turkestan front, appears to have sustained a heavy, if not a complete, defeat. But this theatre is separated by nearly 300 miles from the Siberian battle front. The opening of the road to Turkestan is serious for the British on account of the disadvantages they will suffer from a state of widespread anarchy throughout all the great and inaccessible regions . leading up to the Indian frontier. But what happens here will not affect the immediate general issue now hanging in the balance between Bolshevik and anti-Bolshevik forces.3. On General Denikins front the advances made have been enormous, and the defeats sustained by the Bolsheviks have far exceeded those sustained by Admiral Koltchak. General Denikins position is now one of great strength. He has under the control of his troops regions which cannot contain less than thirty millions of European Russians, and which include the third, fourth and fifth great cities of Russia. These regions are readily accessible to British and French trade, which is the main need of the population at the present time. They possess a network of railways, which are in comparatively good working order if rolling stock could be obtained. The inhabitants have been thoroughly sickened of Bolshevism,. having either tried it of their own free will or experienced its oppression. There is no doubt whatever that the will of these 30,000,000 people, if it could be expressed by plebiscite, would be over-overwhelmingly against being handed back again to the Bolshevik Government of Lenin and Trotsky. Moreover, General Denikin disposes of an army which, although raised very largely on a voluntary basis, is rapidly growing and at the present time certainly amounts to over 300,000 fighting men. Included in this army are many units of (p superior fighting quality possessing great mobility and manoeuvring power and handled according to a concerted scheme by some of the best Russian Generals. So long as this army is not out oif from supplies of shells and munitions it will be a powerful factor. The severe defeat of the Bolsheviks at Tsaritsin within the last week, which was achieved without diverting troops from other parts of the immense front, is a sign of(B19/422)  70  9/19  H4S  7fi05wo
its intrinsic power and efficiency. The operations of the cavalry General Mamontov, 100 miles behind the Bolshevik front, where he finds everywhere friendly populations, and where he is ripping up the communications on which the Bolshevik front depends, may well be productive of further considerable events. Another sign of the military strength of Denikins army is found in the unmistakable defeat of the very serious Bolshevik effort launched last month to isolate and recover Kharkov and recapture the Donetz coal basin. This well-directed thrust was made and repulsed at the same time as extraordinarily rapid advances and expansions were being carried out to the westward in the Ukiaine.4. If General Denikin were to be deserted by the Allies who have hitherto supported him it does not by any means follow that he would be destroyed. He might be destroyed, in which case the victory of Lenin and Trotsky over the whole of Russia would be complete. But he might also win, in which case he would win independently of the Allies, in spite of being deserted at the most critical moment, and not, as at present, as their grateful friend. To desert him now, or to take steps in other theatres which make his overthrow possible, is to make certain that whatever else may be the outcome, we have a hostile Russia to face. It is urged most strongly, therefore, that our policy should continue to be to keep in friendly toudfl with Denikin, to complete the despatch of the munitions, to help him in his &apos; difficulties with other anti-Bolshevik forces, to guide him as far as possible with political counsel, and to prevent him from falling into the hands of the reactionaries. Above all, it seems most important to develop trade and credit in the great regions which have been liberated, in&apos; order that the people there may contrast their conditions with the miseries prevailing in Bolshevik Russia. It is to be observed that General Denikin has never asked for men. One British lieutenant, in the last nine months has been slightly wounded in a tank. That is the sole British casualty of which we have information. No further large expenditure of money (other than the questionable value of surplus munitions), no assistance of troops, except a very limited establishment of technical personnel, are needed. Countenance, counsel, commerce these are the means which are alone demanded. The moment has, in fact, been reached when in this great theatre the rewards of past policy are for the first time coming into view, and when as the result of our action it is open to us (a) to exert influence towards a non-reactionary result, (b) to have a large part of Russia and of the Russian population thoroughly friendly to us, and (c) to have a most profitable future &quot;for British trade. All these may be gained, and gained with practically no further expense or exertion. It may all, however, be thrown away by decisions which might he taken at the present time.5. On his western flank, General Denikin is in contact with the rather feeble Ukrainian forces under Petlura. The question at issue between Denikin and Petlura is that of a united Russia versus an independent Ukraine. The Roumanians, who feel that they can only take Bessarabia from a weak and defeated Russia, will naturally support Petlura. The duty of the Allies should be to try to reconcile the two conflicting points of view. Why should this be thought impossible ? The conception of a Russia consisting of a number of auto-nomous States, grouped together on a federal basis into a Russian union, is one within which all legitimate aspiratious may be comprised. Such a Russian empire would be less of a menace to the future peace of the world that the vast centralized empire of Czarism. And this is the moment when the critical situation of all the Russian parties and forces should make it possible, by a wise exercise of Allied policy, to give such a turn to events. A policy of the partition or dismemberment of Russia, although it might be for the moment successful, cannot have permanent results and could only open up an indefinite succession of wars, out of which in the end, under Bolshevik or reactionary standards, a united militarist Russia would arise. Every effort should therefore be made to guide affairs into the channel which leads into a federalized Russia, without prejudice either to local autonomy or the principle of general unity.6. The downfall of Bela Kun amid universal execration, and the ease with which that downfall was accomplished, has been a most heavy blow at the prestige of the Bolshevik system of world-wide revolution. Its influence upon the general situation ought not to be under-rated.7. Coming further north, on the left of the Ukrainian forces of Petlura, is the Polish battle front. This has also continuously advanced in the last four or five months, involving the Bolsheviks in continual defeats at the hands of the Polish army and in heavy expenditure in men and munitions.   The Polish front now stands in most places,
on Russian soil.   The Poles are now inclined to suggest one of two &apos; courses to the Allies    ,\[a.) That the Allies should finance a Polish army of 500,000 men which should [i        advance into the heart of Russia and capture Moscow, or (Ik) That the Poles should make a peace with the Bolsheviks,Either of these courses at the present moment would be injurious. The advance of the hereditary enemy of Russia to Moscow would rouse whatever sense of nationalism is latent in those parts of Russia under the Bolshevik international regime. Moreover, the project is not one for which any of the Allied Powers would be justified by their own public opinion in furnishing funds. On the other hand, if the Poles make a separate and precipitate peace with the Bolsheviks, the Bolshevik army opposite the Polish front, which is the third strongest Bolshevik army now in the field, could swiftly be transferred to the attack of Denikin; and this might&apos; fundamentally jeopardise his continued existence. For us to encourage the Poles to make such a precipitate and isolated peace at this juncture, when everything is so critical, would utterly stultify (a.) The general policy of the Allies in promising support to Admiral Koltchak, and,(/;.) The special policy of Great Britain in sending great consignments of munitions to Denikin.8. We should be undoing with our left hand what we had done with our right, and by pursuing opposite and contradictory policies on different sectors of the common front, we should have done nothing more than prolong useless bloodshed and prevent the establishment of any form of settled authority. It seems therefore clear that our policy at the present moment should be ,tq persuade the Poles to carry on for. a few months as they are doing, fighting and defeating the Bolsheviks on their borders where and.when they can, without preparing either for a decisive advance into the heart of Russia or for a separate peace.9. In regard to the Baltic States, the policy here is similar to that which suggests itself in regard to Poland, i.e., the taking of no violent action for which the Allies would have to make great sacrifices or become directly responsible, but on the other hand the fostering of the material and moral strength of such anti-Bolshevik forces as exist, and the co-ordination of their action so far as possible in order to prevent an untimely and inopportune collapse on this sector of the front The affairs of this region are complicated even beyond those of any other part of the tangle. And here the Germans present themselves as a novel and formidable factor. Britain and France have both given a certain amount of aid in munitions to the Esthonians, Latvians and Lithuanians, and also to the National Russian forces under the general direction of General Yudenitch, but we have sedulously refused to make ourselves responsible in any way for the succ ss or failure of the operations in this theatre. The Germans have also come forward with important help to the National Russian forces, forming units out of the Russian prisoners in Germany and equipping and organizing them much better than those units supported by Britain and France. The Germans show them-selves disposed to offer the Russians substantial and decisive aid in the capture of Pefrograd, well knowing that in this event they will have rendered a service to Russia which will never be forgotten and which will pave the way to that very Russp-German alliance which, whether on a Bolshevik or anti-Bolshevik basis, constitutes the greatest danger that threatens us in the future. On the other hand, if we ourselves do virtually nothing to help the Russians in this theatre-(1.) Have we the right to cut them off from, the only other form of aid that is available, and(2.) Have we the power? &apos; .10. In this connection it is worth while to remember that General Gough was instructed by the Supreme Council to deliver an ultimatum to General von der Goltz to quit the scene; but General von der Goltz remains, and it is General Gough who has returned home. Further, the German commanders and troops in this region are only semi-controlled from Berlin and may well at any moment or on any specific occasion declare themselves beyond control. So also the Berlin Government, on whom alone we can put pressure, will no doubt confront us with the answer that it has not the power to secure obedience to its orders ; and in addition, both the Germans in the Baltic and the Germans at Berlin may confront us with indefinite delays. Locally, we have no means of action  no troops and no means of putting pressure. All we can do is to threaten to cut off our exiguous support of the North-We&apos;st Russians, and that will immediately precipitate the(7505)
4tmovement of the local Russians towards the Germans who offer their help. In fact, to disinterest ourselves in this theatre at the present time is to throw the Russians into the German arms, and offer to the Germans a means of rendering a signal service to all anti-Bolshevik Russia. What else can these National Russians do if we will not help them, and if the Germans remain on the spot? Therefore it is suggested that the Germans, and German influence generally in this region, in so far as it cannot be eliminated, must be controlled and made to serve a useful purpose. A&apos; mere policy of ultimatums, unaccompanied by effective measures to enforce compliance with our demands, such as we have followed up to the present, is futile. The simple expulsion of the Germans without making any effort to fill the void will only cut off from the struggling National Russians their last hope. It is possible, however, that means might be found not only to make the Germans withdraw their main strength from these regions, but at the same time to preserve those units formed by the Germans which can be made use of against the Bolsheviks. For this purpose an international commission should be formed consisting of representatives of France, Britain and the United States, of the National Russians and of the three small Baltic States affected. The Germans should be invited to send a member. This commission should sit at some Baltic port.   The duties of the commission should be (a.) To superintend and carry out the withdrawal of the German military forces from the regions in question ; (6.) To take the necessary measures for maintaining the peace and order of these regions and for securing the well-being of the three small States ; and (c ) To maintain the existing anti-Bolshevik front as strongly as possible so as toprevent the spread of anarchy and disorder westward.11, The National Russians have a right to demand that this aspect should not be overlooked. Similarly, - the Germans have a real interest in preventing anarchy spreading right up to their frontier. Therefore, instead of handling the matter with the Germans in a rough and violent way coupled with threats of invasion and blockade, neither of which would probably be adopted in the long run, or of stopping&apos; the repatriation of prisoners of war at a cost to Britain of 90,000Z. a1 day, we should take the Germans into counsel in regard to these regions, the peace and order of which are undeniably of legitimate importance to them. Thus the best possible arrangements could be made and all available pressure could be applied to the Germans, but appliod in a way most likely to secure their compliance. There is no doubt that they would be very anxious to rehabilitate themselves to some extent, and if they comported themselves properly, in this local commission of the League of Nations, they would be paving the way to their ultimate admission to the general body of the League at a later date. This would give the Allied Powers much the best chance of getting control of the situation and of avoiding the alternative dangers of Bolshevik anarchy or German predominance in those regions. To order them out and yet make no effective provision to fill&apos; their place, to use violent threats to expel them, which they will resist as far as they can and as long as they possibly can, would be a thoroughly bad way of handling a situation already extremely difficult. All the questions, moreover, in this area are so complex that they must be studied and dealt with on the spot by plenipotentiaries who have a considerable measure of discretionary power. It is to be hoped that this suggestion will not be lightly brushed aside in favour of less patient solutions,12. The worst thing of all that we could do would be to incite the Poles to make peace with the Bolsheviks in order to throw their weight into a war with the Germans. Such a step would cast these regions into complete anarchy and would help no one but the Bolsheviks. The National Russians may be thrown into the arms of the Germans and may make common cause with them. The Latvians and the Lithuanians are very much afraid of Poland, and it is difficult to say in advance what their actions would be.&apos; Meanwhile the Allies have no ,troops to send. The lamentable consequences that have &apos; followed from letting the Greeks loose in the Smyrna province should surely make us pause before setting the Poles (of all people) on to this equally disturbed area.13. Generally speaking, it may be said that there are two Russias and two Germariies, a Bolshevik and an anti-Bolshevik Russia, and a pro-Bolshevik and an anti-Bolshevik Germany. Both Germanies look to Russia as their only means of regaining world power. Each keeps up its own relations with its counterpart in Russia. Either by the pro-Bolshevik or anti-Bolshevik road Germany is determined to get hold of Russia. At present profound doubt exists as to which will be the best hand for Germany to hold out, and which will.be the best hand for them to clasp in Russia. Up to the present moment only Bolshevik Russia is ready to deal with either section in Germany.
But the moment the Allies definitely take steps which are fundamentally injurious to -anti-Bolshevik Russia, and make it clear that they do not care whether it is crushed or not, both the Russian hands will be stretched out alternatively for Germany to clasp, and either in one way or another these two mighty branches of the human race will come together in effective action.14. It is this prospect which should inspire us with a lively sense of fear, because the union of Germany and Russia, and the probable accession of Japan to this new triplice, will confront Britain, France and the United States with perils as great as those from which they have emerged, and will confront the world after a lapse of a few years with an antagonism of hostile forces as dangerously balanced as were those which preceded the outbreak of the Great War.   It is therefore urged Firstly, that we should continue by all means in our power, within the limits above described, to support the anti-Bolshevik Russians and keep a firm hold of them,Secondly, that we should do nothing (except what cannot be avoided, i.e., evacua-tion of North Russia) to weaken any part of the anti-Bolshevik front at this critical time.Thirdly, that we should endeavour to make whatever use is possible of any anti-Bolshevik German or Russo-German forces which could be effectively controlled by an international commission sitting in the Baltic States, which commission should include a German representative.Fourthly, that whatever pressure we can apply to drive the Germans out of the Baltic provinces should be applied through this commission, not only by threats, but by persuasion, consultation and a study of the situation on the spot, and thus obtain an orderly and stable region between Germany and Russia in which the legitimate interests of Germany will not be ignored, but in which her influence cannot be predominant.Lastly, it is urged that at the end of the year the entire Russian situation shall he reviewed, not only in its military, but in its political and economic aspects, by a farther Inter-Allied Conference in Paris. It may then be found possible, if the Bolsheviks continue to weaken, to take up again some general work of pacification on lines which will secure to each great , part of Russia the kind of government the mass of the people want, and to adjust their various aspirations within the limits of a wide federal system.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.Uth September, 1919.
