These con-siderations fall into two main groups, according as they concern the position and attitude of organised labour or of the Government respectively. First as regards organised labour, the distinguishing feature of the present Strike is its dimensions, which are so great as to compel a re-orientation of policy on the part of those directing it.   Usually(01895) 255  10/19 H 4 S 2 QPart I. National Strikes and Public Opinion.
it is of advantage from the strikers&apos; point of view so far as possible to extend the area of a strike.  Hence the policy of federation and amalgamation, and the policy of &quot; sym-pathetic action.&quot;  But when certain limits are passed, as they are in the case of such an organisation as the N.U.R., relative values alter until this policy requires modification. In other words, the National Union of Railwaymen are by their size and position already able to bring sufficient pressure to bear to enforce any demand that mere pressure can enforce.   This power, as has been pointed out before, is well illustrated in their ability to carry matters to the supreme head of the Government whenever they have a mind to. This does not mean that the Triple Alliance is an. unnecessary organisation ; it is a first-class manoeuvring weapon, but how far it is useful through its mere capacity to strike as a whole is another matter.   It is precisely here that one fundamental distinction between the railway strike and the smaller, more usual type of strike, is seen.  In the present case no one, except a serious revolutionary, is in a position to follow un-hesitatingly the policy usual in the more ordinary case.  The leader who desires merely to succeed in a trade dispute must hesitate.   Thus a difference is immediately laid bare between the serious revolutionary and the leader who is desirous of confining the issue to a trade dispute-the difference in fact probably, conscious or unconscious, between Mr. Cramp and Mr. Thomas.  Mr. Cramp, at Carlisle on the 25th May, referring to the coming negotiations with regard to wages consolidation, is reported as follows : &quot; He talked this matter over with other members of the Triple Alliance.  The question became this were the people clear-eyed and conscious of the fact which was involved, because it meant either revolution or defeat ?   Whenever they said they were ripe for industrial revolution he was with them, but not for them to enter it merely under the belief that they were out for a trade dispute.  Let them approach it \vith their eyes open and be prepared to carry it through, but do not let them, through false pretences, engineer a thing of this kind unless the people they were calling upon to follow them knew what they had to go through.&quot;  Mr. Thomas, on the other hand, has hitherto been a strong opponent of direct action and upholder of the ballot-box method of revolution.  Accordingly when the test comes one should see the difference, and one certainly has seen clearly what might be expected in the attitude of Mr. Thomas.  Mr. Cramp, if he is thinking in terms of revolution and not of a trade dispute, should be all for the extension still farther of the area of the strike.   He should want completely to disorganise and finally paralyse the present system of government.  For this, no more effective means could be devised than the simultaneous strike of all members of the Triple Alliance, the Postal Federation and the B.T.U., and the newspaper compositors.   In the complete breakdown which would ensue Mr. Cramp might have an opportunity of establishing a social order more in con-sonance with his ideals.  But Mr. Thomas&apos;s attitude is the more interesting and more important, because more on the plane of practical politics.   Mr. Thomas hesitates to extend the strike area, for the reason already given, namely, that he has already applied sufficient pressure to do anything that pressure will do.   Other considerations arise.  Mr. Thomas points to his forbearance in the interests of the community, and this may be quite sincere, though hardly in just the way Mr. Thomas suggests.  He is, indeed, much concerned at the attitude of the community, but the reason is that he stands or falls by that attitude ; and this is the consideration which must govern his policy as regards the extension of the strike.  Unless he wishes forcibly to overturn the whole existing order, beyond a certain point public opinion must decide the issue.   No single body can stand against an overwhelmingly hostile community.But this consideration applies equally to the attitude of the Government. The Government also in a matter such as this must be ruled by public opinion, and since much of this opinion is labour opinion, it has been desirable to do nothing in the course of pleasures taken in connection with the strike which involves principles to which labour is solidly hostile, without making it abundantly clear that it was necessary, and why. This is the reason why it was desirable to concentrate rather on organising emergency means of transport than on a direct attack on the Union, e.g., through its funds, or on forcibly carrying on the railways with soldiers, &amp;c. It has also been desirable in appealing for volunteers to be careful that appeals should, not be so framed as to appear to be applicable to one social class in the community, as for example, an appeal for all to lend their motor cars.  This brings the conception of the class war dangerously into prominence.These are general considerations connected with Government policy, but there is one of special importance-the question whether strikes are permissible at all in the public service. This has recently been raised more than once, and here again public opinion is the crux of the matter. It cannot be denied that public opinion is in the last resort not necessarily the opinion of the Government. If it were, the considerations adduced above, .as well as many practical activities, would be rendered nugatory.  And if public opinion
Part II. Departmental.Strike Modifications of the Out-of-Work Donation Scheme.The official communique issued to the Press on the 30th September, announcing modi-fications of the out-of-work donation scheme to meet the situation arising from the railway strike, may be supplemented by a brief explanation of its main implications.As regards civilian workers, it was not considered necessary to make any alteration as regards the amounts payable to those who were already registered and in receipt of the donation immediately before the railway strike.&apos; &quot;The Employment Exchanges naturally had in their possession all the details requisite for the application of the scheme, without modification, in these cases. The amounts payable will, therefore, be those whioh came into force on the expiration of the period of six months for which the scheme was originally instituted. The men, that is to say, will receive 20s. a week, and the women 15s., with supplementary donation/at the rate of 6s. for the first dependent child, and 3s. for each additional child.   Boys receive 10s. a week and girls 7s. Qd.The case is different as regards civilians thrown out of work by the railway strike. It would obviously be impossible, in view of the suddenness and extent of the emergency,, for the Exchanges to carry out the usual inquiries to establish, the applicants exact position. It has, therefore, been considered necessary to establish flat rates, which, incidentally, are on a lower level than under the ordinary scheme. Married men, or widowers with dependent children, are to receive 25s., irrespective of the number of children,, an amount less by Is. than that received by the pre-strike applicant with one child. The childless married man, however, benefits to the extent of 5s. The single man, or the widower with no dependent children, is to receive 5s. less than the pre-strike claimant, the single woman 3s. less, boys 2s. 6dL less and girls Is. 6d. less. Married women, unless widowed, are not entitled to donation ; widows receive the same amount as single women. These reductions are necessitated by the serious danger of a complete cessation of normal industry.The amounts payable to ex-members of the forces have not been revised, and remain the same whether the applicant became unemployed before or after the strike. The amount therefore depends on the applicants previous position as regards employment. If the claimant has not already received donation for a period of 26 weeks, the amounts payable are 29s. a week in the case of men and 25s. in the case of women, with allowances of 6s. for the first dependent child and 3s. for others. If, however, the applicants policy has already been extended to cover a period longer than the original 26 weeks, payment will be at the rate of 20s. a week in the case of men, and 15s. a week in the case of women,, with an additional 6s. for the first dependent child and 3s. for each additional child. Disabled men in receipt of disability pensions receive varying amounts in respect of their(C 1895) 2 Q 2is not necessarily Government opinion it is difficult to adduce any strong reason why men should not strike against the Government when it acts in the role of employer. In addition there is little doubt that practice is steadily moving in the direction of looking upon strikes; in the Government service much as on other strikes, possibly in part owing to the recent extensions of the Governments activities as employer. There is little doubt for example that the majority of those who condemn the railway strike condemn it as a blow at the community and not at the Government another illustration that the distinction is in practice a very real one ; their attitude would have been little altered had the railways-been in private hands, if the rights and the Wrongs of the dispute had been otherwise the same. The fact, therefore, must be faced that there may be strikes in the public services. If this is so, one course to render the&apos;position nevertheless stable, is suggested by the principle that the supreme Government cannot at one and the same time act as party to and arbitrator in an industrial dispute. The essence of this method is the appointment of a joint council representing the employees and the consumers or users of the goods and services produced by the industry, together with certain members representing the Govern-&apos;1 ment, for the purpose of exploring fully the position as regards wages, conditions and work-ing arrangements, and arriving where possible at decisions. Where there is failure to reach a decision, conciliation or, in the last resort, arbitration can be applied in the Ordinary way,, and would give an opportunity for each side to state its case for the public consideration..&apos; Strikes will not always thus be avoided ; but when there is a strike, the issue would be a clear one upon which public opinion, the final arbiter, can make a clear judgment.        &quot;&quot;.
children, according to disability. Men of 20 per cent, disability, who do not receive allow-ances in respect of children from the Ministry of Pensions or the Ministry of Labour, are entitled to 24s. a week.The provisions as regards disqualification in cases where the unemployment arises in direct consequence of a trade dispute, involve disqualification where.the applicant was employed in the same establishment as the strikers, or is a member of any organisation which gives active support to the strikers. Finally an applicant will be disqualified as having refused suitable employment if work, other than on the railways, for which the applicant is physically fit, in distributing food and fuel, and assisting public health services, is not accepted when offered. Arrangements have been made for the application of this provision by sub-committees of the Local Employment Committees, which are being specially set up for the purpose.In the application of the revised scale, which will of necessity be carried out in very large numbers of cases with the co-operation of employers who, as in the early days of the scheme, have been asked to provide for direct payment of donation to their unemployed workers, it will hardly be possible to enforce rigidly the whole of the safeguards and restrictions with which the donation has been hedged about. The magnitude of the crisis must, it is to be feared, involve some laxity in the application of the scheme, though every precaution possible has been taken. The choice lay in effect, however, between suspending the scheme as regards the strike and continuing it in this modified form ; and the Government^ decision will no doubt be regarded with general approval. From a general point of view, too, the policy of safeguarding the position of those workers indirectly affected by a strike, though a new phenomenon in such circumstances, may be said to justify itself as dispelling any idea that the Government regards the crisis as in any way a struggle with the workers, or their interests, as a whole.Part III. Press Comments. (1) Labour and Socialist Press. (A) Imperial and Foreign Affairs.Bussia.The papers this week continue to comment on the state of affairs produced by Mr. Bullittfs communications to the Foreign Relations Committee of the American Senate. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald devotes all his space in the current issue of &quot; Forward &quot; to this subject. He discusses the personal character of Mr. Bullitt and declares his opinion that the only error in his conduct has been the repetition of the private conversation which he had with the Prime Minister in Paris. It is absurd to call in question the reliability of his facts. The &quot; Call&quot; has a leading article in which it warns readers not to be taken in by the vague rumours of an alteration in the Governments policy with regard to Russia which the &quot; Bullitt revelations &quot; have called forth. The only means of bringing about such an alteration is for the workers to put such pressure upon the Government that it will he forced to yield. The Call &quot; also contains an account of the latest development of the &quot; National Hands off Russia &quot; movement which has established a new Executive Committee and is organising local branches. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; uses the &apos;&quot; revelations &quot; to attack the Prime Minister and demands his resignation. It also has articles on the administration of the Soviet Government and on the position of women under the Soviets. A similar article on the Russian Administration appears in the &quot; Socialist.&quot; The &quot; Labour Leader&quot; expresses the opinion that the Prime Minister cannot afford to ignore the charges made against him by Mr. Bullitt, and that a more states-manlike and comprehensive reply than those that he has so far given is the only thing that can save him in the eyes of the public.(B) Home Affairs.The Political Outlook.This week the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; and the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; contain references to the rumoured negotiations between Mr. Lloyd George and certain Labour leaders. The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; dismisses these rumours as &quot; press inventions,&quot; and expects that Mr. Lloyd George will continue to ally himself with the propertied classes. The Labour Party is warned not to minimise the strength and power of this reactionary group, for it is likely to command considerable public support. However, the paper thinks it un-desirable that a Labour Government should succeed the present one, because the task of
&quot;the next government will be so difficult and the opportunities for criticism so great. The Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; is of opinion that if the Labour leaders accept Mr. Lloyd George as their leader it will be because they do not consider the Party will be strong enough to win a majority of seats without him. According to this paper it is impossible for a Labour Government of the near future to escape from the influence of reactionary capitalism ; if the Party accepts Mr. Lloyd George he is already in the power of the reactionaries; and even if it forms a Government by itself, the paper argues that when the workers attempt to quicken the pace towards Communism, such timid leaders as Henderson, Thomas and Clynes will give way to the threats and persuasions of the reaction and oppose the workers.The result of the Pontefract by-election is discussed in &quot; Forward,&quot; the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; and the &quot; Yorkshire Factory Times.&quot; &quot; Forward &quot; ascribes the defeat of the Labour candidate to the foolish action of some of his followers in breaking up certain meetings of the opposition candidate, and to the natural reaction after the Yorkshire strike. According to the &quot; Yorkshire Factory Times,&quot; the Coalition victory was due to their good organisation and to the large amount of money spent in the constituency by the late Sir Compton Rickett. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; draws two conclusions from the result, firstly, that the Coalition have still a strong following in the country, and secondly that it indicates that if Liberals and Labour make an alliance, this tends to drive the greater part of the Liberal vote over to the Tory Party.Revolution or Constitutionalism.Very definite views are expressed this week in the labour papers on the problem of adopting revolutionary or constitutional methods to secure political objects. The I.L.P. papers, such as the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; and &quot; Forward,&quot; deprecate revolutionary and direct actionist methods and in this they are supported by the &quot; Democrat &quot; and theCotton Factory Times.&quot; Mr. William Stewart, in &quot;Forward,&quot; admits that the policy of the present Government may well account for the growing contempt for the whole Parlia-mentary system, but appeals to Labour not to accept&apos;what he thinks to be the present destruction of the Parliamentary system as final. Although it is natural, in the present state of affairs, for people to look for other forms of Government, it is pointed out in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; how futile it would be to try to adopt the methods of an agricultural country such as Russia to solve English problems ; armed revolution is condemned, since it would mean greatest hardship for the poor in the large industrial towns. The I.L.P. still adheres to the use of political power to achieve the Social Revolution ; and Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, in the same paper, gives a lengthy interpretation of its policy. He describes itas &quot; a living party, since its creed is legs of a dogma than a guide, for while it has no doubt as to the road, for it has never varied in the essentials of Socialism, it knows perfectly well that its features will change from time to time.&quot; As an example of the elasticity of the party, he says that &quot; when Mr. Cole and the Shop Stewards, by reviving old theories and practices under new conditions, threw some new light on industrial democracy, the I.L.P. was not so bound by past declarations that it could not profit by the new points of view.&quot; On the other hand, the &quot; Socialist&quot; strongly supports the &quot; political strike &quot; method, and it even prophesies that a properly organised general political strike against the Govern-menfs Russian policy would be so amazingly successful that &quot; we should be within sight of the peaceful establishment of a Workers&apos; Soviet Republic in Britain.&quot; Constitutional-ism is considered to be mere slavishness, and it is asserted that &quot; the opposition to a political strike comes from those who are opposed to the end &quot; presumably the establish-ment of a Soviet Republic &quot; and not daring to say so, boggle at the means&quot; The Merthyr &quot; Pioneer,&quot; discussing the general strike as a means to secure nationalisation of the mines, although it is an I.L.P. paper, considers that if such a strike were likely to be successful it is the duty of the I.L.P. to give it every support. The paper, however, doubts the possibility of success, in face of the recent failure of the police and the Yorkshire miners&apos; strikes ; and considers that many Labour leaders are over-confident about the :growth of revolutionary opinion among the rank and file.The I.L.P. papers andthe &quot; Socialist,&quot; although they differ as to the methods by which a Labour Government should be secured, still have perfect faith in the powers of a Labour Government, of one form or another. The &quot; British Citizen &quot; and even the &quot; Democrat,&quot; however, view with considerable foreboding the establishment of such a Government in the near future. The &quot; British Citizen &quot; doubts whether Labour leaders, such as Mr. Thomas or Mr. Henderson, will be able to control their followers any better when their own Government is in power than they can at present. With regard to the present Labour members of Parliament, the &quot; Democrat &quot; says : &quot;No one who has&apos; studied their work is prepared to admit that the Labour members, as a whole, are even competent appren-tices.&quot;  As for their policy, it asserts that nationalisation is not the last work in progress
and they cannot base their policy on the &quot; now musty &quot; ideas of Karl Marx.   The &quot; Nation &quot;&quot; is another paper which has little faith in a purely Labour Government.   It considers that Liberalism is the necessary complement to Labour for two main reasons, namely, that it speaks for all classes, and. that it knows more about the actual business of running the State.   At the same time, the paper discusses two of the difficulties lying in the way of&apos; this union ; the first is that Liberalism has not made up its mind between Mr. George and Mr. Asquith, and the second is that it cannot offer Labour in any definite form, its policy on reconstruction:   In the &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; Mr. Joseph King endeavours to answer the assertion of the Liberals that Labour cannot govern.   He admits that Labour possesses no adequate organs in the Press, and that the majority of Labour Members of Parliament have not made the most of their opportunities ; but he denies the accusation that Labour does not possess the men to govern, and cites, among others, the names of Mr. Barnes and Mr. Clynes, two men whose talents were quite unknown before they took ministerial posts. Finally, he reiterates the argument that no party could be worse than the present Govern- -ment, so that Labour men might as well have a try.&quot; Justice &quot; advises the Labour movement to adopt a clear and firm policy on the food question if it wishes to check the present tendency to disintegration. It should make a demand for stability of prices and of wages. It is expected that if the capitalists are com- -pelled to stop any further rise in prices or fall in wages, they will face the question of economy and see to it that the surplus remaining to themselves is spent in the most profit-able way, for example, on paying full wages to get houses built, instead of on unemployment doles.Ireland.The &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; &quot; Forward,&quot; the Bradford and the Merthyr &quot; Pioneer &quot; and the &quot; Socialist&quot; devote considerable space to the Irish situation this week.   In identical&apos; articles the two &quot; Pioneers &quot; condemn the Government for withholding from Ireland the right of self-determination.  The other papers give accounts of the repressive measures; employed by the Government.Nationalisation of Coal Mines.The &quot;Democrat&quot; contains an article strongly condemning Mr. Brace&apos;s proposal made at the Trades Union Congress, that the mine owners should be compensated by payment of a 5 per cent, scrip. It is argued that the owners will thus be assured of a settled income on their capital without being involved in any expense of management or risk. The country will have to pay this toll in perpetuo, even if the mining industry ceases to be a paying concern, and it is pointed out that the only possible trend in the value of a coal field, even under normal circumstances, must be downwards. No alternative method of compensation, however, is advanced. Mr. David Gilmour, in the &quot; British Citizen,&quot; strongly opposes nationalisation. He challenges anyone to show that the slightest ground existed for the attack on the coal owners.Otlier.Several of the papers refer to the ironfounders&apos; strike. The &quot; Socialist&quot; welcomes the attitude of the employers in refusing to listen to the claims of the men&apos;s represen-tatives, since this tends to- bring into clear perspective the real character of the class struggle, showing that there can be no harmony between the two sides. &quot; Justice &quot; and the Bradford &quot; Pioneer &quot; criticise the Anti-Profiteering Act. They point out that the weakness of the act lies in the fact that the responsibility for making complaints rests with the individual consumers, and few possess the necessary initiative or the means to take action. To obtain beneficial results from the Act, &quot; Justice &quot; advocates municipal control over the necessaries of life wherever this is possible. The &quot; Railway Review&quot; contains two letters addressed by Mr. Thomas to the members of the N.U.R. on the present strike. The &quot;British Citizen&quot; and the &quot;Democrat&quot; publish figures produced by the British Commonwealth Union on the cost of some of Labour&apos;s demands at the Trades Union Congress, namely, the cost of the 44-hour week, the  1 a week old age pension and the  250 income-tax limit.(2) Ex-Service Men&apos;s Periodicals.The &quot; Ex-Service Man &quot; this week discusses the new allowances for ex-Service men under training, the Government scheme for the absorption of disabled men into employment and the prospects of the amalgamation of ex-Service organisations.
&quot;   3UThe Employment of Disabled Men.The Government scheme for the employment of disabled men is discussed in some detail. The opinion is expressed that the scheme is in no way final, and that it provides primarily for the absorption of unemployed disabled, men as unskilled labour. The training schemes for the conversion of unskilled men into skilled men are referred to, and the scheme is thus regarded as final only in the sense that by it men will be removed from the ranks of the unemployed, not to return to them, it is hoped, but to obtain the opportunity of working at a trade and improving their positions by the acquirement of , skill, &quot; which perhaps it might never have occurred to them, to acquire had not war&apos;s blind chances pitched on them as victims.&quot;Amalgamation of ex-Service Men&apos;s Organisations.It is stated that many ex-Service men had hopes that General Byng, as Chairman - of the United Services Fund, would have taken a strong line and made an effort to bring about the unification of the many organisations of ex-Service men, but that &quot; he evidently regards the lack of unity as not, after all, his business so far as the administration of the fund is concerned.&quot; Nevertheless, it is stated that as the outcome of the policy General Byng is following, unity must come, though indirectly and slowly. An appeal, therefore, is made to ex-Service men to aid in this development by joining together in the various towns and districts to form in each one ex-Service men&apos;s organisation, and thus to start a movement of amalgamation not from the top but from the bottom.(3) The Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.Unemployment Donation.The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; of the 26th inst. complains of the way in which the regulation that a claimant to donation pay must be &quot; genuinely whole-time unemployed &quot; and available for suitable employment, is administered by the local Exchanges. The article is a long one, but the burden of the complaint is that workers in exactly similar circumstances as regards working short time are being treated in directly opposite ways, owing to the varying exercise of the discretion allowed to local Exchange managers.Employment of Disabled Men.The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; of the 26th inst. contained a letter from Mr. J. A. Ross, Managing-Director of Messrs. Ross, Courtney &amp; Co., Ltd., drawing attention to a difficulty with which, he said, &quot; employers are faced in their endeavour to do the best they can for disabled men.&quot; He says that his firm has continuously employed disabled men who, after working for a short time, complain that they are unfit for further work, rest for a time, and then take other employment. This conduct he attributes to the practice of Local Pensions Committees in revising the temporary advances they allow to disabled men, pending the award of a permanent pension, according as a man is in employment or not, and as his wages go up or down. This practice, he thinks, will probably explain the large number of unemployed soldiers and sailors there are to-day, and he concludes his letter by appealing to the Government to &quot; institute a more generous and sympathetic method of awarding the pension, so that the disabled men should be encouraged to do what they can for themselves instead of being misled by the idea that they must not work regularly or they will lose their right to a pension.&quot; Mr. Ross somewhat confuses the temporary advances made by Local Pensions Committees with the permanent pensions awarded by Medical Boards.Training Allowance.The opinion is expressed that the frank statement by Sir Robert Home in regard to the complaints which arose in respect to the new training allowances is bearing fruit. &quot; The partially disabled man appreciates the absurd anomaly of receiving a larger sum of money whilst under training than his totally disabled brother, and is now inclined to regard the few months when he enjoyed those increased benefits as one of his lucky periods. The tendency is to regard the lack of foresight shown in Government circles when drawing up the August scale as rather a profitable joke, which coincides with the increasing de-termination amongst ex-Service men to get together and to go all out for the common
Part IV. General Topics.The Railway Strike.Negotiations between the N.U.R. Executive and the Government took place on the 25th-26th September. The negotiations were an attempt to bridge the gulf between the Railway Executive&apos;s offers and: the N.U!R. demands with regard to the fixing of new standard rates of pay for the grades of railway employees represented by the N.U.R. The railwaymen claimed that the new standard rates should be fixed so that every worker in a given grade should receive as a permanent standard wage 33s. per wreek (the present war bonus), plus the highest rate paid before the war to any worker in that grade, with a minimum of  3. The Government offered that the new rates for N.U.R. grades should be on the average 100 per cent, above pre-war rates, with a minimum of  2 per week. The Government also put forward the provisions of the March agreement, whereby no man&apos;s earnings can be reduced before the end of this year ; while, if the new basic rates-were higher in any individual cases than present earnings, they were to come into immediate operation. The Government offered to extend these provisions in the following manner : present earnings should not be reduced until the cost of living had fallen to 110 per cent, above the pre-war figure, and had remained at or below that level for three months. Then the residue of the war wage (the difference between the new basic rates of pay and the present earnings) should be reduced in correspondence with the reduced cost of living by reference either in accordance with the sliding scale agreement or else to an. independent tribunal. This offer was not accepted by the N.U.R. Executive, and the railway strike commenced at midnight on the 26th.Since the strike began the railwaymen&apos;s leaders have been conducting a series of meetings in the London area in order to explain to their members the points at issue. Mr. Thomas, at the Albert Hall on the 27th, and in speeches and statements since, has dealt largely with somewhat minor points of controversy arising out of the negotiations-with the Government, but has throughout reiterated his conviction that the essential issue is the application of the principle of &quot; standardisation upwards &quot; to all grades of railwaymen. At the Albert Hall he expressed the wish that the issue should be made a simple question of railwaymen&apos;s wages, and the opinion that if the strike came to be regarded as a challenge to the existence of the State, the other trade unions might be drawn in on the side of the N.U.R. On the 29th he stated that he had refused &quot; offers of help which would have paralysed the community.&quot; On the 30th a development took place in his attitude, and he stated that he was no longer going to refuse such offers of help, and mentioned in particular the National Union of Vehicle Workers and the E.T.U. In a statement made at Unity House he reiterated his announcements that the N.U.R. were prepared to return to work if and when their particular wages demands were granted,, but he referred to &quot; the challenge, to the whole trade union movement made by the Government.&quot;Mr. Bromley, however, stated at the first of these meetings that the future of the Trade Union movement as a whole was involved in the dispute. Mr. Smillie, in Glasgow, on the 29th, said that this dispute would settle the wfiole question of what the position of bonuses given during the war was to be, and consequently &quot; it would be in the interests of the whole of the workers if the railwaymen were successful in their struggle.&quot;With regard to the participation in the strike by other unions than the N.U.R., interest centres in three bodies, the A.S.L.E. &amp; F., the London transport workers (especially the National Union of Vehicle Workers) and the operative printers. The Executives of the A:S.L.E. &amp; F. offered their support to the N.U.R., on the 26th and their members came out on strike at the same time as the N.U.R. men. The National Union of Vehicle Workers approached the N.U.R. on the evening of the 27th, when they were informed that it was not necessary for them to take any action. They were in further consultation with the N.U.R. on the 29th, when they determined to suspend any decision until &quot;the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation had discussed the situation. The Executive Council of ,this Federation met on the 30th and consulted with the N.U.R.The following announcement was made : &quot; The Transport Workers&apos; Federation have had under their consideration the effects of the railway strike upon the constituent unions of the federation. Reports have been received from all quarters of the United Kingdom that already some 100,000 of our members are affected by the dispute, while the position of other sections has become rapidly untenable in &quot;consequence of the
attempted diversion of goods and passenger traffic. The executive realised that no efforts of the Federation can definitely restrain the members from taking drastic strike action in support of the N.U.R. It realises, moreover, that the motives of the rank and file are warranted and are justifiable ; and we will stop at nothing in order to defend the long-established principles of trade unionism and the right to defend wages constitutionally secured. We have already been in communication with other unions involved and likely to become involved in the dispute ; and having ascertained the opinions of the responsible officials of those unions regarding the policy to be adopted by organised labour, we have arranged a meeting of representatives of those unions at Caxton . Hall to-morrow (1st October). The Executive Committee: of our Federation are fully convinced that the dispute is one into which the N.U.R. was thrust; and in accordance with the underlying principles of trade unionism we shall continue to offer every encouragement and support, in order to maintain the economic status of the entire trade union movement, which is involved in the present crisis.&quot;Representatives of the following unions, not members of the N.F.T.W. were invited to the conference : Electrical Trades Union, Printing and Kindred Trades Federation, railway Clerks&apos; Association, the postal workers unions, National Federation of General Workers and the Amalgamated Society of Engineers. The conference was held at Caxton Hall and besides the representatives of the various unions, Mr. Arthur Henderson, M.P., attended as a delegate from the Labour Party, and both Mr. J. H. Thomas and Mr. Bromley were there to put the case of the railwaymen. The conference adjourned in the afternoon and a deputation consisting of Mr. H. Gosling, Rt. Hon. J. R. Clynes, M.P., Rt. Hon. A. Henderson, M.P., Mr. J. 0&apos;Grady, M.P., Mr. J. Sexton, M.P., Mr. Robert Williams, Mr. E. Bevin, Mr. J. T. Brownlie, Mr. T. E. Naylor, Mr. Muir, Mr. Walker and Mr. Bowen, was received by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister expressed his-readiness to see the Executive of the N.U.R., but pointed out that the Government would not consent to reopen negotiations officially until the men had resumed work. The deputation after-wards proceeded to Unity House and the N.U.R.-Executive agreed to go to Downing Street and meet the Prime Minister. A conference was held lasting until midnight, when it was adjourned until the following day.A significant feature of the dispute has been unrest among operative printers in some London newspaper offices, because of the matter hostile to the N.U.R. which they are being-asked to print, and rumours of threats to refuse to set up statements regarded as unfair.It is reported from Glasgow that interest mainly centres in the use the Government may make of their resources in the Army. No serious objection is likely to be taken to the use of the Royal Engineers to run the mail trains, but the extended use of such resources, it is believed, would precipitate the better balanced element into the hands of the extremists. It is reported from Sheffield that the workmen there are asking whether the meaning of the dispute is not really this; that the Government are inviting the employers (in par-ticular the Engineering trade employers) to refuse to standardise war increases into wage rates, and are encouraging them to seek a reduction in wages at the earliest opportunity. Further provincial opinions on the inner meaning of the strike are given in. Part V (2).National Industrial Conference.A meeting of Trade Union representatives on the Provisional Joint Committee of the National Industrial Conference, which was held in London on the 24th September, 1919, to consider the question of the formation of the National Industrial Council, passed the; following resolution: &quot; This Trade Union Side of the Provisional Joint Industrial Committee protests against the failure of the Government to carry out the agreement arrived at by the Joint Committee of Employers and Trade Unionists, and especially against the exclusion of agricultural workers from the Hours of Employment Bill, and declares that in accordance with the resolution passed by the National Indus-trial Conference on 4th April it is unable to proceed with the formation of the proposed National Industrial Council until the Government agrees to carry the recommendations of the Joint Committee fully into effect.&quot;Copies of this resolution were sent to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Labour, Sir Thomas Munro and Sir Allan Smith (chairman of the employers&apos; side of the National Industrial Conference).(C 1895) 2 R
Trades Union congress the Parliamentary Committee of the T.U.C. met on Thursday, the 25th September, to consider the resolutions upon which it was directed by the Congress at Glasgow to take action. The Committee decided to ask the Prime Minister to receive a deputation at an early date from the Committee and the M.F.G.B. on the suggestion of nationalisation of the mines.  The demand for the abolition of conscription will also be put forward.Industrial League and Council.The Industrial Reconstruction Council and the Industrial League have amalgamated under the above title. The autumn programme of the new organisation comprises three series of fortnightly conferences on the working of Joint Industrial Councils, &quot;Scientific Management &quot; and general industrial problems.Income Tax.The S.W.M.F. is to consider next week the question of deferring payment of income tax, until incomes under  250 per annum have been exempted, in connection with notices for the payment of the tax for the quarter ending July. It is stated that a special delegate conference of the M.F.G.B. will be held in the course of next month to reconsider the whole question.Labour Colleges.. The Central Labour College reopened on Thursday, the 25th September, Mr. Ablett of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation opened the proceedings, in the absence of Mr. C. T. &apos;Cramp. Twenty-nine students are being trained in the college this session, including not only members of the two controlling bodies (the N.U.R. and S.W.M.F.) but also of the Northumberland and Forest of Dean Miners&apos; Associations and the Dyers&apos; and Bleachers&apos; Federation. The new union of Post Office Workers has decided, as was stated in last week&apos;s Report, to give the college its support. The Scottish Labour College, Glasgow,, though it was formed with the idea of being a residential college mainly, would appear to be concentrating rather upon evening classes, with one or two special day classes for night workers and a Saturday class for miners.Nationalisation of the Mines.In support of the miners&apos; campaign for nationalisation, a manifesto has been issued by the Executive Committee of the North Wales Miners&apos; Association. The manifesto deals mainly with the question of output, states that the present system of individual ownership and dual control is responsible for decreased output, and that to improve the output, not only must.the ownership of the mines be transferred to the State, but the management must be transferred to the mines&apos; officials and workers of the industry. Demonstrations were held in Durham on Saturday the 27th in support of the miners&apos; demand for the nationalisation of coal mines, and Mr. Hodges has addressed demonstrations at Hanley and Ashton-in-Makerfield (Wigan) in the course of the week. At the Keir Hardie Memorial meeting in Glasgow on the 28th September, Mr. Smillie announced that the Miners&apos; Federation were proposing to organise a series of. demonstrations next month in favour of nationalisation.National Sailors&apos; and Firem n&apos;s Union.The annual conference of the National Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union of Great Britain and Ireland opened in London on the 22nd September. The meetings of the conference were held in private. It is reported that the conference has decided to take a ballot of members on the question of nationalisation of the shipping industry and that a resolution was passed calling for an increased benefit to persons insured under Part I of the Insurance Act, 1911, and for an increase in the amount allowed to societies for administrative expenses. It was decided to send a deputation to the Minister of Pensions to discuss with him the question of providing facilities for the training of disabled men of the Mercantile Marine, and to continue to boycott all British ships carrying Germans among their crews. The most important decision of the conference from the political point of view, wras a decision to affiliate to the National Labour Party. The conference concluded on the 25th Septem-hei. At the annual dinner of the union, held on the 22nd September, Colonel John Ward was the principal speaker and denounced Bolshevism and Direct Action.
Co-operative Societies,A proposal is on foot for the amalgamation of the seven co-operative societies which trade in the Manchester area. An endeavour has been made recently by members of the Plymouth Co-operative Society to sever the connection between this society and the local Labour Party. The majority of the newly elected committee are hostile to connection with the Labour Party, but their proposals have been defeated at a general meeting of members of the Society.Shop Assistants.The Early Closing Association is promoting a Bill for the compulsory closing of shops at 7 o&apos;clock on four nights of the week and 8 o&apos;clock on Saturdays with the usual half-day holiday. This Bill has been considered by the Executive Committee of the Shop Assistants&apos; Union, and they have decided to approach the Labour Party with a view to getting the Bill amended when it is considered in the House of Commons, so as to enable Local Authorities to close shops at an earlier hour than 7 o&apos;clock, and also to enable shop assistants to vote upon local closing orders, as in New Zealand.Holidays.An agreement has been arrived at between employees in chemical trades and the Chemical Employers&apos; Federation under which workers will get a week&apos;s holiday with pay next year providing that they have a continuous service record from last April to next March and have not lost more than seven shifts during that period and have also a record of &quot; satisfactory work and conduct.&quot; This is worth recording in view of the recent general * movement for annual holidays with pay.Amalgamation.The proposals for the amalgamation of the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks, the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative and Commercial Employees and Allied Trades, and the National Warehouse and General Workers&apos; Union are now before the executives of the unions concerned. The Shop Assis-tants&apos; executive in particular object to the absence of any definite proposals in the draft scheme of amalgamation regarding the large number of members in the Co-operative Union who are not engaged in the distributive or allied trades. Unless, therefore, the Co-operative&apos; Union are willing to sacrifice their members who are not engaged in the distributive trades it would appear that the negotiations for amalgamation will stop. The Shop Assistants&apos; fear is that if the new amalgamation did include the whole of the members of the Co-opera-tive Union, it might be excluded from the T.U.C. in the same way as the Co-operative Employees Union has been excluded. A delegate meeting of the Co-operative Union has been called for the 12th October in Leeds, to which the Executive will report upon the work of. the Amalgamation Joint Sub-Committee. The question of the amalgamation of the Shop Assistants&apos; Union with the National Association of Grocers&apos; Assistants was dealt with in last week&apos;s Report.The proposed scheme for the amalgamation of the engineering trade unions does not appear to be meeting with the satisfaction of the smaller unions. The United Pattern Makers&apos; Association at a delegate meeting, passed a resolution supporting the principle of amalgamation, but recommending the members of the organisation to vote against the scheme that is now being considered. It may be noted that this union was among the minority at the meeting of the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades which decided to defer the claim for a 44-hour week pending the report of a joint com-mittee on the economic effect of a 44-hour week on the industry. The moulders and boilermakers have been absent from all the meetings held to consider the amalgamation scheme except the first. Reference was made to the attitude of the London District Committee of the E.T.U. in last week&apos;s Report. It is, however, stated that the view is held that the unions as a whole will vote in favour of amalgamation.The ballot of the members of the National Association of Builders&apos; Labourers, the United Builders&apos; Labourers&apos; Union, the Public Works and Constructional Operatives&apos; Union, and the United Order of General Labourers of Great Britain and Ireland on an amalgamation scheme, has resulted in an overwhelming majority in favour of ihe-scheme.Workshop Schools.Trade Union and Labour opposition to Works Schools has always been pronounced,, the latest example being a resolution passed at the Glasgow meeting of the Trades Union.(C 1895) 2 R 2
Cjongress^ The Education Act, 1918, provides that no young person shall be required, without his own consent, to attend a continuation school held at or in connection with his place of employment, but the T.U.C. resolution expressed the opinion that attendance at such a school should in no case count as attendance at a continuation school under that Act. In this connection it may be noted that at a recent meeting of the Glasgow Education Authority a decision that proposals from employers with regard to the establishment of schools in connection with their works1 should be considered separately on their merits, was arrived at in spite of - the opposition of the Labour members of the board. Two Sheffield steel firms,.Messrs. Doncaster and Messrs. Osborne, have combined to establish a day continuation school for their own boys.Trade Union Topics.M.F.G.B. It is reported that the Yorkshire miners are preparing proposals for the reform of the Federation in the direction (a) of prohibiting county strikes without the sanction of the Federation ; (b) of providing, in the event of a county strike not being successful within a given time, for the declaration of a national strike by the Federation in support of the county. These are no doubt further moves of the Federation in the direction of consolidating its power.Lancashire Weavers-It is reported that the General Council of the Amalgamated Weavers&apos; Association is considering proposals for an increase in the weekly contributions customary among the weavers&apos; unions. This is apparently the reply the officials of the unions are making to charges of slackness and lack of initiative made by some of their members, who compare unfavourably the achievements of the weavers&apos; amalgamation with those of the Triple Alliance..Clerks. Two somewhat significant developments with regard to clerks are reported. A branch of the National Federation of Law Clerks has been formed at Bristol.   The subject of salaries is to be immediately brought before the Law Society by the Federation. ;   At Burtou-on-Trent the local branch of the National Union of Clerks, comprising chiefly the brewery clerks of the town, have decided to transfer to the Workers&apos; Union.Ex-Service Men.Ex-Service Metis March. Twenty-four of the 28 men who left Manchester on the 14th iiist. arrived at Trafalgar Square at 1 p.m. on the 27th inst. From Trafalgar Square they proceeded to Hyde Park where they participated in a demonstration organised by the N.F.D.D.S.S.   On the 29th inst. they were received at Montagu House by the Minister.Ex-Service Metis Grievances. The Northern Council of the N.F.D.D.S.S. has passed a resolution disapproving of the proposed appropriation of some of the Army Canteen funds for general welfare work among ex-soldiers in London. The Bethnal Green Borough Council on the 25th September received a deputation from the local branch of the N.F.D.D.S.S. to ask the council to establish a street market in which the stall-holders should be exclusively ex-Service men. :Ex-Service Men and the Railway Strike. The National Union of Ex-Service Men are reported to be instructing their branches to act with the local Trades and Labour Councils &quot; in whatever action they may take.&quot; Members of the N.F.D.D.S.S., it is stated, have been enjoined to preserve an attitude of strict neutrality. The Federation has apparently considered its course of action should men in Army Reserve Z be recalled to the colours, and has decided to support any men who should not answer the summons.Ex-Service Metis Organisations. The Birmingham Divisional Grand Council of the Comrades of the Great War has approved of the scheme of amalgamation with the National Association of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers.Part V. Departmental and District Reports. (1) Departmental Reports.Appointments Department.The Ministers Appeal. The Ministers appeal on the subject of training vacancies and premiums was issued on the 20th September to 76 professional societies and industrial organisations. In the letter which accompanied the appeal it was pointed out that there -are now 20,000 ex-Service candidates for professional and business training, exclusive
-of 3,000 men for whom training&apos;has been arranged. Less than 3,000 unfilled openings for training are available and. the purpose of the appeal is to increase facilities and to obtain wider recognition for the view that war service should be regarded as an introduction to training.Training Grants Scheme. The Grants Committee have received from the District Selective Committees 8,873 applications for training, of which 5,125 have been sanctioned. Of the courses sanctioned 27 per cent, are for training as pharmacists, 17 per cent, for training in engineering and 15 per cent, for training in accountancy.Appointments. On the 19th September 18,485 ex-Service men and 2,968 civilians were available for appointment. The number of vacancies registered was 35,731 and the total number of applicants known to have been placed was 13,096.Training Department.Lodging Allowances. Arrangements have now been made for the payment of 5s. a week lodging allowance to single men in training who are required to live away from home. ,Training Facilities. Treasury sanction has been obtained for the acquisition of the factory known as Haydon Park Works, Shepherds Bush, which will provide facilities for training about 400 men in the furniture and vehicle building trades.Employment Department.Out-of-Work Donation. On the 12th September, 420,582 full-time out-of-work dona-tion policies were remaining lodged at the Exchanges. Of this number 376,710 were men, 38,165 women, 3,236 boys and 2,471 girls. In addition, there were on the 5th September, 27,379 short-time policies lodged by 5,820 men, 16,736 women, 1,389 boys and 3,434 girls. The special scheme in connection with the railway strike is referred to in Part II.Work of the Court of Referees.-Up to the 18th September, 31.1,873 claims to out-of-work donation, had been referred to appeals officers in Great Britain. Of this number 286,426 &apos; cases had been heard by the Court of Referees. An analysis of 271,668 claims heard shows that 68,948 were allowed, 202,214 disallowed and in 506 cases a compromise was arranged. The proportion of disallowances to claims heard was therefore 74 &quot;4 per cent. Of the total disallowances 48&apos; 6 per cent, were&apos; disallowed owing to refusal to accept suitable employment.Prosecution for Fraud. Up to the 26th September, 1,318 cases had been referred to the solicitor with a view to prosecution for attempted fraud in connection with out-of-work donation. The solicitor has reported on 814 cases. In 519 cases the defendant was fined, in 127 cases sentences of imprisonment were passed, and in 51 cases the defendant was bound over.. In 117 cases the summonses were dismissed..Unemployment. On the 19th September, 407,307 men and 96,623 women were on the live register. Vacancies remained available for 38,293 men and 45,808 women. The number of juveniles on the live register was 26,406, and the number of juvenile vacancies available was 15,687.Joint Industrial Councils Division.Electricity Supply Industry. A meeting of the LLC. Avas held on the 19th September. Reports were received from Manchester,&apos; Sheffield and Birmingham with regard to the establishment of District Councils. It was agreed that a Commercial Sub-Committee be appointed. It was decided that the London Standing Joint Committee be asked to submit proposals to the J.I.C. with a view to that Committee being constituted the District Council for the London Area.Local Authorities Non-Trading Service (Manual Workers). A meeting of the J.I.C. was held on the 19th September. It was decided to proceed as rapidly as possible with the establishment of provincial councils.Needles and Fish-Hooks. A meeting of the J.I.C. was held on the 16th September, The principal business was the consideration of the Government scheme for the employ-ment of disabled men.   The Council decided in favour of the scheme.Rubber Manufacturing. A meeting of the J.I.C. was held on the 18th September. The principal business was the consideration of the claim.for an advance in wages.   The - employers did not see any possibility of an advance but agreed to put the proposal before
all their members, and promised a reply for the next meeting on the 22nd October.  The employers referred to the American and Japanese competition as driving them out of neutral markets, and they also gave definite instances of under-production and &quot; ca&apos;-canny methods.Court of Arbitration.During the week ending the 27th September, 1919, the Court of Arbitration heard 18 cases, 15 in London, one at Bristol, one at Manchester and one at Glasgow.Trade Boards Division.Special Orders. The Minister has made a Special Order applying the Trade Board Acts to the flax and hemp trade.(2) District Reports.London and South-E astern.Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the 12th September shows a. decrease of 4,379, of whom 3,468 are women and 911 are men. The trades chiefly affected by unemployment in this division are conveyance of men and goods, building and general labouring for men, and domestic service for women.Shortage of Labour. The Enfield General Purposes Sub-Committee ascribes the short-age of skilled workers in the building trade to the failure of the National Federation of Building Trade Employers to come to an agreement with the workers on the question of a national rate and a normal hour basis, the result being that skilled builders are leaving their work for other occupations.Shortage of Transport and Materials. Investigation has proved that there are at Richborough 1,200 railway wagons in various stages of repair, a number of steam loco-motives, petrol and steam lorries, together with a number of steam road rollers. It is suggested that the former could be used to relieve the congestion of traffic and the latter are urgently needed for road-work. A deficient service of trains is impeding work at Margate and transport difficulties are holding up the supply of building materials at Sutton. Margate is suffering also from a shortage of coal. Development at Richmond is impeded by shortage of cement and bricks. Beckenham reports that extensive repairs to highways are practically impossible owing to lack of material.Training-The City of London Committee has approved of training schemes for dis-abled men in the following trades : Pipe-making, shape pressing and wire shape making, metallic capsule making, dressing gown manufacture, umbrella making, and electric oven making.New Developments. A new shipbuilding yard is to be established in the Medway to-take steamers up to 10,000 tons.South Midlands and Eastern.Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the 12th September shows a decrease of 372 of which men account for 272 and women 100. At Leicester it is reported that workpeople engaged in the furniture trade are resuming work. It is anticipated that the end of the harvest will throw a number of land-girls out of employment. The industrial effects of the railway strike will be felt immediately. One of the largest steel makers, Messrs. A. Hickman &amp; Co., Bilston, are damping down their furnaces. The iron-founders&apos; strike has had surprisingly little effect in this division and there has been practically no sign of sympathetic action by other unions, although many ironmoulders are in the General Workers&apos; Unions.Shortage of Material-Tiie Sunbury Aviation Company, Letchworth, complain that production is hampered by lack of material.New Developments-Messrs. Blackstone, Ltd., Stamford, propose extending their works. It is expected that employment for an additional 4,000 workpeople will be avail-able at the end of 18 months.General-The provisions of the Restoration of Pre-War Practices Act have been anticipated to a considerable extent by the large employers and while individual cases of a controversial nature may occur, it is not anticipated by the organised employers or workmen that any extensive trouble will now arise.  The example of the Birmingham
Engineering Employers&apos; and Craft Unions in relation to overtime has been followed by the Leicester Federation which covers Leicester, Rugby and Loughborough, and a joint committee for the regulation of overtime has now been established in this area.South-western.Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the 19th September shows a total decrease of 859, of whom 764 are men and 95 are women. Unemployment figures at Portsmouth will probably show a large increase in the.future, owing to the impending reductions of staff at the dockyard. It is reported that all men with less than seven years&apos; service are being gradually dispensed with at Devonport Dockyard. Plymouth Town Council suggests that work on commercial lines&apos; should be undertaken at the dockyard to lessen the prospect of further unemployment. The strike of ironfounders has not had much effect at Portsmouth or at Devonport Dockyards. At present in this district a larger number of labourers and other men are affected than ironmoulders. At Southampton an endeavour is being made to arrange a system of co-operation between Employment Exchanges and private registry offices for dealing with the problem of domestic service.Shortage of Transport. Quarrying has been stopped at Christow near Exeter in conse-quence of the blocking of the railway siding with loaded wagons.Employment of ex-Service Men. Plymouth Town Council has resolved that ex-Service men be given preference in all municipal vacancies. The Exeter and District Chamber of Commerce is appealing to employers to provide discharged, officers and men with oppor-tunities of training and proposes to hold a joint meeting with, the Trade and Labour Council to discuss the problem of employment for disabled men.Training. -A course of training for women in machinery is proposed at Portsmouth where arrangements are already being made to start the schemes for training women in domestic work and dressmaking. Three firms at Portsmouth have offered to train women in upholstery. The Somerset County Council are establishing a farm institute at Cannington.General. The vacating of sheds and warehouses by the Admiralty at Portsmouth is expected to restore a number of their men to normal employment. Men employed in the building trade at Ashburton have applied for an advance to bring their rates up to the level ruling at Newton Abbot. At Bridgwater, the sawmilling employers are refusing to agree to an award granted by the Court of Arbitration on the 17th June last and have withdrawn their membership from the J.I.C.West Midlands. ..,Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the 12th September shows a total decrease of 1,864, of whom 524 are men and 1,340 are women.Shortage of Labour. The Electric Construction Company. Wolverhampton complain that output is retarded owing to shortage of first-class patternmakers.Training. The scheme for the training of women in waistcoat making at Birmingham has been approved.Effects of Railway Strike. The closing of the Metropolitan Wagon &amp; Carriage Works, Wednesbury, has created a serious situation. Employers and trade unions in the engineer-ing and the heavy brass trades have drawn up an agreement to keep work going as long as possible and to give the longest possible notices of discharge.Yorkshire and- East Midlands.Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the 12th September shows a total decrease of 11,657, of whom 10,336 are men and 1,321 are women. This reduction is largely due to an increase in the supply of coal for manufacturing purposes. The Bradford live register has fallen from 6,049 to 2,294 men. Leeds live register for men has fallen from 7,547 to 5,242.Training. The training of disabled ex-Service men in flax-scutching at Goole is under consideration.General. Shortage of houses, shortage of bricklayers, shortage of coal, the retention of skilled tradesmen with the Colours and a shortage of road-making materials are reported to be hampering industry in this division. The strike of ironfounders will have a serious effect, especially on the labourers and semi-skilled workers.Effects of Railway Strike.-The railway strike has produced for a time complete stoppage of traffic.  Workers are asking whether the strike means that the Government *
are inviting the Engineering Trade Employers to refuse to standardise war increases into rates. There is no indication of the engineering trade joining the strike, however. Responsible tramwaymen officials at Sheffield are opposed to &quot; sympathetic &quot; action. Coalmining in the division is being stopped on a large scale through shortage of wagons, and works are stopping through shortage of coal.North-Western.Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the 12th September shows a total decrease of 2,989 of whom 2,639 are men and 350 are women. The increase of 520 at Barrow is due to cessation of work on the Admiralty programme.Shortage of Labour. At Farnworth the cotton-weaving trade is very busy and there is great demand for women-weavers.Employment of Disabled Ex-Service Men. Engineers at Farnworth are doing every -thing possible to absorb disabled men. At Leigh, the Postmaster has promised to sub-stitute disabled men for women workers wherever possible and recommend them for permanency.General. Owing to the ironmoulders&apos; strike, engineering firms are discharging numbers of their workers. The prevailing impression on the Labour side is that the employers are exploiting the present situation for purposes of a lock-out. There is every indication that the executives of the unions other than the moulders may consider themselves forced to bring their men out in sympathy. It is generally felt in almost every industry that a big struggle between Labour and Capital is impending.The Railway Strike. Responsible trade union officials in this division suggest the calling of a National Industrial Conference, including representatives of the railwaymen and the Triple Alliance as the best way out of the present &quot;impasse.&quot;Northern.Unemployment. The live register shows a slight decrease of 333, which represents. 176 men and 157 women.  The industrial groups mainly affected by unemployment are  Engineering, Shipbuilding, Iron and Steel, Mining and Clerical.Shortage of Labour. The shortage of skilled blowers is so acute that two large glass-bottle plants at Blaydon and Southwick (Sunderland) respectively have entirely closed down.Shortage of Transport and Materials. Complaints still continue to be received regarding the delay caused by congestion of goods traffic at Newcastle and South Shields. Lack of iron rods is holding up the work of the Rivet, Bolt &amp; Nut Co., at West Hartlepool and the non-delivery of sections is retarding the production of Messrs. Douglas Bros., Blaydon.Training. A tailoring training centre will be opened at Newcastle at an early date.Neiv Developments -Messrs. Smith Patterson are erecting a new foundry at Blaydon, and Messrs. E. Mackley &amp; Co. are setting up a new machine shop at Gateshead. At West Hartlepool, Messrs. Boulin &amp; Co. are building a large basic-slag works for the production of chemical manure.General. The Output from the coal mines of Northumberland and Durham shows steady improvement. The stoppage of the ironmoulders is throwing a large number of labourers out of employment, and several foundries anticipate closing down.Effects of Railway Strike. There has been no decision in favour of sympathetic action, although the Newcastle Tramwaymen, the Newcastle Federation of Shipbuilding and En-engineering Trades and the Tees-side Dockers have met to discuss the situation. The prevailing feeling is that an outside party should be called in to mediate.Wales.Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the 12th September shows a total decrease of 714, consisting of a decrease of 847 men and an increase of 133 women. There have been increases at Cardiff, Merthyr, Newport and &quot;Swansea. The strike of the ironmoulders has thrown numerous labourers and others dependent on the moulders out of employment in South Wales. The water famine at Llanelly still continues and the position is serious.Shortage of Labour. A shortage of skilled labour, principally in the building trade, is reported. This, together with the lack of housing accommodation and transport difficulties is retarding industrial development.
Part VI.-Disputes. (a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.Building and Allied Trades.Joiners, N.W. Coast. Owing to the strike of joiners over a wages claim at St. Helens, Runcorn, Widnes and Frodsham, the National Conciliation Board refused to hear the applica-tion of the North-Western Counties Federation of Building Trades&apos; Operatives for a id. per hour advance to all grades, on the ground that the case could not be heard until the men resumed work pending the decision of the Board.About 400 joiners employed by the Furness Shipbuilding Company came out on strike at&quot; the end of last week over the question of allowances for delays in working during wet weather.Mining and Quarrying.Coal Mining, Ogmore Vale. About 1,350 men at the Wyndham No. 1 and No. 2 Pits, Ogmore Vale, came out on strike on the 24th inst. over a dispute regarding safety lamps. The dispute has since been settled. .Mill Close Lead Mine, Barley Dale.-A strike began at this mine eight weeks ago, when the miners objected to the method by which men to be dismissed were selected by the company, who, they allege, took the opportunity of discharging old men who would be unable to obtain work elsewhere. The Council of the Derbyshire Miners&apos; Association has now decided to increase the strike pay and have asked the lodges to supplement the amount paid by voluntary con-tributions.(C-1895) 2 general.-With reference to the railway strike, the attitude of the Government is generally approved and the hope is expressed in many quarters that the strike will &quot; clear the air.&quot; The ironmoulders&apos; strike has not taken effect in West Wales where the moulders are paid  1 per week more than the rate at Cardiff and Newport. Tt is now stated, however, that these men have struck in sympathy with the railwaymen. The situation in the tinplate trade has improved as a result of the Conciliation Board&apos;s award.f . Effects of Railway Strike. Some of the collieries have decided to stock coal. This will enable a number of mines to keep working. There is no work for dockers at Cardiff and Swansea docks.Scotland.Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the 12th September shows a total decrease of 321, 20 men and 301 women.Shortage of Labour. There is an unsatisfied demand for shipwrights, pattern makers and other skilled workers in this area. At Ayr the low rate of wages is keeping apprentices out of the building trade. From Inverness it is reported that certain employers in skilled occupations of the building type are hesitating to accept the interrupted apprenticeship scheme, and that in many cases the apprentices are throwing up their work on the plea of insufficient wages. Work is plentiful in the building trades, but the shortage of skilled labour and the high prices of materials are tending to retard operations. Lack of accom-modation in the Galashiels area is affecting the import.of women workers from other areas to meet the demand for labour in the hosiery and woollen mills.Shortage of Transport and Materials. Lack of travelling facilities is preventing an increase of employment in factories and shipbuilding yards at Falkirk. At Coatbridge, moulders and labourers are likely to be suspended owing to shortage of material. Scarcity of flax is affecting work at Johnstone. Shortage of wood prevents the starting of the barrel industry at Wick. At Leith, there is a shortage of iron and steel for the shipbuilding and shiprepairing trades.Employment of Disabled Ex-Service Men. At Ayr it was stated that practically all employers in the area had already their quota of 5 per cent, of disabled men. It was urged that an increase of training facilities was the only adequate solution of the problem.General-It is suggested that, as far as Scotland is concerned, the struggle between Capital and Labour is entering upon an ominous and decisive phase. With reference to the railway strike, interest chiefly centres in the use which the Government may make of their resources in the Army. The report in Glasgow that the railwaymen are not to be paid accrued wages due is creating a bad impression.
Metal, Engineering and Shipbuilding.Iropfounders. --The iron founders&apos; strike continues, and lias already caused considerable dislocation in other branches, of the engineering industry. It is reported that there is a feeling among the rank and file in the engineering shops that the ironmoulders should submit to having their claims adjudged by the Court of Arbitration. The three Trade Unions concerned the Friendly Society of Ironfounders, the Amalgamated Society of Coremakers and the Iron, Steel and Metal Dressers&apos; Trade Society issued a further statement last week in which they maintain that they are justified in striking, on the ground that the agreement made in February, 1917, with the Engineering Employers&apos; Federation, according to which awards by the Committee on Production and later the Court of Arbitration should be binding, was for the period of the war or for such further period as might be mutually agreed upon. No mutual agreement has been entered into, and therefore they maintain the agreement of February, 1917, automatically ceases to operate. The reply to this contention is that the three unions tacitly admitted, when they made their last claim to the Court of Arbitration, that they would accept its award ; and that while they have a right to withdraw from the agreement, they have no right to strike against an award which they tacitly pledged themselves to accept. It should be remembered that all the other engineering unions, have, in accordance with the agreement of 1917, which they regard as still being in force, preferred a claim, in the ordinary way, to the Court of Arbitration. Scottish ironmoulders have taken a ballot on the question of joining the strike ; and it is reported that the result shows a majority against taking strike action.Steel Workers, Doivlais. The continued strike of skilled iron and steel workers at Messrs. Guest, Keen and Nettlefold&apos;s works is causing distress which is expected to increase now that the discharge notices handed to the remaining 2,000 workers have expired. The employers offered to submit the case to arbitration and meanwhile to pay the skilled tradesmen  4 3s. 3d a week, any award, that is made to be retrospective from the date when work was resumed. The men refused to accept these terms declaring that the rates offered compare very unfavourably with those paid to skilled tradesmen in other South Wales works.Transport.Railwaymen. (See Part IV.) Woodworking.Furniture Trade Lock-Out.-A meeting of the Joint Industrial Council in the Furnishing Trades, held on the 26th inst., arranged terms of settlement which will enable a resumption of work to take place in the areas affected by the lock-out.Food, Brink and Tobacco.Baking, Ireland. The dispute in the Irish Bakery Trade has led to a lock-out of operative bakers in Londonderry from the 29th inst. The men rejected certain offers previously made by the master bakers and refused to submit the case to arbitration.Scotland. The Montrose bakers, who have been on strike for six weeks, are still out, and female and non-union labour has been secured to carry on their work.Agriculture. The strike of agricultural labourers in the Lichfield district has been settled, the men having returned to work on their former terms.(b) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.Building and Allied Trades.Hours. The application of the National Federation of Building Trades&apos; Operatives for a national 44-hour week came before the Conciliation Board last week and it was decided to establish a 44-hour week without reduction of pay to come into force on the ls,t May, 1920.Mining and Quarrying.Shale Oil Mining: Scotland. The dispute in the Scottish Shale Oil industry (see Report for week ending the 24th September, p. 275) became more serious at the end of last week when the Scottish Oils Company issued orders to shut down practically the whole of the shale mines in Midlothian and West Lothian. It is estimated that this will throw about 9,000 workers out of employment.Metal, Engineering and Shipbuilding.Shipbuilding Employees. A conference was held at Carlisle on the 19th September, between the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and the trade unions. The demand for a 44-hour week was deferred, but several questions arising out of the introduction of the 47-hour week last January were discussed. The conference also considered the question of amending the provisions of the agreement entered into for avoiding disputes during the war. These are held to be no longer applicable. It is proposed to amend these regulations and a mutual recom-mendation upon this matter will be sent to the men at an early date.
Tinplate Workers: South Wales. The threatened strike of tinplate workers was averted by the consent of the employers to extend the recent 12J per cent, award to day men, payment to date back to the day when the award came into operation. The settlement was reached at a meeting of the Joint Standing Committee of the Joint Industrial Council in the South &quot;Wales Tinplate Industry.Colliery Blacksmiths. Colliery blacksmiths in Scotland have refused to work overtime unless they are paid the regular overtime allowances, i.e., time and a half for overtime during the week and double time for Sunday work. It was decided to give 14 days&apos; notice of the deci-sion and, failing a settlement within that time, to call a strike.Textile.Spinning: Nottingham. In connection with the threatened strike of 1,300 spinners i employed by Messrs. W. Hollins &amp; Co., of Nottingham and Pleasley, the notices to strike are due to expire on the 8th inst., but it is anticipated that before that date both sides will agree to refer the question to arbitration (see Report for the week ending the 24th September, page 276.)Woolcombers. The Woolcombers have agreed to take a further ballot on the employers&apos; offer in regard to wages and overtime.Lace Makers. A dispute has arisen over the demand of operatives in England and Scotland for an increase in wages. An offer was made by the employers to grant a temporary advance of 20 per cent, until next March when an agreement at present in force in Scotland is due to terminate. This was rejected and a ballot is being taken to decide whether work shall cease on the 11th inst.Transport.Cargo Workers. At a conference held in London on the 25th September, applications were formulated for minimum rates of pay and standardised overtime rates for cargo workers in Great Britain. The minimum rate of pay demanded for all dock, wharf and riverside employees handling general cargo is 16s. a day.WoodworkingFurniture Trade.-Employees in the furnishing trade on the North-East Coast where the national lock-out has not applied have threatened to strike this week if they are not granted an increase of Qd. an hour.Pottery, Brick, etc., Trades.-The National Society of Pottery Workers have agreed to accept the offer of the British Pottery Manufacturers&apos; Association of a bonus of from 9 per cent, to 12 per cent, for the different grades in lieu of the 20 per cent, bonus all round demanded. The men, however, do not regard the acceptance as a final settlement of the dispute and intend to press for further concessions.R. S.
