This document is the property oi His Britannic Majesty s -Government &apos;40WAR CABINET.FUTURE EMPLOYMENT IN WARFARE OF POISON GASES.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.Copies of letters from the War Office to the War Cabinet on the above subject were circulated to the War Cabinet recently (G,T. 7976), and in a memorandum on the same question, by Mr. C. J. B. Hurst, circulated subsequently (G.T. 8119), it is stated in the last paragraph that &quot; if it is considered that from the military point of view Great Britain stands to gain by adopting the use of poison gas, steps should be taken to renounce the Land War Convention and the Declaration of 1907 . . .&quot;In this connection, I append a memorandum by the General Staff who are of opinion that Great Britain stands to gain by the use of gas and that steps should be taken to renounce the Convention and Declaration referred to above.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.mil September, 1919.MEMORANDUM BY THE GENERAL STAFF.The very cordial dislike that most persons feel towards the use of gas in war has arisen mainly from two causes ; they are (a.) Anger against the Germans for having wilfully and without any excusebroken the spirit of the Hague Convention; (b.) The secrecy that has necessarily veiled the whole subject during the war;this secrecy has concealed both what a powerful weapon it may become, andalso the fact (which will be shown later) that it has proved comparativelyhumane.From these two sources (i.e., indignation and ignorance) springs the widespread idea that gas is a particularly brutal weapon.We must first consider, however, what it is that constitutes a particularly brutal weapon; presumably it is one. which, in inflicting the necessary punishment to make an enemy sue for peace, causes an unusually high proportion of deaths, permanent injuries and individual suffering. British and American statistics confirm each other in showing that only 3 to 4 per cent, of gas casualties die, whereas at least 20 per cent, of all other casualties do so.Naturally statistics are harder to obtain regarding permanently injured, since they depend on different persons&apos; ideas of what constitutes a permanent injury, but there is no doubt whatever of the fact that permanent injuries due to gas are also very much less in proportion than those due to other weapons.Regarding individual suffering, it is not denied that this may be considerable in the worst cases among those gassed with certain, mostly out-of-date, gases, but then this is also the case with other wounds; in comparing the suffering caused by high explosive and gas, no doubt can be entertained that the latter is the more merciful, for quite apart from other considerations, it does not, like high explosives, remove limbs, break bones, give rise to nerves, or drive men mad.All who can approach the question with an open mind must surely agree therefore that our particular aversion to gas as a weapon has no foundations except on prejudice ; it should be remembered that the Germans have the same feelings regarding our Tanks.(B19/480)   70  9/19   H&amp;8  7518wo
The foregoing is of course, merely a justification for using gas should it he desirable, but the following are two positive reasons why we should reserve to ourselves the right to use gas ; they are : (a.) France and America, and as far as we know, all other nations worthy of count are continuing the study of gas and are reconstructing their gas warfare organization with the obvious intention of using gas in war when it suits them. Gas is a powerful weapon now and may well become very much more so. For us, alone among nations, to hold back would be an act of the most utter folly and nothing more or less than playing with the Nation&apos;s safety.(b.) Supposing even that we deny ourselves the use of gas until it has been used against us, even then in using it we should be contravening the Land War Convention and the Declaration of 1907, for presumably these documents make no exceptions in favour of a retaliatory use.In view of the above considerations, the only possible conclusion would appear to be that we should renounce the Land War Convention and the Declaration of 1907 in so far as they tie our hands in the matter of gas.
