IB IK lb&apos;:i &apos; SIfJF g6g LOKDOfl UNlvLRLSITY.G.T. 8209.^ -jl- -        Memorandum by the President, Board of Education.At the suggestion of the OhatiooHor of the Exchequer, I venture to bring before the War Oaoinot the question of providing a new site for the Head Quarters:of London University and for ]influencing&apos;a College..    The matter ia of great importance to the future of.the University and is very urgent because the option on the site under consideration expires on September 30th.Importance of       1.      The three principal non-local Universities in establishingja University    England are Oxford, Cambridge and London.     Oxford and Quarter inLondon. Cambridge must for long continue to be filled mainly from the English Schools, though of course they willtake in some students from our Overseas Dominions andfrom Foreign bountries.     There will, however, be manystudents from overseas fpr whom Oxford and Cambridgecannot provide and many who will wish to come to the university of $ha Imperial Capital in order to be near to the great NationalCollections and the great London Hospitals.     It is tc our national interest to attract as many of those students aspossible.   It was the view of the recent Royal Commission and itis mine also that it is of real importance that there should befor students in London, as there is in Paris, something in thenature of a University Qaurters.     The existence of a&apos; strikinggroup of academic buildings in the heart of the Metropolis and ina neighbourhood in which students and teachers could livom would go far to help the University to extend its influence and would  .be an cbvious advantage from an Imperial point of view.Advantagea of    2.      The Royal Commission and the Departmental the suggestedSite in       Committoe, with the: Right Hon. Sir George Murray as Bl^Kwiabury.Chairman, appointed to &quot;inquire as to the steps by which &quot;effect b$j11 be given to the s oho mo of the report of the &quot;Royal CommissionV considered the various alternatives - some of which still have, their advocates - and came to a unanimous conclusion...................................
I 0conclusion in favour ox&apos; the site in Bloomsbury, immodiately Worth of tho British liusoum.   This 3ite is central and accessible; it would bring the administrative Headquarters, of tho University next to its most important teaching institution, iao. University Collogo in Gowar Street, and would enable the almost equally important king College to be transferred there from its buildings in the Strand, which it has now outgrown.   It would bo in a cheap resident-ial quarter, suited to students: it would be quiet, would adjoin the British kaiseum and be near to the Record-Office.Pig Site is further capable of expansion as need may arisen     The grouping together of the University Head-? quarters, University College, ICingrs College and the British Museum would constitute the nucleus of a real University Quarterj3* The Government is under an obligation as regards the housing of London University.,   The University was in origin a Government conception and the Government has as a matter of fact provided accommodation for it throughout its history.;In acknowledging this in 1912 the late Prime Minister, in answer to a question in the House of Commons, refused to &quot; admit liability on the part of the Government for all possible requirements of tho University in the future&quot;,,The Government of course could not accept an unlimited liabilityf &quot;but it cannot be denied that there is a strong moral obligation to doal generously with the University,,Sir George. Muiray&apos;s Committee was satisfied that if tho Government wished to transfer the Site of the University to another part of London, the Government were bound to pro-vide a oits and to make arrangements which would not involve the University in financial loss.     It was contended by the University witnesses nearly 10 years ago that the existing accommodation at the Imperial Institute is - inadequate.
? of existing stics qnd price of new site. 4.The Head Quarters of tho University are now in the Imperial institute buildings at south Kensington. King&apos;s College is in the strand next to somerset House.

The Office of works estimate the rental value of the accomodation at the imperial institude buildings at £7,500 ana the capital value at £105,600. (This seems to be an unnecessarily low figure and probably  £150,000 or  £7,500 at 50 years purchase would be a fairer estimate).

The Office of works put the rental value of  King*s College at £14,000 end the present oapital value at £280,000.(The office of Works estimate of the value of this Site in tho open market is  £350,000 and with the buildings on it would be a good deal more).

The Office of Works estimates of the present value of the two sites accordingly amounts to  £385,000: if we value the imperial institute accommodation at 20 years purchase of tho rental of  ?,  the total would be 430,000.

The Site in ? which it is desired to obtain is on the Bedford Estate. The price which the Bedford trustees now want is not yet khownand they are unwilling to go to tho expense of a careful valuation unless the government seriously intend to buy. In 1913 it was understood that the price was a little over £450,000. It is not unlikely that negotiation,would secure some reduction of this figure. I have been informed that the Duke would be willing "on formal contract being signed and proper deposit paid, to allow the balance of the purchase money" to be paid in five annual instalments with interest at 3%. The duke is, Igather, anxious to sell to the Governnment, but having been left in uncertainty for a number of years insists on a definite decision by September 3oth.

If it is decided that the Government should require the site,provided that the terms aro not unreasonable.
I would suggest that Sir George Marray, who is familiar with the whole question, should to asked to negotiate with the Bedford trustees. I am personally convinced that, even should the price of the new Site exceed the estimated value -of the sites ? - as to which I am very doubtful - the  purchase is so much to the interest of University Education in this Country as to be a highly profitable investment.

I may add that the Chairman of the Treasury Committee on University Grants (Sir William Mc Cormick) is in entire agreement with me.
