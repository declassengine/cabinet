Confidential.Ireland: Policy of the Government.1. Pursuant to the reference made to us by the War Cabinet on April 16th, we have prepared the annexed Draft Bill on the lines of the policy laid down in the minutes of that meeting. We have also agreed to recommend to the War Cabinet certain modifications in points of detail.2. The Draft Bill provides, as was directed, for the exclusion of individual counties from the operation of the Home Rule Act unless 55 per cent, of the voters agree upon inclusion. After careful consideration of this proposal we are, however, opposed to the introduction of so obviously artificial a departure from the common principle of the decision of public questions by the vote of a majority, and we have embodied in the Draft Bill an alternative proposal for decision by a bare majority of the votes polled.  The reasons for this view we shall state presently.3. The following is a concise statement of the principal proposals in the Bill: (a) The introduction of Home Rule with as little delayas possible throughout Nationalist Ireland.(b) A poll  by counties of  the six Ulster counties ofAntrim, Armagh, Down, Londonderry, Tyrone, Fermanagh, (including the boroughs of Derry, Belfast, and Newry) described as the &quot; excluded counties&quot; in the Draft Bill to be taken within a specified period after the war with a view to the incorporation in the Home Eule area of any county where a majority of the voters shall support inclusion, and to be repeated after a period of not less than seven or more than ten years if there shall still be at that time an excluded area.(c) The establishment of a &quot; Council of Ireland &quot; in whichthe excluded area will be represented by its Members of Parliament and the rest of Ireland by an equal number of members nominated by the Irish Parliament, with a President agreed upon by the members or nominated by the Crown, which 199-1 A
Council, voting in panel, will have power, speaking broadly (i) to. pass private Bill legislation affecting both the included and the excluded area ;(ii) to recommend to the Crown the extension to the excluded area by Order in Council of any Bill or Act of the Irish Parliament;(iii) to agree to the inclusion under the Home Rule Act of the whole of Ireland, subject to the assent of a majority of the voters in the excluded area, power to be vested in the Crown in that case to extend the Act to all Ireland by Order in Council, unless either House of Parliament has declared its dissent;(iv) to consult and make recommendations upon Irish questions, including the amendment of the Home Rule Act (as ultimately passed into law).(d) The reservation to the Crown of power to appoint a judgeor judges of the High Court for the service of the excluded area, to sit continuously in Belfast as well as to hear appeals from subordinate jurisdictions, and the maintenance of a right of appeal from the High Court to a Court of Appeal in which the Crown will appoint the judges, and in the last resort to the House of Lords (sections 15, 16, and 17).(e) The grant to every person now resident or carrying on business in the excluded area of the personal privilege of electing to ;be subject to British courts and not to Irish courts, and of a title to indemnity out of public funds for any damage which may result directly to him from legislative, administrative or popular interference with his existing rights (section 4).(/) A parliamentary guarantee to the Home Rule area of an annual grant from the Consolidated Fund for purposes of development such as are dealt with by Part I. of the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act, 1909 (section 13).4. The proposal to make the exclusion of counties from the Home Rule area dependent on the vote of a 55 per cent, majority   seemed  to  us   to invite  the   criticism   that  an
apparently trifling departure from ordinary constitutional pro-cedure was proposed for the transparent purpose of enabling a minority in Tyrone and Fermanagh to decide the issue in those counties. Further, we had reason to believe that the suggestion of a 55 per cent, majority was equally unpopular with all parties in Ireland. In these circumstances it seemed to be undesirable to suggest a procedure which, besides being contrary to the usual practice of elections in the United Kingdom, would appear to have been devised to produce, if not to stereotype, a particular political result.5. We have described the Council of Ireland as a body which will &quot; vote in panel.&quot; This phrase is used to designate shortly a method of voting which is explained at greater length in clauses 15 and 17 of the First Schedule to the Bill. It is there provided that each of the representative groups in the Council shall have one collective vote, to be exercised according to the wishes of the majority in the group. The reason for the proposal is manifest.6. As an alternative to the group of privileges for minorities or individuals in the areas included after the passing of the Act, which are to be found in clause 4 of the Draft Bill, we discussed the suggestion of a privilege of a more comprehensive kind, namely, that a dissentient upon registering himself as such should be left in all respects, except those relating to municipal adminis-tration, subject to British law, British tribunals, and British taxation in the same way as though he had remained a resident in the excluded area. Such a far-reaching provision would no doubt be regarded by these classes of persons as more advantageous than that in the Draft Bill. It would probably provoke objection on the part of Nationalists, and it would necessitate an elaborate adjustment of accounts in order to safe-guard the Irish Exchequer against loss of revenue. It may, however, be worthy of consideration in the last resort if further inducement be required.7. We have found it difficult to devise proposals which would commend this Bill to those who have severely criticised the Home Rule Act on the grounds of finance. Clause 13 would no doubt be more acceptable if it were to embody a statutory minimum grant than if it merely guaranteed a rateable sum proportionate to any grant which might be expended in Great Britain.   The field of education appeared199 A 2
at first to be one in which existing conditions would have made a grant in aid very welcome to the Irish Nationalists to help them to deal promptly with a grave Irish problem. We have reason to believe, however, that a fund ear-marked as a means of educational reform in Ireland would be an embarrassment to the Nationalist members by reason of the controversial questions that it would raise. We have therefore not embodied any such proposal in the Draft Bill.8, We have felt that the Council for Irish affairs which is proposed in the Draft Bill would perhaps receive a warmer welcome if it were designated by a name more suggestive of authority and of a national identity than the &quot;Irish Council&quot; (the title which was suggested to us by a number of repre-sentative gentlemen in Ulster), &quot;The Council of Ireland&quot; and &quot; The Irish Representative Council&quot; are names which have occurred to us.  We have adopted the former of these.9. We have drawn up this Draft Bill in the belief that, should it be fortunate enough to receive a Second Reading in the House of Commons, it will then be referred, along with the Home Rule Act of 1914, to a Commission or Conference, with instructions to draw up a new Bill, as already promised, in amendment of that Act for submission to Parliament. The fortunes of the Draft Bill will in our opinion depend very much upon the terms in which any such reference is made. If the Draft Bill were referred alone without the concession of a power to propose amendments in the Home Rule Act, much disappointment, would probably be caused, and it is doubtful if any practical result would ensue. If, on the other hand, the Act be referred, together with the Draft Bill, there would seem to be a fair chance of evolving a reasonable and acceptable scheme.May 8,1917.C. or K. H. E. D. C. A.
