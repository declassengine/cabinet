This document is the property oi His Britannic Majesty s GovernmentPrinted for the use of the Colonial Office.   November, 1907.Mediterranean, No 65.CONFIDENTIAL.CONDITION OF CYPRUS.MEMORANDUM BY MR. CHURCHILL.Sir F. Hopwood, Lord Elgin,I am concerned about the condition of Cyprus, which I have just left, after a short but crowded visit.I had not realized that we have drawn from this island, exhausted as it was by 300 years of Turkish misgovernment, upwards of 1,800,000?. since our occupation thirty years ago.The impression which I had formed was that Cyprus was kept going by a more or less generous grant-in-aid from the Exchequer. The methods of accounting favour that view, and it is, I believe, the idea which almost everybody holds. But it is quite erroneous. By the Convention of 1878 we bound Cyprus to pay a tribute to the Sultan of 92,800?. ri his Convention was made for our own purposes, because it was then thouglit a matter of high military importance to have a place of arms and strategic base in the Levant, whence Egypt and Constantinople could be surveyed. The Cypriotes were not consulted by us in fixing the amount of the tribute. They never agreed to it, and it was fixed upon the basis of what Turkey declared she had been able to screw out of the island by regular Turkish methods. We were anxious, however, to have the island, and could not afford, or did not care, to boggle about the terms, particularly as they affected only other people&apos;s interests. Reviewing this original transaction, I cannot help thinking it improper. I do not think that we ought ever to have consented to make ourselves the agents of collecting the hatefully oppressive taxes by which the Turk has crushed and ruined so many of his tributary provinces. But that is only half the transaction.It happened by chance that just about the same time as our occupation of the island began the Sultan repudiated the Turkish Debt of 1855, of which Great Britain and France were joint guarantors, and which was secured on the revenues of the Turkish Empire. Here in Cyprus at least was one portion of those revenues which we could seize. We therefore intercepted the whole tribute, and devoted the money to the service of the repudiated loan. No doubt, from our point of view, this was a con-venient arrangement. But was it an honest or moral action ? Observe the consequences. Cyprus had no more to do with, and was no more consulted upon, the extension of the Anglo-French guarantee to the 1855 Loan than she was consulted about her tribute to Turkey. The 1855 Loan was guaranteed by the two Great Powers for reasons of high policy utterly unconnected with Cyprus. It is to he presumed that Great Britain acted in British interest alone in according that guarantee. Certainly Great Britain, and no one else, was responsible for her share in the event of default. She had and has no more right to make Cyprus contribute towards the discharge of that purely British obligation than to make Ceylon or any small independent State which could be coerced by force of arms. But this is what she has done. The Turk has never received a penny of the tribute, and in that respect the Convention of 1878 is, in fact, utterly evaded. Yet Cyprus has been made to pay all the same, and the money has come to us, and has been used by us to defray an integral part of purely British expenditure.From the point of view of ^Cyprus, the case looks very ugly. The Cypriotes see that we have bound them, for our own reasons, to pay an inordinate tribute to the Sultan. They see that we have various debts of our own to pay ; and they observe that instead
of even fulfilling the Treaty instrument by which they were so improperly bound, we take their money all the same and keep it for ourselves. Can we wonder at their feelings ?It is quite true that under the burden which we had placed on this small and impoverished island the Cypriot people collapsed. Although the most grinding economies were enforced, although all public works were neglected and the whole administration cut down to starvation point, we never succeeded, any more than the Sultan, in squeezing out of them the whole tribute of 92,800/. ; and, in consequence of this, we proceeded to treat Cyprus as if she were a non-self-supporting Protectorate. She passed under the most rigid Treasury control. The fruit of all economies, however self-denying, every surplus, however pitifully small, was seized at the end of each financial year; the difference between the amount collected and the cost of the administration and the whole tribute together was then voted as a -grant-in-aid, and the accounts were presented to Parliament in a form which would lead any person to suppose that we were actually keeping Cyprus going out of British money. This iniquitous and immoral arrangement lasted for twenty-seven years, during which time we succeeded in extracting from this wretched island about 60,000/. a-year on the average, or about 1,600,000/. altogether.At the beginning of 1906 the Colonial Office drew the attention of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the lamentable condition of the island, to its slow progress under British rule, to the intolerable financial trammels in which it was held, and to the vicious system by which every local surplus or local economy only went to reduce tbe total of the grant-m-aid. The Chancellor then consented and it was a liberal concession to give what the Treasury call &quot; a fixed grant-in-aid of 50,000/. a-year,&quot; so that all economies or surpluses secured on that basis should enure to the profit of the -island. In other words, we promised Cyprus that we would not make her contribute towards the payment of purely British debts more than 42,800/. in any one year. And this is the arrangement now in force, though be it not forgotten, lest generosity should go too far, it is an arrangement limited in its duration to three years.I do not underrate the relief thus afforded. It is real, it is effective, and there will be a sensible and substantial easement and improvement in the situation so long as it continues. But the fact stares me none the less in the face that we have no right Avhatever, except by force majeure, to take a penny of the Cyprus tribute to relieve us from our own just obligations, however unfortunately contracted. There is scarcely any spectacle more detestable than the oppression of a small community by a great Power for the purpose of pecuniary profit; and that is, in fact, the spectacle which our financial treatment of Cyprus at this moment indisputably presents. It is in my opinion quite unworthy of Great Britain, and altogether out of accordance with the whole principles of-our colonial policy in every part of the* world, to exact tribute by force from any of the possessions or territories administered under the Crown. Let the figures be juggled by any sophistry or artifice within the wit of man, these two root-facts remain that Cyprus pays 42,800/. a-year, and that Great Britain receives 42,800/. a-year for her own benefit, namely, to pay a portion of her own debts. And that, I say, constitutes a blemish upon Imperial policy of a peculiarly discreditable kind.How different is the fate of Cyprus from that of any other island or Protectorate administered under the Colonial Office ! To many of them we give large grants-in-aid  to Somaliland 76,000/. a-year all dead loss to us, all clear gain to them. We are usually delighted to find them self-supporting. From none do we exact any payment, unless it be some contribution to the expense of the local garrison, by which they are defended, and by which they largely profit. But Cyprus, which came to us ruined and prostrate from centuries of horrible ill-usage : Cyprus which not only has never received a penny from us, but supports itself out of its own resources, and has contributed towards the payment of our debts a sum now amounting to 1,800,000/., wrung out of her year by year at the cost of suffering and stagnation : Cyprus, because, forsooth, she cannot pay us more than 42,800/. a year, is stigmatized as a pauper community living upon grants-in-aid.Nor is the hardship less apparent if Cyprus be considered not in its aspect as an island for which we are responsible, and which is administered as if it were a British Colony, but rather as one of those enfranchised provinces of the Turkish Empire. Compare proportionately the payment actually extracted from Cyprus, for our benefit, with the tribute adjudged to Turkey by international agreement from Egypt, from Samos, from Eoumelia, above all, from Crete. Crete pays only 5,000/. a year. Cyprus pays Great. Britain annually a sum of money which in proportion to revenue is
equivalent to 34,000,000?. a-year paid by Great Britain. How the place has ever managed to pull through and to progress at all with this hideous drain going on is amazing; and the fact constitutes a decisive proof at once of the virtues of British administration and of the intrinsic value of the island.It may be urged in defence of the existing system that we are only in temporary occupation of Cyprus, that we have no real responsibility towards its people except within the conditions of the Convention of 1878, and that if and when Russia restores Kars and other places in Asia Minor to Turkey, we are bound by Treaty to restore Cyprus to the Sultan too. This argument may be used for what it is worth, which is not much, in the face of Lord Salisbury&apos;s virtual promise to the Cypriots that they should never be given back to Turkey. But seriously I ask whether it is honest to go on spoiling the islanders by forms of diplomatic fiction, under an international instrument which both Contracting Parties have openly and regularly violated and ignored. We have now been a long time in Cyprus. Next year is the thirtieth since the occupation. We have contracted many obligations there, and connections have grown and are growing every day. We cannot give the island back to Turkey ; Europe and the House of Commons would never tolerate such a retrocession. Are we going to give it to Greece 1 I know of no such question, and I should deeply regret it being raised. If that were done, the lives of the Moslems in the island, who constitute more than a fifth of the population, and who have always behaved to us with the utmost loyalty and good conduct, would be rendered utterly intolerable, and they would all be oppressed or frozen out, just as in the old days the Greeks suffered. What other Power can be concerned ?That the abandonment of Cyprus would force us to make provision for the payment of our own debts to the extent of 42,800?. a-year would not grieve me; but the useless sacrifice of so much effort by British officials, the fruitless employment of so many years, the weak admission of failure either to revive the country or to reconcile the people, involved in a cession, would make a melancholy episode in British history, and would be deservedly unpopular in England. Every one knows that there is no present intention of altering the international status of Cyprus, and that we mean to go on occupying it indefinitely ;tand, in that case, surely it is time to drop the theory that we have only indirect responsibilities there, and that we have a right to do to Cypriotes things we would not dream of doing to our own fellow-subjects in any part of the British Empire. Let us recur to simple and sound foundations. Let us have only one measure for treating people subject to our rule, and that a measure of justice. Let us leave to the Island of Cyprus the whole of the revenues which are raised by the taxation of its people, to be expended on its own development, and to restore its once famous prosperity. Let us pay our own debts ourselves out of our own money. And let us choose next year, the thirtieth of our occupation, for that act of equity and reparation. . &apos; &apos;The present condition of the island is most unsatisfactory. I do not mean that it has not greatly progressed under our rule, still less that it is not incomparably better off than it would have been under Turkey; nor, indeed, that the Cypriotes themselves, Moslems and Christians alike, do not admit and recognize these facts. But an improvement upon Turkish standards is not a sufficient or suitable defence for British policy. The economic improvement and recovery of the island have been vastly extended. The annual drain, averaging between 20 and 30 per cent, of the total revenue, which has gone out of the island every year without any sort of return, has, when added to the necessarily costly character of high-class British administration, effectively prevented anything like a rapid recovery. The patient has not died on our hands ; she has, indeed, grown slowly and steadily stronger through the long period of convalescence. But if her native energies had not been tapped from year to year, she would long ago have been strong and healthy, and if those energies were set free to-morrow, the prosperity of Cyprus would soon be established, without costing Great Britain a single penny, and even without forcing her to disgorge the large sums already extorted.But meanwhile every necessary work is cramped. Education, bridges, harbours, roads cramped. Education, bridges, harbours, roads, the salaries of struggling and almost starving officials, the development of agriculture (including cotton and silk), the provision of the perfectly justifiable and urgently needed railway branches to the line now working between Famagusta and Morphou, and above all the reafforestation of the island which has been incredibly neglected, and upon which the beauty and comfort of life, the averaging of the rainfall, and the provision of fuel depend all, all are restricted, and unjustifiably restricted, within arbitrary and unnatural limits.
Wherever there is economic injustice there will also be found political discontent. Whenever one community uses another as if it were a milch-cow there will inevitably be ill-feeling and estrangement. It is idle for the tribute-taking Power to look for gratitude from the people taxed against their will, whatever the honesty or efficiency of her actual government. The Cypriotes know we make money out of them. They know that, quite apart from the salaries of the British officials charged with the administration, there is an immense annual payment to be made to some Power across the sea, and that it is the extortion of this sum which year after year prevents this or that sorely needed and earnestly desired enterprise or indulgence. They know we are living on them, and that, in spite of our wealth, we are prepared to use our strength to squeeze out of the island every year what is to them a maiming, crippling toll. And while that goes on all the achievements of British administration, skill and fidelity, even when contrasted with the bygone tyranny of the Turks, fail to establish any claim on the hearts of the people. Everywhere I went I was received by the Greek population, who are four-fifths of the islanders, with Greek flags and Greek songs, with passionate appeals.to British magnanimity and Liberal traditions, to allow them \o be united with Greece, and to &quot; set them free; &quot; and if the Moslems protest against these Greek demonstrations, which are every year becoming more violent, it is only because they know that union with Greece means their ruin, not because they do not feel the same economic pinch from present conditions. Things cannot go on as they are. It is futile for British visitors to go about complaining of Cypriot &quot; ingratitude.&apos;&apos;&quot; Look behind the symptom, touch the cause.It is -well worth our while to make a success of Cyprus. Politically it is one of the countries where British methods are, so to speak, on trial before the tribunal of Europe. Great and signal success in Cyprus, as in Egypt, invests the British name with dignity and even lustre in the eyes, of the world. Failure involves equally notorious discredit. But from a purely material standpoint it is well worth our while to make a success of Cyprus, and easily within our power. I observe that we spend nearly 80,000/. a-year on the Somaliland Protectorate, which is almost totally unproductive ; and even in other countries, now fed by grants-in-aid, there are highly speculative elements. But Cyprus is a certainty. We know that the island is already not only self-supporting, but able to contribute to our necessities a substantial sum. We know that in the fifteenth century, under conditions of production which were not scientific, the population of Cyprus was over 1,000,000, or more than four times its present number, and that one single wealthy city, Salamis, now only a melancholy ruin, once contained a population of 250,000. It is not a question of creation, but of revival; and if the natural revenues of the island are allowed to be devoted to the necessary public works-and scientific organization, this revival will assuredly take place with startling rapidity. Not only will Great Britain be vindicated by another good work of recuperation, but we shall find a more material reward in the preservation of a valuable area for British administrative capacity, and in the steady growth of trade connections. Whether the change which I propose would have the effect of dissipating&apos; the aspirations towards Greek national unity, which are beginning to cause so much disturbance, and will cause more, I cannot tell; but at any rate, with the injustice of the tribute removed, the material interests of the islanders would be enlisted on our side, and, without wishing to disparage their sincerity, I would trust a good deal to that.In any case we should have done our duty, and have freed ourselves from a position which is morally, politically, and economically indefensible.1 purposely avoid at this stage going into the details of the new settlement. I think, however, that next year, as the thirtieth anniversary of our occupation, is clearly marked as the occasion. 1 dare say that the Cypriotes could be induced to vote once and for all a certain annual sum, not exceeding 10,000/., as a return for value received in British protection ; but such a contribution would have to be a free-will offering. I am inclined to think that the revenue fund should also be made available for local purposes; but I would not weaken in any way the Governors existing control over the whole range of policy and finance. The forms of the Treaty of 1878 should not, if possible, be departed from. The tribute might either be collected and restored pro forma through the operation of an equivalent grant-in-aid, or else the grant-in-aid would simply disappear; the island would be recognized as self-supporting, and the charge for the service of the 1855 Loan would have to be increased by something like 35,000/. a-year. Tins is the sting. But I am unable to see why we are more entitled to repudiate or forcibly transfer that portion of our obligations than any other.W. S. C.
