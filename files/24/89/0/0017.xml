This document is the property ot, His Britannic Majestys (Government39WAR CABINET.INSURANCE OP OFFICERS AGAINST DISABLEMENT.MEMOEANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOE WAE.When the new rates of Pay for Officers of the Army &quot;were under consideration     48 by the Cabinet (W.C. 616 (1)), the Minister of Pensions suggested that their Gea-$0\ publication should be accompanied by a notice that a scheme was in contemplation whereby officers would be required to insure themselves against disablement.The suggestion has been carefully considered, and while I recognize that the scheme in itself may be sound and advisable, I am strongly of opinion that, if it is adopted, it should apply to the other Services as well as the Army, and that the announcement of the scheme should not be made by the War Office.The new rates of pay for both the Navy and the Air Force were published without reservation, and if the publication of the new rates for the Army had been accompanied by such a notice it would have had a very unfortunate effect. On applying to all the Services, the announcement could be made either by the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer or the Minister of Pensions.The Minister of Pensions based his proposal on the fact that the new rates of pay give officers a &quot; living wage.&quot; The same consideration applies to &quot; other ranks,&quot; and it is assumed that they could be included in any scheme.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.24th September, 1919.(B19/431)   70  9/19- HAS  7519wo
