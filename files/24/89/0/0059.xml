\;\t 8259      JsojJ &quot;TRSSS K^OISTMIO&apos;7&apos;.^.^^iS?lesorandum by tha Minister of Health, , i,      I sia desirous to obtaining the sanction cf the Cabinetto the introduction, in November, of a ii ill for the Registration of Fursee.      The subject has been on several occasions before Parliament, and, for several years east.     This year a &quot;Private Member5 s Bill passed through nil its stages but one in the House of, Commons;   and &amp; rival isili on seme what different lines promoted.by the Qoliege of ?&apos;ursin.;; obtained a second reading in the House of lords.&apos;.   The subject has always been a matter of acute controversy, w\ the result of various discussions this year hae mt.de it unmistakeably pi..in to everyone concerned that the problem will not be solved except by a Government -bill, jjoth of the contending sections of opinion have now urged that the Government should pass the requisite measure.   The registra-ticn of nurses is an.extremely important element in the attain-ment of a more eatisfaatcry s.irid efficient standard of nursing; the latter being an essential element in any real improvement of existing medical services, particularly for the industrial popula-tion.   It is a reform that is ten years overdue.    Many results of medical and nursing work during the war have rendered this legislation doubly necessary.2,      How that each of the rival factions has realised unmistakeably that a Bill drawn specially to suit either of their particular predileotions cannot be got through parliament, there is real ground for hoping that a Government bill will meet with no responsible opposition;   and 1 should of course only bring it in if I had previously, after full discussion of its provisions with the leaders of both sections of opinion, and with Members of Parliament, obtained a sufficient indication of agreement, to make the requisite support in both Houses a practical certainty.    But it would be highly inexpedient that I should proceed now to get to close quarters in negotiations with the
3 7 Stwo sections unless I were able to state authoritatively that I have Government sanction for introducing a Bill promptly in the event of my being able to satisfy the Government of its passing Hithout material expenditure of time.3.        I need not trouble the Cabinet with details of the measure beyond saying (i) that i should propose to confine it within the smallest possible compass;   (ii) that it would merely set up a suitably composed Registration Council, on whom should be conferred by the Bill the responsibility for working out suitable Regulations, subject to the approval of the liinistry of Health, for the registration of nurses;   thus avoiding the discussion of highly technical details of nursing work, and training,&apos;and the conflicting personalia of the nursing world, in the unsuitable arena of the House of Commons;   and (iii) that I should deal only with England and Wales;   leaving Scotland and Ireland to follow suit on their own lines.,4.        One of the points on which there has been some division of opinion is as to the finance of the Registration Council.   It is desired in some quarters that it should be wholly self-supporting; i.e, either that it should be partly financed by same rich tutside body, like &quot;the College of Nursing, Limited;   or else that the fees to be exacted by the Council from nurses desiring to be registered should be high enough to ensure an adequate income for fulfilling all the functions to be conferred upon the Council.     I think that the latter would only be possible by exacting a higher fee than the Government can properly think of allowing to be imposed, and the former is certainly inadmissible in a national Scheme.   It may, therefore, be necessary to su-opleinent the Council&apos;s income from fees by a grant from the Ministry of Health to meet suoh deficit as may arise from year to year;   this would be quite a small sum on the Vote of the Ministry, for the expenditure cf the Council would be restricted   to lines previously approved by the Ministry with Treasury sanction.5. I ask, therefore, sanction to make an authoritativestatement that the Minister of Health will introduce a Bill for the
Registration&apos;of Nurses as early as possible in November, in the event of finding it possible, beforehand, to obtain sufficient agreement amongst those most concerned in the subject.C. AHOISON. 1.10.19,
