? The question was referred to as to the future of the Board&apos;s work in the area especially in view of the statement made in the House of Commons reported in the Public Press. The Committee felt strongly that whatever new authority was constituted the direct Control Area should be carried on as hitherto by the State, having regard to the improvoments in the conditions of drunkenness since the acquisition by the Board of the Licensed Premises, the Committee feels that it would be a great calamity if such direct control were abandoned, and they recommend the Board to convey this expression of opinion to the proper quarters.

Proposed Commission on Liquor Control.

The Rev. Mr. Peebles referred to the position of this Committee in view of the proposed, constitution of a Commission to take the place of the Central Control Board and after discussion the following resolution was agreed to, viz: "The Committee are of opinion (First) that it is in the public interest that the Direct Control in all those areas which have been acquired by the State should continue without prejudice to the operation of the Scottish Temperance Act (1913) and (Second) that before the proposed Commission is finally constituted it is desirable that the views of this Committee and other Licensing Authorities in the District should be obtained and they recommend that immediate steps should be taken to have a Conference of these bodies convened on an early date".
