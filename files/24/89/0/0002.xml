&apos; /This Donnm^nt to the Property ofHis 8 n tan hi&apos;- tftijes y&apos;s Government.)HEklORANOT BT. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE. COLONIES. MfflQNS. PLANT  FOR  australia the question of the disposal of some of our surplus munition plant to the Commonwealth of Australia has been under consideration for a long time and now requires a decision fromthe Cabinet.   The matter was first brought to my notice in a-letter of the 1st July from Senator Pearce, the Australian-Minister for Defence, who is now in England, of which thefollowing are the material passages&quot;The Commonwealth Government are desirous of making pro-vision for the manufacture of Munitions of War in Australia, so m to be, as far as possible, self- suf-Ticient. \During the treat War now ended - owing to the existence in Australia of a cordite factory, a small armseemmition factory, arid small arms factory, we were able to supply the sister Dominions of New Zealand and-South Africa with cordite, small arms ammunition and some rifles, and we were also able to assist in some small way a few of the Crown Colonies in this regard.It is obvious, therefore, that it is not only to the interests of Australia, but to the Empire generally,that situated as Australia is in the Southern Hemisphere, she would provide an excellent depot for the supplying of munitions of war in case of conflict, to those parts of the British Empire in that Hemisphere, in the event of interruption (partial or otherwise) of sea traffic.The Government of the United Kingdom has for dis--;-7::.r::;.:7.^...;--.y 7-7/:&apos;;&apos;.7i-;7.&apos;-.77V:;--:7-:7&apos;&apos;,;.&apos;\ii8-^71-&apos;-:-;-:77 7-777 77777. ;7/7.-\ ;77y7V7.:7^77 ;77;7777-77\;y; :^&apos;;7&apos;-;:!t77.&apos;/ 7/77&apos;&apos;&apos;777-c7:y7777:;:&apos;7&apos;&apos;7;&apos;posal, large quantities of munitions-making plant, which at the present time, it is disposing of through the-Ministry
Ministry of Lurutionsj   end owing to the fact that a quan-tity of this plant is of a special character suitable only for munitions making; I presume that much of it will bo disposed of at prabtieally &quot;scrap-values on the public market.I wish to bring before you, for your consideration, rind would be glad if you would take action to bring the matter before the Government &amp;  the United Kingdom, the proposition that certain portions of this plant shall be made, available to tho Commonwealth Government, either as a gift from the Government of the United Kingdom, or at least on very easy terms.    I attach a list shewing you details of the. plant that would be useful and accept-able in this regard, a copy of which I am alsc sending tc Lord Inverforth, 1.inister fof Munitions.I may mention,, that Ix, Hughes (our Prime Minister) lias already brought this matter under the notice of your Prime Minister (HtJIon^Lloyd George) c&quot;On. receipt cf this letter, I comniunioatod with the Minister ox wnjiitions, with a view to finding out mora^pi-etriseby what were the requirements Of the Australian Government and how far we wore able to supply them,As,a result of the consultation which has since taken place between the Ministry of Lunitions and officers of the Australian Government, I am now informed by 3kr. Pearce that, while Lord Inverforth estimates that the total Australian re-quirements in plant would oosb  600,000 or more, he is. satisfied that a plant of a value of half that amount,  30(3,000, would go far towards satisfying the present Australian progranne.    With regard to&quot;the latter, I have now received the following proposi-tion from Mr. Pearce, in a letter dated the 16th September:-M am anxious before r leave England next week, to carry .with me a definite proposition from the Imperial G-overnmontand
00and I therefore surest that some arrangement like the following.might be considered by the War Cabinet;-(1)   That the Imperial Government be prepared to place at the disposal of the Australian Government, Munitions Plant of the &quot;fair disposal value&quot; of  300,000.(2)   That as to what constitutes &quot;fair disposal value&quot; be agreed subsequently between representatives of the Ministry of Munitions, and of the Avstralian Government, and, that failing agreement, the matter be referred to the Colonial Office for submission to the V7ar Cabinet,(3)(a) That in consideration of the Australian Government installing the Munitions Plant herein referred to in Government Munitions Factories, it shall be presented to Australia as a free*gift;   or, alternatively,(b) That it shall be transferred to Australia at atprice being &quot;fair disposal value&quot;- less......per cent,(Insert-here the discount the Imperial Government is pre-paired to allow).You will see from this.that I have limited myself to Plant worth E300,000, and that it is simply for decision by the Government as-to how far.it is prepared to assist , Australia.It is unnecessary for me to stress how important it is to the welfare of the Empire that the willingness of the people of Australia to contribute their share towards Defence, should be  necessarily&amp;uraged.    Their recent services sufficiently demonstrate this, and I on sure will be -accented as acknowledgment that those services have been appreciated,- if the suggestion,in 3(a) can be given effect to&quot;.The
mThe question which the Cabinet will have to decide is whether they are prepared to male any atateraent on the price ef the Lunitions plant which -ray be supplied to the Australian Government.    This is of. course a question of policy which I cannot myself decide,    At the same time I am anxious to give an answer to llrc Pearoo before he leaves for Australia next week.    My own view is that it would be good policy to let the Australian Government have the Lunitiond plant it absolutely requires on easy terms, if indeed we ere not prepared to make thorn a present of it,,    The price put upon it by the Minister of Lunitions i3 no doubt its estimated full value in the market *    Only the Minister of fentions can say whether, if the Australian Government does not acquire the plant, we are; in fact, likely to find other , p-ui^hassrs&apos; at the value put upon it. I should have thoughtmyself that this was rather doubtful,    But,bs. that as it may, it seems tc me that, taking a &quot;broad view of the question, and regarding not only the actual value of the material but the iirportanoe of its destination, we should do well to dispose of in to the Government of Australia, even if we do so at a figure rather less than, what we may or may not get in the open market.-   77 Q &quot;10X ,  tj J c J- * fi
