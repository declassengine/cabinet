(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;sGovernment).CONFIDENTIAL*RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SCOTTISH OFFICE FOR ^r^rQUESTIONS AFFECTING AGRICULTURAL LABOUR IN SCOTLAND.\(MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR)* \ &quot;&apos; &apos; &quot;***&apos; &quot; &quot;***&quot;        T&quot; &quot; &quot;&apos;&apos;G.T.8282. .cjXi^/?&apos;/;: / n oN^Tne memorandum on this subject by the Secretary for Scotland (G.T.8230 dated 20.9.19.) proposes that &quot;all administrative duties relating to agricultural labour in Scotland should be allocated to the ccottish Board.&quot;A similar memorandum by the President of the Board of Agriculture (G.T.8158 dated 15.9.19.) proposed that &quot;all administrative duties relating to agricultural labour in England and -ales should be explicitly allocated to the Board of Agriculture.&quot;   The arguments set out in my memorandum of 23.9.19. (G.T.8219) with regard to Lord Lee&apos;s proposals apply equally to the proposal of the Secretary for Scotland.The fourth paragraph of the memorandum by tho Secretary for Scotland appears to suggest that the Scottish Office should deal with questions affecting building labour as well as agricultural labour.   In my opinion it is highly undesirable that yet another Department should handle building labour questions. These are now dealt with by the Ministry of Labour through an Interdepartmental Committee, namely, the Building. Labour Committee, on which the ministry-of Health and other Departments interested in building labour in general, and housing in particular are represented,   sages matters in the building trade are at present in a difficult position, and it would be dangerous to attempt a separate administration for Scotland.(Signod)     R.S.Horne.
