MEMORANDUM TO WAR CABINET.I circulate herewith, for the information of the Cabinet a report addressed to the United States Secretary for War by the American Aviation Mission, which, headed by the United States Assistant Secretary for War, has recently visited England, France and Italy.The Mission give in their report an account of air organisation in Great Britain, France and Italy, and make a comparison wholly favourable to our own organisation &quot; which has resulted in placing her &quot; (Great Britain) &quot; well in the lead in practically every phase of aerial development.&quot;The Mission recommend : &quot; The concentration of the air activities of the United States, military, naval, and civilian, within the direction of a single government agency created for the purpose, co-equal in importance with the departments of War, Navy and Commerce.&quot; The powers and organisation which they propose for this Ministry are closely analogous to those of the British Air Ministry.In supporting the creation of a Ministry of Air the Mission lay stress on the needs of civil aviation. Without central organisation and State aid they consider that the aircraft industry of the United States is in danger of extinction, and they hold that without a civil air service as a nucleus of personnel and material no nation can hope to maintain air supremacy in war. They recommend that the Ministry of Air should arrange routes, maintain air stations for civil use, maintain a meteorological service, and provide or assist training of civil pilots. With the exception of the last these duties are all being under-taken by the British Air Ministry.Interest also attaches to the Missions proposals with regard to supply, namely that &quot; all responsibility for the supply of aircraft material and equipment of all kinds &quot; shall be &quot;placed with the Secretary for Air.&quot; This recommendation goes further than the proposal which I submitted some months ago to the Cabinet that non-standardised aircraft supply should be the function of the Air Ministry, other branches of supply going to the Ministry of Supply.Without endorsing the views of the Mission in their entirety I have thought that it would be of interest to my colleagues to read the conclusions of impartial and highly qualified outside observers on the question of the best organisation.W.

Confidential.REPORT OF AMERICAN AVIATION MISSION.July 19, 1919.To the Secretary of War.Sir, .      . ... :^In accordance with your instructions, the American Aviation Mission visited France, Italy and England. It was able to confer with various Ministers of these Governments, ranking Army and Navy Commanders, and the foremost aircraft manufacturers.A thorough study and investigation was made by your Mission of all forms of organization, production and development. As a result of these studies, your Mission desires to emphasize the universal opinion of.its members that immediate action is necessary to safeguard the air interests of the United States, to preserve for the Government some benefit of the great aviation expenditures made during the period of the war, and to prevent a vitally necessary industry from entirely dis-appearing. Ninety per cent, of the industry created during the war has been liquid-dated. Unless some definite policy is adopted by the Government, it is inevitable that the remaining ten per cent, will also disappear.In placing this matter before you the subject falls into three important heads : (.1) General organization. . (2) Development, commercial. (3) Development, technical. The findings of the American Aviation Mission and its recommendations are submitted after a careful review of the situation in the allied countries mentioned, but always keeping in mind the situation in the United States.    Under the above slib-heads the results of these investigations are presented to you, which&apos;, in the opinion of the Mission, -demand the most earnest and immediate consideration along the broadest lines, with a view to establishing some fixed policy which will save the aircraft situation in the United States and give the United States an equal place with the great powers of Europe in this great new commercial development.The American Aviation Mission therefore recommends: The concentration of air activities of the United States, military, naval and civilian, within the direction of a single government agency created for the purpose, co-equal in importance with the Departments of War, Navy and of Commerce, to be called in this report, for pur-poses of identification, the National Air Service.In making the above recommendations, the following views and data of the Mission are presented:Visits were made by the Mission to England, France, Italy, and conferences have been held with those largely responsible for the successful prosecution of the war, and especially with those men most experienced in the aerial development within these countries.  Among others, interviews have been had with : France.Marechal Foch,Commandant-en-Chef des Armees Alliees. Mr. Andre Tardieu,Ministre des Affaires Franco-Americaines. General M. Duval,Chef de Service de 1&apos;Aeronautique. Mr. Jacques Dumesnil, Depute,Formerly Sous-Secretaire de TAeroiiautique. Mr. Loucheur, President du Conseil de Guerre,Now Minister of Reconstruction.

Colonel Crocco,Chief of the Technical Bureau. Signor Conti,Secretary of State for Aviation. In all countries visited, and in the minds of all persons met in conference, appears an extraordinary similarity in condition and in conclusions drawn from the experiences of the five difficult years of mistake and achievement in the prosecution of the war. Perhaps no stronger or more simple presentation of the regard in which the future of aviation is held in allied countries can be given than by quotation from two letters of M. Clemenceau, copies of which were obtained in France. The first is addressed to the President of the United States, urging upon him the imme-diate consideration of matters aeronautical and in connection with the Peace Con-ference. The second is addressed to the President of the Republic of France, sub-mitting the draft of a decree creating a separate department of Aeronautics placed transitorily under the Ministry of War an intermediate step possible without legis-lation and looking to the early creation of an Independent Ministry of the Air :&quot;Copy.    :       &apos;     &apos;&quot; February 16,1919.:&apos; The President of the Council, and&quot; The President of the Inter-allied Peace Conference.&quot; To the President of the Republic of the United States.&quot; Inter-allied Aviation Committee :&quot; Mr. President:&quot; I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your answer of February 7th, to my letter of January 24th. I enclose herewith, copies of the letters which I have received from Lord Milner and from Monsieur Orlando, as well as my replies.&quot; I am pleased to note that you agree in principle with my proposition to create an Aviation Committee for after the war. I take the liberty of insisting on the necessity of creating this Committee without delay, in order to be able to utilise it as an advisory organ for the Peace Conference. Indeed, the clauses for aerial protection seem to me to have at least an importance equal to the clause for military and naval protection; and it is of the greatest interest to have a- study made by competent personalities of the(25056.)  Wt.      -G 707.  (F.)  60.   9/19. d &amp; S.  G. 2. A 2
measures to take against the eventual constitution of a German military fleet. I cannot insist too strongly on the imperious necessity of this study, on account of the proximity of Germany to London, Brussels, Paris and Rome.&quot; Likewise, I adhere entirely to the British proposition which seems to me practical and effective, and I request you likewise to give it attention. In case it seems acceptable to you, I wish you would let me know if you could delegate two representatives to the next meeting of the new Inter-allied Committee, which will take place on Thursday, March 6th, at ten o&apos;clock, at the Directory of Aeronautics, 260 Boulevard St. Germain.&quot;Please accept, Mr. President, the assurance of my highest con-sideration, etc.&quot;(Signed)  CLEMENCEAU.&quot;&quot;Copy. .&quot; Report to the President of the French Republic.&quot; Paris, June 6th, 1919.&quot; Mr. President:&quot; Aircraft has developed considerably during the war. It should, at this time, adapt itself to a no less important part in Peace time. But because of the many initiatives which co-operate in its new use and development, the efforts and means are dispersed in various ministerial departments.&quot; The future of aviation in France will only be assured by the co-ordina-tion of all efforts and the unification of the general services. Also, it will give the advantage of better work from the personnel and credits which are actually effected to similar objects in different ministries.&quot; With this object in view, and according to the propositions of an inter-ministerial conference which I am able to assemble, I have the honour to submit for your signature the following decree creating an organ of general co-ordination of aviation,&quot; This should not be confused with any of the particular aviations of the various ministerial departments. At its origin, it will be attached transitorily to the Ministry of War.&quot; I am, Sir, yours respectfully,&quot; GEORGES CLEMENCEAU,&quot; President of the Council, War Ministry.&quot;Even before the report of this Mission can be given consideration, a step similar to that proposed by France will have been taken by Italy. Here, however, the Department of Aeronautics is being placed under the Ministry of Transportation  a make-shift arrangement frankly acknowledged transitory and immediately possible without the legislation needed to create the clearly foreseen ultimate the Italian Ministry of Air.England more than two years ago began the co-ordination of her aircraft activities an effort which has resulted in placing her well in the lead in practically every phase of aerial development, and which has resulted in bringing her months a-go to the establishment of a Ministry of Air, co-equal with her Ministries of War and of the Navy. That the present Ministries both for war and for air are centred in the same individual has no significance other than that of momentary expediency.The whole trend of events touching the art of aeronautics in its broad relation to world progress, the experience in all Allied countries (including the United States) during the five years past, the frankly discussed future plans under present con-sideration in foreign quarters and the views everywhere encountered by us, leave your Mission impressed with these unescapable conclusions : 1. That Italy, France and England realise fully the importance of aircraft in the military-naval and civil-commercial aspects, and propose to encourage the general,development of the art through Governmental aid to commercial industry.2. That Great Britain has come to consider the dominance of the air as at least of equal importance with that of the seas, and is frankly and avowedly planning a definite policy of Aerial development to that end.
1078. That any future war will inevitably open with great aerial activity far in advance of contact either upon land, or sea, and that victory cannot but incline .to that belligerent able to first achieve and later maintain its supremacy in the air.4. That for economic reasons, no nation can hope in time of peace to maintain air forces adequate to its defensive need except through the creation of a great reserve in personnel, material and. producing industry through the encouragement of Civil Aeronautics. Commercial Aviation and Transportation development must be made to carry the financial load.5. That no sudden creation of aerial equipment to meet a national emergency -already at hand is possible. It has been proven within the experience of every nation engaged in the war that two years or more of high pressure effort have been needed to achieve the quantity production of Aircraft, aircraft engines, and acces-isory equipment. The training of personnel, including engineering, production, inspection, maintenance and operating forces covering some fifty distinct trades and some seventy-five industries, has proved in itself a stupendous task when under-taken upon the basis of the war emergency alone.6. That the rapid adaptation of aircraft to the commercial uses of Peace is everywhere being studied and planned. Under the forced draft of war, this newest and fastest agency of Transportation has been brought to a high state of develop-ment. It must now be redesigned to meet the progressive demands of a civilisation at Peace.7. That because of its great speed and range of operation, oceans, States, and even countries are being passed over with a greater facility than are townships and counties traversed by the motor car. The need for International agreements govern-ing the construction, operation and safety of aerial apparatus of all kinds is immediately before us.8. That for the first time in the world5s history the stage is set for a close International co-operation in the development of a great art at the very threshold of its era of commercial utility. Great Britain, France, Italy and Japan not only invite but urge the United States to share in this work.9. That just as we now have National, International and Interstate regula-tions, laws and agreements covering rail and steamship travel, and the safety and navigation of the seas, so must we have similar regulations governing aircraft and the uses of aerial navigation throughout the world. The International Convention -drawn by the International Committee sitting in Paris, under the Peace conference, gives the first long step in this direction.10. That the need in each country for a single.authoritative point of contact for the conduct of all International aviation affairs, legal, operational, technical and political, is imperative. Such agencies have already been set up in England, France and Italy. The United States has, under the terms of the International Convention, no option but to follow these leads.11. That in England, France and Italy sentiment is undoubtedly in favour of the centralisation of aircraft development under one authoritative head. Difference of opinion has been encountered only in the matter of Army and Navy personnel and in. the question of the independent Fighting Force.England, holds the initiative and is building her Royal Air Force co-equal with the Army and Navy. France and Italy follow England&apos;s lead,, but seem Inclined to leave questions of operating personnel for the present to War Jind Navy Depart-ments, and to debate the need,of an Independent Fighting Air Service. In all cases, forces operating in conjunction with Military and Naval units, function under the Military or Naval High Commands.12.   That among the many considerations of early moment requiring govern-mental direction may be mentioned the following : (a) Federal and International laws governing the use of air routes. (6) Federal and International control of pilots&apos; licenses; examination and tests required.(c) Federal inspection of all commercial aircraft for airworthiness, or suit-ability for service.(d) Customs and other regulations for crossing State and National boundaries.(e) International standards for methods of communication and signalling. .(/) International standards covering the marking or charting of air routes and of landing places for both day and. night use.
(g) International specifications and rules governing the construction, equip-ment and operation of standard airdomes, landing stations, signal towers and other aids to aerial navigation.(h) Port regulations and fees covering seaplanes.(i) Federation taxation of aircraft and license for its use.(?) Safety measures and devices; legislation forcing adoption. ,(k) Fire underwriter standards, regulations and safeguards; insurance of machines, of material and of persons in transit (property and life). (/) The legal status of privately owned aircraft; the property rights of theair; liability for damage inflicted and incurred. (m) International standards and specifications covering accepted practice in quality of materials, in factor of safety, and in methods of con-struction; an engineering literature of this new art must be created by international approval. in) Maps and navigation charts of the United States and its territories.13. That we of to-day are conceivably no more qualified to judge as to the scale and development of the aircraft of ten years hence than were we of even five years ago able to foretell the achievents of to-day. We must bear in mind always that for every one mind focussed upon things aeronautical in this earlier period, some thousands of keen minds are now versed in the aircraft art. With proper governmental encouragement, rapid progress seems inevitable.14. That the broadest consideration for the ultimate welfare of American aviation must be given in the constitution of any organisation set up for the co-ordination and control of aeronautics within the United States. The prerogatives and ambitions of governmental departments and of individuals must be assayed at true value.15. That past experience and every economic consideration point to the vital need for the formulation by the United States of a definite, comprehensive and continuing policy for the development of every phase of the aircraft art. Our Government is now faced with the task of nursing and actively encouraging a new transportation industry, whose healthy growth is vital to the future progress and defence of the nation.Because of the lack of a definite, intelligent and sympathetic policy in our governmental aircraft organisation since the armistice, our American aeronautical industry, built up at such great expense of money and of effort, is rapidly disappear-iug. No sensible business man is justified in keeping money invested in the aircraft industry under the conditions which have maintained in the United States since November 11th.16. That the closest possible relations must continually exist between the aircraft agency of the Government and the production and commercial industry engaged in aircraft development.17.&quot; That the industries involved in the production and commercial use of aircraft must be given recognition and representation in connection with all national and international activities bearing upon the direction and control of aeronautics.In the foregoing brief presentation of its conclusions, your Mission has touched upon the aeronautical policies already in effect or under present discussion in England, France and Italy. -Great Britain&apos;s plan of organisation certainly warrants our most careful consideration. Its salient points are clearly set forth in the chart -herewith attached. It is not argued that the British method is perfect, but it can be stated without fear of contradiction in any quarter, that it stands to-day the most comprehensive governmental mechanism yet set up by any nation in the world for the encouragement, upbuilding, direction and control of its Air resources. This organisation has been born of five bitter years of trial, mistake, experience and pro-gress. It is the product of the best brains in the British Empire focussed under the spur of national need and the demand of the British people. We in America may well study it carefully. -Your Mission, in presenting its recommendations, desires to emphasise the view everywhere encountered that the future of aerial navigation and of aerial development generally, is in only a limited sense a function of military and naval establishments. The air is a medium for commerce and communication and its direction to the peaceful uses of civilisation must be unhampered by the necessarily restricted views of these specialised departments.
Recommendations.&apos;A. The concentration of the Air activities of the United States, civilian, naval and military, within the direction of a single governmental agency, created for the purpose co-equal in importance and in representation with the Departments of the War, Navy, and of Commerce.B. That the agency thus created be charged with full responsibility for placing and maintaining our country in the front rank among nations, in the development and utilisation of aircraft for the national security, and in the advancement of the civil aerial transportation and communication arts.C. That this governmental organisation be formed in general as follows :  1st.-A civilian Secretary for Air. ^ 2nd.-An Assistant Secretary,, a civilian, responsible directly to the Secretary, for Air for the management and operation of the Department. 3rd. Five or more Divisional Heads acting as chief of the sub-departments of (a) Civil Aeronautics, (b) Military Aeronautics, (c) Naval Aeronautics, (d) Supply and Research, (e) Finance, &amp;c. 4th. An Air Council, advisory in character, which shall be constituted by the Secretary of Air, including the Assistant Secretary of Air, the chiefs of the several sub-departments, and such other personnel as may be deemed advisable.. We desire especially to invite attention to the complexity and newness of the whole development of the aviation art, and to urge the broadest possible treatment of the subject during this formative period.   We suggest that the lesser details of organisation may well be left to&apos;the judgment and initiative of those called to assume the responsibility of directing this work. . We desire also, in this connection, to call attention to the aircraft interests of the Allied Governments, and to emphasise the necessity for careful discrimination in the selection of men of industrial experi-ence and broad vision.D. The establishment of governmental institutions of education and training, including an air college, all open alike, under proper restriction, to military, civilian and naval personnel.E. Such curricula and such arrangement of promotion in the National Air Service, and such assignment and pay, as to insure to the young man an attractive career whether he elects to remain permanently in the &quot;National Air Service&quot; or return to Army or Navy, or to civil life.F. The adoption of a system whereby Army, Navy and civil personnel can be circulated in proper proportion through the National Air Service. This personnel would, unless permanently assigned to air work, be automatically returned to the military and naval sources, or to civil life as an Air Service Reserve, after the educational and service periods in the National Air Service have expired.It is felt that such a circulating system is vital to the co-ordination and ultimate efficiency of the three services, and to the desired dissemination of a knowledge of and interest in the art among our people. The young officers of to-day will command the military and naval forces of to-morrow, and will carry with them into the highest ranks an intimate knowledge of aircraft, and of the strategy of its varied uses, in connection with operations on land or sea. The direction of civilian and commercial activities of all kinds will be made possible, and the closest contact and co-operation between the Government and the aeronautical industries assured.All international relations touching aerial matters fall naturally within the jurisdiction of the Secretary for Air.All responsibility for the supply of aircraft material and equipment of all kinds, and for the training of personnel for all branches of the service, is, in accordance with these recommendations of your Mission, placed with the Secretary for Air. As some 27,000 items are involved in the equipment and maintenance of each Air Squadron on active duty, the need for a single responsible direction seems undebatable.Under this plan of organisation here recommended, all squadrons and all equipment assigned by the National Air Service to meet the stated requirement of the military and naval establishments pass automatically under Army or Navy v command. Under National Air Service operational direction remain onlv those independent projects unrelated to the activities of the military and naval fighting fronts and such personnel and equipment as forms a surplus to the needs of the sea and land fighting arms.
The question of governmental organisation for the development and utilisation of our country^ air resources has been give*n consideration, by your Mission, seemingly from every angle. The recommendations made are general. -No report could be made effective if burdened with the mass of details involved in the setting up of anv governmental mechanism such as proposed.There have been, and will continue to be, advanced many objections to the establishment of a Department of the&apos; Air. We believe none of them will prove insurmountable. We believe the advantage gained to be such as to entirely over-shadow any temporary difficulties.Always in the past, in war by land or by sea, and in the transportation activities of peace, we have thought in two dimensions only. We must now re-adjust our minds to think for all future time in three.When this Mission left  he United States in May, its members were hoping the Atlantic Ocean might be crossed before January 1st, 1920. Within the two months of our absence/ four successful crossings have been made, and without the loss of a single life.1&quot;&apos; &apos;&apos;-There must be no over-optimism. There are years of development and experi-mentation ahead. As in the case of all the other great agencies of civilisation, the commercial and financially profitable use will come slowly. But here the immediate welfare and safety of our nation is involved, and an intelligent and efficient direction of our aeronautical affairs will be demanded by the American people. American genius has given to the world the airplane, a new instrument of commerce and of war. But America has left its development to other nations, and, too late, realised the mistake of this neglect. She has paid the price! America now again has the opportunity, if not to lead, at least to take her place in the front rank and to gain to herself the full benefit which will &quot;surely accrue from an active&apos; and sincere oo-operation in the engineering activities and in the scientific and commercialair-craft developments of those nations associated with us in the war.But this will be impossible, in the future as in the past, if our aircraft activities remain dispersed among the several governmental departments, and impossible of co-ordination for decisive action.Upon the breadth of view and the vision of those in control of America&apos;s oolicies depends our future as an Air Power.COMMERCIAL  DEVELOPMENT.With reference to the commercial development of aviation, your Mission makes its recommendation based upon the following conclusions, which have been formed, first, through knowledge of conditions existing at present in America, and, second] the knowledge gained by its investigations abroad.The investigations in England included visits to a number of factories, air-dromes and other points of particular interest, and interviews with the following gentlemen: -England: Major-General Hugh M.

Grassi, Deputy, ex-Chief of the Italian Aeronautical Mission in France.Colonel Guidoni, Italian Foreign Aeronautical Mission. Admiral Orsini, Commander of Italian Aviation. Captain Bursaglia, Chief of Staff to the Minister of Marine. Signor Peroni, Director of the Ansaldo Co.Signor Casatti, of the Caproni Co. .....Signor Buzio, of the Macchi Co.
Representatives of the Mission also visited the following factories in Italy, all of which are engaged in the manufacture of airplanes, balloons and motors :-Pomilio Co. , Ansaldo Co., at Torino. Caproni Co., at Milan.Isotta Fraschini, which was shut down due to a strike.1. One of the most important, problems to be considered in the rehabilitation of the world&apos;s commerce, following the close of the war, is the development of aerial transportation for commercial purposes. Its one invaluable service, and that in which it surpasses all other means of transportation, is speed, that time-saving element which the world has always striven for, and for which America, with its great distances, has such serious need. Reliability, safety, economy, and those other qualities of transportation service which are of value, will steadily improve as the use of aircraft increases and experience accumulates.2. It is as impossible to forecast the future of this new medium of transporta-tion as it would have been to describe the speed, comfort and safety of the modern steamship at the time the first steamship crossed the Atlantic. It is safe to say, however, that in time it will become one of the great transportation mediums of the world and will continue to offer the fastest and most direct means of transportation for persons, mail, and light freight, known to civilization. Its development is limited only by the perfection of the mechanical devices used, with which we are constantly becoming more familiar, and by the extent of our knowledge of the atmosphere which is becoming more thoroughly understood each year.3. It is equally difficult to determine the speed with which this development will take place. In fact, this will be determined largely by the opportunities afforded to employ the brains of the engineer and the scientist on the problems involved, which in turn will be controlled by the financial resources available for such work. It is thought by some well-informed authorities that the next five or ten years will see this new industry through its initial stages, and established on a self-support-ing basis, providing it is encouraged at this time. Adequate support cannot be expected from private enterprise alone, and if no outside aid is given, ten years will probably see this industry in America still struggling for a foothold, and far behind its European competitors who will receive substantial aid of many kinds.4. History has shown repeatedly that no nation can afford to neglect the highest possible development of its transportation mediums regardless of the opportunities existing for immediate profit to the private enterprise concerned. This is parti-cularly true of aerial transportation, which is not local in its nature, but which is essentially of a national and international character, due to the great distances covered, and to the speed with which it links together far distant points. The principle has been so clearly understood that an international agreement has been established between the Allies and their associates, by which international flight of aircraft has been provided for in a far-sighted manner, thus making immediately possible the flight of private craft from one country to another on a basis as clearly defined by law as that governing the movement of steamships, except, of course, that the practice of ages of ship travel is missing in the case of aircraft.5. The development of aviation is progressing so rapidly at this time that it is difficult even for those in close touch with it to keep up with its progress. During -.. the past two months the Atlantic has been crossed four times by aircraft; first, by a seaplane of the American Navy, second, by an airplane of Great Britain, and finally, by an airship of Great Britain which has twice demonstrated its ability to fly between England and America. All of this has been accomplished without the loss of a single life. Airships are now building in England which will be able to carry from five to ten tons of mail, in addition to the necessary fuel and crew, and cross the Atlantic from London to New York, in one half the time made by the fastest steamships. Who can say such transportation facilities will not greatly serve civilization, and be of immeasurable value to our own country if properly developed and used 16. Already lines of aerial transportation are being used in England and France in a small way for commercial purposes, but the distances in these countries are so short that relatively little advantage can be gained, so such ventures will develop slowly. A daily service from London to Paris has been in operation for some time, and promises to be quite serviceable as soon as it can be relieved of its war-time military supervision.  Other lines now in operation are from Paris to Lille and
Brussels and from Paris to various points in Alsace-Lorraine and German occupied&quot; territory. Among other plans English private interests are projecting airplane lines from Cairo to the Cape and Cairo to Bombay, and French interests are planning to run a line to Algeria and Morocco. These lines will carry mail, passengers, and express, and it is expected that they will materially shorten the time between European centers and their far distant terminals. The United States Post Office Department has carried mail by airplane from New York to Washington for over a year with a record of nearly one hundred per cent, delivery at each end every day. It is now inaugurating a line from New York to Chicago which will shorten the mail time between these two points to about one half. It is also projecting a two-day service from New York to San Francisco. England is already desirous of organizing with the United States a trans-Atlantic airship line for mail service which would give a five-day mail service from London to San Francisco. Such a service is entirely possible at this time, and its inauguration depends only upon adequate encourage-ment and financial support.7. The risks involved in these ventures, due to unknown conditions of the atmosphere, imperfections of equipment, etc., are still so great.as to make them impracticable from the point of view of private enterprise, undertaken for a profit. If left entirely to such private enterprise, aerial transportation will develop slowly and with many losses and backward steps, as did the steamship, the railroad, and the automobile, each of which, however, has ultimately become a vital factor in our civilization.8. One of the striking features of our investigation in Europe was the unanimous belief that the use of aircraft in warfare and for national defence would continue to increase and that in the next war, whenever it might come, aircraft would be a far more vital factor even than it has been in this war. One of the greatest military authorities in Europe stated that in his opinion the first battle of the next great war would be in the air, and would very nearly decide which side would win, in that the side winning in the air would immediately have access to all of its enemy&apos;s sources of supply and production, and would quickly cripple them by air raids upon an enormous scale. The opinion was everywhere expressed that the development of aircraft for purposes of national defence must continue, and that sufficient flying and production facilities and personnel must be maintained at all times to insure an adequate supply in case of need. Due to the complicated and delicate nature of such equipment, to its rapid depreciation in use, and to its constant obsolescence, the expense involved in such a programme would be very great, in fact, almost prohibitive in peace times.9. The existence of an aerial transportation industry with a great commercial air fleet and of a strong production industry would greatly decrease the need for strictly military equipment and resources, in that practically all of the aircraft and landing field facilities and personnel, and the manufacturing and maintenance facilities and personnel employed by such commercial activities, would be available as a reserve in time of war. It is evident, therefore, that the most economical way to develop a strong air service for national defence is to encourage, by every means possible, the use of aircraft for commercial purposes, and thereby build up a com-mercial fleet at relatively small expense to the Government, which would effectively supplement its strictly military equipment in time of need. America&apos;s experience during the war has proven conclusively that aircraft facilities and personnel, and particularly production facilities and technical personnel, cannot be obtained upon short notice, but only by long and continued experience and at great expense.10. America&apos;s production industry reached large proportions during the war, but since the signing of the Armistice it has shrunken to a very small volume. Unless immediate attention is given to its conservation it will practically disappear, and a considerable portion of the great sums expended in its development will have been spent fruitlessly. This industry does not require a large volume of business to keep it alive and healthy, but it does reauire a steady and dependable demand, otherwise private capital and enterprise will not long remain interested.Recommendations .Upon the basis of these conclusions, we offer the following plan for stimulating the development of commercial aviation as an aid to national defence, and as a25056
response to the demand that is already developing for improved commercial trans-portation through the use of aircraft.A. The Civil Aviation Division of the National Air Service should establish, with the advice of the Army and Navy and the Divisions of Military and Naval Aeronautics, a series of flying routes throughout the United States and its possessions and to contiguous foreign countries, which will be of military and commercial value. It should also prepare and publish maps and descriptions of each of these routes suitable for the use of fliers.R. There should be provided at national expense certain flying fields in strategic locations and suitable for military purposes, and encouragement should be given to the various States and Municipalities to provide flying fields upon all flying routes at points found desirable, thus eliminating the necessity for private owner-ship of flying fields except for strictly private use. Hangars should be provided at each flying field by the Governmental authority owning the field (that is, Federal, State or Municipal), or, where such fields are used constantly by private interests, they should be permitted to provide their own hangars immediately adjacent to and opening upon such flying fields.The operation and use of such flying fields should be controlled by Federal law, so as to obtain uniformity throughout the nation and conformity with international regulations.C. AU flying routes and flying fields should be equipped at national expense with signalling and communication systems, including wireless telegraphy, wireless telephony and searchlights, to thoroughly safeguard and guide aircraft in flight. The Governments attitude in this matter should be the same as that maintained towards shipping in its lighthouse and coast patrol service. The operation of signalling and communication equipment should be controlled by Federal law for the reasons indicated under item &quot; B.&quot; ,D. A meteorological service should be developed to provide fliers and other aviation interests with accurate weather reports and other atmospheric data neces-sary to govern their activities intelligently. The value of this service to commercial aviation cannot be over-estimated, as it will go far towards establishing reliability and safety of service, just as weather reports are of immeasurable value to ocean and lake transportation..E. Training facilities should be provided at various localities throughout the country, either at Government expense or by private enterprise under Government regulation, with guarantees from the Government of a sufficient number of students to cover expenses. Such guarantees could be given by the Government without undue expense if it used, such schools for the preliminary training of its military personnel. Such a plan would encourage private enterprise to provide facilities for the training of the personnel needed for commercial requirements, which personnel in turn should become a permanent reserve for military requirements in time of need. There should be established at least one. school for the teaching of aero-dynamics and other branches of the science of aeronautics, as recommended under the heading &quot; Organisation.&quot; Encouragement should be offered to universities throughout the country to establish departments of aeronautical science.F. The Government should encourage the development of new design and aeronautical technique for commercial purposes along the lines recommended under the heading &quot; Technical Development,&quot;G. The Department of Aeronautics should maintain the closest possible relations with all civilised nations in determining and applying the rules and regulations which will govern the international use of aircraft, and there should be developed, as rapidly as is consistent with proper consideration, a body of Federal law governing the use and air-worthiness of aircraft for commercial purposes which will safeguard life and property and promote the commercial usage of aerial transportation.In order that commercial aviation may be helped and hot hindered by such legal restrictions, it is of vital importance that aerial transportation be recognised at once as an element of inter-State commerce and be made subject to one body of Federal law applying uniformly throughout all of the United States. It will thereby avoid the complications of individual State control which have proven to be such a handicap to railroad and automobile operation.
H. Insurance of aircraft and its personnel against all kinds of hazards and risks involved should be encouraged in every way. The cost of such insurance should be kept as low as is consistent with the risks involved.I. Encouragement should be given to the organisation of private enterprises for carrying on aerial transportation. This encouragement might well be in the form of payment for the carrying of mail and expressage, and of guarantees as to the volume of such business. Compensation might be paid to such enterprises for keeping their facilities available for use in time of war.Guarantees of this kind, coupled with opportunity to insure against loss by accident, should make privately operated transportation lines a commercial possibility, but if it is found that private enterprise does not respond to such encouragement, then the Government should undertake certain transportation venture on its own account, and should continue to operate such lines until they are proven ^commercially successful. Ultimately they should ^be sold to private enter-prises on such terms as would permit of successful operation, as it is not believed that commercial aviation will ever be successfully developed entirely under Government control.J. The remaining aircraft production industry should be conserved and kept in a healthy condition by a well-defined and continuing programme of production for military purposes over a period of years. This policy should be continued until the commercial demand is adequate to support an industry of sufficient proportions to form an effective nucleus upon which can be built a war-time production in case of need.TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT.With reference to technical development, your Mission in submitting its recom-mendations bases the following conclusions on a knowledge of conditions existing in the United States and upon extensive investigations conducted abroad : (1).

The form of technical organization and control recommended by your&apos; Mission differs materially from the controlling organizations in Italy, France or England. Inasmuch as, for some time at least, military, naval and departmental flying seems likely to lead in the development of the art, your Mission desires to lay emphasis upon the necessity of having these departments strongly represented in the operations of the Technical Division so that they shall be materially helped and not hindered in their research, experiment and development. To the same end, we are of the opinion that lighter-than-air, which in England and France, due to the close-ness of the war, the Technical Division is at present dominated by military personnel, but the opinion is unanimous that, as time goes on, civil personnel will supersede&apos; military in this division. General Ellington, England, expressed this opinion flatly, and General Brooke-Popham, Director of Research, England, holds the same belief. In the Royal Aircraft Factory, at Farnborough, civilian requirements are already
overtaking military and naval. It has therefore been deemed wise to take the ultimate step at the outset in. America, and a civilian head, of the type now earnestly sought in France and England, is recommended for America.3. In equipment and personnel, England and France and Italy are maintain-ing their war strength in the Technical Division. At Farnborough, we found a complete experimental plant, employing about 3,000 men and women, and carrying on actively nearly every line of research, experiment and development in motors, planes, and accessories. More than a score of planes, rigged with apparatus for Aero-dynamic experiment, were in the hangars and in the held. Physical and chemical laboratories seemed busy and fully-manned. Estimating the lighter-than-air and the naval experimental and research personnel, it seems probable that the plant and the personnel engaged in the division in England is nearly, if not quite, equal to the entire trade in America at the present time. Obviously, this branch of aeronautics lies at the very foundation of the future, both military and civil, and to fail to bring it up to the standard of the world cannot help but&apos; mean dependence and mediocrity, or worse, in aeronautics in America.4. The inclusion of such topics as armament (Ordnance), wireless (Signal Corps), instruments (Admiralty), photography (Signal Corps), design and bombs (Ordnance), &amp;c, has been found necessary in all countries. In reality, the design and supply of such appurtenances is left to the departments or bureaux specialising in them, but research and experiment and development in methods of installation and use is essentially a function of the Air Service Technical Division, and must be carried on by this Division, both in the laboratory, on the factory floor, and especially in the air, in the tank and on the field.5. In all the European countries visited we found that access to and use of the Government-owned facilities for development is established. The basis of such use varies, and can be adapted to the circumstances. In all countries, however, the principle is the same, namely, that private interests must obtain access to Government facilities through the officers of the Division, so that new inventions, &amp;c, shall pass the scrutiny and criticism of the Division heads before going into actual experimentation. In England an attempt has been made to furnish facilities at cost, but to save overhead a schedule of flat prices is being worked out.6. In England and France the question whether or not to design complete motors and machines no longer exists. France was forced to design aeroplanes in 1916, due to the failure of her private firms to meet the crisis created by the Fokker; but the immediate result appears to have been a quick return to the safer measures for-encouraging the private designers to design and build, under the direction and assistance of the State. In England, the complete design of aeroplanes ceased with the S.E. 5; and both Government officials and industrial officials offered ample testimony that the making of complete designs was a mistake and would not be repeated, due to its effect upon the private design departments. Without exception, the manufacturers appear to take the view that it would be idle to compete by private efforts, if one division of the Government was designing and another division buying, as the Government would inevitably favour its own designers, even though not quite so good. The result of such a policy, therefore, would be to limit the number of sources from which useful designs can be obtained, and also to lower the standard of personnel in the design departments of private firms.7. In 1918 Sir Arthur Duckham, then Director of Aircraft Supply for England, said: &quot; As we&apos; all know, changes in design, unless they are actually for new types, may be absolutely against production; most of our delays in production in this country, and in the countries other than ours, have been due to the effort to obtain too great perfection at too early a time.&quot;Having this in mind, and having in mind also the disastrous effects upon production of similar causes in the United States, your Mission asked explicit questions concerning the plan used by the Technical Division in England to minimise the result of such changes.  The method is outlined as follows : &quot;All changes made necessary by the fact that a machine or motor is dangerous to the flier or to the public are classed as Number I. These are imperative, and are ordered by the Director of Design, without delay. No machine is allowed to be accepted or flown without such changes having been made.
&quot;Important changes involving improvement in performance, &amp;e, are classed as Number II. Such changes are made by order of the Modification Board described below, and became effective only at such time as not to inter-fere unduly with production.&quot; Improvements and additions, not vital but often valuable, are classed as Number III. They are made when convenient, both to Government and to contractor, and are not allowed to interfere with production or greatly increase price.&quot;A Modification Board shall pass on changes and classify them. This board consists of five members, one from the Technical Division, one from Production, one, from Operations, one from Finance, and one from Supply. In the case of Number I changes, the Director merely reports that such and such changes have been ordered. All other changes are ordered by the Modification Board at regular meetings.Your Mission is of the opinion that the establishment of some such uniform practice, covering not only such changes but also the method of paying for them, is essential to production, and should be a responsibility of the Technical Division.- Recommendations.(a) That all technical functions of the Government in respect to aeronautics be centralised in a single Technical Division which shall perform the work for the Army, Navy and Civil aviation; and which shall be headed by, preferably, a civilian of wide executive experience. Such a division should include as assistants to the Director, experienced representatives of Army, Navy, and other Government depart-ments interested in aviation, who shall be nominated by the departments, and shall act as advisors upon the special needs of the Service they represent.(b) That steps be taken forthwith to secure for the United States the most advanced equipment for research, experimental and development work, and for the testing of motors, planes, balloons, etc., for the testing of materials; for the examination and testing of aeronautical appliances, including armament and instru-ments; and that such an organization shall be established as shall assure at all times that the research, experimental and development activities of the Government shall be second to none.(c) That the research, experimental and development facilities and equipment now used in aviation by the Army, Navy and other Government departments be inventoried immediately and put, as far as practicable, under the control of &quot;the Technical Division, retaining such of same as may seem suitable and bringing them under a central control to make a complete and efficient equipment, and discarding such of them as unnecessarily duplicate others or are out of date. In making this change, great care should be exercised to guard against measures which might tend to interfere with suggestions for improvements and advances in aviation, material and methods, coming from the operating aviation branches of the Army, Navy and Postal Departments. Experience has proved that the initiative in the advance of motors, planes and accessories often comes from practical experience in the flying field rather than from the scientific department of aeronautics. The Technical Division will, in co-operation with the operating forces, study, work out and apply all such suggestions. Care should be taken also to avoid duplicating facilities already in existence, such as water tanks, armament testing grounds, and many other items operated by existing departments. Arrangements should be&apos;made whereby the existing plants of this sort can be used, on a proper payment basis, by the Technical. Division.(d) That extreme care be taken in such a process of adjustment to provide imple means whereby the special technical needs&quot;of the (a) Army, (b) Navy and (c) Civilian flying shall receive attention. Moors should also be provided whereby military and naval experiments of a secret nature can be carried forward., (e) That the organization of the Technical Division cover by means of adequate personnel and equipment, all branches of aeronautical research, experiment and development, including the application and aerial use of instruments, armaments and munitions, wireless telephone and telegraph, bombs and fittings, sights, fire-fighting appartus, parachutes, air bags and other safety devices, motor appliances for air service, propellers, and photography.   (See B 4.)
(/) That all the technical facilities of the Technical Division for aviation, whether now existent or to be created, shall be available to private inventors and designers, upon proper and reasonable terms.(g) That in view of the experience of England and France, it is dangerous to allow the Technical Division to operate under normal war conditions a department of complete design in heavier-than-air machines or in motors, as such competition results immediately in stopping private departments of design. The Technical nDivision, therefore, should be a critic of. and supplementary to, private design rather than aim at design on its own account. The policy of the Technical Division should be to maintain and encourage a considerable number of well-manned and well-equipped private design plants and to co-operate with these plants in all undertakings that meet with the approval of the Technical Division, and to place orders with these plants, at fair prices, for design and for experimental construction of motors, planes, and appliances. Competition of the Government with the industry should be avoided, the onlv allowable exception being cases where, either on account of expense, or for other cause, the Technical Division cannot obtain needed material, or design from existing sources.(h) That careful thought shall be given to the establishment of competition in motor, plane, balloons and accessory design, and encouragement be offered in every reasonable way to the promotion of competitive events and the establishment of standard records.(!) That the Technical Division shall publish regularly and under competent management all the technical facts and data developed bv the Division that may be helpful to the industry, reserving at the same time to itself the right to preserve secrecv in all matters that are deemed to be in the nature of Naval or Military secrets.(j) That such a Technical Division shall maintain at all times as close touch as possible with the development abroad and shall maintain representatives in Europe charged with the duty of liaison between the American and European technical organisations^(k) That a definite method of payment for independent design, experimental production, changes in design, alterations and adjustments be worked out by the Government as quickly as possible, to the end that the design and improvement of motors, planes, balloons and appliances may be &quot;stimulated and not stifled.(I) That the Technical Div:sion shall include an Inspection and Testing Depart-ment, which shall carry on all inspections and tests of experimental construction and revision, and which shall issue certificates of air-worthiness for. all machines for private and commercial use, and shall from time to time inspect all machines and appliances, including landing fie&apos;ds, signals, &amp;c.. used by public. In co-oneratton with the Civilian Division, this department shall have power to limit and control all types of air machines used in commerce, and to test such machines before they become production models. This department should have power to examine the inspection methods of all private concerns building aircraft, and to pass upon the quality of such methods from time to time.(m) That close co-operation be maintained at all times with the purely technical aeronautical bodies, and also with the industrial bodies engaged in aeronautics, so that standardisation of materials and practices may be carried forward as rapidly as can. be clone without hindering the development of the art or entailing undue losses upon the trade., Respectfully submitted :(Signed)BENEDICT CROWELL,The Assistant Secretary of War.(Signed)HOWARD C.
