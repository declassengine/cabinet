&apos; X *it(This document is the property of His Britannic       415Majesty1 s Government)&quot;   \   BUILDING    TRADE.SECRET.     &apos; aHi ALL SI&quot;WAGES AND PROFITS.(Memorandum by tho Minister of Labour). fIn view of the difficulties that are likely to arise on account of the high rents which must be charged in future for workmen&apos;s houses, the Ministry of Labour desire to direct attention to the position with regard to wages and profits in the Building Trade.The Wages Agreements reoently arrived at in the Building Trade for several districts give advanoea over pre-war wages greater than those which have been given generally in other trades or industries, and the position is being further complicated by 300radio demands made on special jobs: (for example, a demand has been made by the operatives for an increase^ of 3d per hour on the Housing aoherne at Guildford)*   There is every likelihood of such demands becoming more frequent and it must be recognised that in such cases where the community generally is to a considerable extent bearing the cost of subsidising the work&apos;, the employers have not tho same interest in resisting claims for increased wages as they had when&apos; they were carrying out the work for private employers under a fixed contract.   It is, there-- fore, important that the serious situation which is certain to arise in the Building Trade unless steps are &apos; at once taken to regulate *the trade should receive careful and immediate consideration.
Xx is clear that increases in wa&amp;es must entail increases in the cost of the houses and therefore increases in the economic rent of such houses.   At present it may be assumed that the cost of a house of the kind contemplated in the rousing Schemes, including, roads, drainage, etc., but excluding the oost of the site, is in industrial centre^ about  800, although in a few instances the cost may be less and in oth*..rs may range up to  1,000 or over; the pre-war cost would rrngo from about  250 to  300* Taking the oost at  800, an increase of Id per hour on the wages of the operatives is approximately equivalent to an increase of 3$ on the cost of the house, the resulting increase in the economic rent feeing about 7fd per week.   Account must also be taken of the fact that, if wages in the Building Trade increase, demands will be made for increases in the industries which supply the materials, (for example bricks) and the result of the same increase in wages in these industries would be to make the total increase approximately 5f0 on the cost of tho house * This would mean an increase at about l/ld per week on the economic rent.   Further, the economic rent of an  800 house may be taken to be roughly 2l/6d per week, and to arrive at the weekly rent including rates from 3/8lbs to 2/3rda must be added to this figure giving a weekly rent ranging from 29/6dti 37/-.   The predominant weekly rents including rates in working class a.wellings of a similar class in 1912 in industrial towns, excluding London, ranged from 5/6d to 6/6d per week, whilst in London it varied, from 7/- to 13/-.   The seriousness of the position of housing is readily apparent from the above figures and the indications are that thsy will in the near future be exceeded: for example, it appears that in Leeds the oost of working class dwellings has been estimated at
 900 each exclusive of roads, drains, etc., while in Birmingham it has been estimated at  940.If, therefore, houses are to be provided without placing an altogether excessive burden on the community, steps must be taken to regulate the Building Trade to prevent increases in prices of material or labour which are npt fully justified by all the ciroumstances.Prior to the Armistioe, wages in the Building Trade were regulated by Statutory Rules and Orders Ho. 742, and several supplementary Orders issued by the Ministry of Kunitions but the Munitions of T7ar Act 1917 was repealed by the &apos;wages (Temporary Regulation)&apos;Act 1918, and,the power of.regulating wages is no longer vested in any Government Department,Under the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Aot, before an agreement for an alteration in wages can become statutory it requires the approval of the Minister of Labour, but this does not prevent tho employers from paying increased wages, it only prevents an employer on Government work being reimbursed for the extra labour cost.   The Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act will expire in November next and there will no longer be any question of approval of agreements under that Act,   in any event, having regard to the position of the Ministry of Labour as a conciliating department, the approval or non-approval of agreements should not be within the discretion of the Minister of Labour. Although in fact approval is only withheld from an
agreement on the advice of the Interim Court of Arbitration it Is extremely difficult to make the position of the Minister of Labour in the matter quite clear to the public to the workpeople, and,this diffioulty is greatly increased by the fact that agreements are in many oases conditional agreements, that is , the employers make it a condition of their observing the agreement that the Minister of Labour approves it.In order to deal adequately with the situation it   * would appear to bo necessary to devise some other means of controlling the Building and Allied Trades.   It would clearly be impossible to regulate wages unless at the same time machinery were set up to secure that the employers.in the Building Trade and these other industries did not take advantage of the situation&apos; to make exeessive profits.The Building Labour Committee (which consists of representatives of the Ministry of Labour and of the different Government Departments concerned with Building Trade contracts) has,the necessary experience as to wages, etc., and the general conditions of the trade; but it is desirable that in addition some central authority should be established, whose duty would be to deal with contract prices in the Building and Allied Trades and in particular to secure that only approved wages were paid in connection with any Housing Schemes being carried out either directly or indirectly for the State, and that the prices charged by the Contractors supplying Building Trade Contractors with materials, were only such as to give a reasonable profit.In order to carry out these duties, it would be
necessary that such aa authority had full power to take evidence, investigate the hooks and accounts of all kinds belonging to such contractors and compel the production of any documents which might bo relevant in any particular enquiry.Further if the proposed Housing Schemes are to be carried out in a reasonable time, it will be necessary to have some system of licensing building work as there is evidence thai building operations are being undertaken on a considerable scale for places of amusement, refresh-ment, etc., and in these cases extra inducements are being offered over and above the wages pretalent In tho district, the cost of these buildings being a matter of comparative indifference to the owners as they expect to be able to recoup themselves otherwise..The only proposal that seems to me adequate to deal with &amp; - situation; fest becoming desperate, appears to be to make building establishments &quot;controlled establish-wonts&quot; as engineering works were during the war. This may be a drastic step but I know of no alternative if vie are to ensure that the proper buildings get priority and are built at a reasonable cost*An appendix is attached showing the position as regards wages at present in the Building Trade.(Signed)     R.S.HOBMB.6th October 1919.
APPEND 1%.PRE SENT WAGES POSITION IN THE BUILDING TRADE.Por some considerable time it has become evident to tho Building Labour Committee that if important work, such as the Housing Schemes contemplated by the Ministry of Health, is to be completed within a reasonable time and at a reasonable oost, some measure of oontrol is necessary.   The following statement shows the reasons why the Committee have been led to their oonolusion.%*   EXCESS OF DEMAND PQR BUILPflfQ LABOUR OVER SUPPLY.This is one of the main sources of the difficulties in the trade at the moment, and in the absence of some control of the trade it is certain that in the near futuee , it will only be possible in many districts to obtain labour at scarcity prices.(1) Even in districts where definite approved rates exist, reoognised by Government Departments and by Master Builders alike, complaints are constantly being made that higher rates of wages are being offered and paid on building work connected with the ereotion of new factories or the extension of existing ones, the building of places of amusement eto* (e,g* at Watford where contractors have oome into the district paying London rates),*(2) Building labour is at present exceptionally mobile and any dispute involving a stoppage of work results in the rapid transfer of a great deal of the labour in that district to, other districts.   This fact has clearly a very important influence on Local Conciliation Boards when dealing with wages claims since the employers, even where they may have an interest in opposing a olaim, are influenced by the great probability that their operations will be largely stopped by the loss of a majority of the labour.(3) There is a very widespread tendency to assimilate the rates of lower paid districts to those of the larger industrial centres in the vicinity, pre-war differences being disregarded; and this tendency probably has&quot; as Important an effect on the oost of Housing Sohemes as the general wages increases in the larger industrial centres. An important aspect of this tendency is the extension of the areas oovered by existing rates fe.g. Coventry, West bromwich and Sutton Coalfield have been placed on the same level as Birmingham).   In the system of grading recently adopted by,the Yorkshire Area Joint Council for the Building Trade ,this tendency is well-marked and has resulted in an increase of more than 150$ over pre-war rates in a considerable number of the distriots.II.   THE INEPPIspTIvlINESS OP THL PRESENT SYSTEM OP WAggS REGULATION. 1) The usual jjraafrice of Government Departments naa
been to pay or to Instruct their contractors to pay to their employees the rates of wages generally recognised by good employers in the district in which the work isf being carried out, and since the Armistice the practice has been to refuse to pay rates which have not been approved by the Minister of Labour in accordance with the terms of the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Acts, 1918-1919. -The result is that in many dis-triots difficulties have arisen owing to the payment of higher rates by other employers.   Examples are numerous but it is sufficient to cite the case of Plumbers in the Birmingham, Lancashire and Tee-side districts and of Painters in the distriots surrouAding Manchester and on the Worth-East Coast.In some districts, such as Lincoln, all olasses ofBuilding Trade operatives are affeoted,(2) The refusal of the Government Departments to recognise rates of wages In excess of those approved under the Wages Acts has undoubtedly the effect of preventing further increases of wages in these districts, but at the same time the labour employed&apos; on Government work Is very much reduced in quantity if it does not altogether cease.   On-the other hand, in districts where there is a serious scarcity of Building labour the payment on Government works of the higher rates would only have a temporary effect since the contractors employed on other works, such as the building of piofcure houses, would quickly increase the retes still higher in order to attract more labour.(3) There is already reason to believe that employers in certain districts are reluctant to tender for Housing Schemes, and it is known that in one oase the members of a Federation have been advised to include in their estimates an amount to cover possible increase labour costs which might not be approved by the Government.(4) The present position of the Housing Schemes of the Ministry of Munitions is as follows:-Lincoln - operations at a standstill.Coventry - demand for payment of rates of wages under &quot;&quot;       the Midland Area Scheme which gives Coventry the same rates as Birmingham, contrary to the previous practice.   This Scheme has been referred to the Interim Court of Arbitration for advice, and if the Court does not advise approval the position will be similar to that at Lincoln.Irlam - The Plumbers have demanded a higher rate of wages than the approved rate and certain houses. cannot be completed.   The Scheme as a whole will probably be affected by the general demand which, has just been made in the north-Western Area and is dealt with oelow.Barrow - This Scheme will also be affected by the general demand in the Nor^th-Western area.,
It would therefore appear to be not improbably that all the Housing Schemes of the Ministry of Munitions may be brought to a standstill in the near future.(5) The present method by which wages are fixed in any district is in general through the Conoillation Scheme in the Building Trades, and the principal defect of that Sohome is that there is no general basis for wa(?es and no attempt appears to be made by the trade to deal with the problem nationally, in spite of the fact that they entered into an agreement with the Minister of Labour last year for a general wages revision among other things.Wages and working conditions are frequently settled by. locai agreement for a town or a small district, and every local agreement which increases the existing rates immediately reacts on every town and district in the neighbourhood.It is clear that only some system of control which aims at scouring some relation between demand and supply and which provides for a more scientific method of dealing with wages claims, will enable the State to obtain the buildings which are necessary to it, more especially houses.III.   PROBABLE RAPID INCREASE III THE ABOVE PIFFICUL-TIBS IH jgg with FWUrIT(1) The Rational Board of Conciliation for the Building Trade at its meeting on 23rd September decided on a 44-hour week from the beginning of May next year, the wages to &quot;be paid for the 44-hour week being equivalent to those paid for the working week in existence at present with a limit of 50 hrs.   It is clearly to the advantage of the operatives to secure as great an increase before the beginning of Kay 1920 as possible as every ouch increase will be further enhanced by the alteration of the working week then coming into effect.(2) The Midland Area Scheme which is now under the consideration of the Interim Court of Arbitration provides for rates of wages considerably hi/cher than those fixed by previous area schemes, and this has been a marked feature of every successive soheme*(3) Although an area scheme was agreed to in February this year In the North-western Area, and part of that agreement was that this scheme should continue in operation till 1st May 1920, an agreement has recently been concluded at Liverpool for an advance In wages of 4d. per hour over and above those provided by that scheme, and a demand has now been put forward for this increase of 4d. in all the districts in the ftorth-Western Area,,It has for some time been clear to the Building Labour Committee that the movement for increased wages and alters-tions in working rules which inorease earnings was being accelerated and that the time had been reached when it would be impossible to advise approval of the new rates of wages and working conditions if any regard was to be had to the
increases in wages in industry generally,It is already unfortunately true that the prices of Material and labour in the Building Trade are such as to preclude the possibility of constructing houses for the working classes at a cost which will allow of an economic rent being levied, and it Is clear that every further increase in wages or the price of&apos; materials will aggravate the position.   Further, it is clear that the longer the introduction of control of the trade is put off the more unpopular it will be if it is ultimately resorted to, aQ the rapid succession of demands for further increases in wages will inevitably tend to lead the operatives to believe that the control is merely a measure to prevent their obtaining increases in wages.IV._pCHEASBI) LABOUR POSTS DUE TO OTHER CAUSES THANniClTlIASES&apos;11? THQTOjg RATlQg Mljjji(1) Tho reduction of the number of hours in the normal working week which Is gradually proceeding and will become general at the beginning of May 1920*   This is frequently accompanied by demands for overtime work.   It has been reported that in many places, e.g. London and Birmingham., workmen cannot be obtained unless overtime is promised.(2) The demand for an increased scale of overtime payments. e.g. time and a half instead of time and a quarter.(3) increases in rates of wages and alterations of working conditions in trades allied to the Building Trades, 13. 0. j -*Workmen engaged in the construction of roads and sewers* Workmen employed in the manufacture of bricks, etc.In the event of control of the Building Trade being determined on it will be necessary to consider the case of these and other allied trades *
