ly      ,   //&quot;k^xO        o q p*This Docut :i &apos;&apos; :&apos;.     Property of   Iy\\ PROPOSAL TO CEDE CYPRUS TO GREECE,It is understood that in the negotiations with regard to Syria now in progress between the French a.nd ourselves, the policy of the Imporial Government is based on the engagements and declarations of the British and French Governments, not only as between themselves, but also as between themselves and the Arabs.As a result of these arrangements, France obtains the mandate for Cilicia a.nd Syria, including the ports of Alexandretta, Mersina and Beirut.It is also probable that a small zone, bordering on, and including, the port of Adalia, is to be assigned to Italy.Mr Fisher&apos;s proposal to cede Cyprus to Greece thus comes at a time when the whole of this littoral, and also adjoining areas of considerable extent in Asia Minor, are passing out of the weak hands of Turkey into the oovyhiNvi. ?f *.v?n cM*ii*CTay.oan -Powers.At the same timo we have, ourselves, undertaken frosh responsibilities in Palestine and Mesopotamia. The Military and trade communications between these countries and the Mediterranean will become before long a factor of considerable importance in the naval situation.3.-   The Admiralty, therefore, think it advisable to place on record the reasons why they regard Mr Fisher1 s proposal as a dangerous one, whether considered from the point of view of the British Empire or of the League of Nations. &apos; \4o-   The port of Lima ol, near the southernmost point of Cyprus, is about 210 miles from Port Said and 150 from Haifa; and tho coast line of the island is separated by only 40 miles from the Cilician coast, 80 from Morsina, 100 from Beirut, and about 150 from Alecandretta or \dalia. Cyprus thus occupies a very ooiomding position in relation to all the ahove ports, which, it may be noted, are all well within range of aircraft.The island has no natural harbours of any size, but Fanagusta, on the east coast, could be made into an excellent base for submarines and destroyers; it could even be developed into a base for big ships, Ihough this would be costly.  There are good facilities for an air base, as has already been pointed out by the Air Ministry, ,5.-   The principal duty of tho Navy in the Mediterranean hitherto has been to protect tho sea route to the 3ast through the Suez Canal, the main artery of our Imperial communications.  To this must now be added the protection of Palestine and Mesopotamia, from attack via the Mediterranean Sea.6.-*   Up to the present time, a cardinal feature of our naval policy in the Mediterranean has been that no strong haval power should occupy ports or territory to the Eastward of Malta.
The control by any strong power of Aleieandrotta and Beirut, which ate within easy striking distance of our ooianunioations to Sgypt and Mesopotamia, introduces a new andisorious factor into the naval situation in the Mediterranean&apos;; which rosy.have to bo reckoned with in the near future; alcxa-ndrotla in   articular is a potential naval and(Commercial port 6f great value and the same may be laid though in, a lesser degree, with regard to Beirut, Mcrsina and Adalia.7**-   In these oirouinstanc.es,. the possession of Cyprus is ef the utmost importance, as.it reives to us the means of discounting the value of any hostile naval bases which might be projected by Foreign Powers in this region. &apos;8.-   We cannot run the risk of handing over Cyprus to any Power which night use it against us. By so doing, not only should we&apos; lose the means of countering attack from Syria, and Cilicia, but we should also present the enemy with a good base for submarine and air attack on Port Said-and Haifa, and on all our traffic to and from the East;The security of these sea communications is vital to the defence of the Smpire .;,nd it would be folly to endanger it.   The history of Heligoland should be a warning to us.O4-   Even during a long period of peace, if this should now ensue, new political combinations will arise, and new methods of warfare vail bo evolved, particularly in the direction of aerial attack.  Greece emerges from the Peace as a Mediterranean Power not to be despised.  Ho one can say in what company she may be found in twenty or thirty years1 toe:  and Cyprus in the hands of a Greece in alliance with a strong Power would bo a distinct menace to us.10.-   It may, of course, be argued that under the League of Notions, no Mandatory Power may use or develop the naval and military resources of the territory for which she holds the mandate; but the future of the League of Nations will not be assured for many years to come, and meanwhile the mandates will take effect.Have we any right to throw away an asset which might be of such value m the defence either of the Empire or of tho objects of the League of Nations? History shows; that none but a strong power has succeeded in holding Cyprus, and it is to the&quot;&apos;interest of the League of Na/tions, as well as of the British Empire that we should continue to hold it now.11,-    There remains the question of self-determination, and the &quot;vast majority&quot; of Greek inhabitants of Cyprus. There are nearly 60,000 Ottoman Turks in Cyprus as against some 210,000 Greek speaking inhabitants; and although the activities 01 extremists in Greece could probably ensure that a plebiscite of the island would show a majority in favour of union with Greece, it is doubtful if there is any spontaneous desire for union in the island.It. is beyond question that tho Turkish minority are absolutely opposed to any change in the status of the island, - as is clearly shewn by the vigorous protest which they lodged after the Armistice.
There can bo no doubt that the whole Moslem population of our Empire would regard as nothing less than a betrayal, the handing over of 60,000 of their&quot; co-religionists to the Government of a country they hate and distrust.12.-    It jnay be noted., in conclusion, that under tho provisions of the Sykes-Pioot agreement,, Cyprus cannot be ceded to a third power without the consent of France. A Secret-Agreement between Greece and Italy signed on the 29th July contains a clause by which Italy remains in possession of &quot;nodes as long as Great Britain remains at Cyprus and in any case for five years..If during that period, Great Britain has ceded Cyprus, the Italians consent to a plebiscite being held in Rhodes.(Initialled)    W.H0I103.10.1.9.
