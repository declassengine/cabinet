SHOOTING OP GBRiviAH PRISONER OK BOARD H.L-.S.&quot;RESOLUTION&quot;iAdmiralty Memorandum for the war CabinetiShortly after midnight on the night of tho 23/24th of June at Scapa Plow, &apos; one of the ratings from tho German Gruiser &quot;Frankfurt1!: held as a prisoner-of-war on board H.ivi.S0 &quot;RESOLUTION&quot; was shot and killed when being marched down the deck between two sentries.    After lengthy investigation it appears that this crime was committted by an Ordinary Seaman named Woolley of the &quot;Resolution&quot;.     There is evidenco that he had told some of his messmates that he intended to kill a; German, having lost relatives himself in the war and that though his messmates endeavoured to persuade him from his purpose he lay out on top of a turret with a rifle for a period of two hours waiting for the German prisoners to be marched down the dock,   and shot the first one who came along who.died of his woundo     There is thus evidence enough to put Woolley on hif- trial for murder and probably to convict..The Admiralty consider that this case should ber brought to the notice of the War Cabinet,   as public attention must inevitably be drawn to this case sooner or later, and it is probable that the Germans will endeavour to make capital out of it aMurder cases in home waters are very rarely, if ever,, tried, by Naval Court-Lnntial and in view of the considerations of foreign policy which may be raised by it, the Admiralty propose that the case shall be handed over to the Scottish Authorities for trial in tho civil courtsc(Intlld) .
