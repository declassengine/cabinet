[F.C^3rd October,1919.IHVERffOBTH.----------oOo----------1. With the first part of the War Office Memorandum (Paras. 1-5) the Ministry of Munitions is not concerned.It is for the war Office and other Service Depart-ments to decide the minimum of stores and equipment which will be required (1) for tho demobilisation of the war time Forces, (2) for the equipment and maintenance of the peace time Forces, and (3) for the authorised mobilisation and war reserves re-quired not only for the Home Forces but to meet any undertakings as regards India and Colonial Forces to which the Government may deem it expedient to agree.In such matters the Ministry of Munitions is not competent to intervene,2.       The Ministry, however, is vitally concerned in those portions of the War Office Memorandum which deal with the method of declaration and disposal of surplus stores and material.The War Office memorandum states that the only condi-tions under which the proposal of 23rd September could becarried out in regard to Army stores arefa)   That the declaration of surpluses in bulk with only the roughest general description (no detailed lists) is accepted.(b)   That the Ministry of Munitions should take charge of the stores thus thrown up immediately they are declared surplus,
(c) That such stores are sold in situ, and that no hand-ling or transportation in regard to them is required from the Military Authorities.3.       As regards (a), it should be pointed out in the first instance that It would he impossible to dispose of stores without such detailed lists, and secondly, that as the Department hold-ing the stores has all such stores detailed on ledger charge and is responsible for the accuracy of those ledgers, obviously that Department should at any time be in a position to hand over with its declaration of surplus a detailed list of the stores concerned.4.       As regards (b) and (c), the contention in paragraph 9 of the War Office Memorandum that tho proposal referred to must necessarily involve a reversal of the War Cabinet decision, im-posing upon the War Office the duty of storage and movement of surplus stores until finally disposed of, cannot be accepted. The object of the proposalMs to facilitate rapid and efficient dis-posal by obtaining clear and. definite information as to the quan-tities of the various classes of stores and materials to be dealt with, and this can, it is submitted, be effected without any immediate and far-reaehi,ng change in organisation and . machinery.5v,      It was obviously impossible to complete the selling organisation under the Disposal Board until a more or less coo-plete picture of the nature and quantities of material to be disposed of could,be obtained, and although it is now 10f months since the Armistice nothing approaching to such a,picture has ,been provided by the Departments responsible for declaring sur-plus stores in their charge.   As it is, arrangements for disposal mado in some theatres of war are still practically inoperative, as little or no.surplus has yet been declared (e.g. Egypt).6.       It will still be necessary for the War Office to. maintain an organisation for dealing with those stores, etc. which it may be decided to.retain for Army purpose, and the
objections to the creation of a duplicated machinery under the control of two different departments for handling storage and transportation, especially in the several theatres of war,, will still in general hold good.   The Ministry is however quite prepared to consider whether there are any cases in which the arrangement approved by the War Cabinet can be advantageously modified, and in particular whether it would be possible to -relieve the War Office of the responsibility for storage and, custody in the case of any Depots,whioh contain no stores required for Army purposes,7.        It is submitted that there is nothing in the $ar Office Memorandum which should lead the Minister to alter the, recommendation which he has already made,.   In order that thedisposal of all surplus material may be effected as rapidly.....as possible and to the best advantage, financially and other-wise, to the State, it is absolutely necessary that a complete summary of the property to be dealt with should be in his possession..   This can only be secured by reversing the procedure which has hitherto been adopted; that is to say, by laying it down that&apos; all Government stores and material, wherever they may be, should in the first instance be immediately reported to this Ministry, and should be deemed to be disposable, subject to the reservation (i) of such quantities as are required by any Department for : (a) immediate requirements, (b) possible requirements in the near future, and,, (ii) in the case of the fighting services, of the quantities required(to provide Such mobilisation equipment and war reserves as may be decided upon and authorised by the Government; and further that the quanti-ties to be reserved under (i) and (ii) should be forthwith notified to the Ministry of Munitions by the Government Depart-raents concerned.
8.       This question of reserves is not one in which, as already stated, the Ministry is competent to intervene, but at the same time it should be borne in mind that in view of the rapid advances now being made by scientific researoh in jjj p, connection with all fighting services and their equipment and munitions there Is very grave risk that many of the stores now placed on reserve would become obsolete in a comparatively short space of time.9. The War Office Memorandum contains certain criticisms on the conduct by the Ministry of the business of disposal with which it is necessary to deal.With regard to the two examples given of the Ministry^ insistence on the furnishing of detailed lists of stores as a preliminary to disposal (para. 7 fi) and (ii) ), it must be obvious that no definite steps could be taken towards the disposal of the huts and hospitals referred to without details of their contents.With regard to barges, the suggostion (para.8) that all War Office barges will be required for the return of post bellum stores., from theatres of war to this Country could hardly apply to the large quantity of barges which have been lying idle at Taranto. since February, and yet were only declared surplus within the last few weeks;   nor to the large quantity of water craft of all sorts lying idle in Mesopotamia.10.      With paragraph ll of the Year Office Memorandum it will be necessary to deal in detail.(a)       This paragraph is most misleading, as it would appear to imply that ever since November 11th the War Office have been declaring stores surplus, whereas until May this year practically no stores of any importance were thrown up to the Disposal Board.The Ministry do not accept as accurate the tonnage stated in this paragraph, and would here remark that it is not clear what is meant to be covered by the word &quot;stores&apos;,&apos; as at least 180,000 tons of British filled ammunition alonehave been declared surplus by the War Office.(4) &quot;
On the other hand, the Ministry would point out that a very large.proportion of the&apos;material thrown up has consisted of salvage&apos; and scrap, or.material of a special . &quot;character not readily marketable.&apos;In spite of this, the Ministry records show that, instead of less than l/3rd, over 50  of this difficult ,,material has been disposed of. &apos;:- ; (b) (1) The contents of Purfleet depot were declared surplus , on the 1st August but the descriptions were so unsatis-factory that nothing could be done with them.   This first . -list of stores available for disposal was - withdrawn by the War Office, and new lists were subsequently declared on the 13th,-17th,&apos;18th,  3rd, and 24th September res-; respectively.   Would it be surprising, even if it were true, that nothing has been disposed of under these circumstances? Asa matter of fact the statement is not accurate, as certain disposals have taken place.&apos;1(ii) The contents of Moor Street warehouse are in fact picks&apos;and shovels of unusual character,The whole of these materials could have been sold for export some time ago, but at a very low price, which can still be accepted at any time but which has, in the first instance, been referred to the Manufacturers&quot; Assoc-iation interested-in these materials.   In the meantime every.effort has been made to obtain better prices and -the goods have been extensively advertised,&apos; but offers received were such as could not be accepted for such large quantities of implements, the sale of which at a low price in this Country might have seriously injured manufacturers of such goods.&apos;(iii) The. locomotives referred to as soon as declared surplus were notified to the Railway Authorities, who were subsequently responsible for their distribution^
9 0&quot;(b)        The Ministry does not accept the estimate made, by the War Office of the time required for selling the material already thrown up.   Some of the stores find ready markets but much is not easily saleable; and in selling commercial articles many factors have to be taken into consideration.   The possible disturbance of trade and industries for example must be constantly borne in mind, as well as the danger of playing into the hands of rinp;s, which within the knowledge of the Ministry have been formed with the express object of taking advantage of forced sales.11.      While the Ministry has constantly pressed the War   , Office to declare surplus stores in the various theatres of war as well as in United Kingdom, it has always been recognised that final decisions in such matters by the War Office were difficult to arrive at until the size, and therefore the needs, of the post-war Armies had been definitely deoide,d.   At the same time the Ministry is of opinion that considerably greater quantities of material urgently required for industrial purposes at the present time might have been thrown up,without risk and with considerable advantage to the State.   For example, large stocks of spare parts for mechanical transport are still held in this Country at contractors works on account of the War Office, while the need;for such spare parts throughout the Country is ac^te.   Considerable pressure has failed to induce the War Office to throw up large quantities of spares which, from a common sense point of view, would appear to be surplus to requirements of the post helium army,Another example to be cited, is the large quantity of mechanical transport of various kinds, much of, which is new and unused, which is being retained by the War Office.   There are for example some hundreds of new cars and chassis standing
idle at *Bulfor&amp; for which a pressing demand exists hut which the War Office will not release6   And, finallyi there is stored at Audricq in France some millions of pounds worth of Railway and Engineering stores,, much of which Ijb required in this country, but the bulk of which.has not yet been declared surplus.0-**m**-  oOo
