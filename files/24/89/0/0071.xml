DIRiiiCTOEATiJ]   OP   INTiSLLIGJilNCS6th Ootober, 1919.In view of the misrepresentations that have appeared in the Foreign Press on the subjeot of the Railway Strike, and the alarmist reports of riots and oivil war, the following message was sent to the itouter and terooni Companies for transmission to every foreign country and the British Dominions.    The message was despatched by wireless and oable last night,&quot;The Railway Strike wus settled at 4-15 tais afternoon and the men return to work: forthwith.MIt is too soon to sum up all the lessons of the strike, but it is already dear that the attempt to hold up the Government has been a gigantic failure.    The Railwaymen ha to been out  for eight days and have spent  300*000 Strike Pay without result.    They never succeeded at any time in imperilling the life of the nation.    Por this two faotors are ohiefly responsible, namely;   the admirable organisation of the emergency servioesby the Government, and the courageous and cheerful acquiescence of the whole publio in the temporary inoonvenienoes.    iJrom the first sudden stoppage of work the food supplies were absolutely assured;   elaborate arrangements were made for distributing milk and other perishables in the large towns; the mails were but slightly retarded;   the newspapers were delivered as usual; and necessary journeys throughout the oountry were performed by motor transport and a limited service of trains - driven largely by amateurs.    The attitude of the whole people has been beyond praise:   there is no question whatever of the universal determination to make the best of disoomforts, to preserve/*
- 2 -preserve order, and to form a strong Clvio Guard with that object; and above all, to refuse to allow the community to be held to ransom by any one seotion.    Por the preservation of order high tribute must also be paid to the Trade Unions -including the Railwaymen - who did their utmost to disoourage sabotage.    It is a remarkable faot that throughout the past week no rifle shot was fired, there was no single instance of death or serious injury, nor %of looting anywhere.    3Sxe situation has been serious enough, but assuredly it offers no encouragement to those who Imagined that England was a fertile field for Revolution.&quot;B.H.T.(
