PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM. From the Governor General of canada to the Secretary of State for tho Colonies.(Received Colonial ftffice, 10 a.m. 4th October, 1919.)conclusion that distinctive representation of Canada at Washington should be delayed no longer and they refer to correspondence whioh has taken place since October 13th 1917, If my advisers are correctly informed the consideration of questions between the* United States and Canada and necessary action thereon constituted two thirds or three quarters of the work at the Embassy prior to the war. After the conclusion of Peace the same condition will probably arise in most oases these questions concern pure-ly Canadian interests and often they were approached without the exact information which should have been available.   Selection of personnel of the Embassy&apos;s staff has always been without consultation with Govern-ment of Canada and apparently with no special regard to (?their) acquaintance with Canadian interests or conditions.   A strong feeling has.thus arisen in this country that effective steps should be taken to safe-guard more thoroughly Canadian interests in Washington, The two countries (?adjoin) upon a boundary line nearly 4000 miles in length and commercial and social intercourse (?are) increasing constantly.   My advisers refer as an illustration to trade conditions during five years periods from 1900 to 1919 inclusive.  During first period total trade between United Kingdom and Canada was 836,000,000-dollar^between^nJ^e^UrdtedOotober 3rd.  My advisers have arrived at
States and Canada  932,000,000 dollars and between all South American countries and United States 765,000,000 dollars.   Corresponding figures in th&amp; second period were 1967,000,000 dollars, 1262,000,000 dollars, and 1114,000,000 dollars. Figures in the third period were 432,000,000 dollars, 2318,000,000 dollars and 1639,000,000 dollars. &quot;The figures in the fourth period are 3273,000,000 dollars, 4483,000,000 dollars and 3585,000,000 dollars. The total trade between United States and Canada exceeds it will &quot;be observed that of United States and all South Amerioan countries and also by a considerable margin exceeds total trade between tho United Kingdom and Canada.  My advisers have no doubt having regard to these facts as to the necessity for distinctive repre-sentation.   They are desirous of accomplishing it upon lines, whioh will maintain and even emphasize the solidarity of the Empire but which give to this country the distinctive representation which constitutional development in recent years both (?) sanctions and demands.   They therefore propose that suoh representa-tion should be established upon the following lines which express conclusions to be embodied in Order-in-Council.   Begins.1,    Dominion of Canada shall be represented by diplomatic agent in United States duly accredited to the President Of the United States to reside at Washington in the character of Envoy Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary for Canada.2.    Canadian Minister shall be appointed by and be directly responsible to the Canadian G-government..He
HS shall receive his instructions from and shall report to Secretary of State External Affairs.3.    Subject to an agreement to be made with the United States Government Canadian diplomatic establish-ment at Washington under direction of the canadian minister shall constitute a part of &quot;the establishment-of His &apos;ajesty&apos;s Embassy.4,    In matters between United States and His Majesty in respect of the Dominion of Canada Canadian Minister shall conduct negotiations and be channel of communication at Washington.5.    In all matters between His Majesty&apos;s (Smbassy and the Canadian Government Canadian Minister shall here-after be channel of communication.6.    With the object of promoting the most complete co-operation and unity of purpose effective arrange-ments tc be i?agreed) upon between Canadian minister and His iSiajesty&apos;B Ambassador shall be made for continuous consultation in all (Itorportant) matters of common concern and for such necessary concerted action (group undercypher able) consultation as they may determine.    They shall refer to their respective Governments for settlement any matter which they may be able to adjust by consultation between themselves.7.    In particular such forms and mode of procedure shall be agreed upon.as will prevent embarrassment or confusion on the part of United States Government in respect of channel of ?subsequent communication.8,    Further negotiations at Washington of matters now pending betwwen united States and Canada shall be conducted by and throuefr Canadian Minister ends.-The matter is somewhat urgent as the Canadianitar
War Mission at Washington has been practically closed. My advisers hope that they may be favoured with views of His Majesty&apos;s Government with as little delay as possible.Communicated to Washington.EEiTONSHIHS.
