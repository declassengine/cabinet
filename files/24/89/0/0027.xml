The majority of these boys would in ordinary course havo emigrated or have been taken for military service had conscription applied to Ireland..The so youths are gradually absorbing the teaching which young violent priests and others have instilled into them.     They have been taught that in committing murder and outrage against police and soldiers,, they are rendering tho highest form&apos;of service to their country.-This..party is daily increasing in number.and &apos; practically dominates tho population in Central, . Southern and&apos;Western Ireland.. .. Their aims an&amp; objects are well described in the&apos; memoranda attached..As regards tho attitude of the Church and&apos;what is known, as the &quot;moderate Sinn. Fein party&quot;&apos; it Is no doubt true that they are. opposed to tho proceedings of the oxtroraicts.,    But tt Is ojiite, certain that they id&apos;11 not properly denounce it cr give the least effective assistance in repressing it.. &apos;grapple with this formidable conspiracy is the first and immediate task of the present.&apos;Irish Government..The situation is such that in my opinion the adoption of Liartial Law in certain districts.would net be too drastic a. measure,.&apos;but before proceeding so.far I fool that every available means of crushing this murderous band should bo adopted and in this respect I do not think, our res euro as are yet exhausted.-,-1-
-2- 90To use those resouroen to the full, however, the Irish Government i:tuot have a perfectly free hand, and whatever demands in reason the;; may have to mahe on the Imperial Government, whether financial, administrative, or otherwise, must be met without delay.The following are tho most Important points requiring attention j *1. The Secret Service must be improved,   Honey must notbe spared in employing all possible detective resourceg to the utmost,   1  trill not further indicate on paper the Cireo-tion in which these inovations should proceed, but I have discussed them carefully with the proper Authorities,2. An extension of the powers conferred by Section 14 (b)of the Defence of the ReaIn Act   so as to enable arrests to be made on suspicion, in the same manner as this clause was more than onco used during tho war,3* A liberal assistance  nment of prison accommodation in all the parts of the British Isles outside Ireland./Irish prisons afford, no adequate accommodation for prisoners interned under the provisions of the Defence of the Realm Act   and. it is to the last degree inadvisable to keep such prisoners in the country.If these powers are used coupled with measures which have already been taken by the Irish Governments I think it may be possible to breah up these gan^e an&apos;-: to briiir; the murderers to justice.   If we succeed in doing        it trill go far to restore such confidence throughout the general population as will induce then to range themselves on the&apos;side of the lav and help in n$tt$l($tng; it.If those measures fail to do so there is no other alter-native but the establishment of Ilartial La:/ wherevor Civil Lavr proves ineffective *It is of the utmost importance that the Constabulary and Police in Ireland should be supported to the utmost in the arduous, difficult and dangerous work they are called upon to p&amp;fovmp   For this reason I deeply regret the delay in passing the &quot;Constabulary and Police Ireland Bill&quot; and I trust that it 17ill be quichly disposed of whon Parliament meets arj,ain.In the meantime I urgently beg that ths $roesury may bo empowered to sanction a further advance of  10 to tho Royal Irish Constabulary and tho Dublin Military Police, pending the passing of the Bill.I would also ask sanction for the increase in the nuubers of the ,rG&quot; Division, Etablin Military Police.   This is most urgently needed,In view of tho possibility of an early reduction being made in the .rmy in Ireland, I thinh immediate steps should be taken to Increase the establishment of the Royal Irish Con-stabulary.   In this connection I would ur^e upon tho Cabinet the importance of securing tho best and most efficient superior officers for that force.*phere should be effective machinery to enable the Irish Government tc replace old or disabled officers without undue hardship upon them.In this respect matters are at present in an unsat* 1a fac tory condition.
attitude of the discharged ana repatriated soldier in Ireland will, in future, exorcise a material effect upon tho social condition of the population.    Thanks to tho excellent work n&apos;h\ch has been uo:.io by tho Central Committee in Dublin in aid of Returned and Discharged soldiers and sailorsx the inducements which, have be on lavishly held out to thorn by the Siinv-Fein element   have not succeeded In drawing any groat number of them from the paths of loyalty and good-citizenship.    The Irish Government havo, however, experienced the greatest trouble and difficulty in getting tho financial assis-tanoo by which alone theijo loyal societies can mako their influence felt.I therefore wish to express to the Cabinet my sure conviction that no better or more effective means could be adopted for the pacification of Ireland than to give the utmost encouragement financially  ,nd other?/lae to this Central Committee which is established in.Dublin to watch over tho interests of old soldiers throughout the country.It must be remembered also that Ireland has an enormous sea board in proportion to her size and therefore a very largo maritime population. (The Haval Commander-in-chief in Ireland, Admiral Sir Charles Tupper, has been most energetic in his endeavours to watch over the interests of men who havo boon discharged from the Wavy, and in establishing soa scouts and training organisations all round tho coast.    I feel sure it is all in the best interests of the country to give him the greatest possible support,I regard it as of greet&apos;importance that thoso purely Irish bills which are now waiting introduction to tho House of Commons, viz. ftu, &quot;Education Bill,&quot; and the &quot;Land for Soldiers Bill&quot; should be pressed on and passed as quickly as possibletThe future pacification of the country largely depends upon the successful administration of th^se measures,
As r gards the political situation^i agree generally v:ith the memorandum from the First Lord of the Admiralty now before the Cabinet.   1 wish, however, to emphasize his remarks with regard to the grievances which Ireland claims to have against England.Vhilst t have always thought that Ireland, apart from Ulster/should be granted a measure of Home Rule, my comparatively short experience of Irish administration has not only confirmed me in this opinion/: but has convinced me that no Irish Government &apos; hich is net in close touch with the Representatives of the people can do the best work for Ireland;I am entirely at one &apos;4th the First Lord in his views as to the Federal system and its adoption in Ireland..  I think the Imperial Government 3hould at once proceed to determine upon their policy and then announce their intention of carrying that policy into effect a3 soon.as the state of the country permits.In fact I am ail in favour of Buch an announcement as the First Lord $vg&amp;ests in his memorandum,Although,at the last General Election 75 sit on-Feinera were elected nominally on a republican ticket, the Vast majority of Veters who supported; them had, and have, no desire for a Republic.   Some of them recorded their votes purely because they were intimidated and others from a desire to overthrow the Irish- party and to protest against the English Government&apos;s shelving of the Irish Home Rule demand.If the policy&apos; of coercion and-repression which ia rendered absolutely necessary -by the state of the country is not accompanied ,by any definite statement aa to a legislative &quot;settlement, I fear it v. ill strengthen the position of the Extremists, thrive a larger number&apos;, cf the youth of the country into their ranks, and alienate the moderate men. of middle.and&apos;old age.As regards the political situation, therefore, I think immediate&apos;action should be taken by the Imperial Government on seme such Line as indicated, in the memorandum of the First Lord of the Admiralty.(intd,)     P.
hoto; oh;SIM mm VJAIT A1ID RBAD,It la quite evident to everybody In Ireland that v/o are going through one of tho most critical periods j&amp; tho history of our country,      The fate of the Irish Nation is tremblin0 in the balance.    The toilsome and dangerous work of the past year has boriDe fruit, and. tho &quot;Republic&quot; established by the Irish &quot;Volianteers&quot; in 1916 now possesses a proporly constituted National Government whose authority Is recognised by the Irish people as a whole. But the foreign usurper still maintains his army of occupation.Ireland is still garrisoned by the &quot;Hirelings&quot; of the foreigner in huge numbers and provided with every implement and equipment of modern warfare.    The Irish army is still confined to the trenches, Its offensive activities being confined to r-iids snd sniping.   It is certain that their loyalty and courage will be tested in the next few months.      The enemy is growing desperate and at the,same time soothing for Irish blood.   The Royal Irish Constabulary and soldiers of the military are being made to understand that they cannot carry on their blackguardism any longer.   The higher placed agents of the enemy will be taught the same lesson.     The Sinn Seiners are the right army of the Irish Republican Army. A state ofrebellion will now exist between England and Ireland. The fat? of Ireland will be determined for good or evil in a very short time, and the result will depend largely on the fidelity of tho Irish people.Beware Irish Volunteers do not bo asleep when tho critical hour comes.     As regards the capture of the two policemen by three Sinn Seiners who deprived them of life and arras - was what you may call courage and bravery on the pert of our 3ooiety.   \% bo asked, do wo recognise English Jbw, a few there are who may, but I say whoever do Is not a true friend to his cou try but a cursed traitor to an overburdened community.    Irish Volunteers I appeal to you one and all in the n^me of your oppressed country to bowaro of Policemen and Soldiers and all paid officials of the British Government. I warn you once and for all not to have cut, shuffle or deal with them.    Bon&apos;t snoer at them In any way, nor give them any information nor food nor fuel of any sort for wo expect to gain our independence when we clean them out of our taxed Isle*   V/e ore not? going to have an Irish Republio set up in College Green and the exooutivo will bo Bail Biroan.Three oheers for the Irish Republioen Army.I remain,A Soldier tf the Irish Republican Army.
SECIES!. CRIME SPECIAL.INFORMATION. FROM A RELIABLE INFORMANT.It Is intended to develop the Irish Republican Brotherhood in Ireland and Great Britain and on a very large scale in America - in fact to make it a worldwide society.      The Brotherhood is strictly secret and bound by cath, and its primary object is t*. band together Irishmen who are willing to risk their lives for the cause of freedom and for the destruction of the British Empire.      There are centres in London, Liverpool, Birmingham, Cardiff, Manchester and Glasgow.      In Ireland the principal centres are Belfast, Dublin, Derry, Galvay., Enniscorthy, Kilkenny, Ork and Limerick.   It was reorganised from the remnants of the old IriBh Republican Brotherhood, In 1915 and had a fairly large membership in 1916 &quot;hen the Rising interrupted organisa-tion.     Persons &quot;ho have belonged to a Sinn Fein Club for two years and are Irish Irelanders are eligible for membership if introduced by a member.Diarmuid Lynch is Director-in*Chief in America and John f)&apos;Hurley occupies a similar prsition in Ireland.This Society is mainly responsible for the recent raids on Barracks and assassination of the police.Advantage is taken of sport meetings etc. for the purpose of secret organization.It is net expected that the majority of Sinn Feiners will Join this secret Society - the membership of which in former days consisted mainly of the labouring class.It is reported to be devoting particular attention to preparation for the coming Local Government   Elec-tions which as they control the public purat are regard-ed as of more importance than the parliamentary Elections.
