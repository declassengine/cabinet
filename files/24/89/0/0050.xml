i&amp;PLOTEOIT   OF   YOUNG   P3HS0HS   BILL.(circulated by the florae Secretary).The object of this Bill which I circulate for the information of the Cabinet is to give power to regulate the employment of persons between 14 and 18 in all occupations other than in factories and works, mines and quarries where their employment is already regulated.     The employment of children under 14 has been provided for by the Employment of Children Act, 1903, and the Education Acts, but apart from the Faotory and Mines Acts, practically no provision is made for the protection of boys and girls over that age. Attention was drawn before the war to the evils consequent on the unregulated e- playment of juvenile labour especially in &quot;blind alley&quot; occupations.     In 1912. Mr. Mc^enna who was then Home Secretary appointed a Committee to inquire into the employment of van-boys and warehouse boys and this Committee which reported in 1913 recommended the regulation of hours and conditions of work. Since the war the problem has been aggravated by the employment of large numbers of juveniles in war work who cannot readily be absorbed in regulated occupations and will run the risk of drifting into uncontrolled and uneconomical work with injurious results both to themselves and the community-The matter was dealt with in reports which were made during the war to the Ministry of Reconstruction, especially in the Fifth Interim Report of the Civil War Workers Committee.The Bill which has been settled in consultation with the Board of Education, Ministry of Labour and other Departments concerned gives power to the Secretary of State to make general regulations as to the age below whioh young persons shall not be employed in any occupation and as to the hours and conditions of employment.     The Bill also gives power to local authorities, by an extension of the provisions of the Employment of Children Act, to make local bye-laws (supplementing the general regulations) for the employment of persons between 14 and 18 and raises the age in respect of which street-trading bye-laws can be made from 16 to 18. -The Bill involves no expenditure other than the small cost of administrationI should like to introduce the Bill as soon as possible after I Parliament meets.
