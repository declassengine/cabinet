:,     -  103HIS DOCWtJ;&apos;^&apos; IS Til   P.&apos;OP. i^TY OF HIS BRITAiTiUO :T,UATOrlS PQVSRH? J-VIT).T. 8330.&quot; . &apos; JAR CA3IIi.:T.ACuUCULTURAh LABOUR. (Hemorandup. by the Secretary for Sootlaiv&apos;).1. I agree generally with the views contained In thoMemorandum of 15th September by the President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries (G.T.8158), and I supoort his proposals.   The  noto and arguments set forth in his lie: lorandum arc for the m03t -part &quot;applicable to Scotland. I have to request that all administrative cuties relating to agricultural labour in Scotland should be allocated to the Scottish Board.2. Uhile no special Parm &quot;,&apos;orJcers1 Branch has beenformed in the Board of Agriculture in Scotland, as has been done in the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, yet in recent years the Board have been closely concerned with questions relating to the supply of agricultural labour under war conditions*   They have come to bo recognised by the agricultural community as the Depart-ment best fitted to deal, In the first instance at any rate, with all such questions*   A very largo correspond-enoe with farmers, crofters and farm labourers has been, carried on.   The arrangement no;: proposed would seem to be a logical development of tho position in which this work, combined with the administration of Part II of the Corn Production Act, has placed the Board with reference to agricultural labour,3. The duties relating to the Scottish Y&apos;onenfs land army which were undertaken by the Board, may be mentioned in- this connection, while the proposed formation of a \ic .i:ifs Branch in tho Board would enable the.&apos; to Aoal in the futtrre with all matters touching the welfare and con-ditions of employment of fe:*.alc agricultural workers.4. I may add that the greater the share which the board may have In the administration of rural housing schemes, the more appropriate it will bo that thoy should be the department dealing with labour questions, sowe of which are intimately associated with housing difficulties.R, iimiHO.September 2Cth; 1019.
