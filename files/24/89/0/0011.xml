It is hoped that the matter will shortly be arranged and that SoS, &quot;Kursk&quot; will be cleared within a week,s*30 i?Pyrgos&quot; left Archangel on 16th September  with military stores for &quot;the Balticc.Go,Ti.er.al Si JmliojiJui. BalticOn. September 15th Colonel Tallents reports an inter-view which he had with General Laidoner,   The latter stated that in view of the Bolshevik offer of peace Esthonia^ position was a very difficult one. and rendered more so by &quot;the failure of the Allies and Admiral&quot;Kolchak to recognise Esthonia&apos;s independence.    He laid great, emphasis &quot;upon the importance of their maintaining close relations with the Allies He stated that there was no fear of Bolshevism amongst the Esthonian Army or people; also,, that ho did not regard the &quot;&quot;Bolshevik offer of peace as sincere, but rather as a clever move to embarass the new Baltic Governments, and the result of a shortage of military supplies amongst the Bolsheviks,, This opinion is shared by others.Colonel Tallents gathered from subsequent conversa-tion with Esthonian Prime Minister that at present General Laidoner is too compromising to satisfy po?political needs of  . the situation. \It.....
It is also reported that the morale of the Estonian Array is very low.There is no truth in the statement that Rodzianko has been proclaimed C-in-C. in place of Yudenitch.(It is now clear that the Governments of Esthonia^ Latvia, Lithuania and Finland are likely to commence negotiation with the Bolsheviks in&apos;tho early future.    It is also reported that tho North -Jest Russian Government has been invited,&apos; H,M. Government has cautioned the Governments of esthonia and Latvia against making peace, and these Governments have promised to keep us informed of the progress of events.    It is evident that the programme of the Baltic States will be identical. The North&quot; &apos;fest Russian Government has acknowledged the f,de facto Government of Latvia and H.M. Government is doing so as regards Lithuania.The situation in Latvia as regards tho German evacuation is unchanged.The war Office has instructed the British Military Mission to continue supply of war material, so far as possible, to Russian North &apos;.?ost Army, in view of the continuation of offensive operations.   If any surplus&apos;remains it is to be handed over&apos; to Latvia, Lithuania and Esthonia to act as a lever to delay the conclusion of peace with Bolsheviks.  Peace negotiations will probably commence at Dorpat on 29th. Sentembermm MispuThe French Foreign Legion has embarked at Archangel on board s..s. &quot;Woermann&quot;*    French Officers on board, in order to ensure proper discipline, have been instructed to proceed to the Baltic&quot;, there dissolve the Legion, and afterwards return to France.Belay is expected in getting all barges and lighters away from Archangel owing to the setting-in of bad weather having made a Tug for each lighter necessary.   The P.N.T.O., Archangel, proposes turning over to the Russian Naval Staff such as will have to be left behind, obtaining a receipt and written guarantee that they will be destroyed&apos;when Archangel is finally evacuated.    The number of these Lighters is 47, of which 10 are provided for but cannot sail on account of weather.The small craft evacuated from Archangel is to be collected at Murmansk and prepared for voyage to United Kingdom.The final withdrawal of Naval forces from Murmansk is to synchronise with the final evacuation of Military forces from that Port.On the 14th September operations commenced on tho Kem front against konchozoro and Koikori;.  latter is reported to be in flames but no news received of its capture.   After having taken Kavgora and Lijma, British and Russian troops, with armoured train and artillery, in support, advancing&apos; down railway, captured the entrenched position&apos; of the enemy at siding 7,      They have now advanced several miles south of Lijma&quot;village.   After crossing Lidma inlet under protection of our flotilla Russian and Serbian troops landed at&quot;Vatinavolok with a view to capturing siding 5.  An enemy fleet of 15 vessels which had sailed from Petrozavodsk *to intercept this movement was attacked by our aircraft and forced to retutn to harbour in confusion.    So far our casualties are 0 wounded.The attack by British Marines at Ustruna and Koikori on Lake Onega on September 8th and 9th was not successful.Monitors &quot;M,25?1 and &quot;27&quot; were demolished up river ( as there was insufficient water to withdraw them.
VTjl 11The British Array of the Rhine Intelligence Report draws attention to a War Ministry Order issued at Berlin on the 24th July,, 1919, directing that old rifles in the hands of local defence forces be exchanged for new and efficient (1098) patterns.   It is pointed out that this order appears to be a contravention of article 177 of the Peace Troaty which forbids members of Societies of discharged soldiers to be exercised in the use of arms.Another order is quoted modifying certain appellations in order to renew or continue the mahufaciaire of engines of war and thereby evade as far as possiile the Execution ofm the Peace Treaty.    The articles affected are mainly R-.B. equipments.BLAQK.

The mission is instructed to&apos; enter into close relations with those Governments and. to extend Polish influence in the Baltic.The Supreme Council in Paris have decided to hold a plebiscite in Teschen to decide whether the population wish to be Polish or Czechoslovak.MILThe press quotes Lord Fisherfs articles in the &quot;Times&quot; as an irrefutable argument against the completion of France&apos;s Dreadnought programme, and expresses the hope that naval estimates will not provide for the continuance of work, suspended in 1915? on war vessels whoso designs are now obsolescent *The French Government have in view an extensive programme of merchant ship construction; a voto of 1,020 million francs has been asked for for this purpose.

Tho British Officers, with flag of truce, will not new be sent out unless Petln.ra? s troops advance on OdessauThe evacuation of tho Caucasus has been carried out so rapidly that the only troops remaining by September 17th will be those protecting animals and stores at Batoimu   Bat can is to remain under British control pending a final decision on policy, and sufficient troops to maintain our authority and protect the province are to be left therebility of Denikin maintaining a Russian gunboat at Batoum, where the presence of his supporters is much resented,.It is reported that a secret agreement has been concluded between Azerbaijan and Georgia by which both parties agree to prevent the Volunteer Army and the Entente Powers from entering Trans-Caucasia? and common action is to^be taken against Armenia, . Both parties will join the Bolsheviks and Young Turks.    A combined Georgian-Tartar force Is being formedArmenians have commenced *Denikin is satisfied that all is now well in Trans-CaspiacAdmiral Gerasimova Chief of Naval Staff to Denikin, otatas that he has already manned the Caspian flotilla with 1,200 ranks and ratings,,    As this statement is doubted the British Military Mission is sending an Officer to report the situation at PetrovslcGeneral &quot;Jrangol continues to repel the Bolsheviks North of Tzaritzyn but has lost ground to the South.  Pressure against Don troops &quot;severe, and pressure on Denikin&apos;s centre has increased. *Itis reported that a new anti-Bolshevik rising has captured Saratov and Penza.The Roumanian Government deny categorically that they have interfered with the transport of food by water into Budapest, except during the first few days^ when they say the situation was hot yet clear, and they only wished to prevent speculation.    Further, they say they have no wish to inter-fere with the supplies of the,town, and on the contrary are making every effort to facilitate matters.    General Gorton is, they claim ; the best witness of this.The prime Minister has complained of the over-bearing attitude of Admiral Troubridge; and says it was quite unjustifiable^ as the Roumanians have m ho way interfered with him in the execution of his duties, beyond taking the necessary precautions of controlling all communication between the two banks of the Danube at Budapest.Mr, Bratiano has renewed his instructions to the Military Command at-Budapest to work in accord with Admiral Troubridge and facilitate the entry of supplies into the town in every&quot;possible way.The French, especially Monsieur De St. Aulaire, -are persuading the Roumanians that they are doing all they Can &quot;for them, but are unable to withstand the hostile attitude of Great Britain and America.    The American Minister spoke v^ery bitterly to Mr. flattigan recently about this, which he described with some justice as &quot;a pretty mean stunt&quot;. - sM. Pichon recently informed M. Mi3u that France sympathisedwith ....;.*
with Roumania, but could do nothing in view of the bitter animosity of Mr* Hoover.hiimblThe Roumanian Government have announced that they will remove their troous in accordance with the orders of the Sunrome Council and cease the removal of rolling stock, machinery, agricultural implements, etc other &quot;than those originally pillaged from Roumania,    lio reports have so far come in to show that they are actually carrying out their udertakings.&quot;The winter promises to be most critical for Budapest. Admiral Troubridge has organised a system of feeding the city but states that the means at his disposal are far below what is necessary.bulgaria,The Supreme Council has decided to grant the Bulgarian Delegation 25 days to formulate its observations on the peace Treaty, instead of a month, which had been requested.The Peace Treaty will be handed to the Delegation on September 19th.The Naval and Air Clauses of the Treaty are as follows the naval terms provide that from the date of the coming into force of the Treaty, all Bulgarian warships, including submarines, existing*or under construction, are finally to be surrendered to the principal Allied and Associated.

He has given assm ance iro Pittalugo that dis-turbances and hostility to other Allies will not take placc? but it was considered- that he may not be able to prevent this.The present position of British and French troops billeted in the town was most unsatisfactory, and it was considered that they should be withdrawn or strbnglv reinforced, and itVas also considered that a Battleship shoiild be sent unless H was decided to withdraw from Fiume altogether.The Rear Admiral was informed that the policV of 1 non-interference was still in force, that it was hot intended to increase the British Naval Forces at Fiume, and that^V should the O.C.-Troops consider it desirable to embark his men, \ R.A. was to comply and proceed to Malta.Owing to the position of the British troops having rapidly become impossible, owinp to the marked hostility of the rebel troops, they were embarked in H.M.8. &quot;Cardiff^ and- .&quot;Ceres&quot;...&apos;

When she arrives onthe Station, &quot;Bramble&quot; is to be paid off, and sold on the Station, her crow being sent to England.ABYS3TNL.URas Taffari, the Regent and Heir Apparent, has earned great unpopularity in tho past by his desiro&apos; to ask for tho assistance of European advisors^   This uolicy seems however to be moro acceptable to tho Abyssinians at tho present time, but unfortunately it is difficult to eradicate the deep-rooted suspicion among the Abyssinians of British designs on their independenceo    It has therefore been suggested that the Abyssinians should be givon tho Port of 2aila, in the Gulf of Aden, end a corridor loading to it.   The possession of a port is the dearest wish of the Abyssinian^ heart, and would probably go far to removing his suspicions of our intentions.    In return for this it is suggested that Lake Tsana should be ceded to the British.This proposal is of course based on the suggestion that the European advisers referred to above should be supplied by the British,    It is difficult to imagine that any useful purpose would be served by cimixed body of advisers who would each have axes of their own&apos;to grindo&apos;But any such sugfrestion assumes the consent of theit ionAbyssinian affairs, a condition wh: however desirable it may appear,- offers little hope of realisationcThe latest news from Abyssinia is that the political situation has improved and tho British Minister consi&amp;ors the danger of a revolution is averted.A French Lawyer has accepted employment with the Abyssinian Government as Legal Adviser.    The British Govern-ment propose to make a protest to the French Government against this appointment, as being entirely contrary to the spirit of the&apos;tripartite agreement of 1906.ALLIEDRED   SEa*HAS. &quot;Tcpaze&quot; is now on her way home, and is duo &amp;t Dovonport on September 24 th.
