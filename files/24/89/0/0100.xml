The total area of land administered by the Board remains the same as that mentioned in last week&apos;s report, namely 18,613 acres,Treasury sanction has been received during the week to the purchase of 7&apos;3 acres of land at Kinson5 near Bournemouth, proposed to be devoted to the land settlement of 20 men discharged from the Army as tuberculous who are being trained in agriculture by the ,A. atthe Kin:on Colony, near Bournemouth.     The Treasury have, however, informed the Board that they are not satisfied that it is the function of this Department to provide small holdings for tuberculous men. unless and. until they have been sufficiently restored to health to take their place with other ex-Service men and not to require special supervision and treatment.     In these circumstances, while the Treasury have agreed to the purchase of   he la...d, thoy are not prepared, pending further consideration, to sanction the proposed expenditure en the provision ef cottages, etc.     They request that the matter may be further discussed with the Ministry of Health,
An additional 59 ex-Service men commenced work on their holdings or as wag$-earner3 at the various i&apos;&apos;ar^ settlements during the week, bringing the total number of such men now at tho Settlements up to 304, consisting of 129 settlers, 143 probationers and 32 oth*,r men working as wag 0-earner3,     In addition 24 men have been accepted as small holders or probationers, but hrr/u not yet commenced woylei     The increase during the week is duw to tho fact that possession has now buon obtained of five additional Settlements,     At Tit^chf ie-ld 49 cx-3 or vice men havo been allotted holdings and nine have taken up their holdings at Klimington.   At Wantage,,   which is to bo devoted to ex-officers, - and women, throe officers and five women of the Land Army have commenced work during the week,The weekly reports received from the Directors show that at i-atrington excellent progress has been made with harvest work, and it is expected that harvest operations will be completed on the 11th instant.     Ploughing in beans has started and wheat sowing is being pushed on.     Tho steam tackle is busy ploughing up stubble and preparing the land for sowing.     Harvest operations have been paid for by piece-work and all tho settlers have worked very satisfactorily.     250 sheep for this Settlement were purchased at the Sheep Pair at Dr if field during the week.     Ov,ring to the rail&apos; ay strike, a comparatively small number of buyers attended and a very useful lot of animals were purchased at exceptionally low prices.At Holbeach the settlers are busy threshing their corn crops which are turning out to bo very satisfactory,     Harvest is now completed, with the exception of the beans, which are expected to be in stack within a day or so.     At Heath Hi 13 harvest is now complete, both on the Central Farm and on the settlers&apos; holdings. Many of tho settlers are growing a large quantity of damsons which have realised very high prices.     At pombr ey a few fields have been lot to local ex-Service men, but the provision cf the market garden holdings will have to wait until the new cottages have been completed The remainder of the crops will be carted during the present week;. The cattle are improving steadily and grass is very plentiful. Owing to the railway strike a cattle train containing 180 cattle and 326 sheep was held up at Burry -ort and the Director arranged to accommodate this stock until it would be dealt with,     Most of the -animals have now been allotted to butchers, but 17 Irish miIking cows still remain which the -Board are endeavouring to purchase,At Hollestcn all tho grain crops have been harvested and stacked in good condition, with tho exception of- about 40 acres cf barley still to be got in,     45 acres of wheat have been sown during the week.     At Amesbury the Director is enquiring of the probationers who are at present housed in Army i;:&apos;uts whether they desire to commence work on their small holdings at once, but it is anticipated that the majority will prefer to wait until the cottages arc ready for occupation, so that they may be housed on their holdings.     The sowing of winter oats has nov/ been finished, the total acreage sown being 123 acres,     26 soldiers from the adjoining Military Camp are working at this Settlement on potato picking.     At Berwick St. James, possession of which was obtained daring the week,  three ex-Service men have commenced work on probation.     The chief work has been threshing and ploughing and 17 acres of rye were sown during the week,-     Throe ex-officers have taken up their holdings at Bosbury, but it will not bo possible to accept further officers until the Office of .-.orks have erected the &quot;hut-dwellings&apos;&apos; that havo been arranged.As stated above, a number of holdings have been provided at Titchfiold, possession of which has now been obtained.     The
Tho tot^l number of smell holdings on this est to now number 124, of which 120 zrb between ono and ton Acres in extent.     Tho nee-holdings provided for ox-Service men during tho week v: ry in extent from one to   -five acres find tho rents hnve been fixed at  4 per acre for the first year and  5 per acre for the seoond and subsequent years.     Voluntary arrangements have been made for three of the former small holders to give up their holdings immediately, and this land has been divided among six ex-Servicc applicants,     Tho lend allotted to the small holders has been ploughed by the Board, and the settlers are busy cleaning their plots and preparing the ground for planting during the present month,     At the Estate Sale held on the 27th ult, the Board purchased eight horses and dead stock at a total cost of  1,195.( ii)   \vork of   Agricultural Executive Committees.Prosecution,       The Dennis Estates, Limited, hove been fined  10 and  5 costs on each of ten summonses for negligently refusing to carry out Cultivation Orders served on them by the Lindsey A.3.C.     The Orders required certain fields to be cultivated and planted by the 1st May, 1919.     It was admitted by the defendants&apos; Solicitor that the work had not been done, and the only defence was that it was not reasonably possible to do the work owing to the position and the nature of the soil. A number of farmers and others were brought to give evidence to this effect, and also as to the waterlogged condition of the land.     The Committee maintained and brought evidence to show that the land was suitable for cultivation, and that its water-logged condition would almost entirely disappear if the interior drainage of tho farm were put into proper order.     A drainage notice had been served on the defendants and in the Committee&apos;s opinion if it had been complied with the land would have been in a fit condition to cultivate.     The defendants wore convicted and fined as above, but ten other sumenses for wilfully refusing to carry out similar orders wore dismissed,Determination of Tenancies,     At the request of the host Riding A.XC, the Board have issued an Order determining the tenancy of a 10 acre Holding at JUppondeU;     The land is reported to be in a neglected state and to be getting worse.     The tenant, who is over 80 years of age, is unable to, carry out the necessary work;   he has neither man, horse, nor implements, and the Holding is understocked.     The farm is too small to furnish a livelihood, but a neighbouring farmer is willing to take it over as soon as the Uotico takes effect.(iii)   Land Drainage.River Ouso,   The first of tho three dredgers ordered for work above Denver Sluice has been completed, and pr-occeded up river from King&apos;s Lynn on October 2nd,     The othor two are expected to be ready for work by October 10th and October 24th respectively.     When all three are at work, it is proposed to resume the hand labour on the banks which was suspended early in September,     Local labour only wi11 bo employed.     The following is a summary of the preparatory work which was carried out immediately above Denver Sluice.i.   Complete surveys of the river were m^de with oross-soctions every 5 chains from the outfall of the river to King&apos;s Lynn (about 3 miles) and from Denver Sluice to Brandon Creek (about 6 miles).
ii. All trees, &quot;bushes, stumps and woods wore cleared frtm the banks between Denver 31uice and tho &apos; isscy, and material v;as faggotted up for use in bank repairs,iii, 8000 cubic yrds of material was excavated, and tho bank made good with properly graded slopes and prepared to receive material oredged cut of the river.Draft Ordor.   A draft order  increasing the bcrrcv/ing powers of tho Thcrncy Drainage Board (lorfclk) h;ss been deposited,( iv) Tithe, Commons , Copyhold and ourvey,In view of tho fact that one cf tho chief objects ef the Tithe Act, 1918, \ as to facilitate redemption, the following statement may bo of interest as shoving the extent to which that object is being achieved:-Received		Affected	1913	1919	1913	1919		j? ex.	p102	233	402	2070118	284	426	319289	315	410	5576309	832	fl,318            	108381st Quartor 2nd quarter 3rd quarterTotal fcr first three quarters cf year.It v;ill bo observed that the amount of tithe rentcharge included in applications for redemption received during the first three quarters of this year is over eight times tho amount for the corresponding period of the pre- ar year, 1913,The number of applications fcr merger received also shows an increase as compared with the corresponding period for the pro-Sar year, 1913. though the increase has not been so marked as in in the case of redemptions, the number of applications received being 181 as compared with 126 in 1913.     The applications for enfranchisement received during Jan..-Sept., 1919, numbered 226 as against 136 during the period Jan, - except, 1913.Prom tho above table it v.1 ill bo scon that tho increase of redemption work this year has become &quot;mere marked each quarter and there are grounds fcr thinking that this upward tendency will become even mere noticeable during the last quarter of the year and possibly during next year also.     In this connection tho following table showing particulars of redemption applications received in the first woek of October in t&apos;:is and previous years may bo of interest.1st * eek in October.ilumber cf Applications   Amount of TitheReceived,Rent charge in-eluded in such applications,		 ,	3,	d.1913	10	24	9	11914	3	9	16	01915	2	2	17	01916	4	25	7	01917	2	18	10	11910	4	30	9	21919	34	1,091	1	3
In addition to redemption applioations the exceptionally high numbers of 17 applications for Altered Apportionment, 10 applications for merger, and 6 for the Enfranchisement of Copyhold, were received during-the week.The Board have recently received from the Trustees of about 213 Recreation Grounds allotted under the Inclosuro Acts, 1845 to 1899, reports as to the&quot; management of the grounds, with particulars of the rents received by them.   The reports show that in about 161 of theso casos these grounds are used for the purpose of recreation as intended but that&apos;about 52 are not being used for that purpose.   Somo of the reports disclose case3 of encroachments by private landowners upon the grounds and. of the unlawful use of tho grounds for purposes other than those for which they were allotted. In other cases surplus rents arising from the Recreation Grounds have been applied in directions not authorised by the Inclosure Acts. The Board are in communication with the Trustees in all suoh cases of irregularity.Technical Division.Requirements and Disposal Section.During the week ended October 4th returns of sales were forwarded from Bast Sussex, Bucks, Cheshire, Somerset, West Riding, Leicester, Norfolk and Essex (Bois Hall).   Tho returns show that the following have been disposed of:-2855 Tractors3786 Tractor ploughs2700 Miscellaneous Tractor Implements3210 Binders100 Mowers and Reapers 4951 Horse Ploughs 1200 Drills1976 Carts and Lorries. 4255 Harrows and Cultivators 2305 Rollers and Presses 248 Potato Diggers.211 Spraying- Machines (including 139 Knapsack) 5869 Whippletrees 273 Threshing Machines 521 Box Vans and Cars 31 Motor Cycles 975,995 has been realised in respect of the sale of machinery and implements above enumerated.   Up to date 788 sales have been he!4 for whioh 782 -returns have been submitted.Good prices are still*being obtained.   At Horthwich whipplotroes fetched 55/- per set, a cart  34, a binder  51 and a disc harrow  24. 108.   At Bridgwater a Pordson tractor was purchased for  102. 10s. while for a Titan tractor  140 was obtained.&quot;The Leicester Committee have disposed of two threshing machines to purchasers who will use the boxes in tho district!. The question of the sale of binders has been tason up with Counties which hold a considerable number as it is fearod that disposal at this ooriod might be unwise,   where Committees advise that the machines will find, ready purchasers it is proposed to proceed with sales, but in cases where Committees are of opinion that binders will not now fatoh reasonable prices - and probably get ir/bo the hands of dealers - endeavours will bo made to arrange cheap swerege until May or June next when farmers will be inclined to buy and bcrber prices should be obtained.
Traotor Section.   During the-week ondod the 19th September, 1185 tractors were Tn the hands of Committees and 036 of these were held by contractors under the New Tractor Scheme.The returns received showed that 3101 acres were piought 2746 acres cultivated and 2305 acres reaped by tho 472 tractors at work under both schemes, giving an average of 6.7, 5.8, and 4.9 acres respectively.   Harvesting operations were carried out in 22 counties.Tho hir-hoet average acreage was recorded in the Isle of Bly, where 4 tractors ploughed 57 aores and cultivated 78 acres giving an average of 14,3 acres and 19,5 acres respectively. The most work, however, was done in Norfolk where 37 tractors ploughed 347 acres, cultivated 62 acres and reaped 392 acres, giving an average of 9,4, 1.7 and 15,9,acres respectively. ;Supply of petrol and paraffin during strike.     Some complaints have been received as regards &quot;fine difHcuHy of obtaining petrol for agricultural purposes owing to the railway strike.   These complaints related principally to the restrictions which were imposed by the Ministry   of Food and withdrawn after operating for about 12 hours.   Enquiries have beon made of the five principal Oil Companies supplying petrol and paraffin, and the Board are assured that there is no prospeot of any immediate shortage of either fuel for use in agriculture.   It has been found necessary by some of these Companies to suspend delivery from local depots to retailers in order to maintain supplies at the local depots, which are normally fed by rail.   It Is consequently necessary in most cases for retailers to transport their own supplies from tho local depots.   Arrangements haVo also been made for these depots to supply direct to consumers who must, of course, convey the fuel themseivea.   Priority is boing given in the case of petrol required for agricultural purposes.   No complaints have been received so far as regards paraffin.   The position as regards both fuels is boing carofully watched during tho present emergency.Coal for agricultural purposes.   Arrangements have been made with tho Coal Mines Department for overy possible assistance to be givon to consumers requiring urgent supplies of coal for agricultural purposes.   During the present emergency supplies are being limited to the minimum quantity needed for 14 days according to the existing scale of rationing.   3?ew complaints have so far been received.Horse Section.   The salo of 69 horses and 2 foals was reported iuring tKe past week, bringing the total sold up to 8124 and leaving 850 still to be disposed of.   several of these have   . already been sold, but the results have not yet reached the Board owing to postal delays oto.Tho net amount realised to date is  494,902, an average of  60 a horse.The sale of harness at Willosden has boon pos tponed till October 16th and will be followed probably by a final sale on November 6th.ation Branch.Few new proposals have been reoeived during the week, owing to the partial cessation of postal facilities consequent on the strike.   Opportunity has been taken to push forward the examination of estimates of expenditure on agricultural eduoation submitted by Local Education Authorities in respect of the current
financial year.    Claims for payment of grants on account hare now begun    to come in and are being dealt with.   Tho estimates submitted by Higher Agricultural Institutions of expenditure on research and advisory work during the coming acadomic year have in most casos boon dealt with.Instruction in agriculture and allied subjects notified hy local eduoation authorities during tfeptombea includes 26 organised day courses in Cheosemaking notified by 12 counties; 3 organised courses in Basket Making notified by one county; 3 in Farriery, notified by 2 counties,&apos; Individual lectures notified include 100 in horticulture, 25 in fruit and vegetable preserving, 21 in poultry keeping and 10 in dairying.

Owing to the strike reports havo come in vory slowly, but it is evident that many cases of Vart Disease have been found in districts hitherto thought to h^vo been free.     Several have occurred in Lincolnshire and quite a number in tho none Counties,     It is thought th^t many of those cases have boon in existence for sovernl years, but have only now been brought to light as a result of the propaganda vork carriod out.in the Homo Counties on an ovtonsive scale,     a number cf specimens of . art disease have boon sent to tho Board for idontifi-cation.As regards blight on potatoes the fovr reports received arc to the effect that potatoes nov boing lifted arc moarly froo from disease and that potatoes pro expected to keep well this yeavr.The Lancashire County Council undertook a prosecution against a grower for planting a susceptible instead of an immune variety, and he v/as finod by tho ; agistrate .^4.15,0 including costs.Two Orders have been drafted dealing with diseases on nursery stock sold for planting purposes, and also on nursery stock imported into this country.

Tho inspection of growing crops of see&amp; potatoes of varieties immune to wart disease, amounting to over 6,500 acres, has now been completed. In several cases it has been necessary to pay more than one visit to ascertain whether the rogues have been removed and that the crop was moderately true to type in order to permit of an official certificate being issued.     In some instances the crops have proved to be too impure for certification.Transport of Seed3 for Autumn Sowing.

PART II.   OTHJH DIVISIONS. Animals Division.Diseases of Animals Branch.The number of outbreaks of Swine Fever has been 61 and the reports 161.

Tho attention of the Boy Scouts Association having been drawn by tho Board to the campaign against rats and in particular to tho National Rat V/eek, Sir Robert Baden Powell has directed a Notice to bo published in their Headquarters Gazette calling attention to&apos;this appeal from tho Board and expressing the hope that, if any Scout Masters can see their way to helping in the campaign, they will do so.   Ho has also written a short article on the subject of Rat Catching which has been published in the &quot;Scout&quot; of October 4th, pointing out that Hat Catching is now a national duty owing to tho damage done to crops by rats, and Scouts can help thoir country by joining in the&quot;campaign against them.   Scout Masters have.been instructed to get into touch with the Local Authorities responsible for th-.- administration of the Rats Orders.On tho 2nd inst. a lottor was addressed by the Board to the Council of tho National Farmers&apos; Union drawing attention to tho measures being taken to bring about a general campaign against rats, pointing out that tho chief object of the movement was to &quot;benefit the faming community generally and enable farmers to obtain the full measure Of tho crops they produce, and asking the Council to take tho necessary steps to urge upon thair members tho necessity of co-operating with and giving thoir support to the Local Authorities.

Two hundred and one cases were sent to Insn-ctors for visit;   enquiries by correspondence were made in 175 cases and 111 cases were completed.   Reports were received from Inspectors in 78 cases.Fisheries Division.Government Assistance for the Autumn Herring Fishing.   Al 1 arrangements have been made for the scheme for Government Assistance in connection ^ith the autumn Herring Fishing, to be nut into operation as from 7th October.

VTorlc.   The work of the Outdoor Branch of the Fisheries Division has been devoted to dealing with the various questions arising out of the strike.   In order to strengthen the ooastal staff for this purnoBO, fish measurers were instructed to place themselves at the disposal of the Inspectors.the most important problem was that of getting the fish from the fishing ports t6 centres of distribution, in the absence of railway facilities.   In order to deal with this question^ the Board obtained from the -admiralty, early in the week, the services of a number of steam trawlers, which are now running under the direction of the Board&apos;b Officers.   Cargoes of fish have been taken by them to London, Portsmouth, Shoreham, Hewhaven, Hull and Aberdeen, and the vessels are carrying return cargoes of empty fish boxes, lubrioating oil, wood for kipper boxes and other fishing requisites.   The vessels have also carried to Hull and Grimsby the orews which are to bring back to Lowestoft two of the drifters recently placed at the disposal of the Board by the Admiralty.   All arrangements were made also for carriers to Cardiff, Bristol and Plymouth, but it was found possible to arrange land transport and the vessels were held in reserve,The Board&apos;s Officers at Lowestoft, Yarmouth and Grimsby have, in co-one rat ion with the Ministry of Food, organised the services of lorries to carry fish to inland ports.Another very serious difficulty was the lack of coal at the trawler ports.   With regard to this the Board have acted in close co-operation with the Coal Controller and the Ministry of Food in securing that no coal should be wasted, and that . the limited supplies available Bhould be used to the best advantage by arranging that no more trawlers should be bunkered for fishing than could be so handled as to bring their catch within reach of the consumer..A supply of coal at Gravesend has been nut at the disposal of the Board for the purpose of bunkering vessels carrying vfish to Billingsgate, bunkers being issued only on the certificate of the Board,
So far ae can be ascertained, these matters have all &quot;been dealt with successfully, and it is understood that all the fish caught has so far gone into consumption,   In London the supply of fish during the week was little, if anything, below the normal.The 3ast Coust Herring Fishery is in danger of being seriously hampered by lack of salt.   It has, of&apos; course, been impossible to get any salt to Yarmouth and Lowestoft by rail during the week, and arrangements with the Admiralty are boing negotiated whereby salt will be brought round from Mersey ports in vessels belonging to the Admiralty.Free Passage for German Ships to fetch Herrings,   A request was recently made by the German Authorities that free passages should be granted to a couple of German vessels to visit various Scotch ports in ballast and load back with herrings.   This request was refused by the Admiralty, after consultation with the Board, owing to possible difficulties with labour over loading the German vessels, especially as neutral tonnage is available for the purpose.Conference re  Salvage of Aircr af t^at Sea,   A C o nf e re no e was held recently between the Air ministry and the Board, to discuss the question of salvage of aircraft at sea.   It was decided that a section dealing with salvage at sea shall be introduced into the Air navigation Bill;   that aircraft on the water shall be regarded as shipping for salvage purposes;   that aircraft in need of assistance shall be legally made &quot;wrecks&quot;; that an ex gratia payment shall be given for salvage of Government&quot;aircraft, and that the first (case of salvage of civil aircraft shall be allowed to go to the uourts as a test case.MtPI^-IiPMJ^Pi^iiL^ee .   By the exercise of a little forethought the Committee were able to make arrangements to keep their mechanics and shipwrights fully employed in spite of the strike.It is felt that not only will congestion on the railways be very serious for some time to come, but also that it will assist to ease the situation if such goods as can be sent by road are so sent.   Arrangements are being made for a lorry&quot; load, consisting of six engines with their equipment, to be despatched to London.   These engines will be despatched from . London either by sea to the east coast, or by lorries returning empty to the places at which they are required.Emergency arrangements were made for certain engines on show at Olympia tc be handed to the Committee, and while.it is felt that the- time has passed for such drastic measures, it is probable that certain of the engines, at any rate, will be retained when the show closes.Ordnance Survey.During the week ending 7th October 1919, 27 sheets of the 25 inch map and 1 sheet of the Popular Edition of the 1 inch map were issued.The following special maps and diagrams are in course of preparation, or have been supplied to the AdmiraltyProofs of Silhouettes, British War Vessels,Pa^es 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12.C.B. 1158 Austria   Hungary Coast Report.7,872 maps have been supplied to various departments at home.
