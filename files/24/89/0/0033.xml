It is ad-report.     mittedly a special report, embodyingsuch findings as the evidence heard would allow. It does not deal with pensions for officers nor for parents and dependents; that is to follow. But it states the case of N.C.O.&apos;s and men, their widows and wives and children; and recommends increases of pension and allowances, based on a calculated increase in the cost of living, and bearing the impress of a sense of obligation to those who have suffered physical injury and material hardship in the war. All and this is nearly everyone who acknowledges allegiance to the Union Jack who can still recall those dark days when the cry was &quot; Men!&quot; will endorse these recommendations. Those of us who have to shoulder the actual monetary burden will do so with a satisfaction not usually associated with the pay-mentally of taxes.That the Government endorsed that gratitude and those obligations was proved the day following the actual publication of the report.action. &apos; Due, we imagine, to a determination on the part of all concerned to &quot; get a move on&quot; (the colloquialism is appropriate), the, Minister of Pensions, Sir Laming Worthington-Evans, was enabled to announce to the House of Commons on 31st July, with an illuminating regu-clarity, the Governments acceptance, point by point, of practically every recommendation&apos; contained in the report. On this occasion there can be no com-plaint of delay. Between the publication of the report and the debate in the House the Cabinet held two meetings and made its decision. So ex-Service men should feel gratified, not only on account of the increase in pensions that was a matter of calculation and justice but because their cause, on this occasion, beat the traditional and mysterious delay of Governmental routine, just as they beat the invincible (?) Boche. There was the little matter of a country!s gratitude behind them, but that may be taken as the &quot;barrage.&quot;How much of the celerity of this decision and of the decisions themselves must be attributed tothe personality of the present Minis-recoqnition. ter of Pensions is a matter for indi-vidual deduction each one according to his imagination. The Select Committee admit that his evidence put upon them the responsibility of considering broader issues and aspects of pen-sions than the terms of their reference implied; further, in the report is an unusual appreciation of his administrative ability. The Press through-out the country acknowledged his achievements in generous terms. Similarly the debate in the House provided many personal expressions of apprecia-tions which, in some instances, went, beyond&apos; the usual Parliamentary formula. Veteran critics of pensions administration added their quota of con-gratillations,    Recognition is always welcome.
And though Sir Laming Worthing!on-Evans would be the first to acknowledge what is due he does so more than once in his speech- -to past efforts of his predecessors, to the Select Committee and to the present Ministry staff around him, a fairly just and impartial summing-up might be i &quot; He only can who does.&quot;There remains little further to be said on the Report that cannot be gathered from the printed extracts except perhaps to surmise and now   tnat the provisions to be made forT0-   officers and parents and dependentswill be proportionate. For the rest, the spirit of the Report and the quick acceptance of its recommendations should be a good answer to the diatribes of those whose object it has been to inflame the grievances of the ex-Service man into an active discontent. No amount of mis-representation can detract from this material proof that the old ingratitude is not to be allowed again. Grievances there will still doubtless be ; mistakes ; cases of individual hardship. But -the disabled man, the widows, the fatherless children, should now be able to feel that the country has tried to meet its debt for the tragic misfortunes of war. Those more fortunate should be able to appre-associate this too. So now perhaps we might all get on with the idea proclaimed by &quot; The Comrades of the Great War,&quot; in their recent manifesto: &quot; Our sacrifice was for the State and our way is clear. It is we who have saved the country in war and it is we who must now save her in peace.&quot;In a recent issue of the Daily Chronicle Mr. Harold Spender uttered a warning against the danger of losing our best manhood, another     unless we provide some attractive warning.     Cheme and opportunities for settle-ment on the land.  A similar warning was made in the May issue of the WAR PENSIONS GAZETTE.   As we said then : &quot;We cannot afford to lose the husbandmen.&quot;   But the danger is there. Men who want an agricultural life will get it and will get it where conditions are the best.    The industrial unrest is going to emphasize this inclina-tion for the outdoor life which already exists, and probably create it in  temperaments ordinarily addicted to town life.   Competition for manhood there must always be in white man&apos;s countries.   If the Mother Country does not want to start handi-capped, the inducements for settlement on the land must be of the best.   And that quickly.The conferences which the Minister of Pensions&apos; has been holding with Members of Parliament to discuss Pension problems have been discontinued owing to the recess. They will, however, be resumed when Parliament meets again in the autumn,PERSONAL.A pleasing incident took place at the offices of the South-Eastern Region on the 8th August last. By command of H.M. the King of the Belgians, the military attache of the Belgian Embassy in London called on Major-General Sir John Adge, K.C.M.G., and conferred on him the following decorations: Commander of The Order of Leo-pold, First Class, and the Belgian Croix de Guerre.

140September, 1919.War Pensions Gazette367COURAGE AND ENCOURAGEMENT.BY ETHEL M. WOOD.It was this realisation thatThere is probably no one engaged in Pensions work, with any vision of the solemnity and sacred-ness of that work, who has not frequently suffered from a sense of handicap and limitation, in dealing with men severely wounded, because of their own immunity from any such suffering.Sir Arthur Pearson&apos;s greatest gift to the blind is his personal example ; and demonstration is both more useful and more inspiring than any amount of theory and advice, however full of sympathy and practicability, induced the Brit-ish Red Cross to invite two men to come over here from the United States of Amer-ica to hold meet-ings and visit all the big orthopte-dic centres.One of them, Mr. Michael Dowling, s u f -interfered the ampu-tation of both legs just below die knee, the left arm just below the elbow, and all the fingers and half the thumb of the right hand. Ex-posure to bliz-zard when a boy of 15. He was an orphan without friends or money Photo\ when this terrible experience befellhim; and for a time there was nothing for it but to accept State relief. But Mr. Dowling holds that the only thing that really counts is a mans soul &quot; what&apos;s above the collar;&quot; and he proved it. He is now president of the largest bank in Minne-sota; has held the office of Speaker in the House of Representatives in his State; and is a married man with three daughters. The other guest, Judge Corley, lost his right arm at the shoulder and his left at the elbow through a railway acci-dent; yet he claims he can do everything but tie a bow tie! The fact that he has travelled over from the States without an attendant proves the thoroughness of his independence.On July 25th, the London War Pensions Com-mittee, in conjunction with the British Red Cross, organised a meeting at the Central Hall, West-SOME   OF  THE AUDIENCE.minster, for the benefit and encouragement of men who had suffered during this war. Contingents came from most of the hospitals, and the whole of the floor of the huge hall was packed with men in hospital blue, whilst above them in one gallery was a solid phalanx of &quot; silver-badged &quot; men, the other galleries being occupied by people interested in orthopaedic or Pensions work. A fine display of work done by disabled men, trained under the auspices of the London War Pensions Committee, was arranged in front of the platform and includedspecimens of plumbing work, clock repairing, boot making, book- keeping, s t e n o g r aphy, military embroi-dery, wood carv-ing, plastering, draughtsmanship, leather work, electrical wiring, tailoring, dental mechanics, etc., etc.H.R.H. Prince Albert attended the meeting and was received by the Minister of Pensions, S i r Laming Worth-ington - Evans, M.P., Major-General Feilding, C 0 m m a n ding London District,[NewspaperIllustrations, Ll.&apos;.    and    Sir    LleiiryHarris, M.P., Chairman of the London War Pensions Committee. Prince Albert inspected the display of work and gave great pleasure by asking to have his &quot;wings,&quot; to which he had just become entitled, worked at the School of Military Embroidery.Then Judge Corley gave a practical demonstra-tion of what he could do and how he did it, taking off his coat, unfastening and doing up collar and tie, writing, etc., etc. There were roars of laughter when the Prince asked what a certain implement on the table was for, and Judge Corley replied, &quot; It is what I cut my toe nails with.&quot; A film showing Mr. Dowling managing his own motor, etc., was then shown, and at its conclusion Mr. Dowling spoke. &quot;There is no such thing as a cripple,&quot; said he. &quot; There may be a disability but the d-i-s can be wiped out.&quot;  Mr. Dowling&apos;s prac-
tical, humorous and intensely human speech made a deep impression on all.That the meeting achieved its purpose was amply evidenced. One man with a high leg amputation threw away his stick after it, because he said, &quot; If that gentleman can walk without a stick so can I.&quot; He can and does now. At tea, which Mr. Jock Mackay made merrier with his bagpipes, another man with badly maimed hands refused to be helped. &quot;You&apos;ve got to do it all yourself,&quot; shouted his friends.   &quot;You bet I&apos;m going to,&quot; was the reply.The encouragement and hope they bring to others must be a very wonderful reward for their own courage and perseverance to Mr. Dowling and Judge Corley. We who wish to show our gratitude and pride in practical fashion are very grateful to them for coming over here to give of their experi-ence to those just starting the fight with self.To quote Mr. Dowling again, &quot; It&apos;s the thorough-bred that has to carry the heaviest handicap and wins the race in spite of it.&quot; And I think every unit of the big audience, whether physically &quot; handicapped &quot; or not, felt stimulated and inspired by the words and the deeds of these two very gallant gentlemen.A CHANCE FOR CHILDREN.The contributor of the above article on Charley Schools, Sussex, writes as follows concerning certain modifications made since the]article appeared in the July issueof the GazetteThe Army Children&apos;s Homes Committee have come to the following decisions : (t) That the original Chailey proposals should be modified, with the result that for the present fifty soldiers&apos; children will be maintained there. These children will not be suffering from active tuberculosis, but will be in the convalescent stage.(2) Further provision is contemnlated for the more serious cases of surgical tuberculosis, requiring pro-longed treatment, and it is hoped that a special institu-tion will be established in co-operation with the Ministry of Health for the treatment, education and training of a large number of children under the most up-to-date conditions.As the adaptation of a suitable building or the g.e.e-cion of a new one will take some time, no cases requir-ing surgical or special treatment can be considered under this scheme at present. Information will be forthcoming so soon as any decisive steps are taken.The Minister of Pensions, Sir L. Worthing-ton-Evans, visited Manchester on the 8th August to attend a meeting of the Local War Pensions Com-mittees of Lancashire, Cheshire, Westmorland, and Isle of Man for the purpose of explaining the scheme of decentralisation. The Lord Mayor of Manchester presided, and representatives of the various ex-Service men&apos;s organisations were also present. - The Minister, in explaining the regional decentralisation, announced that the headquarters of the North-West Region, i.e., Lancashire, Cheshire, Westmorland and Isle of Man, would be at Manchester, and computed pensioners in this area at some 200,,000).War Pensions Gazette.A monthly Official Journal for all interested in War Pensions; in those who have earned them; and in their widows   and   children   also.No. 29.

Other instances could be given of that improvement mentioned in the Special Report of the Select Committee. Still other efforts are in contemplation.It is understood that to expedite the preparation Df cases for Appeal Tribunals, Local War Pen-sions Committees are to be asked to proceed immediately to investigate cases without waiting for a man&apos;s documents, as now directed in Para-graph 8, Circular 179.A somewhat similar arrangement is, we under-stand, being considered with a view to simul-taneous action by Local War Pensions Com-mittees and the Headquarters of the Ministry in connection with applications under Article 9.WAR PENSIONS (ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS) BILL,This Bill is designed &quot; to make further provision for the administration of the enactments relating to Naval, Military and Air Force War Pensions, Grants and Allowances.&quot; The Bill was presented by Sir Laming Worthington-Evans and was sup-ported by Colonel Sir James Craig. It deals with the questions of advance issue of pensions; an extension of powers in respect of information from employers as to earnings of disabled men ; certain functions of the Local Committees; also the con-stitution of Pensions Appeal Tribunals, to which the right of appeal shall lie in -certain cases of rejection of pensions. The Bill has now become an Act of Parliament.It is hoped to give the text of the Act in some detail next month.
-   141September, 1919. War Pensions Gazette 369THE  KING&apos;S  FUND.lATke folloiving extracts from a letter to the Secretary of the King&apos;s Fund show how the gaps between State administration and individual needs can be filled, The letter is from the Secretary of a Northern Wa) Pensions Committee.So far as this area is concerned, the objects of the Fund have been attained with striking success. A small and efficient sub-Committee, presided over by the Chairman of the Committee, has held weekly meetings, to interview applicants, and has exercised the strictest care in investigating cases, latterly much assisted by the Inquiry Officer.Anything in the nature of methodical surveillance has been rigidly avoided by my Committee; but casual observation proves that the grants have been employed generally in the manner surely wished for by the trustees and subscribers. In only four cases &quot;have exceptions occurred : one man was forced to emigrate owing to medical disability; one failed in his original project, but started in another; one was awarded a grant, but obtaining a suitable job, preferred to return it to the trustees; the fourth, just discovered, has sold his outfit (horse and cart) and seems really to be a very unsatisfactory case. ,My Committee has always borne in mind as the first and almost decisive point the question -of severity of disablement. It has endeavoured not to allow indulg-ence to be mistaken for benevolence, and if an applicant is of such a type that independence would be the reverse of beneficial, it has not hesitated to refuse the applica-tion.The outstanding point of danger and the outstanding mark of success in this area, has been the delicate matter of &quot;hawking,&quot; so alluring to the ex-service man from its adaptability for all purposes and its entire independence. Here disablement is the first considera-tion; and it might be said that the purchase of the modest pony and Hat has proved the salvation of many a broken man six months ago a problem, now an important and self-respecting member of society. It is indeed wonderful to notice the zest and the &quot;canniness&quot; with which these pensioners throw themselves into the business; they overcome difficulty after difficulty which would daunt better equipped men ; and, owing to the position of the town, there is always plenty of work for them; they serve the mining districts for many miles around, penetrating ten, twenty, thirty miles abroad, with lish (secured from the seaside ports as quickly as the local hawkers there), fruit and vegetables of all kinds, etc. Of course, wholesale people are very good to them, and much has been accomplished by sympathy for their histories. Then, again, their cheeriness and patience have gained customers, who welcome the change from the &quot; war-time manners&quot; of ordinary salesmen.In other lines, the same gratifying results are visible. In one case, a man, considered as totally and ferman-ently disabled, has established a thriving little business (sweets, tobacco and drapery) which is rapidly becoming the leading enterprise in an important quarter of the town.   He was a problem, successfully solved.Now that the Fund has been partially superseded by State Funds, it might be well to say that bene-beneficiaries have taken the grants in the spirit in which they were offered, and so far as this neighbourhood can say, with gratitude for the opportunity of making them-selves entirely self-supporting; the reflex has been in the diminution in the number of applications for other torms of assistance. A source of great gratification has been the attitude of the men-&quot;never mind any further favouring-1 can look after myself now.&quot; Surely a matter for congratulation? In conclusion, I am directed to thank the trustees for their invariably helpful attitude towards all applications sent forward, and the advice always freely available.APPOINTMENTS.Local Committee Staffs.The following appointments of Principal Officers to Local Committees and Sub-Committees have been approved (Z..C, Local Committee; S.C., Sub-Committee):TO BE ASSISTANT SECRETARIES. li.

370War Pensions GazetteSeptember, 1919.SPECIAL REPORT ON PENSIONS: 28 JULY, 1919.Being opinions and recommendations of the Select Committee appointed to enquire and report on Pensions Acts and Warrants. The recommendations as regards scale of pension refer only to N.C.O!s and wen; nor do they deal with parentsor dependents.These extracts are taken verbatim from the report. DELAYS.Serious and long-continued delays have undoubtedly occurred in the past, both at headquarters and in Local War Pensions Committees administration. Evidence shows that there has been improvement recently in this respect, certainly at headquarters, and particularly since the present Pensions Minister Look office, and indeed over the whole field of Pensions the energy and adminis-trative ability of the present Minister arc securing great improvements.At headquarters we welcome the recent creation oi a Department of Office Organisation at the Ministry, under a Director General of Organisation. This new Department will, we hope, greatly.improve the working and administration of the various Departments.EMPLOYMENT (EX-SERVICE MEN).Adequate use must be made in Administration, both central and local, of the services of discharged and dis-abled men, and special arrangements should be made with a view to training such men for work of this char-acter. In the case of Local War Pensions Committees themselves the representation of discharged and disabled men should be materially increased.The Committee recommend that much greater effort should be made to secure the employment of discharged, and, when possible, of disabled, officers and men for work of this character, in which their own personal experience and disability should make them peculiarly useful and sympathetic.PAY OR PENSION.We are strongly of opinion, in order to prevent hiatus in pensions and also with a view to secure active co-operation on the part of the Naval and Military authori-ties, that both officers and men should remain on full pay and chargeable to the War Office or Admiralty respectively, at any rate till all necessary papers have been passed to the Pensions Ministry.STATUTORY RIGHT TO PENSION.Evidence shows that the present method of expressing payment of pension to be by way of bounty is really felt as a grievance. It is desirable, therefore, to pass for Soldiers&apos; and Airmen&apos;s pensions an Act similar to the Naval Act of 1865, now in force for seamen . . . further, declaring the Soldier and Airman, and also the Sailor, to be &quot;legally entitled&quot; to his pension, as was the case under Windham&apos;s Act of 1806, till that was repealed in 1826.Scales and machinery of administration must be left to be settled by Regulation or by Order in Council or similar executive machinery; but such Regulation or Order should be made subject to, and draw its authority from, the Act itself.MEDICAL BOARDS AND THE RIGHT OP APPEAL.The celerity with which the Z cases generally have been dealt with when they came through to Chelsea reflects credit on the Department concerned.The Pensions Minister has initiated a more rapid sys-tem of reviewing the Z awards (&quot;Provisional&quot; awards) which has helped to get rid of difficulties.REVISION OF THE AWARD BY OFFICIALS WHO HAVE NOT SEEN THE MAN.Evidence shows that such revision of the award of theoriginal Board is never nip.de at Chelsea by lay officials,but only by competent medical men; and also that in. only a very small proportion of cases is the originalaward reduced; in a much larger number of cases7 theresult of the examination of the original award by the Chelsea doctors is to raise the original award, not to lower it.But allowing for all that, the system by which the award of a Board which has seen the man is liable to revision by medical men who have not seen him is indefensible, and this is now generally admitted. COMPLAINT THAT MEN ARE NOT TOLD.We think that with the development of the Regional system, and the greater experience of the Medical Boards, and the increased uniformity that should result, that there should be no difficulty in telling the man directly the Medical Board have arrived at a decision what that decision is.The guiding principle here and indeed throughout Pension Administration should be that the man should always be given the benefit of any doubt.Generally both here and in all other similar cases we think that attempts to recover excess payment where the original assessment, though possibly wrong, was made by a proper authority should be abandoned as unfair; it may be the cause of much hardship to those who live by weekly payments and have usually little, if any, surplus savings out of which to refund arrears. RIGHT OF APPEAL.We are of opinion that the long and long-continued delay in the hearing of Pension Entitlement Cases in the past, often amounting to many months, was a serious defect in pension administration, and the delay in setting up additional Tribunals so as to deal with them was, in our view, inexcusable.This evil has now been dealt with, the Tribunals reconstituted, and their numbers largely increased. For this improvement credit is due to the present Pensions Minister. There arc now, as recently rearranged, ten such Tribunals; they are constituted as follows:-(i.) A Lay President, usually with Legal Training,    (ii.) ARepresentative ex-Soldier and ex-Sailor,   (iii.) Medical Assessors.INDEPENDENT TRIBUNALS.In our opinion it is essential they should be indepen-dent of the Pensions Ministry administration.We recommend that they should be formally consti-tuted as separate Tribunals, under the Home Office or some other Department of State, and we make this recommendation with all the more confidence as from the evidence of the Minister for Pensions we gather that he does not dissent from this proposal.We recommend that a direct appeal on amount should be allowed in all cases to regularly constituted appeal Tribunals on the lines given below.The conditions we recommend for the constitution of the Appeal Tribunals on Amount are as follows : (i.) They should he set up on a basis  independent of the Pensions Minister, c.g-, under the authority of the Home Office, as in the ease of Appeal Tribunals on Entitlement.(ii.) It is desirable to have a lay ex-Service element oil these Tribunals as on the Entitlement Appeal Tribunals; but as the assessment questions arc mainly medical questions, the medical element on Appeal Tribunals on Amount should in our view have a majority. .....(iii.) The medical element on the Appeal Tribunal should be of superior authority and experience to that of the ordinary medical Boards and should, where possible, comprise Senior Consultants and Specialists in the diseases or injuries causing the disabilities under consideration.(iv.) The disabled man when appealing must be informed that the result of his appeal may he to alter the assessment downwards as well as upwards. An analogy is furnished in the case of appeals to. the Court of Criminal Appeal. This provision should be a check on unnecessary appealing.FLAT RATE AND ALTERNATIVE PENSION.This is the most important matter we have, had to consider.   Our terms of reference point to amendment
142September, ioio.War Pensions Gazette371in matters of detail rather than to a complete revision of lilt; Warrant and of the existing scales, but the evidence given by the Pensions Minister raised the broader issues and placed on the Committee the responsibility of dealing with them.Both in the case of the llat rate and of the alternative Pension, the State provision is to be regarded as a com-pensation (though no monetary compensation can e\er really be adequate) for physical disablement and not as a general reward for service. Otherwise every man vdio has served would be entitled to claim a pension.Not only have the Flat Rate and the Alternative Pen-sion a close financial relation to one another, but both are connected with the cost of living and the Expense Budget of the industrial classes, from which the Army was mainly drawn. A provision by way of compensa-tion for disability, which may have been accepted by the common sense of the country as not unreasonable in 1914, may well seem impossible now when prices are at least 100 per cent, above the pre-war level.PENSION SCALES-TOTAL DISABLEMENT. It may be of use to give the pension scales and also the rises in prices in other countries.Single Men. Men with Wives.Canada   ...... 47s. nd. a week.      47s. ud. plus 7s. 8d. a week.France    ...... 37s. a week. 37s. a week.Australia        ...  30s. a week. 30s. plus 15s. a week.Italy      ......   19s. 4d. a week.        19s. 4d. plus 4s. 5d. a week.New Zealand ...  40s. a week. 40s. plus 20s. a week.United States ...  28s. iod. a week.      28s. iod. plus 14s. 5c!. a week. United Kingdom  33s. (including bonus).33s. (including bonus)N.B. Under the Alternative Pension a man may get up to gos. a week (including bonus).A comparison of the cost of living, including rent, shows that in 1914 the index numbers of the relative cost in relation to the cost in the United Kingdom were approximately as follows : Canada    .................................................................. 150Australia .................................................................. 123New Zealand .......................................................... 124United States  ......................................................... 150United Kingdom ...................................................... 100But at the same time the cost of living has during the war risen to. a far greater extent in the United Kingdom than in the other countries referred to. This may be largely due to temporary causes, and we had evidence that even now the cost of living is 23 per cent, higher in Canada and the United States than in this country.We think it desirable to make the official figures of the working class Budget as published in the Board of Trade Gazette the standard by which to measure varia-tions in cost of living and the consequent adjustments for pension.MAXIMUM FLAT RATE PENSION,We make the following recommendations . That the Barnes Warrant be accepted as the basis of calculation so far as Pension is concerned, the basis of prices to be the average of the Board of Trade figures as shown by the Board of Trade Gazette in the months prior to August, 1914. Prices measured by the nearest approxi-mation available, viz., by comparison of the figures of April, 1917, with those of July, 1919, show a rise since the Barnes Warrant of about 40 per cent. ; we think, therefore, the Flat Rale Pension which is already raised by 20 per cent. Bonus should be treated now as raised by 40 per cent., which in the case of the maximum dis-ability pension would mean an increase from 27s. 6d. (or with Bonus of 20 per cent. 33s.) to 38s. ud. In addition, if measured over an average period of months, it will probably be found that the variation in prices between the present time and the spring of 1917 would on the Board of Trade figures be somewhat more than 40 per cent., and we therefore recommend that the 100 per cent, disability flat rate pension for the single man should be placed at 40s.Pensions for men with 90 per cent., So per cent., and lower percentages of Disability should be raised in proportion.CHILDRENS AND OTHER ALLOWANCES.These, subject to the provision recommended below lor the married women and for widows, would be raised in the same proportion; viz., 40 per cent, above the Barnes Warrant, or somewhat more. The comparative tables, therefore, would work out as follows:-- 	Barnes Warrant.	Present Scale, with 20 per cent.

But(b) This is not to apply in the case of the widow without children below the age of 40. Until she attains 40 her allow-ance to be 20s., but at 40 to rise to the full two-thirds. The case of the widow without children and below 40 who is, in fact, unable to work, may have to be met by a special grant administered through the local War Pensions Committee.ALTERNATIVE PENSION.On the basis of the Flat Rate Pension, and its con-nection in principle with the Alternative Pension as out-lined above, the Government Actuary, Sir Alfred Watson, furnished evidence to show that the pre-war rates of earnings should be &quot;loaded up&quot; by 60 per cent., and we recommend that this course should be adopted. This would apply to both men&apos;s and widows&apos; alternative pensions.** This would mean that if the pre-war earnings were calculated to be 50s. per week these earnings should now, for the purposes of the Alternative Pension, be taken at 80s. per week.WIDOWS&apos; ALTERNATIVE PENSION.We recommend two further amendments :-(a) The widow with children who at first goes on the Flat Rate should have the option to come on the Alternative Pension, if she desires it, as her children work off the Pension Scale. But she should apply to do so within a limited time, so that the necessary evidence, may at once be obtained and placed on record.  Later on the evidence might not be available.(b) The widow should be allowed Alternative Pension on the basis of two-thirds of her husband&apos;s earnings whether, in fact, he would have been himself entitled to the Alternative Pension or not.  At present this is not so.Further, in the case of the men&apos;s alternative pensionsthere is at present the following maximum limit, viz.,a man can receive a pension on the basis of the total ofhis pre-war wages (after allowing for present earning capacity) up to 50s., and half of any amount above that up to 100s.We recommend that this limitation of one-half, from 50s. to 100s. be abolished, and that a man be granted Alternative Pension (after allowing for present earning capacity) to the full extent of his pre-war earnings (loaded up as already explained by 60 per cent.) up to 100s., tut not beyond.   In the case of widows, the maximum in
the same way would be the full two-thirds of the bus-band&apos;s pre-war earnings (also loaded up by 60 per cent.) up to 66s. 8d., viz., two-thirds of 100s.COST.The Government Actuary laid a Memorandum before the Committee in which he estimated that the adoption of recommendations outlined above would involve addi-tional annual expenditure of between ^17,000,000 and ^,&quot;18,000,000. -,   AUTOMATIC SLIDING. SCALE.The additions we have recommended above to the Flat Rate and Alternative Pensions are not to be by way of bonus.In December of each year, the Board of Trade Gazette should publish officially figures of the rise or fall in prices in the working-class Budget averaged over the previous twelve months as compared with pre-war prices, also averaged over a period of months prior to August, 1914; that the consequent figure of rise and fall in pen-sion on the basis of the Barnes Warrant should be officially announced by the Pensions Minister not later than the last day of December in each year to take effect on all pensions and allowances on the 29th March following, and to continue in force for twelve months till&quot; the next annual readjustment. But we recommend that this method of automatic , adjustment should be subject to two qualifications : (a) If prices fall, the Flat Rate Pension now recommended should not in any case fall below the present rates under the Barnes Warrant with the 20 per cent, bonus, and these should be considered as a minimum.(b) No alteration in the scales of pension should be made unless the Board of Trade figures showed a substantial variation, e.g., at least 5 per cent.The Committee recommend that the necessary adjust-ment should be made without delay and remain in force until the end of the financial year 1920-1921.TREATMENT AND TRAINING ALLOWANCES.We recommend that the principle of increasing the pension in all cases to the maximum for men undergoing Treatment or Training should be adhered to, and, in view of the large additions recommended above to the maximum Flat Rate Pension, we hope that a larger number of disabled men will be induced to undertake Treatment and Training.PENSIONS INCREASED: 31 JULY, 1019.Being extracts from Speeches in the House of Commons in debate (Supply), providing increased estimates on Pensions Vote when the -Minister of Pen-sions made announcement as to increased rates of Pensions and Allovoances.THE MINISTER OP PENSIONS, SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS: 1 must warn the Committee that the Estimate, which amounts to nearly ^73,000,000, is already out of date. Since that Estimate was presented, additional expenditure has been authorised, as I have from time to time announced. For example, there has been added a 20 per cent, bonus to officers&apos; retired pay and to alterna-tive pensions for officers and men and their widows, and certain pre-war disability pensions have been raised to the present rates. These and other alterations will cost this year over ^&quot;2,000,000. I shall presently inform the Committee of the decisions of the Government upon the recommendations made in the interim Report of the Select Committee on Pensions.FIGURES AND NUMBERS.These decisions will call for an extra expenditure for the remainder of this year of about ^11,000,000, so that the Estimates we are considering should be treated as ^86,000,000, and not, as presented, at just under ^.&quot;73,000,000. The increased expenditure, however, covers only a portion of this year, and the Committee may like to know that for a full year at least, as long as the number of pensioners remains at or about the maximum the rate will be about ^96,000,000. This is more than double the estimated expenditure for the previous year ending April, 1919, which was ^47,500,000, and more than four times the actual expenditure of the year before-the year ending April, 1918 which was just over ^,&quot;23,000,000. Perhaps before I proceed with my review I should also give the Committee information as to the numbers of pensions, gratuities, and final allow-ances in actual payment at the 30th June. Officers and nurses drawing retired pay numbered just under 20,000; officers&apos; widows numbered just under 9,500; officers&apos; dependents, just under 5,000; officers&apos; children, just over 9,000 a total of 43,500.&apos;The corresponding figures for other ranks at the 30th June were: Men, 875,000; widows, 216,000; dependents, 279,000; children, 968,000; total, allowing for the odd numbers, of 2,340,000.Soon after I took office in January last, I entered into a detailed examination of the organisation of the Minis-try. My attention was forcibly called to the almost universal complaints of delay which poured in upon me from every quarter. 1 set to work to put my house in order. .ADMINISTRATION.Delays can now be traced to their causes, and steps have been taken to remove the causes by simplifying the procedure. In order to cope with the additional work due to demobilisation of the Army, the staff had to be largely increased, and the difficulties were accentuated by lack of suitable accommodation. The stall at the 30th June numbered 14,829, of whom 11,549 are women, and 3,280 are men. Of the 3,280 men 81 per cent., or 2,670, are discharged officers or men. The staff is housed in thirty-three separate buildings or groups of buildings, and this separation makes control extremely difficult, and leads to great extravagance in staff.At the same time that the work at headquarters was being co-ordinated, Regulations had to be issued under the War Pensions Act passed last year, governing the pro-cedure of Local War Pensions Committees and defining the duties of the secretary, treasurer and chief officers of the Local War Pensions Committees. The Committee is aware of the very valuable local work done by the Local War Pensions Committees which act as the Ministry&apos;s local agents in direct touch with the claimants for pensions and allowances. There are 2,200 of these local committees and sub-committees, and the constitution of each of them has had to be reviewed. Congestion and delays at the centre were, therefore, not surprising.I felt that no re-organisation of headquarters would be sufficient, so I appointed a Committee under the Parliamentary Secretary consisting of members of this House and representatives of Local War Pensions Com-mittees to consider how far it would be advisable to decentralise the organisation. The question was very carefully considered by that Committee, to which I am most grateful. They reported unanimously in favour of decentralisation, and they drew up a scheme-which I have adopted.VOLUME OF WORK.The reorganisation of the headquarters and the re-casting of the local organisation had to be carried out at a time of great pressure due to demobilisation of the Army. Before demobilisation commenced, men were dis-charged from military hospitals, and their discharge documents were sent direct to Chelsea and were awarded
f-    143September, 1919.War Pensions Gazette373upon the fairly complete records then furnished. During the last six months about 150,000 first awards have been made in cases of men discharged from hospital, in addition to 274,000 renewals of previous pensions. This was the normal work of the division. But with demo-demobilisation two other classes of claimants appeared, namely, the Z men and the Article 9 cases.Nearly 3,000,000 men were demobilised in the first six months of this year. About 385,000 men made claims. The claim was made on a Z.22. These are the men we call Z claimants, but in addition there were others who, for some reason or other, did not make claims. They are not debarred from claiming; they can still claim under Article 9. These we call Article 9 cases. In January last I established the Z branch as an emer-gency branch to deal with these cases only.It was organised and directed by Mr. Demetriadi, a business man of great ability, and but for his untiring-efforts and for the excellent work of the staff under his direction, there would have been very serious delay in dealing with the 385,000 claims received. All through February and March the arrears increased, by the middle of June arrears had disappeared. The greatest number of awards made in any one week was 35,800, a really remarkable performance.Of the 385,000, 303,000 claims were admitted. There is still considerable delay in the Article 9 cases, and a special inquiry is now being conducted to simplify and hasten the procedure.In December last public notices were issued broadcast calling attention to the three classes of pensions to any one of which parents might be entitled. The result was a great flood of applications and a mountain of corre-spondence. The arrangements to deal with the inflow were hopelessly inadequate. Large arrears soon piled up. There are capable men now in charge, and within a few months J hope that the causes of delay will be removed.I do not wish to offer excuses, but in addition to a continuous process of reorganisation the Ministry has had to deal with the very heavy work thrown upon it by demo-demobilisation. During the last six months 920,000 awards have been made, and 94,000 claims for pensions have been rejected or have run out by effluxion of time. Mcn&apos;s cases alone amount to about 6,500 awards each working day.INNOVATIONS.In January last there were two Appeal Tribunals hear-ing appeals. Now fifteen have been constituted, and arrears are being overtaken, but even yet I am not satisfied that many more tribunals will not be required.So soon as I became Minister I asked the Parlia-mentary Secretary to take the chair of a small Inter-departmental Committee with representatives of the War Office and the Pensions Ministry. The Committee recommended that the officer should be kept by the War Office on pay until his papers were transferred to the Ministry of Pensions to enable his pension claim to be awarded. The War Office, however, were not able to accept this suggestion, so I adopted the next best plan. I obtained authority from the Treasury to make advances to officers in necessitous cases pending adjudication of pension, and some 7,400 advances have been made to cover the time necessary to obtain the officers&apos; papers or to have a medical board. Pension is now awarded within twenty-one days of the receipt of the officers papers. In the last six months nearly 42,000 cases have been dealt with, including the advances I have mentioned.I appointed also a distinguished soldier to act as &quot;officers&apos; friend.&quot; He and his staff of twelve officers have had interviews and correspondence with over 10,000 officers and their relatives.t   .r        1        OFFICERS&apos;  WARRANT,In the early part of the year I also set up a small com-mittce under my Parliamentary Private Secretary, the member for Akrincham (Major Hamilton), to whom I am much indebted for his strenuous work during the last six months. This Committee considered the &quot;Officers&apos; Warrant,&quot; as the officers had been omitted from many of the concessions made to men. These and many other anomalies have now been removed. A bonus of 20 per cent, is payable on that part of the retired pay which is granted for service disability. Thus the minimum retired pay is now  210, instead of  175. A separation allow-ance is also payable of  50 to a wife, or  40 to a dependent if the officer is in hospital. Children&apos;s allow-unce-i were formerly only granted if the officers dis-ablement amounted to 50 per cent, or more. This limit has been removed. Medical treatment can now be given to an officer pending settlement of his claim to pension. Artificial limbs and repairs are now supplied by the State. Pre-war disability retired pay is brought up to the current rate. Widows&apos; pensions granted in respect of previous wars have been increased to the rates of this war. There is a new concession, and a very valuable one, to which I wish to refer briefly. There is a tem-porary bonus of 20 per cent, added to officers&apos; retired pay and to the pensions of officers&apos; widows. This bonus will now be added to the retired pay and pensions and cease to be a temporary bonus. The retired pay and pensions will thus be increased, and after three years, if the cost of living falls, it will be subject to automatic reductions in the same way as men&apos;s pensions, which 1 will presently explain. But for the next three years the increased retired pay and pensions will be payable.MEDICAL SERVICES.I have been fortunate in securing as Chief Medical Officer, Colonel Webb. During the War he held an im-portant position in the Medical Service of the War Office, and he brings a very special knowledge of the requirc-commitments  of the serving man who is now a pensioner. We have already takenovcr from the War Office two hospitals, and arrangements are practically complete for the trans-fer of others. The British Red Cross are assisting the Pensions Ministry as they assisted the War Office, and I have to acknowledge their kindness in offering us the use of some of their hospitals and providing for the con-veyance of cot cases by means of their ambulances. As we take over hospitals, we are bound to provide a nursing service, and I am glad to say that Queen Alex-andra has graciously consented to be President of the Penlions Nursing Service. I have been fortunate in securing as Matron-in-Chief Miss M. E. Davies, R.R.C., and she will act with an Advisory Committee.MEDICAL BOARDING.On the 1st of April last the central and regional staff of the Ministry of National Service was transferred to the Ministry of Pensions, and we became directly responsible for the boarding of all men. On the 4th of August we are also taking over from the War Office the re-survey boarding of officers. I may say that 230,000 men were examined by medical boards in the first six months of this year. There has been a steady and rapid increase right through the year in the number of men boarded owing to demobilisation, and in June last 45,000 men were examined. The Select Committee has recom-mended that any case of doubt should be sent for rehear-ing, either by the same or by a new board, for exam-ination before any alteration is made in the assessment. I entirely agree with that recommendation; indeed, I informed the Select Committee, when I gave evidence before it, that I intended to alter the system as soon as the decentralisation had been completed.It will be possible to set up the Appeal Boards as soon as the medical personnel in the regions has been com-pleted. Thereafter a definite procedure will be laid down, which will be followed in all cases, namely, that if the Medical Assessor, on scrutinising) the report of the board, is not satisfied that substantial justice has been done either to the pensioner or to the taxpayer, he is not
to alter the assessment, but he is to refer the case, either back to the same board or to an Appeal Medical Board, before any alteration takes place. Similarly, if the pen-sloner himself is not content with his assessment, he will be entitled to appeal to a Medical Appeal Board. ARTIFICIAL LIMBS. Soon after I became Minister 1 wanted to be satisfied that the provision of artificial limbs for both officers and men was sufficient. 1 accordingly set up a very strong Committee, upon which several Members of the House kindly served, and they have recently reported. They have made several recommendations which are in the course of being carried out. 1 might say in this con-nection that it is proposed that fitting centres shall be established in connection with orthopaedic hospitals spread throughout the country, and that in addition repair depots shall be opened in populous centres so that minor repairs can be made in a short time.TUBERCULOSIS.I was also not satisfied that the provision made for the pensioner suffering from tuberculosis was sufficient, and, in agreement with the Minister of Health, we appointed a Joint Committee for the, purpose of thoroughly mvesti-gating this question. The Joint Committee has now reported yesterday, I believe and immediate considera-tion will be given to the report. I cannot close without thanking Sir Arthur Pearson for his continued service for the blind; nor can I omit to mention the splendid work being done in many parts of the country by those who are providing and managing hospitals and homes for the paralysed and the disabled requiring long-con-tinued treatment.OPTION OF DOMINION PENSIONS.I propose now to deal with some matters of policy. I will first deal with the question of the discharged dis-abled man who was resident in one of the British Dominions or in the United States at the outbreak of war. I am glad to say the British Government is now in negotiation with the Canadian Government, and if, as I hope, these negotiations can be carried through suc-ccssfully, pre-war British residents in Canada and the United States who enlisted in the Imperial Forces, or Reservists who joined from these countries, will be given the option of taking pensions and allowances, medical treatment and training, and all other privileges, at the rates and upon the same terms as are provided by* the Canadian Orders in Council, instead of the rates of pen-sions accorded under the Royal Warrants. On the same principle 1 shall endeavour to negotiate with other self-governing Dominions that pre-war British residents in those Dominions shall be given the option of taking their pensions from the Dominions instead of from Great Britain.CABINET MEETINGS.I. now propose to deal with the Report of the Select Committee, and to inform the House of the decision of the Government upon the recommendations made. The Report was only published yesterday, but the Cabinet recognised the urgency of the matter, and have given it consideration at two meetings.DELAYS.*1 set up a complaints section, and each one of the complaints received is investigated and a record kept of how long each takes before a proper solution is arrived at. But the Committee^ recommendation goes further. I have recently appointed a statistical officer whose duty it Is to see that progress reports ami statistics are forth-coming, and as soon as this is complete&quot;it will be possible to work along the lines recommended by the Committee. I will see that it is done.EMPLOYMENT (EX-SERVICE MEN),&quot;I have already told the Committee that Si per cent, of our male staff at headquarters is drawn from discharged officers and men.   1 have laid it down that all of thenew appointments of chief officers to the Local War Pen-sions Committees are to be made from discharged officers and men, and for many months past 1 have refused to sanction any new appointments except of discharged officers and men. In order that a supply should be available in May last I set up in the Ministry a school for teaching disabled officers and men the work of Local War Pensions Committees.FULL PAY OR PENSION.8&apos;I made this latter suggestion to the War Office many months ago, but it was not found possible to adopt it. 1 will, however, strengthened by the Committee&apos;s Re-port, again bring the matter to the attention of the War Office.STATUTORY RIGHT AND INDEPENDENT APPEAL TRIBUNALS.*I will deal with these two questions together, as the one is intimately connected with the other. The Govern-ment is prepared to accept the recommendation of the Committee that the Appeal Tribunals shall be set up under an authority independent of the Ministry of Pen-sions, and I am authorised to say that a Bill will be introduced as soon as possible. The tribunals will consist of one legal representative, either a barrister or solicitor, who will be chairman of the tribunal, and a disabled officer in officers&apos; cases, and a disabled man in men&apos;s cases, with a duly qualified medical practitioner. In this way there will be granted a statutory right to assert a claim to pension, and a statutory Court, independent entirely of the Ministry, will be the sole and final judge of whether the right exists in a particular case. This does not entirely coincide with the Committee&apos;s recom-mendation. The Committee seems to suggest that there will be some magic if the words &quot;legally entitled&quot; were inserted in an Act of Parliament, but they take care to say that they do not wish the scales of pensions, and still less the administrative machinery of pensions, to be embodied in the legislation. I do not believe that this would give any man any greater security than he will have under his statutory right to appeal to an independent tribunal if pension is refused by the Ministry of Pensions, and though I shall be perfectly willing to consider any form of words which would strengthen the statutory right to pension I do not think that the suggestion of the Committee would have that effect.It is no longer in the power of any Minister to say : This man is not entitled to a pension. He can go as a statutory right to a Statutory Court to get a decision; and 1 believe that fairly meets the case for a statutory right.APPEAL AS TO AMOUNTSI must say at once that this recommendation appears to me to be entirely impracticable. Let the Committee for a moment consider the work of the last six months. During this six months 920,439 awards have been made, or if I deduct from this total awards to widows, children, and dependents, nearly 700,000 awards have been made either for the first time or on renewal to men. These awards are made for varying periods for from six to twelve months. What the report suggests is that each one of these men should have the right to go before an independent Appeal Tribunal and should be able to appeal against the medical assessment. If even one in ten appeal we should have something like 70,000 appeals in six months, ami the delays would be so great that the appeals could not be heard before the &quot;pension had expired. I do not believe that a reform is possible upon these lines. As soon as the regional organisation is complete medical appeal boards will be set up to which either the man or the Department can appeal. Any out-side tribunal dealing with these assessments would cause so much delay as lo actually deprive (he man of the benefits which the Select Committee desires him lo obtain. INCREASED PENSIONS (SLIDING SCALB).*1 have only one observation to make upon this part of
144September, 1919.        War Pensions Qazette 375the recommendations. The Select Committee proposes that any increase made should hold good until March, 1921, when the first readjustment should take place. I think this period is too short. Our object should be to give a sense of security to pensioners. The Government is therefore prepared to go further than the Select Com-mittee proposes in this connection, and to say that the increases shall be for a period of three years, and that the automatic readjustment shall take place, as to 20 per cent, of the pension, after three years.INCREASED SCALE (MEN&apos;S PENSIONS).&quot; The Government is prepared to accept the new scale proposed.The scale for the partially disabled will be a perccnt-tage of the full scale, according to the percentage of his disability. There are, however, certain reactions from this increase which will have to be considered and about which 1 am not in a position to make a final statement to-day. For example, a single man in lodgings away from home for treatment or training has frequently obtained, besides his present pension, an allowance of 7s. 6d. a week towards his board and lodging. He will now have  2 a week, out of which he will be able to maintain himself. Similarly, a married man under trcat-ment and training at home in certain cases obtained an extra allowance up to 7s. 6d. a week. As he and his wife will now have 50s. instead of the previous 33s., this extra allowance should, I think, be discontinued.There are also certain treatment allowances for men in institutions, and wives&apos; separation allowances and con-stant attendance allowances, which may have to be re-considered. I do not wish to do more than indicate that as the substantive pension is being largely increased the allowances which were intended to make up for the previous inadequacy of the pension in certain cases will have to be reconsidered.INCREASED PENSIONS (WIDOWS).&quot;The Government is prepared to accept the Committee&apos;s recommendations. The new scale will, therefore, be in the case of a widow under the age of forty without children 20s. a week, and in the case of a widow of any age with children, or over forty without children, the pension will be 26s. 8d. a week. There will be paid, in addition, in respect of the first child .10s., in respect of the second child 7s. 6d., and subsequent children 6s.INCREASED ALTERNATIVE PENSIONS.&quot;In my evidence before the Select Committee I put to them two proposals for meeting this position, and one of these proposals has been adopted by the Select Committee, namely, to load up the pre-war wages by 60 per cent, in order to get at figures which could be fairly compared with present figures. The Government is prepared to adopt the recommendations of the Select Committee. So that a man who was, in fact, earning 50s. a week will be deemed to have been earning 80s. a week, and his present earning capacity will thus be compared with the 80s. and not with the 50s. The Government is also prepared to vary the basis of assessment by loading the full pre-war earnings increased by 60 per cent, up to 100s. a week, so that the maximum alternative pension will in future be  5 instead of  4 10s. With regard to widows&apos; alternative pensions, the same principles will apply. The pre-war earnings of the husband will be loaded up by 60 per cent., and the maximum of the widows&apos; alternative pension will be  3 6s. 8d. a week instead of the present maximum of  3.OPTION TO TAKE ALTERNATIVE PENSIONS.&quot;The Government is prepared to accept the first of these recommendations, namely, that a widow with children who at first goes on the flat-rate should have the option to take an alternative pension as her children cease to be entitled to children&apos;s allowances, but in order to obtain this right she will have to make an application and prove her right to alternative pension within a year.   Thesecond recommendation is of less importance; it requires some further consideration, and I will not deal with it to-day. It will be understood that the automatic sliding scale will apply to alternative pensions as well as to the flat-rate pensions.INCREASE! AUTOMATIC.These alterations will throw considerable additional work upon the Department. It is not an easy thing to change the amounts of pensions and allowances payable to 1,000,000 people. The new rates will, therefore, be brought into operation in respect of the first week ending after the 1 st September next. I think it is the 3rd September. This gives about a month to make the necessary pre-reparations, and so it is not probable that the increased payment will actually be made on that date, but any arrears which may accrue will be paid as from that date. I do not wish to invite a deluge of correspondence, so that I give notice to all concerned that it is quite unneces-sary to write to the Ministry or to the Local War Pen-sions Committees, claiming the increases. The increases will be made automatically. With regard to alternative pensions, however, claims will have to be made by the claimants to the Local War Pensions Committees, and they will be adjudicated as rapidly as possible. It must, however, be many months before the large number of persons newly entitled can receive settlement of their claims. Meanwhile, they will draw their pensions at the flat rate, and all arrears which may be due to them will be settled as from a date in September.I should like to thank the Select Committee, on behalf of the Government, for the great care they have given to the matters referred to them. I am sure that every Member of the House will feel indebted to them for their able report.I am sure the Chairman of the Select Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Salford (Sir Montague Bar-low) has had a specially strenuous time. He has not only been Chairman of this Select Committee, but he has been Chairman of the Select Committee on Tuber-culosis, which has brought in a report equally able. I regret that I have detained the Committee so long. My excuse must be the importance of the subject, and the desirability of letting everyone, including the pensioners themselves, know that every effort is being made not merely to do justice to the disabled by adequate pensions, but also by improvement in and quicker working of the administrative machinery.MAJOR COHEN:I am quite satisfied that the limbless man is getting his first leg quickly; but as regards the renewal and repair of the artificial limb I think the Com-miltec will agree with me that the position is not at all satisfactory. In many cases there is serious hard-ship, as the pensioner is unable to fill any employment while waiting for the necessary repairs.Would it not be possible to adopt some principle like that which is used in France? That country is divided into various centres, each with its own hospital. All that a pensioner who requires anything done to a limb has to do is to go to the local police, purely for identification, and they send him immediately to the nearest fitting hospital, where the limb is repaired and he is sent back to work in a couple of days.MR. HOQOE: I suppose that I have been responsible as much as most people for criticising the Pensions Minis, try. 1 have dealt with successive Pensions Ministers, and I am glad to admit that since the present Minister of Pensions took office, if I take my own post-bag as an average indication of the way in which complaints have moved, the complaints reaching me have altered&apos; from 75 per cent, on pensions and 25 per cent, on military service matters to 75 per cent, on military scr-vice matters and only 25 per cent, on pensions matters, and if my right hon. Friend wishes to take that as a* Indicates Recommendations of Select Committee.
376War Pensions Gazette        September, 1919.testimony to his administrative ability he can do so. I do consider that the Pensions Ministry has gained enor-mously by the administrative ability of my right hon. Friend. There is one point which 1 think has not yet been covered adequately. The Government say that they admit a statutory right to a pension. 1 should have thought that that means that a man has a legal right. My right hon. Friend is providing a new Court of Appeal which may be a legal Court of Appeal. He said that those Courts were going to be set up by the Lord Chancellor, that they will be presided over by one legal gentleman, preferably a barrister, and that the other members of the Court will be officers in the case of officers and men in the case of men, with a medical assessor. I have never known a legal Court constituted in that way.SIR L. WORTHINGTON-EVANS: This is a Court which is to be set up by an Act of Parliament, and is therefore a legal Court.MR. hoqge : I do not see how a man who is deprived of all right is going to establish his right before this Court. My right hon. Friend forgets that in many cases which will arise in years to come a man may want to estab-lish a perfectly legal claim to a pension, but he could not do so.SIR L. WORTHINGTON-EVANS: My hon. Friend is con-contemplating the case of a man two or three years after-wards making a claim. One of two things will happen  either that claim is to be accepted and a pension awarded or else it is to be refused. If it is refused, he has a statutory right to go to a legal Court and to appeal against the refusal, and the Courfs decision is final. So he has either a pension or a statutory right to appeal.MR. HOGGE: There is one point in the process of a man&apos;s award of pension which creates more dissatis-faction than any other. The average man feels, and feels very acutely, that it is a descending process. If my right hon. Friend would address his ingenuity to that point, he would be removing one of the greatest troubles. I frankly confess that I had quite another speech in my mind until 1 heard the position of the Government. I am willing, on behalf of those sitting on this side, to associate myself with the thanks and gratitude ex-pressed to the right hon. Gentleman and the Government for the very generous way in which they have responded to this Select Committee&apos;s Report.SIR MONTAGUE BARLOW: 1 am personally interested in the Report of the Select Committee, of which I had the honour to be chairman. May I say at once that as chairman I claim no special responsibility or privilege in connection with that Report. If ever a Report was the Report of a Committee as a whole, that Report was. Whatever measure of praise it brings from the House the Committee as a whole is entitled to it. The Pensions Minister has been good enough to say some-thing about my work in connection with that Com-mittee. May I say this : It is referred to in our Report, and 1 wish to emphasise it again how much the pension administration does owe to his ability and energy. We saw traces of it in all branches of pension administration. If a day comes, as I suppose in due course it must, when inevitable promotion removes him from the Pen-sions Ministry, I am afraid there is a possibility of the ex-Service man suffering in consequence.In my opinion, if the public are prepared to foot any bill they are prepared to foot this Bill, for it is the kind of Bill that no one would for a moment refuse to pay.It was suggested by the Minister that one of the difficulties would be that if you put into an Act of Parlia-ment that a man was legally entitled to a pension, you would be bound to put into that Act the scales them-selves. We suggested putting in the words &quot; legally entitled,which were in an old Act passed during the Napoleonic Wars.  There certainly does not seem to beany legal impossibility in putting the phrase &quot;legally entitled &quot; into an Act of Parliament and leaving the scales to be settled afterward. Assuming that that difficulty is not made good, 1 would strongly urge that it is well worth while making this small change, and in so doing they will be removing a great difficulty felt by the men.The regional area is an administrative improvement from which we hope great things. Everything will depend on the type of man you get as regional director, and it will be one of the great tests of administration. He must be a strong, capable man. He must be a man able to resist pressure ; 1 hope, not political pressure, but pressure from all quarters, of whatever kind.I want to say one word about the only very large point which is outstanding, and that is the question ot the appeal on amount. We suggested tribunals of an inde-pendent character, which would sit for tribunal work alone. He suggests appeal boards which are really similar to ordinary medical boards. If that is the only possible alternative, we must put up with it, at any rate for a time, but what 1 would put to the Minister is this : that the evidence given us, which 1 must say entirely accords with my own personal experience, was to the effect that there is nothing to which the men attach greater importance than this question of a free right of appeal to some kind of independent, properly constituted authority. The Minister answers that at the moment it is practically impossible. I venture to hope that under the reconstitution of administration which is involved in the regional system a loophole will be kept open for the consti-tution of proper appeal tribunals on amount of the type which we venture to suggest in our Report.CAPTAIN HACKING: With regard to this flat-rate allow-anceof 6s. 6d., or the subsequent increase to be made on that amount, in any case I have said that this is only paid to the childless wife of a serving soldier. 1 would suggest, with all humility, that it would be better if this payment were made by the regimental paymaster in the form of separation allowance, rather than by the Pensions Minister. I have always been in agreement with the statutory right being granted. 1 would press strongly upon the Government that they should admit the statutory right to a pension. It would get rid of a great deal of discontent among the soldiers, and it would cost the Government nothing to get rid of that discontent.My final point is more in the form of a request. It is not necessary for the Members of this House to ridicule the Ministry. Grievances, errors, or omissions of an individual character would be far better dealt with by a personal letter to one of the Ministers or to their Parlia-mentary Private Secretaries than by a question across the Floor of the House. 1 have communicated extensively with one of the Parliamentary Private Secretaries, the hon. Member for Altrincham (Major Hamilton), and 1 hope I am not out of order in mentioning the fact that I have received complete satisfaction.We ought to see to it that these men and their dependants are in no worse position to-day than they were before the War on account of the sacrifices they have made for their King and country.MR. HODGE: The Minister of Pensions is to be con-gratulated upon the success he has achieved with the Treasury. Generous as is the advance on the present scale, when one takes into account the present cost of living, it is not too generous. We have to realise that all we possess to-day is due to the sacrifices of the men to whom we are granting pensions, because without their success we should have had nothing to provide for.CARTA1N LOSEBY: I cannot imagine an act of the Government more creditable than the act of being able to make up its mind within two days upon a subject involving a huge sum of money as in the present case. I hope the widest publicity will be given to the act of the Government in this respect. It is so vitally important that the soldiers throughout the country should realise,
though there may be grievances, yet the heart of the House of Commons and the Government is most certainly sympathetic. Knowing full well, as I do, the intense sense of comradeship amongst soldiers, you will, I say, achieve that effectively and completely once they fully realise that their broken men are being looked after. But 1 do, once again, urge the Pensions Minister again to consider this question of an appeal on amount. It is of such vital importance to the soldier himself. Perhaps he will consider the proposition I have put forward before-that a medical board might be equally com-petent as now if there was only one doctor upon it and iwo laymen. He would thus get over his difficulty of medical personnel. For my own part I believe he will have not only a satisfactory but a more satisfactory board, lie would then on the Appeal Board be able to have two doctors and he has his superior board!I earnestly appeal to him not to rest until he has achieved a recommendation of the Committee in regard to open court, telling the man then and there what he is going to get, and letting it run.In regard to the War Office paying a man until his medical board has delivered its findings. Why, it is obvious simple justice! You. have that broken man. You are going to throw him on his own resources. The right hon. Gentleman can have the most complete assur-ance&apos; that this House is right behind him if he will continue this light with the War Office.An hon. and gallant Gentleman who made his maiden speech suggested that&apos; we ought not to ridicule the Pensions Minister! Ridicule -the Pensions Minister! Why, anyone who has a grievance, discharged soldiers and the like, are most profoundly grateful to him and to the Prime Minister for sparing for this important Depart-reassessment  one of the most able of his Ministers. It is im-portant that it should go to the country that in the right hon. Gentleman we have one with all qualifications -imagination, wide sympathy, determination, and energy.COLONEL ASHLEY: May I say how profoundly-rgrateful we are to the Government and&apos; to the right hon. Gentle-man for the generous way in which the demands of the ex-Service men have been met, and, above all, upon their promptness in coming to decision? &quot;Who gives quickly gives doubly,&quot; and this refreshing decision afterforty-eight hours&apos; consideration in the face of months of previous delay will give the discharged men confidence that the Government mean to remedy such grievances as exist.I would like the representative of the Government who is going to reply to explain to the House why in the Ministry of Pensions it is still necessary that out of every fourteen people employed eleven of them should be women ?At the&apos; present time I understand that the widow of a private gets 13s. 6d., but the widow of a non-commis-sioned officer or a warrant officer only gets the same amount. I think that must be an oversight in the Royal Warrant.In reference to the question of parents&apos; pensions, I consider that where any pension is awarded based on dependence on the son, it should be paid from the date of death instead of from the date of application for the pension.I think the Pensions Committee should be empowered to pay the difference between the ordinary pension and the prospective alternative pension pending the decision of the Ministry..May I also ask the right hon. Gentleman to con-sider the case of men who have received specific injuries in previous wars, but whose pensions awarded at.the time have lapsed, and they are now debarred from the benefits of the Warrant of 1918?My next point is, that of men who received injuries other than on active service, or the widows of men who were so killed,, who, I think, should be brought under the Warrant of May, 1918, which brings the pre-war pensions up to scale.Would the right hon. Gentleman also consider the case of re-enlisted pensioners in receipt of modified pensions, and have them re-assessed at the present time for total service and for higher rank .attained during the War?MAJOR ENTWISTLE: The maximum disability pension of 40s. a week represents a pre-war value of about 19s. per week, and no one can say that is an extravagant sum for a man who has been totally disabled fighting for us in this War.Note. Space has allowed only ex/tacts of the speeches in debate.SOLDIERS AS SCHOOLMASTERS.Training Ex-Service Men as Certificated Teachers /or Elementary Schools,  at  the   University   College  of  Wales,  Aberystwyth,BY?J. H. DAVIES, Registrar of the College.The University College of Wales received a Circular early in 1917, which had been issued to Universities and University Colleges, asking them to give assistance in the work of training discharged and disabled soldiers for various professional occu-pations.Feeling that the equipment and premises at their disposal did not justify them in offering to provide training in industrial occupations, the authorities of the College decided to approach the Board of Education with a view to formulating a scheme for the training of disabled soldiers as teachers in elementary schools.There was already in existence at the College a Training Department for Degree Students, but, owing to war conditions, the number of men in residence was extremely small. It was evident to the promoters of the scheme that there would be a great demand for men teachers as soon as thewar was concluded, and that the salaries offered to qualified teachers would be much higher than in the past. There was also the further consideration that men who had, owing to their service in the war, .been rendered incapable of pursuing their professions or occupations, might be trained as teachers, and thus qualify themselves for per-manent appointments.In due course the Board of Education approved of the scheme, and gave it every possible support. Precautions were taken that only men who showed a real desire to teach and gave evidence of a love for the profession should be chosen. In this work the co-operation of the chief inspectors of -the Board of Education was gladly given. They undertook to interview all the candidates before admission.A copy of the proposals was sent to War Pen-sions Committees all over the country, but at first
only a comparatively small number of men sent in applications. In the meantime the scheme had been placed before the Ministry of Pensions, and though the Minister was not at the time able to sanction it as one of the training schemes, he gave it every encouragement in his power.In October, 1917, 16 men were admitted to the special two years&apos; course. Amongst those admitted were tea blenders, grocery assistants, newspaper reporters, commercial travellers, clerks, engravers, compositors, regular soldiers and uncertificated teachers.   All these have now completed their twothey have invariably spoken of the keen interest manifested by the students in their studies.Several of the men have suffered very grievously. Some of them have lost limbs, and others have lost the use of their arms, or have been perman-ently lamed. To such men the opening up of a new occupation has been an untold blessing; and there can be little doubt that they will have suc-cessful careers as schoolmasters and be fitting preceptors for the younger generation.Under a recent Circular of the Board of Educa-tion, 1101, issued on the 3rd April, 1919, menUniversity College of Wales, Aberystwyth,years&apos; course, and most of them have been granted their Board of Education certificate. The re-mainder have been granted provisional certificates, which will enable them to obtain positions as cer-tificated teachers, conditional upon their passing an examination within a given time. Six of the men have shown such diligence and ability that they were recommended to pursue degree courses, and to graduate in the university. A further 15 men were admitted in October, 1918, and 30 men were admitted at Easter, 1919. It is proposed to admit 40 students in October, 1919; but for the future, only men who are not qualified for admis-sion to residential Training Colleges will be con-sidered.There is no doubt at all that the scheme has been an unqualified success. The most satisfactory feature is found in the success of men who had no previous connection with teaching. Not only did they work hard, but they showed a real interest in the subjects of study, and a determination to pass the qualifying examination at the end of their course.Many of the College professors and teachers have delivered courses of lectures to the class; and disabled by military service and desiring to be trained as certificated teachers are qualified to receive a special grant of such an amount as will bring the total grant for maintenance up to a sum of  104 for each year of training. The Govern-ment also pays the fees of such candidates.Note. The Circular referred to in the last paragraph was reviewed in June issue of the &quot; War Pensions Gazette.&quot;-Ed. W.P.G.IN  PARLIAMENT.pensions (week&apos;s expenditure).16th July, 1919.Mr. Lyle asked the Secretary to the Treasury if he will state the amounts paid in pensions arising out of the War and in out-of-work pay, respectively, in the week ending 5th July, 1919?The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Pen-sions (Colonel Sir James Craig) : I have been asked to reply to this question. The total amount paid in pen-sions, including treatment and training allowances, but exclusive of the cost of treatment and administrative expenses for the week ending 5th July, 1919, was, approximately, ^1,330,000. I am informed-by my right hon. Friend the Minister of Labour that the amount spent in out-of-work donation for the same period was, approximately, ^820,000,
1 INCOME TAX.17th July,  1919.Lieutenant-Colonel Archer-Shee asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether, in view of the fact that the Income Tax Commissioners have no authority to give effect to the Government&apos;s decision to issue disability pensions and gratuities free of Income Tax until the Finance Bill has beep passed, he will arrange that special permission shall be granted pending the neces-sary legislation?The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Chamber-lain) : My hon. and gallant Friend is under a misapprehension-hension. After the announcement on the 13th february-ary, that it was proposed to seek authority to exempt disability pensions and gratuities from Income Tax, arrangements were made that, pending legislative sanction for the proposed relief, Income Tax should not be deducted in respect of the pensions and gratuities in question.PENSION REVISION (REGULATION),Lieutenant-Colonel A. Murray /asked the Pensions Minister whether the Regulations admit of a man who is appearing before a medical board for revision of pen-sion being asked questions by the board as to his present weekly earnings?Sir L. Worthington Evans: The answer is in the negative.EX-SERVICE MEN (EMPLOYMENT).21st July, 1919.Mr. Raper asked the Minister of Labour what per-centage of the ex-Service men for whom employment was secured through the Labour Exchanges for the two periods 8th June, to 8th November, 1918, and nth November, 1918, to nth June, 1919, were on the dis-abled register?The Minister of Labour (Sir Robert Home): The per-cehtages for Great Britain are 46.1 in the earlier period, and 18.7 in the later period. The number of disabled men placed through the Exchanges was, however, manufactured-ally larger in the later period than in the earlier. I am having the figures circulated with the Official Report.The following are the figures referred to:The proportion of ex-Service men placed in emplo)&apos;-ment through the Labour Exchanges in Great Britain, who were on the disabled register, is as follows :Period.	Ex-8ervifc men placed by Exchanges.	Disabled men placed by Exchanges.	Perrentage ot disabled men.8th June to 8th November,			1918      .......	22,546	10,411	46.I8th November, 1918, to 6th			June, 1919	105,880	19,852	18.7DISABLED SERVICE MEN (TRAINING).Lieut-Colonel Pinkham asked the Minister of Labour whether any scheme has been formulated by the Minis-try of Labour for the training of disabled sailors and soldiers and, if so, where these men should apply for training and receive their allowances?Sir R. Home : The Ministry of Labour is at present engaged in very largely extending the facilities already available for the training of disabled ex-Service men of His Majesty&apos;s Forces. For the present these men should apply for training either to the Divisional Director of Industrial Training for their area or to their war pen-sions committee, who will take the necessary steps to place them in touch with the authorities responsible for providing training. On and after 1st August the allow-ances of men receiving training (other than those who require concurrent curative treatment) will be paid by the Ministry of Labour through the institution or firm where the training is taking place.DISABILITY BONUS.22nd July,  1919. Lieut,-Colonel W. Guinness asked the Pensions Mini-ster whether men pensioned for disability during the year 1916 are in receipt of the 20 per cent, bonus granted on later pensions; and whether, seeing that the increased cost of living affects all pensions alike, he will take steps to remedy this inequality?The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Pen-sions (Colonel Sir James Craig): Men invalided in the year 1916 can claim to have their pensions re-assessed under the present Warrants, and so obtain the bonus. In some few cases it is to the man&apos;s advantage to remain under the earlier Warrants, even without the bonus.APPRENTICES.Lieut-Colonel Sir J. Hope asked the Minister of Labour whether the allowances to apprentices who joined the Army are payable on the date on which their original apprenticeships would have terminated or on reaching the age of twenty-one, whichever is the earlier; and whether there is any difference in the application of this Regulation to Scotland?The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour (Mr. Wardle): The answer to the first part of the question of my hon. and gallant Friend is in the affir-mative, and to the second part in the negative.TIME-EXPIRED  MEN DETAINED.23rd July, 1919.Mr. Holder asked the First Lord of the Admiralty whether Clause 51 of the revised scale of pensions deals with the cases of sailors and Marines who had completed time for pension before or during the War and who have been detained in the Service under the existing law, or as to Marines under 5th Geo. V., c. 16; and if not, will he take steps to include them and treat them in the same manner as pensioners now serving or who have served during the War?Dr. -Macnamara : The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. The second part does not, therefore, arise.TRAINING GRANTS.Mr. W- Graham asked the Minister of Labour whether he has received a copy of a resolution passed by a mass meeting of discharged disabled men at present under-going training for new occupations in the various schemes of the Ministry in force in Edinburgh, pointing out that the new rates of maintenance and training allowances are vague and inadequate ; whether he will state the terms of the new rates in question, and how they compare with those formerly in operation; and what steps he proposes to take to secure maintenance and training allowances which will be sufficient in view of the present high cost of living?Sir R. Home : I have not seen a copy of the resolu-tion referred to. Disabled men eligible for training under the Royal Pensions Warrant mav receive either the Warrant rates of allowance or the Ministry of Labour rates, whichever they prefer. The Warrant rates are an allowance of 33s. per week in lieu of pen-sion, plus 8s. a week for the first child under sixteen, 6s. per week for a second child, and 5s. per week for each successive child. The Ministry of Labour rate!? are 33s. per week plus 6s. per week for the first child under fifteen, and 3s. per week for each additional child, to which falls to be added the amount of the man&apos;s pension rights. Under each scale additional allowances are payable to men living away from home and apart from their dependents; the terms are slightly more favourable under the Ministry of Labour scale. Tra-velling allowances are also pavable under both scales subject to certain conditions. In general, the Ministry of Labour scale is more favourable for ex-privates, es-specially for those with a high degree of disability. The Warrant rates are more favourable to ex-non-commis-sioned officers. I am considering, in conjunction with my right hon. Friend the Minister of Pensions, the question of an adjustment in the amounts given as allowances to trainees.September, iqio.        War Pensions Gazette 379
38oWar Pensions Gazette September, ioioMINISTRY OF PENSIONS CIRCULARS.July 21st, 1919, Circular 185.-Compensation for Loss of Time to Men attending Medical Boards, Medical Referees, etc.It lias been decided to extend the terms of Circular 104 so as to include :-(a) men who are the sole owners of small businesses and who, by reason for their attendance, in the circumstances mentioned in Circular 104, either at a Medical Board or before a Medical Referee or before the Local committee&apos;s Appeals Sub-Com-mittee have either to close their businesses or to pay a sub-stitute to act in their place ; and(b) men who are engaged in certain grades of casual labour ie.g., dockers) who, for a like reason, are unable to get work because they are prevented from attending at the place where, and on a day on which, they are usually engaged.The Minister desires to impress upon Local Committees that great care should be exercised in dealing with cases of this kind. Suitable forms (numbered M.S.D. 19 and 20) have been prepared for use by these men, and further supplies will be issued on application. With regard to the word &quot;substitute&quot; in the declaration, it should be noted that this does not include the man&apos;s wife or any relative who may be living with him. The substitute must be an independent person actually employed and paid by the applicant during his absence from the business.Payment for loss of time in the case of men undergoing out-patient treatment will continue to be made by Local Committees on the scale laid down in Paragraph 40 of the Instructions and Notes on the Treatment and Training of Disabled Men (1917), and may be extended to the classes for which the circular provides, subject to similar cer-certificates being furnished.It should be remembered that in no case (whether under Circular 104 or Instruction 40 of this circular) may compensation be paid at a higher rate than 1/- for each remunerative hour lost, or beyond the prescribed maximum.The payment of compensation in the case of men attending Medical Boards will be made as heretofore by the officer of the Board arranging for the man&apos;s attendance thereat.August 9th, 1919. Circular 186.- Personnel of Committees.Deals with a circular addressed to Local Authorities who are empowered to appoint Local Committees and District Committees under the Naval and Military War Pensions Acts, regarding increased representation to employers and to discharged disabled men on Local Sub-Committees and certain Sub-Committees.August 5th, 1919. Circular 187.-Rules to be observed by Men in receipt of TVpatment Allowances.Deals with Correction Slip (No. 23) showing the revised conditions prescribed under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant and Order in Council in connection with the issue of allowances during medical treatment.QUESTIONS  AND  ANSWERS.Q. 266. I was discharged as Leading Seaman. What allowance am I entitled to whilst in hospital for myself, wife and two children?A. Your own allowance will be 27/6 a week, plus the allowances for Petty Officer time, good conduct badges, service, etc., which have been added to your disablement pension. The exact amount of these, in your case, can be ascertained by sending full particulars to the Secretary, Ministry of Pensions [Seameris Award Branch), Burton Court, Chelsea, S. W.3. The allowance for your wife will be 15/- a week, and for your children 11/8 a week.Q. 2671 If a man died while drawing 50 per cent, pension, would his wife&apos;s pension be based on that amount?A.-It is presumed Art. 17 is referred to. If the pension was permanent, yes; otherwise the grant may depend on the circumstances of the case.Q. 268. I was demobilised in March, and when I saw my own doctor he advised me to claim. I appeared before a Medical Board, and was put down as an out-patient to attend twice weekly. 1 have heard nothing yet about my pension. Can I claim 27s. 6d. weekly, and my wife and child 19s. 6d.? If so, how should I make the claim, and should it be paid from date of demobilisation, March 15th?A. You should consult the Local War Pensions Committee in whose area you reside. Pending a decision by the Minis-try on your claim to Pension, the Committee will arrange lo provide any treatment certified by their Medical Referee to be necessary on account of a disability attributable to or aggravated by service. They will make advances to you at full pension rates if the Medical Referee certifies you Jo be incapable of work, or at rates appropriate to the decree of your disablement if you are certified, capable of work.Q. 269. When the widow of a soldier re-marries and takes as her second husband a man who has served many years, and is still serving, is she eligible for separation allowance on her second husband, her pension naturally being withdrawn?  We have had two cases ofthis kind, the R.P. deciding in one case separation allowance is due; in the other, she is not entitled to separation allowance. Will you kindly inform us which is correct?A. It is probable that both decisions were correct, but, on the information furnished, it is impossible to give a definite answer. A widow in receipt of a pension who marries a serving soldier will receive the Separation Allowance to which she is entitled. If, however, she is ineligible for Separation Allowance, she will naturally not receive any. In either case her own pension ceases on re-marriage.If particulars of a specific case are forwarded, a specificansvoer will be obtainable. Ed. W P.G.Q. 270. Will you inform me whether Regulation 3, Part I., stating that in any cases where the general and financial circumstances of a sailor or&quot;soldier were similar to those of officers a Supplementary Allowance, Special Allowance, or other grant may be granted to his widow or dependant upon the scale applicable to officers, their widows and dependants may be taken also to apply to Alternative Pension. Is a widow whose husband was earning more than ^500 a year before enlistment, and whose circumstances were in every respect those of an officer, eligible to apply for an alternative pension up to ^300 a year?A.-Under the terms of the Royal Warrants, both as regards men and officers, an Alternative Pension to the widow of an Officer or man can only be granted upon the scales and under the conditions set out in the Officers and Meris Warrants respectively. There is no power in the Meris Warrant to grant a widow an Alternative Pension upon the scales applicable to Officers^ widows. The widozv of a private or Non-Commissioned Officer who has been granted an Alternative Pension under the Meris Warrant may, however, apply to the Special Grants Committee for a supplementary allowance under their regulations on the ground that the general and financial circumstances of her husband were similar lo those of an Officer. The amount of the supplementary allowance would be that set out in the Special Grants Committeis regulations.london published BY HIS MAJESTTS STATIONERY OFFICE.

APMDIX XII.AUSTRALIA:   7;ar Pensions Act.Australia&apos;s war pensions are estimated to cost the Commonwealth  6,000,000 for the next financial year. This sum should decrease vvith subsequent years, because many of the pensions are not permanent.   Such temporary pensions are reviewed from time to time, and are renewed, reduced, or increased es the pensions authorities deem just.   The representatives of the returned sailors and soldiers desire that the TCar Pensions Act be amended in several directions, and that its administrations-be brought more into line with that of the Imperial War Tensions Law. The nature of the proposed amendments will be considered at the interstate congress of the Imperial League of Returned Sailors and Soldiers to be held in Adelaide shortly.In Australia provision for the disabled comes unde three separate Ministries.   Hospital treatment is a matter for the Defence department; restoration of industrial efficiency is supervised by the Repatriation department; and the assessment and payment of the discharged soldiers.&apos; pension comes under the control of the Federal Treasury, but as the after-care of the cisabled soldier, his training in curative workshops, or the disappearance or permanence of his disability, and the amount of his pension are matters largely interdependent, it would seem desirable that they should be administered by the same department.   Gases have occurred in Australia where soldiers have failed to obtain the full benefits of massage and other treatment^by their irregular attendance at hospitals.   Under the Imperial Law, such failure to take advantage of hospital facilities would mean a reduced pension.One complaint made by the League against the responsibility administration in Australia is that a manfs earnings after discharge are tai-cen into consideration when his pension is being finally reviewed.   The officials of the League are of opinion that many men now receiving pensions would put forth greater efforts to earn their own livelihood if they were assured that higher earnings would not mean lower pensions. The League have decided to press for the adoption of tne Tritish system of assessing pensions.The Argus.May^7th k 14th, 1919
mm ZEALAND, PROVISIONAL PENSIONS,Provision for Wife,The War Relief Association passed a Resolution in March last to the effect that as che rights of soldiers&apos; wives and children are recognised when a pension is made permanent, and as it is impossible for any man who has a wife and children to live on 30s. per week, the Government be again urged to provide that where a provisional pension certificate is issued to a married soldier, a similar provisional certificate should be made for his wife and children.The Auckland Weekly News, April 3rd, 1919.A deputation from the executive of the New Zealand Returned Soldiers Association at Wellington was received by the Minister for Defence, and &apos;^ar Pensions in April last?The deputation, among other matters, requested that the work of the Pensions Board should be expedited,.   It was mentioned that the decision of the Government to grant a provisional pension to discharged soldiers pending proper investigation of their cases was satisfactory in the case of single men, but that the provisional pension was not sufficient in the case of married men.The deputation also asked that the regulations providing that for a wife to be eligible for a pension- her marriage with a returned soldier must have taken place within two years of the latterfs return should be abolished,   To the minds of the speakers the limitation often inflicts hard-ship upon deserving cases*The Minister said It was only after very grave consideration that the Cabinet had agreed to the limitation of two years, and added that as far as he knew no ether country had been so generous *   There must be a limit, and he could not see how the Government could go further than that at present. .The Auckland &quot;eekly News, April 17th, 1919.
appendix   xiv.NEW ZEALAND.Education of. Soldiers 1 Orphans.A scheme to provide education for soldiers&apos; orphans has been originated by Colonel II.R.Potter, C.M.G., officer commanding the Auckland districts   The object of the schei.e. Anown as the Tre-rt-aavc Schorrs hip fund, is to provide for and educate trie 2,,. 35 ohiliron under 16 years, whose fathe-S were id.lied in tho war.   The average pension received by the mothers of these children doe;-, not enable them to educate their children as they have a right to le educated..To raise a part of the necessary funds, the Trentham art union has been organised,   It is hoped to raise  100,000 by the art union., and a fur-:her  100,000 from patriotic associations and by private donations.   The patriotic as303 Lations are Doing as^ed to subscribe 5 per cent of their available funds,, an amount a.! &quot;Lowed by law.   No patriotic association has so far refused this contribution.The plan is to ta^e children at 14 years.   Those who reach the pass standard in the junior scholarship examination will be sent to high schools, and provided for, Should they continue   to reach the pass standard in the senior scholarship and university scholar-snip examinations, they will be carried through, and. so given professions; the total cost for each child being about  1,000.   Those who do not reach the pass standard will be taught suitable trades. The children will not cost their mothers any thing.   An appeal has also been made to wealthy people to provide whe  1,000 necessary to carry a child right through the university, and several generous grants have been made.The Auckland Weekly Mews., May 2 no, 1919.

F &apos;ANCji: Travelling facilities for Disabled.Early in June the National Office for the Care of the Disabled forwarded to the National Union of Disabled and Discharged Soldiers x a copy of an Order which the Prefect of Police proposed to issue concerning the preference to be given to disabled soldiers in boarding public conveyances.The proposed order provided that disabled soldiers should be furnished with an identity card which, on production, would give them preference of admission to the platforms of the -city and surburban railways under the same conditions as first class passengers, and the right to occupy any vacant   seats in trains trams or buses at the stopping places In priority to ?.ll ordinary passengers.   The same facility is to be accorded to the person accompanying a disabled man unable go about unattended.The identity cards are to be issued by the Prefect of Police only to blinded soldiers and those with leg injuries or whose wounds render It painful for them to stand.The National Union suggested that in addition, since men whose disablement is due to injury of the legs require to have recourse frequently to the use of public conveyances, they should be given passes enabling   them to travel at a reduced rate.Another suggestion put for..arc was that a badge also should be given; and that both the card ana the cadge should be issued by the National Office for the Care of the Disabled for distribution through the medium of the various Associations of discharged and disabled soldiers.&apos;Pne Union hopes to see the provision proposed by the Prefect of Police extended to all means of transport.   The issue of an identity card is all the more necessary since it has been already agreed to reserve seats on certain railways for disabled soldiers.The Minister of Public aorks, Transport and Mercantile Marine has issued a request to the main railways to take measure to ensure suitable accommodation fox disabled soldiers and to draw the attention of the public to tho matter by means of notices in the corridors and compartments.Journal des Hutlies, 21st June, 1919.s   Union National des Kutiles et ,.;e formes.a Pill, recently introduced in the Chamber, providing that men disabled in the war should be entitled for the rest of their lifetime to.travel on all French-railways at quarter-rate has been referred to the Committee ok Public works, Railways, and Ways of Communication.
APPENDIX XVII:PRANCE:   Employment of Disabled Soldiers.In the &quot;Journal des Untiles&quot; (12th May, 1919) the director of the employment section of the National Union of Disabled and Discharged Soldiers k draws attention to the question of employing disabled soldiers.     He states that the Government departments, in which certain posts are reserved for disabled soldiers h have asked the employment section to dissuade men from applying for these appointments and to advise them to get employment on industrial or commercial work.The problem of finding work for the disabled, the writer points out, grows more and more difficult. He asserts that barely 20 posts in every 500 are filled by disabled soldiers;   that employers exploit the disabled, skilled as well as unskilled;   and that in certain cases a miserable wage had been offered.     The provision made for re-education will remain ineffective because the State allowance to men under training is not sufficient for him to keep his wife and children.    The State ought to set the example.The writer complains that the war Is hardly over, yet the enthusiasm has evaporated and a complete indifference has taken its place,    To prove this one has only to enquire Into the experiences of the applicants who go day after day to the labour exchanges.x    Considerable doubt was expressed at the time as to the Expediency of this law as It tended to make men neglect re-education and trust to government employment. , &apos;
ITALY t INCREASED PENSIONS FOR THE DISABLED AND POR nDO?&apos;S AND ORPHANS,The Ministry of War Pensions and Allowances has decided to grant a temporary allowance to war pensioners to take effect from 1st January, 1919 and to continue until 31st December, 1920, by mi oh time the whole of the; pension scale will have been revised.     This allowance will be paid monthly, and will be the same for all military ranks.The first group, comprising those who have suffered serious mutilation, has been sub-divided into classes which receive different treatment according to the following schemes-(a) Privates who have lost all or three of their limbs,or who are totally blind, or Insane, or who are suffering from serious lesions of the central nervous system or from advanced pulmonary tuberculosis, are to have their pension increased from 1260 to 4620 lire annually, including the supplementary allowance for attendance, which has recently been raised to 1200 lire annually.(b) Privates who have lost two limbs or are blind inone eye or are suffering from some infirmity which involves absolute incapacity for gainful work, will have their pension raised from 1260 to 3130 lire, including the supplementary allowance of 1200.(c) For all other infirmities included in the first group the pension will be increased from 1260 to 2940 lire.The pensions for the other categories will be Increased as follows:-Amount of			lire.		lire.	increase2nd	group !1	from	1008	to		3rd		t!	945	n		4th	11	11	882	?i		5th	It	It	756	H		6 th	(1	If	630	If		7th	ri	II	504	1)	864	.... 360 -   &quot;8th		II	378	IT	618	...,240     &quot;9 )	groups	, the	pension		will be	increased by10 )		240 lire		a	year..
