304 ft;PARAPHRASE mSGfcail from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor General of New Zealand. (Sent 4 p.in. 26th September, 1919) .Referring to my telegram of 11th September labour for Samoa His Majesty&apos;s Minister Peking has telegraphed that coolies would have to be recruited in South as northern Chinese are quite unsuited to climate of Samoa, but that South is still outside control of Peking Government,.   Only means ho&quot; can suggest is to come to an agreement with the local authorities of Canton.    He has sounded these on the subject and they state that until they receive report on Chinese labour in Samoa from their Consul there with whom they are trying to communicate by telegraph they cannot give definite reply.    Ho suggests that your Government should also approach the Consul with explanation of the terms offered.New recruiting organisation will be neces-sary as I have ascertained that coolies at present in Samoa were recruited by a German firm in China in virtue of an agreement between the German Consul at Canton and the authorities of the Province.MILN2R. .
