mmtDocument is the Property of     /His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.0 9WAR CABINET.AUTUMN HERRING FISHERY,MEMORANDUM BY. THE POOD CONTROLLER.lo     I have had under consideration the proposal put forward by the President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries&apos; and the Secretary for&apos; Scotland in their memorandum to the War Cabinet of Sept. 17th (G.T. 8167), the main principle of which-is the guarantee during the autumn herring fishery of a minimum price for herrings sufficient to ensure the maintenance of the industry   I note that this price would be about 45/- per cran$ and that it would be applicable to a maximum of 628,000 barrels of herrings to be purchased for&apos; curings2*     An effect.of this al sales at unusually arise when there was a (which is not the case distribution facilit1e the other hand, it is will not, and in fact unless they get a reas and that to secure any consumption, It is afcs be fixed as will giveguarantee would be to prevent occasion-low prices *   This, however, could only glut of fish, and also provided at the present moment) that the 3 were equal to dealing with it,   On quite clear that the herring fishermen cannot afford to go to sea at all, onable return for their work and outlay,adequate supply, even for home olutely necessary for suoh a price to the fishermen a fair reward.3*    Before the war the fishermen were content with an average price of about -25/- per craiu   In view of the all  . round increase in the cost of living, and the very ,great increase, amounting to 250 - 300$, in the cost of&apos;all supplies which the fishermen require in the way of gear, stores, coal etc., a minimum price of 45/- per cran does not appear unreasonable.   This figure   represents rather less than lid per pound0   The margin between this and the present controlled retail price of 7d per pound Is therefore con-siderable, even after allowance has been made&apos; for costs of distribution and reasonable profits to the trades concerned. It should be noted that the price of 7d. is a maximum price, The price for herrings secured by the fishermen necessarily varies with the season and the actual catch.   The maximum price is accordingly fixed at such a figure as will provide a margin to cover these contingencies.   The maximum price Is now be in.-: reviewed and it may be found possible to lowerit provided the fleet can be1 j keptat work,4. In all the circumstances I am of opinion balance of advantage lies in the direction of proposed in the memorandum of September 17th, action will result in no appreciable hardship consumer.that the the course and that this to theGSO.
