MR, GOSLING:   Mr. Prime Minister.   I em speaking to you.now as the President of tho Transport Workers1 Federation and as Chairman of a Conference that has been held this morning.   Our Federation are very muoh involved in the dispute that is now going on*THE PRIME MINISTER:   We are all Involved.HR* (SOSLIHG:   Yes;   but no one can he more so than we.   We have about 100,000 men already affected.     It was absolutely necessary for us at onco to consider what was the best cour^o we could take, and we decided that wo would, if wo could, bring into consultation with us the othor branches who are more or less affected, as we are, to consider the matter,   We met this morning, and we had a very representative gathering; most of the principal organisations of the country wero present through their Executive or their representatives in some way. r/e first of all sent&apos; for Mr0 Thomas and Mr. Bromley to meet us;   and we heard from them a statement of their ease..   V/e consider that they have established the fact that there is a real trade union struggle going on in which we are all involved in the sense that if this is a real trade union struggle it affects us all.    [Hoar, hoar).   How we are not going to say a word about the merits of the disputo;   we think that would not be right;   but1 &apos;,.e do want to express tho very strong opinion that negotiations should be at onco ro-openod,   If that is dona it. will ease the position that wo are now in and possibly enable us to help if our help is wanted  in a settlement, rather than being used to develop the thing as it must develop. I thought you would acree with&apos;mo that it would be very diffi-cult for the trade unions who are involved just to stand idly by and see tho thing go on without putting a little ginger into it on &quot;i/neir own behalf.   That really is the object for which wo havo come hore;   because the Conference felt that if negotiations wore re-opens &amp; thoro mif^ht be nothing else for
them to do;   end wo must find out, first of all, if negotiations can bo opened before we decide on any other course.   Therefore we ha to asked tho Confprohoo to stand by, e.nd wo are ^oing to meet them again this evening&apos;;   and then it may be that we 8hail be able to report to them that all is well, or that they may have to consider what position it will be necessary for them to take up, for their own protection.   I will not weary you. That is putting the thing quite plainly ant?.&apos; bluntly to&apos;you&quot;, that our opinion, is that negotiations should be re-opsncd.   I am now going to ask you to listen- to four representative men who --111 speak oil/behalf of this Deputation and for the  -Conference,     I will askMr. Clynes to.od.ress you shortly on tho position first, and then Mr. -Henderson, after him Brownlio, and finally Ur.: Bavin;   and I think you will gather from them exactly what our position ia.MR. C1YIIBS:   Mr. Prime Minister.   Our instruction israthor a narrow one, and it is not easy to say much and keep within the limits of.that instruction by way of adding to what lh\ Gosling has already said,     But although it may bo a narrow instruction, v/o fool how very grave s.ud how very great the&apos; situation is which has brought us before you.   I am sure that as the hjad of the State you havo in mind what all of us round this table havo in mind - and indeed what every man and woman in the country must have in his mind   namely, a desire to see this dispute settled.     Everyone wants to settle it.   The merits of the difference, as L.r. Gosling has pointed out, we are not here to discuss.     Thiy has resolved itself -for the time being i-.to a contest between the Government and the railway-men&apos;s Unions,     There are people who consider that we hove reached a 3taga where a trial of strength can be determined-   -Va want to put to you, lit. Prim9 Minister a broader and I think a finer consideration  that is, a triumph of reason as against merely the determination of th-a issues now at stake by ciuch show of
foroo as either side may bo able to command.     Though we are not going to ask you to discuss with us the merits of this difference, I think we can go so far as to say that the margin of difference between tho Government.and the Railway Unions is such as to admit of a resumption of negotiations with a hope of a means of. settlement, being found by further   discussion.   If the Government think that the men can be beaten, we had better say to you straight away that our firm belief is that you are wholly mistaken in that view, (Hear, hear).   You no doubt would be able to run a. few trains or to carry certain commodities or necessities of life, and you may be quite entitled to do that;   but the half million or so of men whose work is to deal with these great loads of materials, coal, merchandiset food, and so on, that keep the material life of this country going   those men are standing, and I myself believe will stand, firmly and united until this thing is seen through,,   That is not a mere Labour platitude or sentiment;   we believe it;   and It is because we are so rooted in that belief that we want to see negotiations resumed;.,   and havin,:. invited representatives of the Railwayman this morning to meet a representative gathering of tho Transport Workora1 Federation,, and having hoar thoir case, wo unanimously dooidod that it would bo propor on our part not to t. ko any stop merely to support our sido -* merely to support tha trade union point of view   until wo had represent-sonted to you the desirability of having negotiations ro-oponod and of of Coring our assistance in connection&apos; with resuming, discussion of tho points of difference between tho propor authoritioscI would like.to emphasise what Mr. Gosling mentioned   namely, that in our view this is absolutely what ia called a trado union disputo;   that it to say,, wo regard as having come within tho terms of this dispute only such considerations of working wage claims,, labour conditions, as are usually covered,
by tho torn, &quot;labour qu&amp;rrol.!&apos;    It is not therefore a political issuo, and wo do not want to hsvo it broadened in any sonso in that direction.   It may be of course that a fow persons on either side may look upon this dispute as something thft can be used for other purposes, and that can bo said of ono side just $a well c.s of the other;   or indeed in equal measure it can be said of both.   But your handling of trade union disputes in previous years I think has invariably shown a desire to settle matters reasonably as between the two sides, and to keep tho nation in s composed condition.     It is in that spirit that wo approach you to-day.Bow let me add this, that wo,as transport workers in vary many and various ways feel that if tho Government has made up its mind, or if it does make up. its mind, to sec this thing through, in tho sense that they are determined to beat the railwaymen in their claim and to compel thorn to su::-x&apos;OJif;e;.? or to break the striko   if that is tho determination of the Govern-ment wo want frankly ,to say to you that we fear that those whom we represent   frill regard that- as a challenge which, mast bo answered. . Wo do not want to challenge;   wo do not want to seek merely a triumph of strength in connection with, this difference; we ere hero to appeal for a victory of reason, and urge upon you.the desirability of having negotiations re-opened as between tha Government and the representatives of tho Railwayman,MR. A, HENDERSON:- - Mr. Prime Minister.   The first point thatI should like to emphasise is this;   that tho Conference upon -whoso behalf wo&apos; are acting this afternoon was, having regard totho time for organisation and to tho lack of facilities (about which wo all know something) really vary representative.I I do not think that any apology is necessary for their comingtogether or for their sending this Deputation.   You can, I boliovo,almost more than any other man in the community, ba possessedinof tho tromondous consequences that arc involved this/1isputo.
But I do not know that wo have ever had a dispute quite like&apos; this.     You and I in days goh   by have been associated in attempt :to settle disputes.     I think during certain stages in the war we had to take very definite action:   we took that definite action always on the ground that we believed that the conse-quences to the nation as a whole wore to be considered.     I am on this Deputation this afternoon because I believe the conse-quences arising out of a prolongation of this dispute and a continuance of some of the misunderstanding that has already arisen regarding the issues involved in the dispute are serious to the community as a whole-     In another sense we have never had anything like it.     I remember   I think in 1911 -  you and I were associated in attempts to settle a dispute on simi-lar lines and by the same great industry,,     But in that case the position was not quite like -&quot;hat it is to-day,.     In those days you acted as a member of the Government,     The employers in those days were the Managers representing their Companies.. You did a3 you have done pn many occasions during your oxper-ience at the Board of Trado and in other Offices   you did all that in you lay to bring the parties together,.     &quot;&quot;ell now., the position is changod..     You are the employer..     Unless some-oar,,:&apos;- acts as we are acting to-day, there is no third party (as it wore) to bring you together;   and our groat object   in fact not only our primary but our sole object   is to suggest to you   no,r? that both sides realise more than they did oven four or five days ago what there is involved in such a. struggle   whether it is not possible for negotiations to be ..i\ --m entered into;   whether we can be the medium of breaking the ice (as it wore) and bringing the two parties together in any way.     I think personally that in urging this I can claim to be uninfluenced by any of  hose &quot;anarchistic&quot; considerations referred to in.your telegram.
THE TilWS MI1jIoT?.H:   Yes. .MR. K^rraW:   If I ha a wants a tc take that lino I think you -ill agree v/ith ne, Mr, Prime Minister, that I could have taicon it last March when, at your invitation and with your agreement, in that Conference I did all I could to keep things on sane and constitutional lines.     I happen to have gone away on Friday, before this broke out;   I did not get back until Monday night.    I spent the whole of yesterday in trying to grasp the re 1 meaning of this struggle; ond see if some-thing could be done.     Therefore personally I can lay my heart bare so far as these considerations that seem to have influenced your minds v/hon you issued your telegram on Satur-day are concerned.     After all, I could quote another precedent of another important character that ought fc$ bear on your mind at this time.-     I think It was in 1912 we had the great coal strike.     There again the Government, without waiting, intervened;   they used all their influence, left no stone untutned;   to bring the cbalowners and the miners together. You vjqto a member of the Government, and Mr. Asquith was P-imo Minister.     They succeeded in bringing them together, and although thoy had had many meetings between themselves before, it was not until you&apos; got thorn together, rnd the experience of the few flqys that both sides had had exercised a salutary effect upon them, and they wore much more pliable to the influence that was&apos; brought to bear, that settlement was reached.
I just quote- these things because, as Mr. Gosling and Mr. Clynes have said, the issue we have to put before you is exceed-ingly narrow.     V.e only heard the statement this morning in order to get that assurance, that this was not avpolitical but a trade union dispute, and i can assure yea that there was aot a member ofj the Conference who reached the conclusion that it was not a trade union disaute in its character.     How if it is trade union in its character   and we are prepared to make you a present of this   we realise thst you are in a better position to-day to fight than you have ever been in the history of this country,        \&apos; \ You have gone through a war.     You have a machine.     You have not III] allowed that machine to be scrapped, and you can put the machine that was created out of the patriotism, a machine which you never could have created, as I have heard you say over and over aaala, without our assistance   (hear., herr)   you can put that machine into operation ag&quot;inst the men without whose as^istr-nce you could never have brought it into being in the first instance. And you can smash some of our trade unions,.    In other words, you can make us spend every half-eany we have accumulated during the war.     I am not going to insult your intelligence for a single moment by suggesting that when you have done that you will be satisfied that you have done all that is necessary, because you know full well that then you would only be at the beginning, and not at the end.     ..;e have come to you as you have come to us, as you have come to me, and ue you have come to other trade unions in days gone by, to say:   &quot;Coma and settle this thing.&quot;     You have had days of it, and you know   h---t it means, and in spite of all the conferences we have had before, you have said, &quot;Come together again,&quot;     I know you do it probably with a unique influence, time after time again.     How wo come to you.     The veryi
first step we take, and without telling the other side that we have come, we have come to yon first of all, and we say: &quot;Can the negotiations not be continued, and in such a way probably that they will lead tc some accommodation being found that will save you and- the country all the disaster, all that must inevitably befall both the country and the: workers from their own particular standpoint, if this thing goes on indefinitely?&quot;   That is all I have to say.MR. BROWHLIxi&apos;-:   Mr. Prime Minister, I am here for the very reason, as explained by my friends Mr, Gosling and &quot;Mr. Clynes and Mr. Henderson, and as wo appreciate, when we have met in this room, on memorable occasions previously, I have generally been, in the attitude of a combatants     Wo have a difference between us on this occasion,, in that I have come in a concclia-tory mood.     I have comt&apos;; aS it uere, holding the oli-ve branch in my hand, with a sincere desire to erect some bridge or super-structure whereby the Government and the national Union of Railwaymen can meet and settle -this difference.     Into the merit of the l&apos;].U.R&apos;s case I am not going&apos; to enter.     All I am anxious to do is to avoid an extension 01 this struggle.     I can assure you, Mr. Prime Minister,, that I have on my desk at peckham Road hundreds of telegrams from.various parts of the country asking instructions, many of then demanding, that they should be immediately withdrawn to ..support &quot;the H-.U.-R., and they say that this is a matter of vital import&apos;nee-.     we considered the ques-tion very carefully, and having-regard to the sincere desire on the , art of the U.U.K-. to keep the dispute within their own limits, to safeguard -the /interests of our own organisation and to safeguard the interests of the nation,- we have instruc-. ted out men to remain at work, but not to do work that was done by the N.U.R., who are now&apos; out.     How far we shall succeed in our endeavour to maintain peace within- our own borders I am not
in a position to say;   but I appreciate that the people oi&apos; this country are not in a reasonable, dispassionate frame of mind, in consequence of what they have undergone during the past five years.     I also recognise that there are turbulent spirits in the country, who are not making your task or our task any easier.     I realise what will happen if this dispute spreads. As one of my own members assured me last night   he was not an official of the Society   if ever there was an issue which demanded unity of the part of the workers, if ever there was an issue which we should fight, that hi&apos;sue is here and now. I mention those things to you to give you some indication of the temper and the spirit of our people, and I am here, as I have indicated, in a conciliatory mood;   and even at some loss of prestige, even as the risk of being misunder-stood, I appeal to you as the head of His MajestyTs Govern-ment to take into your serious and sympathetic consideration the representation .that has been made, and to scse if it is not possible for negotiations to be opened up between you and the N.U.K., and I believe a settlement will be arrived at. Those winged phrases that fell from your lips during the war about this being a better country, and a fit country for heroes to live in, with the sincere desire of all those who have given up their best to save Europe from the Prussian menace, and to make it fit and safe for democracy   we are all an ious to help you in the upbuilding of the great work that lies before you;   but we assure you you will not be successful in your endeavours to make this a greater and better country if you are going to force an issue and extend the area of the present dispute,     I know something of the history of the Revolutions which have taken place in the world in the past.     I know something of the horrors that went in the wake of those Revolutions, and I am an nous to avoid that in this country,     Again., I appeal to you to listen with a sincere desire to meet these people, and to settle the dispute
in the interests oi&apos; each and all of us, and your name will be revered by all.UR* Mr. Prime Minister, our task since lastFriday has been a very difficult one,-    I took a car and went round the vest of England and South v/ales on Saturday and Sunday, and also a part of the Midlands and other places/ I was urged by the men I met to give the word to come out at once.     I advised them to hang on and to see what could be done.     The fact that you have to use a war organisation&apos; to defeat the railwaymen.&apos;at the moment is a further incite-ment to the docker, who is called upon to load, or would be called upon to load things, and I find from all parts of the country telegrams coming in that they will refuse to take any part or to assist in any means which will defeat the railwaymen in this struggle.     That cannot last very long; the crash will have to come.     In addition to that, my colleagues of the Transport Workers1 Federation have been bombarded by the passenger-carrying men of London to give the word for them to stop.     I do not know whether the press is influenced from this house;   but in that restraining influence we have not been assisted by the threatening statements that have been issued as to what would happen if the busmen came out.-TEE PRIME Mill I STEP:   What kind of statements?MR. BEVIU:   The threatening statements that the Government will find sufficient men to drive all the buses, and the rest of it, and almost challenging them to come out and see what will happen.     If you see. the statements issued by the London Press day after day, I think I can say that is generally the tone of challenge that has1 been thrown at the busmen, particu-larly since last Monday. ..The same thing a, plies to other work people^ and we feel that the whole thing must come to a crash
in the interests oi&apos; each and all of us, and your name will he revered by all.MB, aavID:   Mr, Prime Minister, our task since last Friday has been a very difficult one.     I took a car and went round the west of England and South wales on Saturday and Sunday, and also a part of the Midlands .and other places. I was urged by the men I met to give the word to come out at once.     I advised them to hang on and to see what could be done0     The fact that you have to use a war organisation to defeat the railwaymen at the moment is a further incite-ment to the docker, who is called upon to load, or would be called upon to load things and I find from all parts of the country telegrams coming in that they will refuse to take any part or to assist in any means which will defeat the railwaymen in this struggle.

In addition to. that, my colleagues of the Transport Workers1 federation have been bombarded by the passenger-carrying men of London to:give the word for them to stop.     I do not know whether the press is influenced&apos;from this house;   hut in that restraining influence we have not been assisted by the threatening statements that have been issued as to what would happen if the busmen came out,THE PRIkiS MINISTER:   What kind of statements? MR. BEVIiJ:   The threatening statements that the Government will find sufficient men to drive all the buses, and the rest of it, and almost challenging th^m to come out and see what will happen.     If you see the statemen ts . issued by the London Press day after day, I think I can say that is generally the tone of challenge that has been thrown at the busmen., particu-larly since last Monday.     The same thing , a, plies to other work-people, and we feel that the whole thing must come to a crash
unless reason takes place and negotiations cowe about to. take &apos; the place of the present impasse.   I also want to say this extent V.-e all of us on trJ a aide of the table, as -&quot;ell as yourself, have had a good deal of experience in handling disputes, but aa &quot;To Henderson pointed cut, even your Minister of Labour cannot be an impartial man in this dispute;   he ia part of the Government that is involved in it; and we of course in our usual nay thought it would be better to act in a conciliatory manner, end see what your attitude would be to the whole move-ment.   I do not think there ia a member of the trada unions of the country who does not feel that he is involved in the decision or outcome of this strike, or in whatever the out-come of the settlement may mean.   But without going into the merits or   demerits of the dispute, there in a growing, con-consciousness that the whole movement ia more or less challenged by the policy that has been adopted.   We have not allowed that feeling to develop.   V/e have urged that we would try and get all the re ponsible officers of the Unions together that we could, and see whether in the circumstances that bridge could be built which has been referred to by Mr, Brown-lie 0   Speaking on behalf of the Dockers, particularly, and the Transport Workers   passenger and other road vehicular workers   I oan assure you the resentment at the whole position is very strong; and I think it would considerablyoase things if it were announced that the parties had againismet; and if itypor.si.ble for you to-day to adopt that attitude sometimes it takes, I think we all agree, a stronger man to climb down from an untenable position than it does to get into one   if both sides can move towards meeting without imposing onerous conditions upon the meeting, or anything of that kind, it will materially help to remove the difficulty in which we are,   I think I ought to say that there is a very
o 10strong resentment also at the statement you made last Saturday,, that the dispute was a result of a small anarchist conspiracy.,THE PR BIB MINISTER:   I did not say the dispute was;   I said the strike was.   I still say that; but that is another matter,   I did not say the dispute.   The dispute was a bona fide trade union dispute; but I do say that It was exploited by a small body of men with ulterior  saoti 63, who would not allow us to continue the negotiations.   I say their motives were not bona fide trade union motives to settle hours of labour and to settle wages, but that they were ulterior motives.   I did not want to refer to it, but you V-ave referred to it, and I say it without any hesitation, and I have only -to quote one or two things from here, and you will see.   The first time they ever came was on Thursday afternoon, with a dispute which had taken three months to negotiate.   I said t^ them&apos;; &quot;I really cannot settle this in 24 hours;   I beg of you to give rce two or throe days.&quot;   I will show you at once why I say that, because it is important.   I am not an enemy of trade unionism, and I decline absolutely to be considered an enemy of trade unionism.   I would take no part in making war on trade unionism.   This is what I actually said:   &quot;I mean in order to get over the next 24 hours it is quite impossible, if you really insist on coming out, if you are right, in fact I think it hopeless to endeavour to havo a discussion.   Therefore I would ask you to put it off at any rate for two or throe days so as to give us a realchance of talking tho matter over.   Then it occurred bo meI hud he*rd that It was thought we would take advantage that perhaps they thought we would take advantage^ f that,and prevent their posting notices, zo I went on to say: &quot;Ihave no desire to take any unfair advantage; we will not stop
your notices or anything of the -sort&quot;---- (reading down to tho words)   &quot;to prevent you declaring your strike.   That if- certainly not our intention,:&apos;     Vie would have given thorn the sane -facilities-to declare it on i-onday an had already been given to them on -Friday., and I hep -;ed them to put if off for two or three days,   -as that an unreasonable request for me to make.   Ttcy only came to me at 4 of clock on Thursday afternoon.   I wan faced with a strike at 12 on Friday.   I had to listen&apos;to their case, and it is.perfectly true they only decided by a. small majority, I understand, to refuse to extend tho time.   But I deliberately say I have come to tho conclusion after watching ver   carefully.   I am not without experience in trade union strikes-,; I know when men really come-to discuss the merits of a thing, and I also know when there is something else behind .-- I absolute-ly have no hesitation-in saying that in those who engineered --this strike, not the majority who wanted to givo an extra two or three days to discuss the matter, but in the other8; there wan an ulterior motive.   I havo no hesitation in saying that.Mr.GOSLING-:   I think we are on a wfully dangerous ground.THE PRI;iE MINISTER:   I did not want to refer to it; I did not mention this; Mr.tB.evin referred to :it.Mr.GOSLING:   I want if I can to get us back to where we wore.     &apos;-o came here not to.discuss merits of this dispute In any way at all.     We cannot be on one aide and cone and try to act as the bridge that in going to put the thing together again.   We wanted to avoid the  -erits in every possible way we could, and only to ask that negotiations should be opened up between the parties who. are interested so that thoy can make their own settlement quite apart from
us.   It Is nothing to do with us.   *.7e are satisfied if the settlement Is made.   It will have thin other very special advantage, that if something of thin kind cannot he done wo have to go back to our Conference to consider what wo must do, and that Is another matter that we shou?d prefer to avoid if it were possible,   I a-  afraid If we sit in this room and discuss the meritr, of the dispute, and then the railwaymen hear that wo have been doing this, they will regard it as having been unfair to them that we should sit here to discuss a dispute to which), for the moment, we are no party, and which we only want too see ended,.THE rRI&quot;&apos;E MINISTER.:   I will only say this,   I think you&apos;&apos; began hy saying that you heard llr Thomas&apos;s side.   I also hope you will hear what the Government have to say,   I think it is only fair to hear hoth sides, and I want you %&amp; hear both sides; and I only hope to have the same indulgence as was extended to Mr Thomas to hear what I have to say on the part of the Government later.MR BEVIN:   I was only stating the facts of the position, and not what you said in your telegram,THE PHI;&apos;E MINISTER:   Lot me say this.   I never said that the trad - unions were an anarchist conspiracy.MR BFVIH:     I did not say that.THK PRI&apos;&apos;E minister ii   I simply said there was a small body of men who were trying to exploit trade  unionism,MR BEVIN:   what I said was this.   I was merely dealingwith the point of restraining tho men;   the inferences they gained from statements of that character have already preju-diced the position.   That was the point I was raking.   It made our task particularly difficult inrestraining the men. We want to impress upon them the reasonability of trying to got negotiations open, in order to clear those things out of the way and to have the position clarified; and we hope settled.      That was the point I v/as giving you when you made your statement.   That Is all I have to say,
THE PRIME MINISTER:     If you will allow me, I should like to put to you a few considerations.   In the first place let me say I am delighted that you have come,, and I thank you for the opportunity of putting before the leaders of the Trade Unions you represent the Government view of this matter.   Everything is to be gained by conversations like this.   What Mr Henderson said is true.,   I have always been in favour of Government state-mentsj   there could not have boon misunderstandings cleared up without conversations.   As we all know, nothing spreads more rapidly than misrepresentation,&apos;, therefore I am delighted that you have come here to have a talk with me upoft this subject. I would also like to say that I agree with every word that has been said as to the extreme gravity of the situation, and still more of the prospect.   I know as well as anyone the gravity of tho situation.   You cannot have 600,000 men  * men who repres-ent, as it were,. the jugular vein of the country   affected without very dangerous consequences to the vtfhole community. If that jugular vein is severed it in true that we may be able to keep the patient alive Until wo manage to rejoin the broken ends, but nevertheless the position in full of gravity, and complications nay arise in other parts, as you point out. That I know... I am under no delusions r;  to the possibilities. I can soo even other dangers which I think are oven greater, and Nftich from my point of view I regret more.   They cannot be altogether absent from your minds either, I am sure they cannot. . A conflict of this kind ends in reacting on the temper of the country, which reaction is not conducive to the progress which either you or I desire.   That is always  hat happens.   The machinery for bringing about progress in dis-crodited, the temper of the people swings eventually in another direction, and I cannot conceive a greater disaster than a strike of this kind. /Whether it succeeds or whether
it falls I or:; sorry to say that the result would be&quot; pretty much the same.     You represent certain demands to which I probably right not asrent; but in the main we would like to travel in the same direction; and I do not believe that the nation would travel without very heavy footsteps in that direc-tion after a struggle of this kind.   You must have that in your minds7 and therefore 1 deplore it more than I can toll you. The&apos; Prime Hindator under normal conditions has very much to do, but these arc, not normal conditions, and even after the Peace, the amount of work which a Prime&quot;Minister has to do is tremen-dous.   It Henderson knows as well as anyone what happens in the case of a war, and there ia really no less to do when you are clearing up the debris, aa it were, of war.   Therefore I could not keep my eye on the negotiations which were going on, and I do not pretend that I did*   Thoy went on for months and months with the Railway Executive0   Then someone said they threatened to come out of Friday   that was not with a week&apos;s notice] I think it was 48 hours, or something of that sort   and then I said, &quot;I had bettor sec them,&quot;   I knew perfectly well what a railway strike meant, and I was not going to have a railway strike with every possible complication thrown in without knowing what it was about.   I felt this, that as long as I was here I was the trustee of tho national interests for all class-es; and I demanded that negotiations should be passed on to my charge.   The Board of Trade and the rest agreed that was right, and it was communicated to the National Union of Railwaymen,who also felt.that this was right.   They came here at 4 o&apos;clock on Thursday.   I felt It right to hear the view of the railwaymen, as the more I went into it the more I was convinced that it was exceedingly difficult to clear up a very complicated dls-pute of that kind in 24 hours..   I do not think that my question was unreasonable, that they should put it off until Honday. I felt that sitting continuously - as I meant to do, Thursday,
Friday, Saturday, Sunday if nocor;.:vary, and i.Monday   wo night be able to arrive at aono definite arrangement.   I am talking here, to men who have much more experience in Labour&apos;disputes, than I hi.vo, but I Ir vp cone, and I h. ve a-an Labour diapviten break down- hopeleonly, and yet   one how or other in tho end; with patience and goodwill, nomoone hits upon an idea of which no one el.ee had thought, and you try that line, Perhaps you feel that it will not carry you any further, and then so&apos;0-ono conon along with yet another idea, and in the chdP with tiwe and goodwill, I have never neon any of those disputes that sonehow or other you could not manage to have an agrce-mont upon with good will.-  But there was no time; and what struck me very much w: c that there, wan no good will*   I am talking plainly to you here, and you will not mind my doing so;   it in no use our meeting unlose we nprak very freely to each other. (Hear,hoarI an not talking about   r,Thomas, let me nay no at once; but I felt that an far as -   section and what turned out to be a majority   of those wHb whom 1 wan dealing were .concerned., I saw no desire to settle.   And when I put forward thin request about 8 o&apos;clock on Thursday night, that they should put it off for two or three days-, I felt certain that they would probably do that.    I heard that by .a small majority, it in true -**   they decided not to poot^ pone the strike0   Then I knew I wan not dealing with men who were sincerely desirous of settling a Labour dispute in the old trade union sense, but that they were man who were fight-ing for something else, I worked hard ft It that night;, nnd very early on the following morning, and I met then with very substantial conceww ions.   I will tell you what the concessions were.   There were, two absolutely new concessions&apos;.   The first won that there should, he no reduction in the present wage until the cost of living had cone down to 110 per cent, It
is now 115 per cent,     That was a substantial concession.   And that afterwards the reduction nhould be in accordance with a scale to be disoussed either between the Railway Union and our-selves, or, what we preferred, between the whole of the Trade Unions and ourselves.   We did not want this standardised now; we would have infinitely preferred If it had been put off until we had discussed the whole question of tho war wage with the Trade Unions as a v/hole.   That would have been very much better; because what you say is true, that it is something which affects the v/hole Trade Union world, and It was a ques-tion that ought to be discussed with Trade Unions as a whole, because the same principle applies..    We were anxious to do that. It was the National Union of Railwaymen who pressed for a standardisation at the present moment, before you have a clear idea of the oost of living.   I do not think this Is the time to settle it at all in my judgment.    You do not know whether the cost of living is going very much lower or whether It will remain as it ia, or whether it is going up   I myself do not think it is going up; but you want to see what is the drift of things in the world in consequence of this tremendous cata-clysm that has occured during the last four years.      However, they insisted upon it now;   they would net wait, and they precipitated the thing without waiting for the discussions which were going on with every other Trade   Union,The second concession I made was of much more importance. There is a goodndeal of play made upon the word &quot;definitive,&quot; that a sort of final offer had been made, and we were not going to depart from it.   I am not going to argue what that meant. All I know is what the offer I made meant   that if any grade felt it was aggrieved, felt that there was an anomaly in the way it was treated, we were prepared to discuss the grievance of that particular grade.   For instance, guards got up and spoke.   One of them said, &quot;Take my case,   I am receiving so
much, and a fireman is receiving so much.&quot;   Very well, I expressed no opinion on it.     All I say is that wo were willing -to discuss that case,   The signalmen said the same thing,   1 said I could not in 24 hours discuss the wages of each grade signalmenj firemen, go through the list - all In 24 hoursj but what I did undertake was this, that nothing that we had said would preclude Us fromi discussing any an6maly or any harshness in tho treatment of any particular grade&apos;;   that the door was not closed to discussion&apos;.   But I will show you, in order that you may appreciate the position, what were the very last words I uttered upon that subject   I told them I regretted very much that thoy had rejented the terms.   Then I said: &quot;They decline, not merely the terms which I proposed-, but they decline further to negotiate&quot; -* I want to call your attention to this &quot;they decline further to negotiate for an amelioration of those terms in respect of individual groups&apos;, where a case would be made out that they were harshly Or anomalously treated0&quot;   Those were the very last words I said.   So you see when you ask for a resumption of the negotiations, this is a refusal to negotiate.MR; CLYNES:   How was that statement made? Is it in a communi-cation or in a verbal statement?THE PRIME MINISTER:   They have a copy of this document,MR. CLYNES:   It was made by whom?THE PRIME MINISTER:   It w s made by me;MR. CLYNES.   I Understand that is the Railwayman1s statement?THE PRIME minister   N6, it-is mine.   I say this:    &quot;WellMr-. Thomas and gentlemen, there is no Interpretation that needs to be placed on that decision;   It is a plain, clear statement that the leaders of the railway railwaymen reject the terms proposed by,1the Government., including the concesaiens whicf/announced this morning. They decline, not merely tho terms which I proposed, but they decline further to negotiate for an amelioration of21;
those terms in respect of individual groups, where a case oould be made out that they wure harshly or anomalously treated,&quot;&apos;MR. clynes:   If I may make a comment on that,,without venturing to discuss at, all the merits of the casej it shows to my mind the need now for resuming,negotiations;   because there Is clearly some misunderstanding from what we have heard,.THF PRIME MINISTER:   That is oxactly what I cannot under-. &apos;stand.   Repeatedly I said to Thomas that morning, &quot;Do youunderstand what I am proposing to you?&quot; Because the way inwhich it was received left the impression on my mind that theydid not understand it.   I said,. &quot;If you are going to have awhiohstrike/ have it on something/is a question of merits; for God&apos;s sake do not have a d sputo on a miaunderstanding.&quot; I said that three times to them   I further sfcid, &quot;Do you understand what I am proposing?&quot; I proposed what I told you before, and I proi-os,d this in the second case, that each individual group could have its grievance considered if they claimed that they were harshly treated,   The guard was a case in point.   He said, &quot;I am not getting enough in comparison witSa a fireman.&quot;   Very well;   if he was not,, wo were Tailing to negotiate about those individual groups;   and you must remember that the whole negotiation from the start is a group negotia-tioh.     We first of all dealt with the engine drivers, then with the fitters, and then with the oleaners;   then there was another set of groups;   and some of the groups we have not started to negotiate about;   this is only the second lot of groups upon which we have broken down.- MR. HENDERSON:   They make one strong point - I suppose we must hear your statement - that notwithstanding any offer you may have referred to there, the Government did dftcline to apply to these grades, that they think are unfairly treated, the same method of payment - -----
MR. &apos;&apos;&quot;ALK&apos;.:iR:   Principle.MR. HENDERSON:   I will not put &quot;principle&quot; - the same method of payment tnat the ^government had applied in connection &apos;,lth two or three 0redes of men in a previous settlement.A MEMBER:   locomotives. -MR. HENtSRSOIC   les;   the Prime Minister understands that.THE PRIME MINISTER:    I went into that very carefully.   It is perfectly true that the higher v-aid men get a considerablo increase;   hut you xnow they are up against a very difficult matter.     You must either level everyone&apos;s wages from top to bottom, or you must treat these matters, as you have treated them up to the present, by saying a very highly skilled man must  et a higher rate of pay.     The only alternative to that is what the Bolshevist3 attempted and failed   a complete levelling of all the wages in the Kingdom, giving the boot- . black in e hotel the same pay -.:s the manager.     You have heard a good deal about Bullitt;   he came baci to me from Russia and said that Lenin himself said that idea had failed, and that he had found he had to pay a higher rate to the skilled men;   and they are ooing it.   So that Bolshevism has dropped that attempt. It is no use saying, &quot;You are paying more to the engine driver than you- are paying to the platelayer.&quot;MR. B3VI1I:   i&apos;hsy do &quot;not as  that;   it Ta&amp;s within the grade.TUB PRIMS MINISTER:   That was paying more within the grade?MR. BEVIN: I nave read through the Shorthand Notes care-fully, -nd their trouble oeema to. be that if a point is raised -- we are not supposed to be discussing the merits -------THE PRIME MINISTER&apos;:   We must have an understanding.IkiR. BEVIII:   It seems to be a misunderstanding on your part. The point is, if ,ou have a 6uard it is the grade of guards; they want a standardisation within;the grade, and not that the porter shall have the same w-ges as the tuard,THE PRIME MDI&apos;;TSR:   You mr-n a platelayer who lives in
tho country should Oot exactly the same pay? i.iR. 3137IH r   iJoalIRr IOTU3RS02J: , The Prime Minister is putting an illus-tration which is perfectly right, that a p atolayer In the country is to get the somo rate of pay as a platelayer in London,.   That is what I think you wore putting?THS PRIMS MINISTER:   Yes,.   That is a natural principle. I have lived in the country all my lifo.   A man who is paying  5 to  10 for his rent - I have soen many  5 houses with gardens - is to got exactly the same pay es the man who is paying a rent here of say  26oMR, HENDERSON:   You havo done it with the police.THS PRIME MINISTER:  .You mean throughout the country?mr 0rGRADY:   A flat rate,THE PRIME MINISTER:   There is no rent as a rule, MR0 HENDERSON:   I am merely saying it has been done,, THUS PRIMS MINI sTSR:   We have not done it with the postmen, MR a HMDERSON:   No,THE PRIME MINISTER:    That is tho only public service which is concerned.MR. H2NDERS0N: , The point I want to clear up is that they are seeking tha trade unions to do what the employers are doing, ti&apos;is is, to mer/e the war wage into the standard rate0THE PRIM:; MINISTER:   Th,t is another claim,MR,-? HENDERSON:   They thim: if they give that away -that is the difficulty of negotiating sectionally;   you say it would have been much bettor if it had been deferred and wo had all come in together?THS PRIME MINISTER:   We are willing to negotiate with the whole of the Trade Unions.   I am with you to this owtent, that ,it is an issue which affects trade unionism as a whole.     But that is our contention, &apos;-nd not theirs.     I would infinitely rather that the whole question of the war wage and how to deal
mwith It should, bo dealt, with by trade unionism as a whole than thPt you should., have &apos; the National Union to meet here, and the. Doctors to meet here, and the Engineers to moot there,   You are bound to get anomalies&apos;and difficulties.     Each trade would begin to say, .&quot;look what&apos;you have given to the others;   we are ;rested unfairly;1&apos; , and so on.MR.. WILLIAMS:   I am.afraid you have more trouble in trying oo rectify, those anomalies than ^oing on as you aro..THE PRIME MINISTER:   I agree;   and if trade and unionism came to us and said, &quot;Settle this thing with us as a whole,&quot; I would say, &quot;Lone&quot; at once,- MR. GOSLING;   May I put a question?THE PRIME MINISTER-:   Settle the thing as a wholeMR. BROWNLIE:   You have not done it with the Railway people in Ireland,THE PRIME MINISTER:   If it were something we were going to cut down within the, next sis months, they would say, &quot;We must know,&quot;   But you,see, there was plenty oi time to discuss it with trade unionism &quot;as ..a whole.   Nothing could happ-an until, the 31 December, and if we had not settled...by then thay could .&amp;aslly&quot; have come and said, &quot;Vfill you. continue this for six..weeks--and ,.ive us more time to negotiate?&quot; end we could have-settled&quot;-this^MRs BEVIN:   On. that point.     Had they acoepted.,,your*&quot;offer **c tire effect of your latest offer as. I undorstand..JJae--.Not.ea,...^ would. everything else- not have been..automatics, tiurb the-yavould.^ nave accepted the . principle ..of reduction. .o.f war-waget .f.rom..--th^&quot; offer you made? .That .is -hoi;&apos;it appears-outside from -reading the Shorthand. Hotes.THE PRIME.MINIi^TER:   Very well, let, them--disoriss-that.jsrirth trade unionism,as a whole, and-we are willing to do so.   How-aver, let me conclude.     You say this affects trade unionism as a whole,    See what it means..   Our standardisation of the trade union wages represents the permanent wage.   This Is a uage
which has no reference to the cost of living. If the cost of living next year came down to normal, they would still get the standard wage. That is a thing which is not thoroughly understood, because I cannot believe that people wilfully misrepresent it. I saw a leaflet that was sent to me from Wigan, issued by the Strike Committee there, in which it said that the Railwaymen were getting 20s. before the war and were now getting 40s., which represented only the same thing, because the cost of living had gone up. That is absolutely true if we  proposed to reduce it to 40? before the cost of living came down. But we distinctly stared that as long as the cost of living remained above where it is now, and even if it comes down to 110 par cent., there will be no reduction of any sort or kind; and afterwards the only? reduction proposed was a reduction in proportion to the cost of livings.  They never explained that.

MR. BEVIN: That, is my point.

THE PRIME MINISTER: That shows that they did not understand it.

MR. BEVIN: That is where you are up against the whole movement.

THE PRIME MINISTER: You are not taking my point to begin with. My point is that this was a misrepresentation of the facts. Do you follow me?

MR. BEVIN: Yes.

THE PRIME MINISTER: You see, people have no right in order to keep a strike going to state something which is not true. It is not true to say they will got 40s., even if the cost of living is where it is;  we have given 53s. as long as the cost of living is where it is now, and not 40s.  Either they have struck without knowing what they have struck about, or they are misleading their men.

Then you come to what is offered. That is offered? The standardisation is an increase of 100 per cent. all round upon
the pre-war wage.     In the case of eome of the groups it is more than that;   hut even in the case of the groups about which the strike has arisen it is an increase of 100 per cent, in the permanent wage.MR. H3KISHS0K:   That is not clearly understood outside.THE PRIMS MINISTER:   How many trades are there in this country which would not gladly settle with us a permanent wage which represented double the pre-war wage without any reference to the cost of living?MR. HENI3RS0N:   But, Mr, Prime Minister^ I would like to make it perfectly clear, that if a man in the grade got 25s. a week before the war, and he ie to have 25s- added, making 50s. is any of that&apos; 5^8. subject to what is oalled the 11 and 13 that has to be affected when once the cost of living goes down?THE PRIME MINISTER;   No.   That is what I say;   it is hot understood.   That was the evil of striking in a hurry.   They struck without even understanding what the thing was.   . Theporter and the platelayer who got 20s. before the war, or as I16.c .am ashamed to say in my own district ^StSsfor a platelayer they now get 40s., even if the cost of living came down next year to normal.MR. BRCWNLIE:   That is on pre-war prices?THE PRIME MINISTER:   Yes, they get 40s.   If the ,eost cf living does not come down below 110 they will get 53s.MR. EROWNLIE:    I understand that applies to the low grade men      the men receiving l6s. or 18s. before the war;   their minimum will bo 40swhich will be said to be an increase of 110 per cent, over pre-war wages.,THE PRIME MINISTER: . Yes..MR, BRO-VNLIE:   Let us assume a man receiving 25s. a week bofore the war.   100 per cent, on that means JOb. Will that man&apos;a wages bo 5Qs. if prices fall?THE PRIME MINISTER:   Yes.
MR. BROWNLIE:   They will?THE PRIME MINISTER:&apos;  The standardisation haft nothing to do with the cost of living.MR. HENDERSON:   I must say that if our Deputation oame here for no other purpose than to get that clear, it 1b a substantial point.   I took the 2^s. man case, &quot;because I know the case has been thrown at me time after time that this man instead of keeping h*u 50s. would, owing to the operation ef the drop, come right down, to 40s. - the whole 13s. or 13s. would come off.THE PRIME MINISTER:   The standardisation we are proposing has nothing to do with the cost of living.   The war wage is a totally different thing.- -MR. ESVINj - Have you not a maximum oasis?   That is where the trouble is.   I have read these Notes carefully.   Supposing you had a man with 32e. in a particular grade,   100 per cent, on that will he 64s.? -,TKS PRIME- MINISTER:   Of course the 100 per oent. is an aver-age.   Sometimes a man gets 80 per cent... and another man gets 120 par cent.   I mat to make that ole&amp;r..  Everyman does hot get 100 per cent.;   hut 100 per&apos;eehty ia the average.MR. BEVIN:   That is the point.MR. MtJIR:   I want to ask you one question, Sir.THS PRIME MINISTER:   Just a minute.   I want you clearly to understand that one man will get 80 per oent.   and the other man will get 120 per cent., hut&apos;the average inorease throughout the whole of the grades ie 100 per cent. upon the pre-war wage.MR. MUIR:-I would lifce to ask you this.   Is it within your knowledge that one of the chief points that Mr. Thomas and his Exeoutive are contending with you upon in connection with the standardisation question is what he explained to us     namely, that in an area like Manchester, where there.are a number of Companies .coming in, there were various moneys paid for the same, giade?   ;
MR. CLYHEBs     Different rates of wages. THE PRIME MINISTER:   Yos.MR. MUIR:   One Company paid as much as 3s. different from another.THE PRIME MINISTER:   That was not a standardisation;    it was to try and equalise.MR. MUIR:   One moment;   will you please allow me.   Mr, Thomas told us---------THE PRIME MINISTER:   We are getting into details.MR, HSVTN:   Yes;   I do not think we ought to do so.MR. WILLIAMS.   It is a false step to discuss the other men&apos;s wages except for illustration.THE PRIME MINISTER&apos;:   I do net object to your ask:ing a question.MR. MUIR:    I think this is one point missed by the ethers, because I would not have intervened, as I think our duty is simply to come here to ask you as a Government whether you are prepared to open negotiations or not.     That was our message and nothing more,     But as the statement was made by Mr. Thomas at our Conference that their desire was fco standardise such wagee so that in any one area -- that is how I understood it --. or in any one grade.there would be a common rate, and that the standardisation would be taken on the highest payment in that one area.   We also had the Statement that you were not in favour of that, and a settlement   might have been effected  r--MR. WILLIAMS:    I do not think that is correct.   ^hat was said was that at a further conference held in this year when Mr. Gosling and Mr. Smillie and others besides myself attendedd, Mr. Bonar Law said the Government, would consider that favourablyMR. MUIR:.   He. first saw Mr. Lloyd George in Paris,., &apos; (Sir Robert Home, here entered the- room).THE PRIME MINISTER:   Who put the 30s. case?MR. KEVIN:    I put. the case of a man who got. 3^s.
THE PRI13 MINISTER:   Ho gets his 64s, whore there is an increase of IOO per cento Without reference to the cost of living.   If the cost of living were up to 110 he would got the &quot;balance of the 32so, whatever it is.MR. BR0WNLI3:   Tho l8s0 man gets 40s., the 2 a. man gets JOSi, the 30se man.gets (Oe.;   that 3s the war advance added on to the pre-war sat a;    that is your minimum?SXR R0ES&amp;T HCP-KB:   That is not quite accurate.THE PRIME SINISTER:   It is not accurate for this reason. 2 could not tell you whether the  ?s* man gets fifoe-. or the 3^3. man 60s(,   Tho 100 per jonto is an average right through.   Some groups may get an increase of 120 per cent.   That involves, if tho average is 100 per cent, that someone should get &quot;below the 100 per cent v   But wo said to you, j;Wo will discuss that if you can prove that the men who arc under 100 are unfairly treated;   we will discuss that with you0.JJffii GOSLING-:    I w$:it to straighten this out.   As far as we here are concerned      at any rate as far as my responsibility is concerned -** I am very much afraid if we are not careful we shall get it on tho Notes that certain things were said to v;hioh we assented, and that kind of thingoTHE PRX103 MINISTER:   Ho one is consenting to anything,MR. GOSLING:   No, but it is very dangerous..   And you know this, that wo have only come hers for the purpose of asking you. if you can to open negotiations.MR. 0&apos;GRADYi   That does not preclude the Government from stating their case .MR. GOSLING:   I am not going to be a party to this;   that is all.THE PRIMS MINISTER:   Mr, Gosling said you had heard Mr. Thomas&apos; statement, and it is clear that        Thomas put the whole case to you.   (To Sir Robert Home);   I thought that their sense of fairness would impel them to listen to my statement of what
the Government had done.    This has led to questions &quot;being put to me to elucidate things, and I think that was right.   But I will resume that I had to say on the subject.   1 want to make it olear that even now there is a good deal of misapprehension of what the Government proposed;   and I think that is rather a pity.   There is the case which I put to you, that we had slammed the door, declined to discuss the grievances of any particular group,   tyjiite the reverse.   I quoted to you the very last words I uttered there, that we were prepared to negotiate where there was any charge of harshness in dealing with any individual group.Then we come to the other question.   I want to make- It olear that the standardisation does not represent what we would pay if the cost 6f living is higher.   We have made that as olear as we can;   but it seems a hopeless tasktto try and get that thoroughly fixed in the public mind.Let me say one or two other things in reply to what has been said.   Mr. Henderson suggested that we were using a very potent machine which we had forged during the war with the help of the patriotism of the men against them.     In the first place the machine we are using now is not a machine with which the railwaymen had anything to do, if you mean motor lorries.MR. MUIR:   No, the military people. &quot;THE PRIME MINISTER:   We are not using the military except to protect order.MR. MUIR:   The Military Forces of the Grown.THE PRIME MINISTER:   We are only using the   military to protect order.&quot;. We owe a debt to the community as a whole.   If the community   ag a whole were in favour of the railwaymen and desired us not to offer protection and not to organise the dis-tribution of food, then of oourse no Government oould poesibly do it;   believe me.  -Publio opinion is just as potent to-day in a strike as ever it was;   and if public opinion thought that
we were harshly treating the men wo oould not uee any machine.And I tm not ooascious that we are using any machine except a machine to koep the country going,mr, WILLIAMS&apos;   You are uning the machine of public opinion.THE PRIMES MINISTER: - That is fair.    You will use that machine against me.MR. WILLIAMS:   Ours is not as good as yours, unfortunately.MR. IciTXR:   You shut it down.THE 3PRX3SB MINISTER:   You must use that.   But wa are only using the machine to keep the country going;   because not even the National Union of Railwaymen oan live unless we go on distributing food.    We have not discriminated against them. The 5*00,000 men and their families would starve if we had not , used the motor lorries we had in the war;   and everyone of them is getting hie daily bread ci-ury morning.    They say &quot;Give us this day our daily bread&quot; to our friend here, because he is the man who is organising the machine.MR. WILLIAMS;   *And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive the Government their trespasses against us,&quot;THE PRIM3 MINISTER:-  We shall see about that.   New t come to the question you have put to me;   Will you resume negotia-tions?   I never broke them off.   Never.   I have given you the last words I uttered.   But it is no U3e negotiating while the men are out.   Ycu say, &quot;This is an ordinary strike.&quot;   It is not. In an ordinary strike fair notice is given to the employer. Is the Etata less entitled to fair play at the hands of its citizens than &amp; mswe capitalist who is making money out of his industry?   We are running this thing for the country.   We are running it at a great loss.   Mr. Thomas&apos; said we were exaggara-ting the loss;   but that is not the point.   You must admit there is a los3 which has to be passe-4 on in the form of passenger fares, in the form of increased charges on goods.   The 3tate32.
io treated t^us by a body of ni.n who voted for nationalisation at the Trades Union Congress throe woolen ago.   ( Throe wenkn later you give tho public an illustration of what in meant bynationalisation, that the State in going to be treated more-scurvily and shabbily than you would think of treating a private employer.     They havo hit nationalisation tho deadliest blow any body of men could have hit it.   Pardon my outburst; but thoy never gave us the notice which a servant would expect from her employer, or which an employer would be entitled to expect from her.     They just came and said, &quot;In 48 hours unless you give us all our demands we are off.&quot;    You know if they had started fair and given us decent notice that would have been another matter.   But to go on r suming negotiations -dth ncople who throw out of gear tho industry upon which thr vary life of the community dependswithout ov n asking ^hrther ,,-a had a motor lorry to carry loaves to tho children      I think tho first thing they have to do is to resume their work.     Then we will negotiate with them.     I never refused to negotiate;   I was anxious to go on negotiating all&apos;these grievances of which they complain,.and I am willing tc discuss them.   But it is quite impossible to do that whilst tho whole energies of those ^rho have been negotiating are concentrated on how they are to get food here, how they arc to preserve-order there, and especially if tha Transport Workers again ara going to do the same thing the whole of our time must be given to this.    Every other activity must be suspended to see that 44,000,000 people do not starve.     Ho^ can negotiations be carried on whilst that is going on?    It is qirHe impossible. -   Let the men treat the State fairly.    This is not a row with an employer;&apos;   it is a row with the nation of which they are citizens.   Let them treat the nation with the respect that is due to their own country, to their own native land.     Unless they do that we-shall have no
time to negotiate;   every minute of our time is taken up.   Take the Strike Committee;   how much time will they have to nego-tiate, with all the complicated difficulties they have in every part of the country?MR. bevin:   I do not think there is any intention to ask that negotiations of a character which involves all the detail you are now describing should take place.THE PRIMS MINISTER:   You see, I had Thursday and Friday, and it is all very well to say that you can avoid detail;   hut you see how you have to go into it without the slightest intention of doing it;   you just siip into it.     It is quite impossible;   and they really must take the responsibility of running the essential services of the nation whilst negotia-tions are going on;   otaenrise it will be quite impossible to resume discussion.     I very much regret it, but they have thrown down this challenge.   It is idle to say it is a chall-enge to Trade Unionism.   I have never seen trade unionism treat an employer in this way let alone the State;   and I s-could be very sorry to think that trade u&amp;ionioii would sanstioa. would take upon itself the placing of the stamp of its approbation upon this method of negotiation with the State.You represent a Party that  aanis to nationalise industries. Is this the way the inddotriOo wou*d be treated if they were nationalised?   I should have thought that it would be more imperative for you - representing the Party of Nationalisation and of State control      that it was more imperative on   your part co see that the State get fair play thai&apos;:, oven an individual.   All I asis: is that whilst the negotiations are pending thev ehoaid, with rut prejudice to their case., without p.:-c-j i-i . go of ,-.oa:^ t;* any rights they may have to resume the 3:,        \.i th..? isjiwt J at tone fail. -- chat they should undertoko co see that one essential services of the nation are carried on.
MR. CLYNES:   But seriously.......-MR. GOSLING:   May I intorru.pt you in order to say one word. What if you do not re-open negotiations?MR. MUIR:   Before you say what you are going to say, might I ask you to explain to the Prime Minister, as one of the Deputation, that the Railway organisation have not asked us for help, and that thoy have not asked us to negotiate for-them?MR.&apos; GOSLING:   I was just going to do it.MR. MUIR:   They   re prepared to fight.THE PRIMS, MINISTER:   I assume that;   otherwise they would not have struck.MR. MUIR:   Before we gave them the help wo undoubtedly should have to give them, we same here;   we did that before that help was given,,MR. GOSLING:   What I want to put to you is this, Mr. Prime Minister.   V/q are people who are now coming into this dispute; it is impossible for us to keep out. of it, and this is our first stop.   I know the difficulty, of course.     We have hoard very much the same kind of statements made by employers as you have made   not quite in the same way, but you are in the position of the employers   about what you consider is tho tad treatment of the other side.     But we are going to bo afficted.   We are in. V/e have 100,000 transport workers already affected.   If you do not open up negotiations we should be very much more affected in the next day or two, and wo must tsiie some action. &apos;.&apos;o did not like to take any action at all before we first of all found out whether it was possible for negotiations to take place.THE PRIME MINISTER:   I offer to resume negotiations the moment 1 gol an intimation that they will carry on tho services oT the State, of the community   carrying food and fuel and so on for the people.MR* MUIR:   I would like to suggest to you that we have no
authority to enter into such a discussion in the interests of the Railwaymen. They have given us no authority to interfere on their questions at all. They stated their case, and we felt that before we took any action we  should call and ask you to resume negotiations with them.

MR. O&apos;GRADY: We are not discussing tho Railwaymen at all now.

MR, MUIR: But we will if we go into that matter.

MR. O&apos;GRADY: Not at all.

MR. BROWNLIE : What you have said about the men resuming work is what many of us anticipated. We know that hat is the attitude generally adopted by the Employers&apos; Federation with regard to industrial matters; but the representatives on this side of the table cannot commit the Railwaymen in any way whatever.

THE PRIME MINISTER: I never expected that.

MR. BROWNLIE:  ? want to appeal to you. Is it possible for you -- I hope it is not impossible -- to re-open negotiations immediately between the two parties with a view of settling preliminaries which would load to an immediate resumption of work on the part of the Railwaymen?

THE PRIME MINISTER: I do not know what "settling preliminaries" means. If you mean settling the preliminaries of negotiations, we can settle those now. I can any time betweenn? now and to-morrow morning.

MR. WILLIAMS: Is it possible for us round this table to find a formula which might be satisfactory to both sides? I heard Mr. Thomas at the Albert Hall. I heard him last night, and I heard him again to-day at Caxton Hall. It seems to me what he says is, as Mr. Henderson put it, if a method could be devised for settling all other grades comparable with the settlement of the footplate grades, that would be a suitable basis for a settlement.
THE PRIME MINISTER:    I have watched that formula vory closoly;   I havo discussed it.     There is one thing you must avoid;,   you must avoid anything that wouldm moan a charge of broach of faith.   Therefore ho wight put one interpretation ou that formula and wo might put another interpretation upon it, and the result would be charges of breach of faith on bottom sides.   That would bo worse than anything.   This is not a thing to ba settled by formula, but whether you are going to givo 60s. or 50s, to these men.    That is really what it comes to,     You   cannot have a formula that settles it.     You have to consider each grade on its merits.   That was done by Mr. Bromley, with the others, and Mr. Thomas was there.   There was a separate principle with the cleaners;    there is a separate principle with tho platelayers, and there is a separate element that comas in when you come to tho guards   the question of their responsibility   and it is- really not a question where you can lay down a formula.   You must discuss the raspective merits of each case, and it all works out in figures at the end.     Therefore I think if you attempt anything in the nature of a formula they will coma back and say, &quot;What is the meaning of these words?   You havo sold us,&quot;   Tho and of that would be vory much vorse than the beginning.   You arc not dealing with an employer..   It is true that the employers may say that sort of thing, but you are not dealing with an employer,, you are dealing, with tho State,,.IYou may be sitting hero   no one known;   you may form part of the State, and you may have respensibillbiez0 and I want you to talk like men who may have tho responsibilities.. Just put yourselves in the position in which I am, with, a stride not against an employer but against tho State,    If you are giving the decision cue way and go to Parliament aad say,-&quot;We are going to increase the tax by so much,&quot; you could not
tolerate things of this sort if you were? acting for the State. You really could not.   Anc. I want you to put yourselves into ray position.   You may he here sooner or later - it is not for me to express an opinion; you have an electorate now which   is practically universal suffrage; I want you to accept the suggestion of putting yourselves into the position of having that responsibilityiMil, MUIR:   Mr. Thomas said    THE PRIME MINISTER:   whom do you represent ?MR. MUIR: The Electrical Union; we are involved in this.THE PRIME MINISTER:   What is your name ?MR., MUIR:   Muir.-THE PRIJjT?. MINISTER:   I have met most of the gentlemen here except you.MR. MUIR:   Mr,- Thomas, in explaining the psychology of the forces behind him, explained fully to us that he fought the weapon of the strike as long as he could.   He showed and gave us ample proofs that he was not inclined in favour of a strike.THE PRINT1 MINISTER!   No; he ha3 been over-ruled.MR. MUIR:   Mr. Thomas, in explaining what was behind him,&apos; said that before he went to Glasgow you had settled with Mr. Bromley, and following that, whilst he was at Glasgow, there was such an overwhelming demand for action on the part of the other grades that the executive took action,- and they fixed up a meeting.   And I think after all that what you have to remember here, and what we have all to remember, is the human side of this question.   Those other grades arc in the   jjij^rfty cm the railway lines, and they wanted the same principle applied.MR. HENDERSON:   Mr. Muir raised an objection to a discussion of the merits of the case, but he is now discussing the merits of the case, -MR. MUIR:   You are all discussing them.   You have either to discuss them and put a plain question to the prime
Minister and ask him is he prepared to open negotiations, or to find a modus operandi fer getting over the difficulty.MR.- GOSLING:   17 e are shoving our weakness to the other side, and that is why I have held my tongue.,MR. NAYLOR:   I should like to know whether you are of the opinion that you are putting to us a proposition that cannot possibly be accepted by the men whom we represent.   You suggest that negotiations might be re--opened provided the men first return to work,   we have our difficulties in promoting peace, and I think you will understand from your knowledge of the history of the industrial movement that any proposition of that krnd would be rejected by the men. .m. MUIR:   Hear, hear. .MR. CLYN&quot;3:   Not merely rejected by the men, but I am certain it will have the effect of widely extending this.THF PRIME MINISTER:   I very much regret to hear that..MR. CLYFrS:   There is one point of very great Importance, I think, which I fear you have overlooked..  You mentioned the fact that you came into these negotiations on the eve of a breakdown.   I think that is true; and you naturally are con-cerned at not having hern given the notice that you sought and expected in regard to- this matter.   But is it not a fact that after all your colleagues in tire Government, acting for the Government, have been for months -.- I think they have had half a year   dealing with the executive of the Railwaymans Unions ?TH? PRD&apos;&quot;7 MINnT^R:   It is not a case of my not having had notice, but notice was not given to the Railway Companies.MR. CLYNES:   I am putting the point that your colleagues acted for the Government definitely on this question.   For about six.months they have been dealing with these two questions of standardisation and the other main question; and a point \was
reached where your colleague gave what was interpreted as the final decision of the Government for the men to accept or.reject allowing no: further margin for negotiation.     Interpreted in that way the executive of the Railwayme^s Unions reached a decision as to what they should do.   , It was upon this -that-the negotiations &quot;broke down, and I think it is hardly fair to say that no time was properly given to the Government to consider this matter.THisi PRIMB..I/iIllIiTjiR:   I am surprised at that coming from you;., I should have expected something else from you;   to say .-; that a noticy %iven on Tuesday, that there would, be a strike on Friday &apos;-------MR. GLYl^iDS:   I am not saying anything to justify what the men did.;.   X am pointing out, what they did.  . It is another thing whether J approve of it or not.TEii FRZlkUS miitary$T.etf::   ,,hen.I made it clear to them on Friday mtrnieg that negotiation was quite ohen on the grievance of each grade, for them to have struck,------Liu BhVIii:   Hpve you made sufficient allovance for. the point Mr. clynes has put with regard to the psychology 0.1 the position?   The trouble in our minds appeared to be this.   ,As leaders we are often in the position of the Kailwaynen at this moment     have you made sufficient allowance for the point that the decision to strike took place not merely upon the offer, . but the general treatment?JuIU uIIXIAMS: . The ultimatum. -J$B* BiiiVIH:   Xee, the ultimatum the&apos;t came from one of your, colleagues who they understood was speaking with the authority of the Cabinet and with the authority of the Government;   and the statements that are meae   which in fact appear in these llotes, from which you are quoting, and which I read through carefully on Monday   the statements from the Minister of Transport and the President of the Board of Trade indicate that
so far as they were concerned, speakicg for the Government, they had in fact said to tho Railwaymen, &quot;That is the offer of the Government;   take it or leave it.&quot;    Tlr:-t seems to be where&apos; the fatal decision was taken.     That is the psychology of the position prior to your coming in.     I am not quibbling about the professorial ten: &quot;definitive&quot;,THE PRIME MINISTER:   &quot;Take it or leave it&quot;, it was never-used.MR. BOTH:   I do not say it was used.THE PRIME MINISTER:   Immediately after that - I have looked at that letter carefully   it goes on to say that details and anomalies ,can be discussed.MR. BEVIB:   Yes.     But again we do not want to get into the merits of the dispute.     I look it it as an Executive would look at it.     rfe are not the Executive of an ordinary trade union.     I read thpt letter as a leader.     I should come to the conclusion, if an employer sent me that letter, that it meant, &quot;That is how far I am prepared to go,&quot; and I should have to face the situa-tion, whether I was to accept it or whether 1 was to call a strike.     And when you emphasised the point that you are only given 24 hours notice, ho;, such a proposal would present itself to me   I have tried to place myself in Mr. Thomas&apos; position &apos;and tried from the other point of view to place myself in the position of an employer      I have said to myself, &quot;It does not matter whether I have three months to run or six months to run; with the proposal that is submitted I am hung if I accept it.&quot; I have read the original offer submitted from the President of the Board of Trade,     Read that how you will, I say as one who is dealing with a grievance day after day, how I would read it would be this, that those were the final terms, and if I had accepted those terms not a single one would have been kept, not a single agreement could have been based uyon them, and I
should have but my head into the woao and that everything was automatic alter it.     Sir Robert Home shakes his h.ad, but some of us have had a lot of experience.     ;&apos;e are here to-day something like sir George Askwith&quot; useu to be, going from one fco the other. I ho e digiit   will not sta-id ia tie way of industrial peace. If we can bring down to some extent the difficulty on one side, we would go into the other rocm and try to bring down some of the difficulty on the other side.     That is our position   a messenger between the two parties, which you uould be if it were a dispute between the workers and employers.MR. HiUIDjSRSOiI:   I hope you will not forget the precedent I quoted to you of the intervention on the part of the Governments, which you will remember not only in the South .ales miners1 strikes during the war.., :hich you miaht plead was necessary owing to the terrible crisis, but the case I cited to you in the time of peace, where the miners were brought to London to meet the mineowners, and where the then Prime Minister succeeded in bringle/; i v$a together and effecting a settlement.MR. V.;ILLIAI&apos;i:h   you have asked us to put ourselves in yourplace,,     Let us ask you to put yourself In our place.     You havehad a lot of experience as a negotiator.     Your own wit hasdevised words, formulae., which have formed the medium of settle-ment, and we would like you to do that for us.     Our position isvery difficult in the extreme.     It is not often I adoat thedorole of pacificator, but I have hod to/that in this dispute.THx3 PRIM^ MINISTER:   No man need ever oe ashamed of that.LiR. .ILLI/US:   Some of us have been ashamed of it sometimes, but our difficulty is very great.     I attended a meeting of the executive of the lBus, Tram and Omnibus Union on Saturday night. Those men really want to come out, and they are not allowed. Many of the vehicle workers on the commercial side - horse-drawn ana mechanical      are tired of the taunts they are
receiving in tho &quot;industrial centres-...    They rant to con&apos;&apos; cut,. I ?m getting wires from Newcastle,. Crirasby, Liverpool.,.. Pros ton, . and Glasgow, from all over South &quot;files, and from other plaoes^ that tho men want,to stand down in sympathy with the Railwaymen... Tho task is getting intolerable,    h&apos;o think this thing is easily susoeptible to a settlement.     - e seo that there is nothing very mtioh for the N.tJ-.li. to gain oat of it.TIC Fine IStUZiTZl.   The standardisation is open to rovis-ion in December;   until December tho wages cannot bo altered^M3. MUIR:   I thinic we ore rather wasting our time unless the very serious statement yon have made osri be withdrawn,    \.q have only got ono direot answer, end it is oontained in the words I have written down here.    T.?e o mo here with a dofinito purpose -namely, to asK you if it wero possible to ro-opon negotiations; yon say Yes, on one condition;   ::nd the condition is that thoy resume work.    If that ic your answer, wo are answered.MR. V-ILllASflSi   Vie had better discuss tho answer in a colicc-tive capacity.Ma, GOSLING:     e h^vc not written down yet -bat the answer iu.    I wan. again to see if J cannot press you, if you cannot commit yourself all they way, whether you would see tho other side in the hope that the$ might load to negotiations being,re-op o-v a.    I will tell you -hat is worrying me , and it has been ; oin.   through my mind all the ; hile I. have been sitting hero,, There muat come - day when you will have to meet the Railwayman, and possibly all of us as well.     Howaver this thing goes, we are bound to be in it in a day or two.     Do ^ivtovor we li.,;o5 we shall bo in it some vrry or  nothoro     Either wo shall to ice tho man into it or tho m.n will pull us into it.     If wo   ro in it, some day or other we shall have to moat.     I cannot think of its being a less difficult task in another week&apos;s time or in another fortnight1 s time than it is no-.     This thing cannot be d-cidod without a meeting, and if &quot;there is going to be a
meeting the quicker it is held the less complicated It will be. I am perfectly sure that the next 24 hours will make a tremen-dons difference in the complication of this fight.   I know your difficulty; we have all been throiigh it together; sometimes you have bullied us and sometimes we have bullied you. I know the difficulties.   I sometimes sit as an arbitrator, and I know what It all means.   You will not improve it by letting it go; it ought to be done as quickly as possible.   Do not let us bite off more than we can chew.   If we go and see the Railway-men and say to them &quot;how you come along and see the Prime Minister&quot;   if we tell them to come and see you, will they see you If they come?   That is fair and- square, man to man.   Let us get rid of all the other business.   You have told us, just like an employer, how badly the men have treated you.   That may be all true   What I have been afraid of is that we should get anything on the Notes which rather shows that our feeling one way or the other was with the men-.     e are here in a different capacity; we want to be strictly impartial.THS -PP.11 IE MINISTER;   He will go out for a while, if you do not mind; and have a ta3.k about this.(The Prime Minister and his colleagues withdrew at*50 pm. and returned at 6.5).on resuming,THE PRIME MINISTER:   A queation was put to me by Mr Gos-ling whether if the Executive of the National Union of Rc.il-waymen asked me to see them, I would       see them-.   That I think wan the question?MR GOSLING;   Yos.THE PRIME MINISTER:   My answer would be that if the Executive of the National Union ask to see me I shall be ready to see them and to hear what they have to say; but I am sure no thing is to be gained by any ambiguity,   There has been
too much misunderstanding already* and I must state veryclearly that it would be impossible to continue the negotiations.....until work is resumed^   Apart from other considerations, Ministers could not possibly attempt to deal with negotiations while their whole energies are devoted to improvising means of carrying on the life of the nation.   That is the answer I give to the question..If it be of any use to you, I could put down in writing and let you have what i said to you before as to the offer of the Government; because i consider it to be important, that they should clearly understand what it was that was offered. Because I do not honestly believe that the Executive gave them-selves time to consider what it was I was offering.   If they had waited, until the Shorthand Notes had come into their hands   which I hoped they would      and then looked at them, they would have know exactly what the offer was; and I feel quite confident, not that they would have accepted it --- that is not YJhat I wanted   but that they would have continued negotia-tions upon it, which is a different thing.   Therefore if you think it desirable, I can got rut into writing for you exactly what I have said now as to the character of the proposal of the Government, notably what I said about the Government being prepared to negotiate with regard to any claim that our propos-als bore harshly or inflict anomalies upon any particular group, which left negotiations open with regard to any particu-lar group that claimed it was dealt with harshly.   That is ray answer to the questions you have put to me..MR GOSLING j   You say there that if the National Union wish to see you you will seo them?THE PRIME MINISTER:   Certainly I will see them, and hear whatever they have to say.MR GOSLING:   Would you mind if it were put in this way;
would you say, If wo wish you to 3ee tho National Union you would soe them?THS PHIiVilJ MINISTER.   YesMR GOSLING:   I think that would help us a little.   Then there is the other point.TIE PRIME MINISTER:   If you ask us to see the National Union      I can put it that way, if you like.M3 GOSLING:   At the moment we are making the running, and we could go to the Railway Union  - -TH..] PRi::E MINISTER:   If you cone to me tomorrow and. say, &quot;will you see tho National Union?&quot; I would say &quot;Yes.&quot;MR GOSLING:   Would you do that at the earliest possible moment?THE PRIME MINISTER:   Yes, tonight, if you like.MR GOSLING:   V/ill you read it again, what you 3aid about the possibility of negotiations?THE PRIME LTiirSTER:   &quot;That I say about negotiations is this extent it Is a practicable question^MR GOSLING:   You do believe that there has been misunder-standing?T33 PRIME MINISTER:.  I have not the faintest doubt that there has been*MR GLYNES:.   I am sure there has been. THE PRIME MINISTER:   They did not give themselves time to consider tne two very important concessions 1 made;,   I am not sure that they understood the original proposals, but I am absolutely certain they did not understand the concessions I made, and they did not give themselves time to consider them. They did not take more than three-quarters of an hour,   &quot;/hen  -proposals of that kind are made you really ought to give them a little more consideration.   They might have said, &quot;Let us see them in writing.&quot; and then we would have reduced them into writing for them; and If they had taken even two hours -
someone behind said, &quot;We don&apos;t want any time; we have already made up our minds:&quot; and then Mr Cramp said, &quot;Yes, we have made up cur minds.&quot;   They mever considered the two important propo-aais which were put before them.   I do not mind telling you I was very surprised, and I am absolutely certain that Mr Thomas was surprised.MR GOSLING:   You used a form of words about negotia-tions; &quot;I am sure nothing is to be gained by any ambiguity, because there has been too much misunderstanding up to the present, and it would be impossible- for many reasons to continue negotiations until work is resumed.&quot;THE PRIM MINISTER:   It means if they come here tomorrow do net let us have any mistake about this   and say, &quot;Let us sit down and begin to negotiate,&quot; I could not do it,   I should have to have Sir Eric Geddes, who is running the whole of this show, taken suway from that, and Sir Robert Home, and all the other Ministers concerned.   You cannot settle it in a day, believe me; it is not as easy as all that; it is going to take days to arrive at any basis which will be a satisfactory one.    It is no use patching up a thing which will break down at once.MR GOSLING:   I only want to try and find what appears to be the best way of putting it, and I was wondering whether you could say instead Of it being impossible without resumption of work, that it would be possible if it wsre more definite--if a resumption of work took place it would be possible for negotiations to commence at once,THE PRIMS MINISTER:   It is the same thing; what is the difference?MR GOSLING: Whilst it might be impossible without renump-tion it does not follow that it is impos -ible with resumption.THE PRIME MINISTER:   It is the same ..thing.    It would be impossible to continue negotiations if work were not resumed.47.
---- Asa..practical proposition it is impracticable not to have a resumption while.negotiations are going on.   The whole business of supplying the nation would be neglected.MR HENDERSON:   But you do begin negotiations tomorrow if we can get them to come here and meet you?THE PRIMS MINISTER:   No.MR HENDERSON:   Surely you do; once you get together in the same room you have opened up negotiations?THE PRIME MINISTER:   No.  .Do not let us have any mistake about it.MR 0&apos;GRADY:    If we ask you to see the National Union of Railwaymen1s Executive you will see them, and let it dropthere?   -THE PRIME MINISTER:   No; I do not want to do that.   There must not be another misunderstanding.   They will begin tomorrow to discuss llO or 105, Whether you ave going to put it up to this and that.MR HENDERSON; My suggestion is that .if you come into this room tomorrow you will probably lay down to them the conditions upon which negotiations can be resumed?THE PRIh.E MINISTER:   I can do that tonight; I could give you those now.MR HENDERSON:   My point is this.    I cannot see any useful purpose to serve by asking them to come down here to go away again,   I am trying to assist you.THE PRIME /MINISTER:   I agree; and therefore I do not want them to come here and say, &quot;You have brought us here under false pretences.&quot;   That would exasperate things and create bitterness instead of allaying bitterness.   I want to say at once that it they begin to discuss the grades and standavdisa-tion and ask whether you will apply this ot that principle., all that opens up the whole thing.m HEliDERSON:   That is my point.
THE PRIME MINISTER.&apos;   I cannot have the men here who would be able to guide me on that&apos; sort of thing.,, and. I could not discus&quot; it without those men.:MR HENDERSON;   I suggest if they come tomorrow they will probably raise this question as a practical question      if we resume work, when will these negotiations begin seriously;; how long are We going to sit,&apos; hew long will it take Before we get anything like a settlement?   We have dome these things before with the ordinary employers; they have got us to agree, and have then hung us up for weeks and weeks,THE proposal-2! MINISTER:   ,We can go on at once.SIR ROBERT HORKE:   There will be no difficulty about resuming negotiations if they will go back to work.THE PRIME MINISTER:   Or if they say that they will go back to work,MR KEVIN&quot;:   Do we understand that assuming we use our influence to persuade something on these lines, that the whole thing is open, or do you regard your statement as,a Sprt of final statement, and only &quot;the negotiations on the anomalies &apos;-- you see what I mean      there seem to be two points, and I am only asking you to elucidate what is in your mind.   You have broken what they&apos;regard as a definite principle.THE PRI&apos;JE MINISTER-: I really do, not-know what they mean about that, Tfifriat they say is, &quot;You have treated the fitters and the engine men more favourably than you have treated the guards.&quot;   Very well, let&apos;the guards make out their case.MR GOSLING:   May I get this in a simple form, if possible.THE piu.-^ MINISTER:   This is what he said at the end -it was not Bromleyrs doing at all., it was. Thomas&apos;s doing.   He said, &quot;You gave this to Bromley, now you. are denying it to me-.&apos;&quot; Not at all.   It was Thomas&apos; who did.that; it was not Bromley, This is what he said at the end;&apos; &quot;I should like to say this. If you&quot;think that a special case can be made for the loco-
motive men, we are delighted, and I hope you will keep that in mind when considering both the Companyfs side and ourSj and we are content to deal with others on their Own merits.&quot;   There is no principle.   It is a question of dealing with each case or.!, its merits;&apos; we dealt with the locomotive men!s case on its merits, mid whether we were right or wrong we gave them what he said was generous treatment.   Very well; let the others make their special case.iv:R GOSLING:   I want, to get this as simply as I can.   First of all you have not slammed the door in our face?THK PRIME KIPISTER:   No; I am anxious not to do so.MR GOSLING.   -ve want to get the railwaymen to you as quickly as possible.   If we ask you to meet the railwaymen, you say yes?THE PRIME MINISTER: Yes; and I will hear whatever they have to say.m GOSLING:   I we. ;t %o get that clear before we begin to consider any other way of helping the railwaymen, because we regard this as helping them in getting them, to come and see you.   That can be done pretty quickly; and then they can tell us how they have fared when they have met you.   It is for them to make up their plans with you as to how you go on in the future.   I hope when they come to see you the negotiations will not break down again, but that you will go straight on and then we are free from the.whole, thing and we have done our duty to them and put the thing right.   So that you would see them to-night if possible?that  PR I HE MINISTER:   I will ses them the moment you-bring them here.   .MR GOSLING: I think if we had that shortly in writing-, that we having asked you to meet then you have consented., it would help us..;MR BROaNLIE:,. right I suggest, that the language should
be as clear ahd simple and as little offensive as possible? ,Jle wish to grease the ways, as it were.MR GOSLING: I have been talking to my friends. What we feel is that we had better take your short answer as you have given it to us, and see If we can get them here as quickly as possible.THE PRIME MINISTER: I can put in &quot;impracticable&quot; if you consider that is better than &quot;impossible.&quot;MR HENDERSON:   Personally I would not put anything down at all.   Say that we have been to see you, and that you are willing for them to come and tell their own story, and you will tell them exactly you position.THE PRIME MINISTER:   I wonder if that is fair to them or . to us without your telling them?   I am afraid it is not.   I do not think it would be really quite the thing.MR 0&apos;GRADY:   I think when      get Into contact with one another things will pan out all right.THE PRIME MINISTER:   Then you have to get the public right.   a&apos;e had better be open ;rith each other j   e have to think of our public-- the people who are coming forward to volunteer; and if it goes out tonight that ^e have re-opened negotiations, that does not help us If nothing comes of it. Therefore I am bound to tell you quite frankly that is one reason which is weighing with us.   ,:&apos;e must make it clear that re-opening the negotiations Is only possible under conditions which will enable us to release our Ministers from the bother and organising essential services for the country.   I really must do that.MR 0&apos;ORADY:   Put those words In.TH1 PRIME MINISTER: Otherwise I should be destroying the machinery by which the Ministers are organising for keeping up essential services for the country. Therefore I must not have any misunderstanding either with the railwaymen or with the
public.MR GOSLING.   It would be very regrettable if there were any misunderstanding among ourselves, therefore may we have a few minutes alone together?THE PRIME MINISTERj -Yes,  -(The Prime minister and his colleagues left the &apos; room at 6.20. and returned at 6.35).IviR GOSLIMG:   v&apos;e are going to see our Conference and then the Railwaymen in the hope that vse may eventually be able to bring them along to you.   Do you see any objection, if vie can get the Railwaymen here, that in any negotiations we should at least have a watching brief In them?THE PRIkE MINISTER:   Do you mean that you should be here?MR GOSLING:   Yes.THE PRIME MINISTER:   I should certainly make no objection to that.   That is entirely a matter for them.KR HENDERSON:   To hold a watching brief, because we may have to report to the fuller movement.THE PRIME MINISTHR:   I should certainly make no objection. In fact I should have thought there &apos;*as a great advantage in it.   I wish you had been here on Friday and you might have said,&quot;At any rate take your tine to consider.&quot;MR HEllDERSON:   If */e can manage it you would be willing to see them -tonight?THE PRIME MIHlSTkRl   tes, I shall be here.MR HENDERSON:   *re are going first to Caxt m Hall and then on to Unity House.The De-putation then withdrew.
