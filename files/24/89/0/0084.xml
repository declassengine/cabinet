FranceWINSTON S. CHURCHILL. 4317&amp;th October, 1919.General Headquarters,The Forces in Great Britain, Horse Guards,London, S,W. 1. teh September, 1919.Sir,Field-Marshal French having published in Iris book &quot;1914&quot; a most incorrect report of two War Councils held at 10r Downing Street on the 5th and 6th August, 1914, I request that the attached memorandum, being a statement of the opinions I then expressed, may be placed on record.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant,D.-HAIG, Field-Marshal, Commanding-in-Chief, The Forces in Great Britain.The Secretary, . The War Office.Memorandum of Opinions expressed by me at the War Council Meetings held at 10, Downing Street on the 5th and 6th August, 1914.On the occasion in question I spoke from notes which, by request, I gave after the meeting to Captain M. P. A. Hankey, C.B., the Secretary.   I made three points : 1. That the war must be a long war (several years), notwithstanding the frequently expressed opinion by German military writers that a great war in Europe could not last 6 months.I based my opinion on the fact that Great Britain and Germany were then about to fight for their existence.2. That Great Britain must set to work at once and create an army. I mentioned the strength as one million because the Territorial Army was originally based on that number.That it would be particularly important to be strong when the moment for discussing peace arrived.3. That we only had a comparatively small number of trained officers and non-commissioned officers. That these must be spared as much as possible because of the need of good instructors, which would at once become apparent.Therefore I urged that a proportion of officers and non-commissioned officers be withdrawn from the Expeditionary Force at once. This met with Field-Marshal Frenches disapproval.I also asked certain questions on which information was required before a decision could be given as to the best area in which our Expeditionary Force should be concen-trated in France.1 certainly never &quot; suggested,&quot; as Field-Marshal Lord French states on page 6 of his book. &quot; postponing any landing until the campaign had actively opened . . . .&quot; On the contrary, I definitely stated that :&apos;our best policy&quot; at that time &quot; was to be ready to do as the French wished us.&quot;D. HAIG,Field-Marshal.
