&apos;. BOARD Off AGRICULTURE AND PlgHBRIES.   &apos; j faReport for week,ended 23rd September, 1919. PART I   -   POOD PRODUCTION DJSPARTMENT.The Weather and Condition of Crops.The weather has been ver^ changeable,    The first half of the week wa3 mostly fine and warm, but on Thursday the wind veered round to the North and there was a sudden fall of temperature accompanied by heavy rain in some districts.   There was a sharp frost on Friday night, and squalls of snow were experienced in Yorkshire on Saturday.Very little damage to crops has so far been reported, as the bulk of the corn had already been gathered.     In Derby and Warwickshire, however, a good deal of corn is still standing and second out clover has been spoilt by the rain.    Late sown turnips look healthy and main-crop potatoes promise good yields.Parmers have been busy with threshing and ploughing.Land Division.(i)   Land Settlement (England),Applications for Small Holdings.

Farm Settlements administered by tho Board.The total area of land administered by the 3oard remains unchanged, namely 10.643 acres.The total number of ex-service men now working on the Farm Settlements is 2.-6, comprised of 60 settlers, 14i probationers and &apos;i2 men wording as wage-earners.   In addition 21 men have been accented as settlers, but have not yot started work,The reports received from the Directors show that at Patrington tho work during the week consistod mainly of cutting and leading crops and ^uildin;: ricks.   Crops from about 300 acres havo boon olearod and stao;:od up to date.   ,i contraot has been made for the sale of about 193 tons of tho 1919 crop of hay at an average price of  13 per ton, on vhe ground.   Tho steam Tackle has completed 77 acres during the woofc.   At heath hill harvest operations are completed, with the exception o*  one field of spring Wheat to carry, snd 10 acreii of beans to out.   the settlers have been busy harvest-ing and taking up their potatoes.   At Pembrey variable weather has delayed   carting and stacking of corn crops.   Potatoes are still in good demand at  12 per ton, but labour has   not been available to raise any quantity.&quot; At Eoileston tho second crop of clover has been cut.   PIjughing is proceeding as quickly as possible.   Boots are growing, but are ranch too late to &quot;make a fair crop.)   At Ames bury the work has consisted chiefly of potato-picking, and plougHng and sowing winter oats,   70 acres have already been sown.Tho Parliamentary Secretary of tho Board ot Agriculture visited Heath Mill during the week when the Director pointed out the pressing urgency of commencing building operations.IAt Bosbury the work has consisted of loading and hauling clovor and manure, hop-picking and tending of stock.   Hop-picking should be completed about September 25th.&quot; Tho remainder of the harvest ia now gathered.(ii) Provision of Allotments.As a result of representations mado by the Board with regard to the provision of allotments in the Royal. Parks, the Office of works have now agreed to allow the holders&quot;of allotments in Kensington Gardens, Kensington   ace Green, Greenwich Park, and the Hampton Wick end of Bushy Park to continue in occupation until Pebruary, 1921. and for the allotment holders in the other parts of Bushy Park and Primrose Hill to keep their plots until February, 1920, in order to allow them to secure their winter crops.Representations wore made to the Board that the Beverley Town Council had in contemplation the acquisition of about 18 aores of land for a Housing Scheme including some 2-^ acres which had been acquired for allotments under the Cultivation of Lands Otfder.Tho erection of bouses wss not to commence at onoo, but the Council were desirous of proceeding forthv/ich to construct the necessary roads, and ths allotment holders had been given 2 months notice to quit.      .Thls would have resulted in thoir losing the greater part of their winter crops.
An Inspector of the Board visited the site and after consultation with the officials of the Corporation it was arranged that the makirg up ::f the road which would have passed through the allotments should be postponed until April 1920 so as to allow the present cultivators sufficient time to harvest their crops and vacate the ground.The Corporation propose to acquire an adjacent field to accommodate the dispossessed - holders,The attention of the Board was called by the Han we 11. U.D.C. to a case of damage tc the growing crops on certain allotments, &quot;by fumes resulting from the burning of a large quantity of waste material en adjoining land owned by a Building Contractor.     After considerable negotiation an Inspector of the Beard euoceeded in bringing about a satisfactory settlement, the Contractor compensating the allotraent-hcldcrs concerned to the- extent of about  16. 10, 0.(Ill)    or kof;.jjgr i cultural Executive Commit tees.Action under He gu 1 at i onJ3M.

Agr7.cuTte&apos;al&quot;;j.xecuti:ve&quot;Committee called attention to the neglected and impoverished condition of this  state, which is the propoerty of Lord Aylesfrrd, and cimprists about 6,000 acres of land,, including&apos; 40 farms of   25 acres and upwards, together with numerous small holdings. cottages. etc.     The low standard cf oultivatisn was attributable to unsymoathetic and indifferent management, and a general fueling of insecurity,     New agents were stated to be appointed and dismissed by the landlord every few months.     The Committee wished the Beard t* take over the whole Estate, and place it under competent management, but the &quot;hoard were advised that their powers under Hegulaticn 2&quot;-; would not admit of their entering on the whole of the Matate, but only on such of the farms or lands ao wore in a particularly bad state of cultivation. One 3uch farm was known as the Dairy Farm, which, after being in hand for some time, had just been let to a new tenant.     This farm was reputed tc have boon at one time one of tho finest farms of its kind in the Kingdom, but had been allowed to fall into an exceedingly bad state.At the Board&apos;s request Mr. K.       Cobb and the Hon. Ji. 0. Strutt made a survey cf the Estate, and Mr. Cobb made, a report, the general effect of which was to confirm the absence of efficient management, and the low standard of cultivation resulting from this and other causes.     The Committee were av.the.i3ed to take possession of the Dairy Farm, and to let it to a good tenant, who, it was thought, was acceptable to the landlord,*hut vith whom he, or rather Lady Aylesford, subsequently refused to have anything to do,  . The new tenant, in spite of every obstacle being placed in his way by the old tenant, and Lady ^yleoford, has already succeeded in effecting considerable improvement in the farm.     Lady Ayltsford, who has endeavoured at every point to thwart the Committee, ie trying to oust them and their tenant from pc;Je/iition and hat threatened to take legal proceedings     The iioard arc quite t-atiafitd that it i* deeirabl.. that the- tenancy created under the Regulation should continue for the maximum possible period, and have assured the Committee of their support.     At the same time, Lady Aylesford has been informed that the Board are reluctant to interfere in regard to matters of estate management, but that unless effective measures are taken to bring about an improvement, the Boards powers for securing the better cultivation of land must be expected to be invoked, and will be exercised to such an extent as may be doomed necessary or expedient.^e Somerset Agricultural f-xpeut? ve Committee took possession last April of the gi *atc-.r      1 of n farm of 205 acres at Thorn St. Margaret which had been purchased by    land speculator who had endeavoured, without success, to dispose of the purchase.     The
The tenant had vacated the farm at Lady Day, there was no one to cultivate the land and it was essential that the arable land should be attended to at once if it was to be cropped this year. No sooner had the Committee taken possession than a prospective tenant came upon the ?, and efforts were wade to contest the Committee&apos;s action. The Committee were instructed, however, not to withdraw from possession until satisfied that the new tenant would farm the land properly, and to inform the tenant that while they remained in possession of the land, entry by him would be regarded as trespass and dealt with accordingly. The matter has now been satisfactorily settled; the Committee have withdrawn from possession on payment of the cost of their cultivations amounting to £214, and have served the occupier with certain Cultivation Notice in regard to the arable land.

Lincolnshire. Repair of the Trent Banks at Readby. Arrangements have been made to procure all the materials required for this work, and operations will commence in a few days. The work is expected to take about six months to complete and the estimated cost is £8,850.

NorfoIk and West Suffolk. Sanction has been given for the temporary continuation of drainage work under Regulation 2M on the Ouse and Waveney. On the upper portion of the Waveney, considerable sums of money have been advanced voluntarily by land-owners from time to time. On the lower part, the powers of the Waveney Drainage Commissioners are being exercised by the Norfolk Executive Committee. A report is being prepared as to the present position of the work on each river and the recovery of the money spent.

Land Drainage Act, 1918. The following draft Orders have been deposited during the week:-

(1) Holmewood and Stilton Drainage (Hunts.), constitution of separate drainage district.

(2) Wisbech Northside Drainage (Isle of Ely), increase of the Commissioners rating powers.

(3) Tithe, Commons, Copyhold and Survey.

The Board have determined adversely to the objections received to the Schedules of Assessments of redemption money and expenses in three compulsory redemption cases affecting lands in Stoke-next-Guildford (Surrey), Fortsea (Southampton), and Tutbury (Staffs.).

The applications received under the Tithe Acts during the past week include 34 for the redemption of tithe rentcharge amounting in all to £4 95. 9, 2., 9 for the merger of tithe rentcharge, 1 for the redemption and 1 for the conversion of corn rents into tithe rentcharge. In addition, 10 applications for the enfranchisement of copyheld lands have been received.

In cases where the consideration money for redemption is discharged by the payment of a lump sum, the rentcharge is extinguished from and after the payment of the half-yearly portion of the rentcharge which next accrues due subsequent to the time of the payment of such sum. In these circumstances in cases of redemption for cash payments affecting tithe rentcharge payable on the 1st April and the 1st October, special eiforts are being made to issue the Orders of Redemption before the 1st prox. so as to enable the applicants to pay ever the redemption money before that date and thus prevent the accrual of further half-yearly payments of the tithe rentcharges.


The necessary arrangements have now &quot;been made for the 1   holding of a meeting for the purpose of appointing a valuer to prepare a report and plan pijor to making an Award for the Regulation of Coity &apos;7allie Cor^rxs (Glejso-rfran), in accordance with the provisions of the Commons Regulation (Coity Vallia) Provisional Order Confirmation Act, which recently passed into lew.The Stevenage Urban District Council have submitted a draft j-cheme under the Common.&quot; Act, 1895, for the regulation of bedwell Flash Common in the parish cf stevenage, Verts.

The efforts which have been made tn secure the prompt delivery by Railways of fruit and vegetable empties are proving successful.    The Great Northern and Eorth eastern Railways
ypa which the delay was specially acute appear to hare realised the importance of this traffic.Complaints have been received as to unsatisfactory railway acoommodation at Brentford Market. The Railway Companies concerned admit the need for improvement and it is hoped that increased siding accommodation will be provided.The Ministry of Transport has during the week asked for the observations of the loard on the agricultural position in the districts which would be served by the following proposed railways, viz., Braintree and &apos; arks Tay Railway, Longridge and Kellifield   r &apos; light Railway, JBradwell Light Railway, and a railway between Bridgwater and V/atenet, powers for the construction of which are now being sought by private companies.Various distriots in lierfoik have been reported on this week in regard to their need for increased transport facilities.Feeding Stuffs.     Arrangements have now been made by the Ministry cf Food whereby dealers, in Uaize and   illin^ Offals will be licensed and required to sell at the- prescribed prices.     There has recently been evidence that these materials after being sold by millers or importers were being retailed by other dealers at much increased prices.    It iff hoped that the licensing of dealers will prevent this in future.Binder Twine-.     The demand for binder twine for this season has now oome to&quot; an end and it is proposed to transfer to the Disposal Board the surplus stocks which will remain on hand at the end of this month.     These will probably amount to 370 tone.Draft Seed BUI.     The latest draft of the Seed Bill has been considered during the week by a committee of representatives of the three Departments of Agriculture and it has nor been sent forward to the Board&apos;s legal adviser for examination.     Ib soon as the Draft has been passed by the legal adviser it is proposed to submit it for final consideration to a joint meeting of the Trade Advisory Committee and representatives of the other interests concerned.Prices.     The Royal Commission on Agriculture asked for a Memorandum on the prices of fertilisers,&quot;feeding stuffs, seeds, and agricultural machinery, indicating as far aa possible the rise in prices at the present time as compared with pre-war years, together with seme indioaticn of the probable trend of prices in the future; A Memorandum on these lines was prepared and evidence given before the Commission in support.Technical Division.Requirements and Disposal Section.     During the week ended tho 20th September returns of sales were forwarded by Cheshire, Carmarthen, Dorset, Herts., Linos,, Holland, Vonmouth, Bucks., staff., V/est Riding of Yorkshire, Flint, Worcester, Somerset, Hants.The returns show that the following have been disposed of2794 Tractorn 3723 Tractor Ploughs. 2642 t/Iiov-ellcneous Tractor Implements. 3193 Birulera,184 Covers and Tieapers. 4912 Horse Ploughs. 1276 Drills. 19CB Carts and Lorries.

During the week ended the 5th September, 1185 tractors were in the hands of Committees and 836 of these were held by contractors under the new Tractcr Scheme,The returns received showed that 1436 aores were ploughed, 1454 acres oultivated and 4991 aores reaped by the 457 traetoro at work under both schemes, giving an average of 3.1, 3.2 and 10.9 acres respectively.    Harvesting operations were carried out in 3o counties.The highest average acreage was recorded in the Isle qf Ily, where 4 tractors ploughed 21 acres, cultivated 97 acrea and renned 25 acres, average 5.3, 24.3 artd 6.3 acrea respectively, hut the most work was done in Norfolk where 28 tractors ploughed 99 acres, cultivated 69 acres and reaped 716 aores, giving an average of 3.2, 2.5 and 25.6 acres respectively.Requests have been received from several counties for permission to continue the tractor scheme after the end of this month, either for general purposes or simply for threshing. &apos; all cases it has been   explained that the oeherae oannot be continued and    it has been suggested that the position could probably beet irts met by the Committee assisting in the pr:jm^tion amongst the farmers eenoerned of co-operative societies er associations fcr the purchase and working of maohinery and implements.    Arrangements have been made with the Commercial Division for securing the assistance of the Agricultural Organisation Society in all suitable oases.     It may be mentioned that over 30 threshing boxes have already been purchased from the Department by farmoro for working on a co-operative basis, and this seems the most effective method of meeting any difficulty occasioned to smaller farmers by the cessation ef the traotor sche; and farmers in out-lying districts not adequately served by threshing or other contractors.Horse Section.

The ohjeet of the Scheme is to establish a quasi civil service of Research Workers and to open a more attractive career to young graduates in Scjonee. Definite scales of salaries will be provided with annual increments rising to aasdmum of  800 per annum.    It is also intended to;-provide for superannuation on a contributory basis.    Research in the agricultural Scitmoos has been hampered in the past by the fewness of the workers in the field and tho dearth of promising recruits*    It is ,expected that the scheme will be accepted by the Development Commissioners and that, as a consequence, there will be a steady flow of men of first clacr ability with a consequent improved output of scientific repultr directed to the advancement of the productive no so of British Agriculture.Localni^education.

The farm consists of  131 acres, all arable with the exception sf 30 acres of rather indifferent grass.    The arable is light two-horse land and has been farmed well.    The owner (a lady)  -has no previous experience and proposed to engage in mixed farming and to roar pedigree Jersey and Kerry stock.    Advice was given as te tho scheme of cropping to be adopted under a four course system. Besides tho small herds of Jerseys and Kerrys, the aimer was advised to fill up with Shorthorns.

During the past week arrangements have been made to close down the training centres at Colston Bassett, Nottingham, Hangingstone Leicestershire. The Coaches, North Riding, and Bourne End, Bedfordshire. The latter hostel is retained for the pre? as a depot and dilleting hostel.

With the nearer approach of the demobilisation of the Women&apos;s Land Army it is satisfactory to recall instances of the value of their work and the good opinion of their employers.

From Sussex a farmer wrote last week after employing a member of the Land Army. "I shall never have a man again to look after my poultry, as I find a good intelligent, capable girl is better in every way, cleaner, more ? conscientious, and studies the small details which alone make for success."

At a farm in Stafford where all the men were on strike, a cow got etranded on a small piece of land in the middle of a wide and swift river. The animal refused to cross to either bank. A Land Army employee took off her overall, boots and stocking, swam across the river, roped the cow, and drove it before her swimming until they both reached dry land.

Another case is reported of a woman showing great presence of mind in rescuing a man who was being gered by a bull. Miss Fisher attacked the bull from the rear, and succeeded in pulling him off the man.


A member cf the Land Army has gained a prize in the open miking Competition as well aa a special milking prize at Monks Kirby Show.Twc Land Army women have been given a small holding of about 10 aores on an estate in Cornwall.    the new tenants propose keeping cows, pigs and poultry, in addition to a oertain amount cf culture of vegetables and violets.

A small Sub-Committee including the Inspector was appointed to draw up a Scheme for the next meeting.Shropshire,     The County Council have appointed a Committee knovn as the County Council Agricultural Ccmmittee which is practically a Statutory Agricultural Committee in embryo.     There ia a Horticultural Sub-Committee v/ith an efficient Chairman.     The County Council is in favour of the new Statutory Committees which it is proposed to set up, but intends to protest against the &quot;card appointing members, on the ground that enough control is already exercised through grants and Inspectors.&apos; Cheshire.     The Horticultural Sub-Committee meets for the firBt time this month.     A Farm Institute is being formed at Reaoe Heath, Zfantwioh,&quot; and four acres are to be allotted for horticultural purposes.Staffordshire.     The County is in favour of giving horticulture a prominent place in agricultural education, and at the Perm Inctitute at Rodbaeton there are 5 acres of gardens and pleasure grounds, while an additional acre for horticulture has been set aside in a very fine field-.    A further 5 acres will be obtained shortly.     It is recognised that the better organisation for marketing produce, is a subject of the greatest importance.     The Board&apos;s Scheme of Horticultural Organisation hao been -  explained te the Horticultural Superintendent.Westmorland.     The Horticultural Instructor for the county has been interviewed and the suggestion ar.de to him that a plot should be acquired for planting varieties I^own to do well, and a -careful note kept of all expenses,   with a viev to convincing practical grorers of the worth of these varieties from a commercial point of view.

A Schema, for Hoxtdjcultural&apos;Instruction is being drawn up, anoT^land Jfer   a training Institute, a seotion of which will be devoted to horticulture, has been acc^ulred. &apos;Cardiganshire. The Agricultural Organiser considers that ^he. interests of the ooUxr^t are ^mainly agricrulrtural, and not much attention can be given to Small cultivation. There is ajqple scope for improvement in cottage gardening and near such summer- resorts aa Aberystwyth Market Gardening should be developed. The Agricultural Organiser eventually agreed to bring these points to the notice of the Education Committee.Cheshire.     The Inopeotor reports that farmers are buying fruit trees extensively, and that the average acreage put down to fruit by them is about 3 acres.    The regular farm hands are employed, in the orchards when there ia no pressing farm work.Warwickshire..

Wiltshire,     The Agricultural Lxeoutive Committee are anxious to obiialn atore land for the Swindon Training Centre for Disabled ibc-Service men, which is at present too small for good training on commercial lines, and the purchase of a market garden in close proximity has been suggested.Beekeeping.

In the Home Counties further cases havo boon reported,Tho increase in the number of reports of tha ooourronce of this disease is doubtless due to the propaganda which is being carried on by tbs 3oard.   Eastern Counties continue to keep practically free, although two fresh cases havo boon reported from tngham, Lincolnshire.   Many contraventions of tho Order are being reported froui Glamorgan and it has boen stated that susceptible varieties are being freely exhibited at whs shows and in some-cases have received prizes,   Tho District Inspector reports, however-, that the e:diibition of non-immunes is a rare occurrence in the County and ho further states that the result of the Order in the County thir-year is remarcable*   In his opinion tho immunes planted total over 99 per cent, of the potatoes present in tho County, and he considers that as a conso uonce there are fewer oases of /art Disease this year thin in any othor year sinco he has been connected with the j3oardrs work.Other Potato Diseases, Blight is still general throughout the country and is&apos;&quot;&apos;reporCed as being somewhat severe in parts of Denbigh and it is also said to be spreading rapidly in tho  astern Counties.

The latter case was just out-side the Worth 2ssex and Suffolk Control district bo an extension of that district was considered necessary, to include the remainder of Essex and a small part of Canbs, and Herts,     The outbreak being at Stebbing, Essex,the contemplated removal of restrictions from the part of Essex in the London Middlesex District has to be given up,&apos;Orders have been prepared considerably reducing the area of the London, Middlesex. District, revoking the East Kent Distriot and the whole of the Cornwall, Devon District except the.special areas.One outbreak of &quot;Foot-and-llouth Disease has bee;; fconfirmed but as it was in close proximity to the previous case at wyke Regis it did not materially affect the position.     An Order haB boon issued modifying the restrictions imposed on account of the outbreaks at ityke Regis,s Orders.A schedule of questions on the subject of the Rats Orders was recently addressed to all l:ort Medical Officers by a Special Committee of the ;ort Sanitary Association,In ana- er to question (l) &quot;Does the Order of March 1919, convey useful powers over and *boye those of any other Orders for the purpose of ship disinfestation?&quot;     the Medical Officer of Health of the Pert of Liverpool replied that the Order dated 26th March, 1919, certainly oonveyed useful powers which have not hitherto been available for the dioinfeatation of ships, viz., that measures may be taken to disinfect rat ridden vessels irrespective of. the conditions as regards infection at the Port of departure.     All vessels, therefore, arriving at this Port (Liverpool), can be dealt with for rat destruction.     In answer to question (2), !Should the powers and facilities of this Order be rendered permanent in come form as a public health measure of sanitation rather than of food preservation?&quot; he replied, Yos, these powers -.vould be supplementary to those already in force under the Cholera, Plague and Yellow Fever Order, 1906, in regard to ilague infected and suspected vessels,Liverpool has arranged to cooperate for the National Rat &quot;week and  250 h*s been voted for this purpose,Newcastle City Council hove decided to spend  500 on the extermination of rats,inquiry has been made into the recent report of extensive damage done in a warehouse in Manchester.    The damage done in a warehouse of a firm of large provision merchants in cheese, butter, bacon and lard is estimated by the owner at  300 per month.     Two other firms in the same block cf buildings have also suffered from the rat pest.     Individual effort on the part of the firms concerned has failed to get rid of the rats, and they agree that combined action is the only remedy and have expressed their willingness to cooperate.     The facts have been brought to the notice of the Local Authority.
In reply to enquiries as to what further action the City of London Authority have been taking, the Town Clerk states that since December 1918, an Inspector has been specially employed and prompt measures have been takon to deal with urgent oases but the Medical Officer of Health has not yet found it practicable to define a working policy which could be applied to the City in general. He hopes, however, to present a report to the appropriate Comraitteo before the end of the year.V/ithout doubt the problem of rat destruction in London is one of considerable magnitude and speoial diffioulty; but this reply from the City Local Authority and evidence we have from the Metropolitan Boroughs indicates that they are very much behind ether Authorities in the perception of the need for aotion and a resolute intention to grapple with it.Veterinary Depar tment.Swine fever material was examined in - 82 reported outbreaks.

Fishery Harbours.,     An informal Conference took&quot;place last week between two Officers of this Division and Mr, Steel of the Ministry of Transport,,, in relation to the future policy with regard to small Harbours, regarded as essentially fishing harbours.     It was arranged w.ith Kr. Steel that, in the event of the Development Commissioners applying to tho Board for a report in connection with any application for improve^ ment, the Board should invite the Ministry of Transport to send an Officer to accompany the Bo rd&apos;s Officer on the preliminary inspection;     the idea being that even if the Harbour was essentially a fishery one there might be certain transport considerations to be borne in mind in connection with development.     The Board would, in such cases, for the sake of convenience, furnish the Ministry of Transport with a copy of their report, but where any improvements to a fishery harbour were likely to result in it3 becoming partly a oommeroial harbour, the Board should also suggest to the Development Commissioners, in sending their report, that the case was one where the Ministry of Transport might be consulted.It was also agreed that in any cases where the Ministry of Transport were approached for funds for the improvement of the Harbour, that they should ask the Board for a report as to the fisheries aspect, if any, of the proposed harbour improvement.r
As regards the question of the delay in distribution, shortage of trucks and similar questions, it was arranged that any complaints should at once be communicated verbally to Colonel Gray, who \.ould immediately take steps to have the matter dealt with by the Operations branch of the Ministry.     This arrangement-; has already worked with groat success in the first case referred to him, a case of truck shortage, which Colonel Gray was able to dispose of the same ovening.   *If all future cases are disposed of with the same smoothness, it is not anticipated that any difficulty will be found in dealing with any future transport troubles which may arise.Government Assistance in connection with the Autumn Herring Season (I&quot;3594/19T.    &quot;The soheme for GoveFnment assistance containing the essential detail.! which was referred to in the last Weekly Report, hps now been submitted to the Cabinet, conjointly by this Department and the Scottish Office, and the decision of the Cabinet is nov awaited,It is understood that the Pood Controller will submit a separate Memorandum supporting the proposal.question of Foreign vessels being allowed to land their catches for sale at British&quot; nor ts.    (&quot;F.55^77^&quot;),      &quot;&quot;This question  has been brought to the Beardfs attention by the Foreign Office, who have been approached by the Netherlands Charg&amp; d*Affaires.,     The Board replied to the Foreign Office that they were in some difficulty with regard to the question, as technically they did not consider that they could legally prevent the landing and sale of fish at British ports by foreign vessels.     On the ether hand, the Board1s view was that there was sufficient fish being landed at the present moment by British vessels almost tc over-burden existing distribution facilities, and that the presence of foreign fishing vessels was likely to upset the temper of the fishermen,     It was recommended, therefore, that the Foreign Office, when replying to the Netherlands Charge d*Affaires, should inform them that while His irajesty&apos;a Government would raise no objection to Dutch trawlers landing their fish at British ports, it would be impossible, under existing circumstances, to undertake that such vessels would be provided with bunker coal and other stores.Fisheries in Palestine jjK3576/191..

In order to relieve the shortage of ice for fishing purposes&quot; at Yarmouth, arrangements have been made vlth the Ministry of Transport for the provision of waggons to run daiiV- v/ith ice from Sheffield to Lo^estoft,     This is the case referred to under the opening subject,Punning of Explosives___( ?.3518/1919) .

The lo;,rd at first desired that all su^h^i^^i^^L^h^ulaV-be dumped outside the 200 fathom line on account of risk of injury to fishing, likely to be caused rather by gear getting entangled and lost, than by actual injury to fish life caused by the contents of the shells gradually lea ingi,   out.     The Ministry of Munitions urged that, with a view to economy, places within the 200 fathom line should be selected, and they suggest an area about 15 - 20.miles bout?! of tho 3ddystone,     The Board have, with a view to meet! .   the case, proposed to the Ministry of Uunitiona that all surplus ammunition lving &quot;-in the   est Coast of England shall be deposited within 200 yards of a certain wreck lying in the area suggested, since fishermen would, in any case &apos; avoid that locality.     It has been further suggested that as an extra precaution, the location of the wreok shall be narked by a permanent gas.-: buoy.     It is understood that the Ministry hnve accepted the site and official confirmation is awaited.Admiralty Buoys at Yarmouth____(g,5623/19\,     The Board havinglearned that certain buoys are still located on the fishing grounds at Yarmouth in positions likely to cause injury to fishing vessels&apos; gear during the herring season, have requested the Admiralty.to take steps to ensure the removal of these buoys, and the Admiralty hnve promised to do their best in the natter before the end of September,Salt for Scotch I: err in;..; Curers (F,, 3427/19) ,    tirgent requests for resistance to obtain railway trucks to convey salt for the Scotch Herring Curers have recently been received by the Joard, who, at once took up the question of obtaining trucks to convey at least 1,000 tons to be sent to certain points on the Horth Eastern Railway, with the Railway Executive Committee, The Railway ..   e v*  . .

Demobilisation.Military.   Recent Amy Council instructions have relaxed somewhat, the qualifications necessary for dispersal, and the fish industry, inter alia,   stands to benefit thereby.   Whilst it remains impossible to secure releases on occupational grounds alone, it is hoped that a number of hankers and other smaller distributors of fish may be demobilised in the near future as &quot;proprietors of one-man businesses&quot;.naval.   It has been decided not to press the Admiralty for any fresh general concessions at present.   A considerable proportion of the &quot;special&quot; cases put forward by the Board for favourable consideration are released with very little delay.Economics Division.latisticaOL Branch.The Preliminary Statement of the agricultural returns of 1019 nag completed and issued to the public on the 20th instant.
