(This Dooumant la the property .of His Britannic Majesty is Government)im CABira?.Seoretn&quot;m J&quot;onAK                      Unemployment Insurance t ,G .T* 8205. ......Memorandum by the President of the Board of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries.&apos;In Sir Robert home s Memorandum (G.T. 8123) it is stated that workers in agriculture &quot;are exposed to a very low risk of unemployment11 .   I do not know what ie the basic for that statement, The figures derived from the members of Unions have, in the past, referred to but a very small proportion of the agricultural labourers and the Labour Exchange figures are equally misleading.   The situation as regards agriculture has changed radically since the institution of a minimum rate of wage and the recent advances in that minimum rate.   It is to be feared that many farmers will, in future resort to the practice of &quot;standing off&apos;5 part of their men during the winter and other slack times, having regard to the high and unaccustomed rate of wages they now have to pay.   I could not therefore support any proposal to exclude agriculture altogether from a general scheme of unemployment insurance and, so far as I am aware, Buch exclusion would be resisted by the representatives of agricultural labour who at the present time seem anxious to place their industry in all respects on a parity with purely urban industries.        li then agriculture is to be included I should ask for its separate treatment On the &quot;basis of 7b of Sir Robert Kernels Memorandum, i.,e- that it -should be allowed to set up a scheme for itself and devote its own &apos; funds to a system of benefits organised in accord with its special needs.   Though the Trade Unicn Organisation among agricultural labourers is comparatively recent, and still not oo-terminous with the industry, I am of opinion that it will be practicable to organise an approved society for the purpose of unemployment Insurance.   There are many borderline workers in agriculture but it would be for the individual to decide whether he would join the approved society cr throw in his contributions tc the common State scheme.ftFishermen present particular difficulties, owing to the general prevalence of the share system, under vrhich they are not &quot;employere&quot; and &quot;employed&quot; in the usual sense of the term-   I am making enquiries as to.the possibilities-of a special scheme for $fishermen but in the meantime their case could he mot by allowing men   , like trawler hands, who constitute the chief class in receipt of weekly wages, to join the general scheme,L of F. 24th September, 1919,
