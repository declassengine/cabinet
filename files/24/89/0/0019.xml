S3CONFIDENTRESPONSIBILITY OF TIE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AMD FISHERIESFOR JiUESTlOHS EFFECT IMG AGRICULTURAL LABOURMemorandum by the Minister of Labour.The memorandum on this subject by the President of theBoard of Agriculture and Fisheries (G.T.8158 dated 15.9.19) proposes that &quot;all administrative duties relating to agricultural labour in England and ! ales should be explicitly allocated to the Board of Agriculture&quot;.   I do not think this .would be a wise decision to make.The question may be dealt ^ith in two aspects (a) as regards employment, (b) as regards wages and hours of work.1.   The administrative duties of the Ministry of Labour as regards employment In rural areas fall under three main heads;-(a) The ordinary work of an employment agency, as regards all classes of employers or workpeople who choose to apply.(b) The administration of the temporary Out.-of-Vork Donation Scheme, v/hich covers all classes of wage-earners who are unemployed.    &quot;   -- w(c) The&apos;administration of the permanent UnemploymentInsurance Scheme, which covers. In rural areas, 3uchclasses as carpenters and smiths, but not agricultural workers proper.   The latter however, may be includedin the Hew Measure dealing with this subject.2.   The proposals now put forward by the President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries appear to involve the transference of the administrative duties above referred to from the Ministry of Labour to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, so far as agricultural workers are concerned.This seems to be open to the following objections:-(1)   The Board of Agrioulture could not discharge these duties satisfactorily without establishing what would be ineffect a system of Employment Exchanges (by whatever name they may be described) for dealing with agricultural labour.   the branch Managers of the Ministry of Labour must be retained in order to deal with rural workers who are not engaged inEmplryment.The machinery used is that of the Employment Exchange which acts in close co-operation with the Agricultural,Executive Committees established under the Board of Agriculture.agriculture/
agriculture and in particular those who are insured against unemployment.   The result would-.be; a wasteful duplication of State employment agencies&apos;all&apos;.over the country.12) , The need for oxiering the facilities now provided by the employment -Exchanges for the transfer of workpeople from one district to another or from one kind of employment to another is hot ao important in agriculture as it is in some other cases, but it is nevertheless of some importance, and it fill become mor( important as agriculture a;  &quot;oaeb.es - ore nearly to..the level of ordinary industry in its terms and conditions of employment.   As regards transfers from one district to another, the $oard of Agriculture could meet this need &quot;ithln the limits of their-jurisdiction, i.e. for England and &quot;ales, but only by a further duplicate of the machinery already provided by the Lmploymerit Exchanges for this very purpose.   Transfers from one kind of employment to another cannot be dealt ^ith efficiently except by an, organisation such as that of the. Employment Exchanges rrhich covers all kinds of employment.(3)   A considerable extension of the scope:of unemployment Insurance is inevitable.   The result rdll be in any event to increase the numbers of non-, agricultural workers to be dealt with by the ministry of Labour in rural areas and consequently the need for&quot; having machinery under the Ministry of Labour in such areas.&apos; The new scheme may or may not include agricultui workers.   If it does, the advantage of keeping the administration under the same department for all classes of workers is Incontestable.   If it does not, it still remains important that the facilities for offeringemployment In agriculture In suitable, cases to those drawing unemployment benefit should not be impaired bythe proposed separation of functions.(4)   The administrative duties now exercised, by riinistry of Labour in connection with employment are essentially the same for all industries.   The Specialise needs of agriculture can I suggest, be be,st met not by divorcing It from the main system but by developing and extending the arrangements &quot;hich already exist for&apos; co-ordination with the work of the Agricultural Executii Committees.Ps. Pages.(5)   As regards wages it is true that the Agrlcult T&apos;ages Board system is placed under the control of the Board of Agriculture by the Corn Production Act, 191?, 1) In all essentials these - ages Boards are Trade &apos;oards.There/
A 9There is no reason In the nature of the case why(apart from the Com Production Act), the Ministryof Labour should not deal with agricultural wagesquestions.   On the other hand, it Is of the highest Importance that the Department dealing with v agesin any&apos;one industry should be in touch withdecisions as to Wages in other industries as everydecision affects every other trade in some, degree..(6)   Lord Lee&apos;s memorandum states that &quot;it Is highly desirable to emphasise the special, conditions under which agriculture Is carried on.&quot;   while this is true, it is equally certain that the Agricultural Unions are now acting more and more with other Trade Unions and it will be found impossible to deal with them apart.   For example, the other Unions are at present irotesting In sympathy with the represen-tatives of.agriculture against the exclusion of agricultural workers from the proposed Hours Bill. The whole Trade: Union movement would look with.great suspicion on any attempt to deal with agricultural workers by a separate Department. &apos;(7-)   It is; agreed however, that the Corn Production Act has brought about an anomalous situation and so . long as it lasts the tfoard of Agriculture must be the executive authority In connection with AgriculturalV/ages Boards *   Similarly, it must be the Department to set up Conciliation Committees, but for these purposes It is suggested that a representative of the Ministry of Labour should be attached to the Farm borkersVBranch of the Board of Agriculture.(8)   From a general point of view. I am of opinion that there is a great disadvantage in &quot;sectionalising&quot; duties which belong to the Ministry of Labour, by cutting off bits in which particular Departments are interested.   In the end there will be a mosaic of unconnected, If not conflicting, jurisdictions which,besides being very expensive, will be most unsatls-factory.September 25.1919.(Signed) R.S.H
