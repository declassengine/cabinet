October 3rd. 1919. R. October 6th. 1919. No. 1405. lOAG.At yesterday1b meeting of the Council (see my telegram No.1401 item 2) M.Clemenceau made a strong appeal for support for the Polsih Army.   He said tnat all indications, including German despatches which he had intercepted, proved that the Polish Army was recognised hy the German Government as one of the most effective instruments in the hands of the Allies for enforcing on Germany the terms of peace, and it was therefore of the most urgent importance that the Polish Army should he kept fully equipped with arms and munitions.   A note from Marshal Poch covering a detailed statement from M.Paderewski was read, showing the urgent need for clothing and other supplies including a certain amount of war material and ammu-nition. I am forwarding copies of these document hy despatch.   It was made clear that the assistance to he rendered would unavoidably involve certain ox-penditure on transport, etc.I agreed that the military representatives at Versailles should he at once authorised to report on the possibility of furnishing the supplies required for the Polish Army, and while I explained that i could
could not in any way commit ray Government in the matter without definite Instructions, I promised at once to ask for directions as to the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards these requests and  , the assistance which they might he prepared to render,I should therefore he glad to receive as soon as possible an indication of the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the question of the principle, It being left to the British representative on the Council at Versailles to examine, in concert with his Allied colleagues, into the question of the precise form that a contribution cf each of the Allies to the common purpose might take.It will he remembered that the question of military supplies and equipment for Poland was discussed at a meeting of the Council of Five on June 27th when it was decided to complete the equipment of the polish Army, the Versailles Council being directed to make immediate enquiry in consultation with the Polish authorities as to the deficiencies, and to advise how and from what source these could best be made up.   The present proposals of Marshal Foch are no doubt the result of the enquiries thus set on foot.
