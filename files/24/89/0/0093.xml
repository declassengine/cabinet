MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR,I circulate a memorandum, which has been compiled by the General Staff, from General Holmans reports, the Bolshevik wireless messages and Press narratives. tu,\ yi.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.9th October, 1919.During the fighting between the 15th-20th August, 1919, west of Borisogliebsk General Mamontov, the Commander of the, 1st Don Army, having concentrated the bulk of his cavalry in this area, inflicted a severe defeat on the Bolsheviks at Makarovo and broke through their line with the object of carrying out an extensive raid behind the Bolshevik lines.For some ten days no news of him was received, though from time to time the Bolsheviks published in their wireless reports extracts from an article written by Trotsky entitled &quot; The Courage of Despair,&quot; in which the raid was described as General Denikin&apos;s last effort and General Mamontov and his Don Cossacks were reported to have been surrounded by the Red soldiers.At last, however, a report was received that General Mamontov was south of Tambov and working towards that town. Shortly after, the news was received that he had entered Tambov, the chief supply dep6t of the Bolshevik southern front, where his casualties were reported to have been only 20. There he captured 13,000 prisoners and in addition disarmed and sent back to their homes 20,000 peasants who had been forcibly conscripted by the Bolsheviks. One Bolshevik regiment, with 40 officers and several machine guns, joined General Mamontov. The latter also formed from Volunteers a &quot; Tula&quot; Division of three regiments. After distributing Bolshevik food reserves amongst the population and destroying stores, which he could not remove, General Mamontov worked westwards towards Koslov, the headquarters of the Bolshevik southern front.Again, several days passed without definite news as to General Mamon tovs move-ments other than that he was north of Koslov, having struck north-west from a point midway between Tambov and Koslov.Sufficient information was, however, given in the Bolshevik wireless report to show that he was still in existence. Appeals to the Coss icks to abandon the raid and join the Bolsheviks were published, but evidently made no impression on the former as they were followed by reports of damage done to the Bolshevik organization. &quot; Railway lines were taken up for a stretch of many versts and thousands of telegraph posts have been sawn down.&quot;Subsequently, General Denikin using De Haviland aeroplanes gained touch with General Mamontov in the neighbourhood of Voronezh. It was found that he had raided Koslov, Jeletz and Kostornoje, an important railway junction, and as ordered by General Denikin was working towards Lysky. In the course of his exploit he had destroyed Bolshevik supplies and done extensive damage to the railway. The effects of his work were already being noticed on the northern front of General Denikin s forces, where the Bolsheviks were reported to have been restricted to a daily-ammunition allowance of 12 rounds per rifle and 50 rounds per machine gun.The latest reports indicate that General Maihontov, after raiding Voronezh, where he destroyed huge quantities of military stores and returned 20,000 Bolshevik conscripts to their homes, has regained touch with the main forces of the Volunteer Army. He is operating against Lysky from the north in conjunction with an advance against it from the south and west by the main Don Army.Thus General Mamontov with a small face (probably not exceeding 3,000 sabres) maintained himself in the enemy&apos;s country fcr over 35 days and covered over 375 miles. He was enthusiastically received by the population and was able to increase his force48401498083
by two infantry divisions raised from volunteers in the raided territory.   The vast quantities of military stores which Averfc destroyed are reported to have included 300 guns and large stocks of ammunition.   The. number of Bolshevik levies released and returned to their homes is said to have reached 80,000. . ....The direct result of this daring enterprise is seen in the drastic reduction of the ammunition supply of the Bolshevik forcels in General Denikin&apos;s northern front. There is little doubt, moreover, that the slackening of the Bolshevik offensive against Tsaritsin at the end of last month was due to the withdrawal of Bolshevik cavalry from this front to oppoise General Mamontoy, and the rapidity of General Denikin&apos;s recent advance towards Voronezh and Kursk may be attributed in no small measure to the disorganization created by General Mamontov on the Bolshevik lines &apos;&quot; of Communication.
