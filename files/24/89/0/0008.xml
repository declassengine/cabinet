Hp Ps-nnpsrtv of36tV&apos;3 014PARAPHBA.SE TElSGRALe from the Secretary of State for theColonies tc the Governor General of the Commonwealth ofAustralia. v.,(gent 11&apos;. 30. a. 20th September, 1919.,)Referring to your telegram 13th September please communicate following to year Prim,.: Minister.     As Chairman of handatcs Commission I did. my best obtain a form of Landato which v/culd be most favourable to Australia.     o objection to the form finally adopted, has been raised either by low Zealand or by South Africa and I think that it would be un-wise tc reopen question new.As regards your first point the Commission it was quite evident were not prepared to insert.provision for in-ccrporation of islands in Mandate and to continue to press; for it wculd have bc-t,n useless.     The fact that no provision for incorporation is included in mandate will net in the least prohibit an appeal to the League of rations to allow such incorporation, if there is a bona fide demand on the part of natives in future and League would be pretty certain if agreeing to it to insist that reservation as to fcrtifica-tions be maintained.As regards your second point, your proposal seems to me tc be.: really less favourable to Australia than article adopted by Commission, Expression &quot;all reasonable facili-tios&quot; would make it possible to appeal to League whenever it was considered that reasonable facilities had been withheld. &quot;-Further I do net agree that absolute right of entry is given to persons who are not bona fide missionaries or to whom.. . \  &apos; ; e&apos;- ;legitimate objection can be taken.     The rights conferred arc conferred on missionaries as such and further are &quot;subject to the provisions of any local law for the maintenance of public order and morals&quot;.     It seems to me most undesirable that any narrow interpretation should be plaocd upon this proviso; the powers which you will possess under it are very-wide .MILITER.
