TO THE Mt^ORUIIMl SUBMITTED TO THE vtAR CABIB2T BY MR-. ec?h,,!tdOiJ UIUjSR COViiRIiiG LJOTL D^TKD 28th JULY, 1919 (G.T. 7823). .In Mr, Mfophsrson! s covering note to. the .Memor&amp;ndum submitted by him to the War;&apos; Cabinet he states&apos; that the views of&apos;the Trustees of the Hationr..l Gallery in London in regard to the 39 pictures of the Modern French School, bequeathed by Sir Hugh. Lt;ne to the national Gallery are set out in tho penultimate paragraph of such Memorandum. This paragraph, however, merely quotes the advice of the Treasury Solicitor as to the legal effect of the provisions of Sir Hugh Lane!s Will and of the national Gallery Act of i856 by which the pictures are vested In the Trustees of the London Motional Gallery.     The para-graph does not contain the views&apos; of the Trustees as to the position or on the various points arising out of it, which are referred to in the Irish Memorandum,The Trustees of the London national Gallery have thought it desirable to summarise as briefly as possible the main facts in connection with the questions raised, as also the deductions which in their view are proper to be made from thooe facts, and following the precedent set by the Irish Memorandum they have annexed a number of Statutory Declarations substantiating the faots and deductions made from them.The questions at issue have been the subject of considerable public discussion&quot;in the Press on various occasions in 1916, 1917 and 1918,Originally three questions were involved :-(1)        Whether the pictures in question were legally vested in the Trustees of the national Gallery(E)       Whether&quot; the so-called Codicil represented the last wishes of Sir Hugh Lane, and(2)        Whether it would be just and expedient to provide by legislation for the transfer of the pictures from the London National Gallery to Dublin.(1)        The first question has, it is understood, now been settled, as those responsible for the Irith Memorandum no lbngor contend that the pictured r-re not properly ma legally vested in the Trustees oi the lfntional Gallery, while the Treasury Solicitor has advised the Trustees th&amp;t&apos; they have no power to dispose of the pictures by gift to the national Gallery of Ireland or to any other body including the Dublin Corporation,     The pictures are therefore legally held by the Trustees on behalf oi the nation.(2)     . According to the Irish Memorenanm the so-c&amp;called Codicil, though of no legal effect, expressed Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s last wishes..The Trustees oi the National Gallery after carefully considering all the evidence both for end against this contention have come to the conclusion that it is not borne out by the frets, and that to give effect to auch Codicil would be in the circumstances to defeat and not to carry out Sir Hugh Laae&apos;s last wishes.
The Irish Memorandum though containing h number of ashertiona^ in favour of the contention it puts forward omits so jnany material facts and dates that it is necessary to supplement it by the chronological statement &quot;A&quot;o     The Traces&quot; reasons in support of their view that the weight of evidence is in favour of the National Gallery will be found in Statement &quot;3Jl and is in part based upon the Statutory Declarations of Mr. D. 3* MacColl, Mr, Charles Aitken, Mr. Rooert Witt and Sir Joseph Daveon set out in Appendix lo(3)        In regard to the third question, whether n special Bill should, be introduced into Parliament transferring the pictures from London to Dublin, the Trustees of. the London national Gallery are of opinion that this course would be neither just nor in the public interest.     Their reasons in support of this view and on what has been called the &quot;moral&quot; side of the question are set out in Statement &quot;CH.(2)
/[OpCHRONOLOGICAL   STAIMSfT1.        Por some years before 193.3 Sir^Hugh^lano^had boon in controversy with the Dublin Corporation and &quot;ith oortain sections of Irish opinion outside tho - Corporation as to the exhibition,, of various modern pictures of tho British and French Schools whi*h ho had either obtained as gifts or had himself purchased and whidi he desired tc procont to tho Corporation on condition that it pro-vidod a Gallery which he considered worthy and suitable both as to site and design for thoir permanent accommodation and bxhlbition^ Meanwhilo, a portion of thoso pictures v/as deposited cn loan at Belfast anfl another portion, the largest, in a house temporarily provided by the Dublin Corporation in Hsroourt Street, Dublin, whioh subsequently beoamo tho Dublin Municipal Gallery of Modern Art.2,        On the 20th January 1913 the Dublin Corporation had passed a Resolution offering to provide  22,000 for the ereotion of a Gallery upon two conditions;-(1) That the site was provided entirely by ethers(2) That  3,000 was also provider1 by others towards the oost of the erection.A subscription list for oufclio subscriptions vas opened bttt nothing had boon agreed as to tho Icoation of th&quot; site., nor as to tho design cf th ; Gallery b ing approved by Sir Hugh L:?nn.&quot;   Tho Resolution th .r -foro dia not fulfil tho conditions of Sir Hugh Lano&apos;s of$or.3. By th* autumn of 1913 the majority of tin pictures had&apos;b-ocmo tho property of tha Dublin Corporation subject in part io th i ultimate provision of a Hilary, but Sir Hugh I*no had retained in his own hands what ho call^ his provisional Gift, whioh included the 39 French pioturos (which arY tho subject matter of: tho present memorandum), and some others as to whioh no question arises.4. These ho retained in hia own hands with a view to U3ingthorn as a lover to force tho Corporation to comply with his oonditJioha in tho matter of providing a G-rilory to contain the pictures and of -rooting it in on a site and to a design approved by him.   Sir Hugh Lano proposed various sites and finally employed Sir Sdwin Lutyrns to proparo ,)lans for one on a bridge crossing the. liffey. Objection was taken by tho Corporation and by a section of Irish opinion to the site, to tho plans and to tha arohiteot, on tho ground that he was not Irish,5. Sir Hugh Ir-no refuse:&apos; to yield to thoso objections.Tho Bridge site and the luty^no design had become his gr-^at and oontral scheme.   Finally ho offnrod to accept an alternative site for the pictures air ady given but in that c;so his &quot;Provisional Gift&quot; cf tho 39 Fr?.nch pictures &quot;ould bo withdrawn,6. In July 1913 tho idea of transferring then to london was discussed in a conversation between Sir Hugh I^n^ and lord Curzon..  Lord curzon, who was a Trustee of the London IHtional Gallery, had.in mind the provision of a Gallery of Modern Foreign , Pointings in lendon,    The Committee of Trustees of the national (Jallsry to enquire into matters connected with the National Art Collections (of which he w*3 Chairman) - was ju.3t completing its [Report and this Re ort recommended jiuter alia), teat the L?information of a Gallery of Modern foreign or Continental
pictures and sculpture was a matter of urgent importance but that a suitable Gallery was not likely to be  provided until there was on important collection of such pictures which needed to be housed.

7. On the 27th July 1913 Sir Hugh Lane wrote to Sir Charles Holroyd, s Director of the National Gallery London, that as the Dublin Corporation were unwilling to carry out his conditions as to building a permanent Gallery ?or the mo?orn collection, he felt bound to remove his "Provisional Gift" though he was anxious to give the Corporation a last chance of securing them. He offered them as a loan to the National Gallery  and pointed out that while it might encourage the Dublin Corporation to accept them on his conditions it might also serve a double purpose by gauging English public sentiment in regard to the de? irability of a permanent collection of Modern Contintental Art for London.  On the l2th August 1913 this offer was accepted by the National Gallery.

8. On the 8th September 1913 the Dublin Corporation inally rejected Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s proposals to crect a  permanent Gallery on the ?ito and to the designs approved by him.

9. On the 9th September 1913 an interview with Sir Hugh Lane appeared in the Manchester Guardian which refers to the conversation in July 1913 with Lord Curzon. It is as follows:-

"Sir Hugh Lane ?ho es hat the Exhibition now to take "place in the National Gallery may lead to the realisation "of ? ambition which he shares with many leading artists "the establishment in London of a permanent Collection "representative of modern international Art, including the "work of living man. The  Question has been discussed "between him Lord Curzon and I understand that Lord "Curzon has Suggested that the Lane Exhibition in London "might be the starting point of a movement to this end. "It Is possible that an appeal may be made to the pubilc "?or Funds and that in time we may have an international "Gallery worthy of London."

10. On the 27th September 1913 Sir Hugh Lane withdrew the ?9  French pictures from Dublin (the Provisional Gift referred to in paragraphs 3, 4 and 7) and thoroupon deposited them with the national Gallery, London, in accordance with his offer of the 27th July 1913.

11. On the 3rd October 1913 Sir Hugh Lane executed his will specifically bequeathing the group of the 39 French pictures lent by him to tho London National Gallery "to "bound ?collection of Modern Continental Art in London." by this Will he also bequeathed the residue of a11 his property not specifically bequeathed "to the National Gallery  of "Ireland instead ? to the Dublin Modern Art Gallery which I "considered so important or the founding of an Irish School "of ?inting, to be invested and the income to be spent on "buying pictures of deceased pointers of established merit. I "hope that this alteration from the Modern Gallery to the National  Gallery (of Ireland) will be remembered by the Dublin "Municipality and others as an example of its want of public "spirit in the year 1913 and for the ?olly of such bodies "assuming to decide on questions of Art, instead of relying " upon export opinion."


12. On 12th November-1913 Sir jIughJLane wrote, to LadyGregory &quot;You jviva me too much-credit for my-intojotlon-i;owaxds&apos;,&apos;&apos;&apos;*&quot; Dublin.     I hate the olacov the people and the Gallery ......I don&apos;t think that I will ever bring back those same pictures, ;.&apos; s I could best work up a fresh interest (to myself and Dublin) by moving a fresh Collection.&quot;13. &apos;      &apos; On 20th&apos; January 1914 a final Meeting of tho Mansion tie use Committee for the Municipal Art Gallery took place in Dublin at which it was placed,on record that the project which would have done so much to ennoble the city had had to be abandoned and the subscriptions which had been&apos;collected to supplement tha expected Mu icipsl contribution were thereupon returned.14.   -      On the 15th January^1914 tha -Trustees of the Rational Gallery in accordance with their practice in tho ease of Loans to the national Gallery, and to avoid the offering of Loans with a view to subsequent early sale by the lender, enquired of -Sir Hugh Lane what his :intentions were in regard to the pictures and proposed exhibiting only a portion of those deposited with them,   Cn the 12th February Sir Hugh Lane-replied objecting to the exhibition of a portion only and refuse.aing to give any pledge as to their future destination, but added.-&quot;    If I thought tnst the giving of the Colleotion to &quot;London would mean-&apos; trio t- stops wore taken to ores to a &quot;Gallery for Modern Continental. Art, which I feel is a &quot;crying want, Ishoold bo greatly&apos;tempted to give them, &quot;but I refuse any definite promiso as I do not intend &quot;to -ct hastily.&quot;15. On the 2nd March&apos; 1914 a number- of personal&apos; friends ofSir Hugh Lane including Mr. d.s.c.MncCc!Il. Mr. C. Altkan (the then Zeeper and now Director of the late Gallery) and Mr. Robert 1:/itt met at Sir Hugh If no&apos;1 s house.     The whole matter-w-.s discussed ond it was arranged tnat he should propose an exhibition of the pictures at the I&apos;-to Gallery.     This proposal was: subse-quently made and discussed between Lord&quot; Curzon, Mr. .D-.S.Mao Coll and oir Hugh Lano,ond&apos;uix Hugh Lane expressed himself as willing to stand- by the statement quoted in paragraph 14.   He also informed Mr. MaeColl that tho Gallery, if it were obtained for London, would decide him in favour of London.      ,16. Just -bout this time. March 1914, Sir Hugh lano wasappointed DIroetor o2 the Dublin national Gallery.17. On 6 th May-IV14-Mr. Mac Co 11 be : an negotiations withMr. Joseph Duveon (now air Joseph Duveen): In re. ---id to the presentation-b;o him:of a Cillery of Modern Poreign Art for London ;nd on the&apos;-7th May informed Sir Hugh Lane tnat there&quot; was a good prospect of the Gallery being secured for London.18 r to os were- taaen during -May and June 1914 by Mr.Altaen to - ore ..are-foi&apos; the Exhibition&apos; of the pictures at the Tote Gallery;   Owin^&apos; to the feet--&apos;.that the rate Gallery proper w.v&apos;S. by the terms of its gift, specifically sot aside for pictures of the British School it was thought desirable to exhibit the&apos; French pictures in the new Turner Galleries presented in 1908 by the late -Mr, Imvoen - nc therefore -outside tho te firms of the Tate Gift,   accordingly in June 1914 Mr. Alton communieat id- with Mr. Joseph Duveon, the eldest son. and - one of the executors, to obtain ais permission and informed Mr. Joseah Duveon of tho naturo of the --icturns, of their serving as a possible nucleus for-&apos;a -collection&apos;of - modern foreign Art, end of the urgent need of a Gallery in London for tho proper

Sir Hugh.

On the 3rd February 1915 Sir Hugh lane appears5according to its date, to have executed the Codicil in question. His sister, Mis. Shine, pteles (Dublin e.c.^orsndurn p.7) that he had on two previous occasions boon warned that; a testamentary disposition to- be valid must be wiitnesseeU22. On the 24th March 1915 Sir Hugh. la^a had a conversationwith Mr. D*SoMacColl and made no mention of any change of his intentions or of the understanding he had had with him, as mentioned in paragraph &apos;15.23. At the end of March 1915 he, Sir Kftgh Lane, had acon arsation with Mr. Aitxcn at the Tate Gallery at which the subject of the destination of the French pictures was definitely raised.    Mr. Aitxen as a result.of what had been stated to Mr. MacColl by Mr. Joseph Duveen informed Sir Hugh Lano that the prospects for both the Exhibition i t the Tate Gallery and for the provision of a Gall ;ry in London for the permanent exhibition&apos;of the pictures wore aood and.Sir Hugh Lane stated taat he would wait for the result of the negotiations tnd finally decide according to the.treatment he roeeived from the authorities of London and Dublin respectively&quot;.24c On the 8th jfcril 1915 Sir Hugh lene sailed forAmerica *nd an the 7th May 1915,He was drowned when roturnihg on board the Lusitynia.25.        In the latter part.of.1916&apos; Mr. Joseph Duveen learned of the bequest by Sir 3u h Lane of the 39 French piotures to the London National Gallery and lie accordingly determined that as the necessary nuclei Of modern foreign pictures to require a Gallery had been bequeathed by ;ir Hugh Lane he would himself carry out the iftca that hed been in his mind since Juno 1914 and connlete the gift by presenting a Modern Foreign Gallery in which tbay could bo worthily1 exhibited. In May 1916 he came over to ::n6lgnd to moke the offer which, was accepted by the ^oteinment.      The plans for the new Gallery which is&quot;to adjoiil the existing !Hte Gdlery at Millbahk have b:-en prepared and the oreotion of the. Gallery1 only awaits the resumption of building operations by the Offioe of ;rorks.   Mr. Josoph Duvoen considered that tiore., oould be ho doubt as to the duo carrying out of the lecal effect of Sir Hu&amp;h Lano&apos;s boquest of the j/iotures to the Notional Gallery and would not havo made, such offer but for the fact of the bequest ef tho pictures under the   111 of Sir HUe-h Lane.
26. On the 15th November 1915 the Lords Commissioners ofHis Majesty&apos;s Treasury informed the Trustees of the National Gallery, London that the Treasury Solicitor had been instructed to render them assistance in the legalprooeadoVngg whjLch might arise in- connection with the construction of the Will tt Sir Hugh Lane and that they were gratified to learn there was still e possibility of securing- for the nation important examples of the French School and of thus adding to the representative character of the National Gallery in a direction where there was considerable scope for improvement.27i On the 1st December 1916 in their reply to a letterfrom Lady Gregory; representing Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s family and the claim of the Lublin Corporation^ the Trustees of the National Gallery suggested the possibility of a loan of some of the pictures to Dublin and intimated their desire to respond favourably to&apos;any request for such a loan.28. (       On the aiat March 1917 the Chancellor of t e Exchequer answering Mr. Byrne in th* House of Commons stated that he was -infowned it could not be assumed as certain that the un* witnessed Codicil represented the.final intention of the Teatstor and that he had no authority to ask the Trustees of the National Gallery to relinquish their small portion of Sir . Hugh Lane 8 Collection which was definitely bequeathed V. them.29..        froeoedings having been commenced by the Exeoutors of the Will for the determination of certain questions whioh arose as to the oonatruction of the Till of Sir Hugh Lane on the 25th May 1917 an Order of the High Court of Justice in the matter of the Estate of Hugh Lane deceased; directed the Executors of the fill to deliver over the 39:pictures ia question to the Trustees of the National Gallery, ,&apos;Londun. .30, On the 18th  March. 1918 the Trustees of tho national gallery in reply to a letter from the Secretary of the /Wane P?. craves Sommittee, Dublin, referred to their letter of tiio lsv, :./&apos;ooember 1916 and Enquired whether an arrangement b-;r whioh the nan/tunes would bo exhibited by agreement in London and Dub j An for the benefit of both would in all the oirouiustances of nhe case be agreeable and 3eem reasonable to that /Committee-To neither of their letters of the 1st December 1916 or the 18th March 1918 suggesting such an arrangement have they, received any reply.
TO 3IR HUGH LAF?*f5 LAST WI&amp;OT, .?As regards gir Hu;?h Lane&apos; a last wishes the weight of evidence appears to the Trustees of the London National Gallery to he overwhelmingly&quot; in favour of the view that he intended to benefit Dublin only if London also failed as Dublin had already failed to carry out the dominant idea of his whole scheme, via. the provision of a permanent Gallery in which to exhibit the picture;;?.   The provision of such a Gallery in London was, at the time of the   Codicil, under negotiation and-Sir Hugh Lane v**.*3 aware of the fact.   But having had his offers finally , rejected in Dublin he was anxious that the same fate&apos;should not befall these particular piotures in London.He was therefore keeping the question-of their ultimate destination. London or Dublin, open until he knew whether the pending negotiations for the new London Gallery would be completed.&apos;His original idea had &quot;fyeen to benefit Ireland but as regards the pictures in question, which he had always referred to as his &quot;Provisional Gift&quot; he was, to use his.own words &quot;so completely disillusioned&quot; about Ireland by the treatment he received there and by the final and definite refusal of Dublin to provide a Gallery to exhibit-his gift that after consultation with his friends in London he decided to sive , Loncon the opportunity&apos;which Dublin had rejected.As the result of discussions with Mr. Aitxen, Mr. MacColl, Mr. Witt and others of his friends in London he had already become keenly interested in the founding of a collection of Modem Continental Art in London and in the prospeot of a speoial and permanent Gallery bein^ Isuilt there in which to exhibit them.   He thereupon made his will, in that sense and informed M?%. Ait?ren that he had done so.   Then, difficulties having arisen with the London Rational Gallery as to the exhibition of all the 39 pictures and as to a pledge of the-tr-----future destination, he again approached Mr. MacColl and - Mr..-.-Aitxen and told them that he would wait and see what apprecia-tion of them was she - n in London, the test to be the provision of a Gallery which was in course of negotiation with a number of possible donors.   He also told Mr. Aitken about two months after the execution, of the Codicil.and just before leaving lor America that he intended to alter his Y/ill in favour of Dublin if the- London authorities refused to&apos; exhibit the pictures and Mr.-Aitken told him that there was every prospect of their bcin^ exhibited very shortly at the Tate Gallery and of a permanent Gallery bein;; provided.   Further in writing to Lady Gr^ory he mentioned the improbability of ever?  ;iving Dublin the collection of 39 pictures lent to the Lonaon National Gallerv though he hinted at the possibility of another Collection to be made by him in the future, and it was no doubt with this in his mind that hr bequeathed the whole of the residue of hie vcrv valuable property to the Dublin FationoL Gallery.&quot;B&quot;
It must be borne in mind that sir Hugh Lane was pormamnt-ly resident in London since his early childhood and even after his appointment as Director of the Dublin National Gallery he not only refused to take up.hi a residence in Dublin but spent most of his time at his only residence and home in Chelsea while he also contemplated the purchase of a country house in England.   Further it must be remembered, that his interests were no means exclusively Irish or with Ireland.   In South Africa both Johannesburg and Cape Torn owe much to the collections he formed for them.The suggestion in the Irish Memorandum that his. Will was the result of momentary irritation with Dublin is -contrary to the facts.   Indeed he contemplated selling the.whole, collection and was supported in this iuea by Lady Gregory herself,   ^ven before the rejection of his gift by Dublin he was doubtful of how they would be treated.   &quot;I feel sure that the pictures will eventually be put in a cellar&quot; he wrote, and in 1912 he wrote of Ireland as &quot;this horrible country where one can only collect advice&quot;.Tha Statutory Declarations of Mr. Aitken, Mr. MacColl, : Mr, Witt and Mr. Duveen which will be found in Appendix I seem to show conclusively :-1. That the three first mentioned were in his confidence and. were consulted by him on his difficulties in , Ireland and in London.2. That he informed1 Mr. Aitken of the terms of his 7/ill about the time he made it.3. That he discussed with them and others at various times up to his departure for America in April 1915, his great desire that his bequest should form a nucleus of &quot;A Collection of Modern Continental Art in London&quot; and be exhibited in a new Gallery specially erected to contain it.40 That he was informed of the position of the negotia-tions for the presentation of such a Gallery and approved r-f them.5. That he gave assurances to Mr. MacColl to the effectthat he would stand by the statement contained inhis letter of 12th February 1914 to the National Gallery.6. That he informed Mr. MacColl that if the GalleryWere obtained for London it would, decide him in favour ofthe pictures going to London.7. That on the 24th March 1915, viz., after the execu-tion of the Codicil he hau a conversation&apos;with Mr. Macuoll at which he mo.de no mention of any change in his intentions or in the understanding he had with him.8. That at the end of March 1915 Sir Hugh Lane went to sec Mr, Aitken at the Tate Gallery and discussed with him the destination of the French pictures.   That Mr. Aitken as a result of his correspondence with Mr. Joseph Duveen &amp;nd of Hr   Duy^en&apos;s conversation with Mr. MacColl informed Sir Hugh Lane that the prospects for &apos; both the exhibition of the pictures at the Tate Gallery and for the provision of a Gallery in London were good .   and that Sir Hugh Lane stated that he would v;ait for
4 AHthe result &apos;ef the negctiations and finally decide acc rding tc the treatment he received from the authorities of London md Dublin respectively.9.     That Mr. Aitken communicated t--. Mr. Joseph Duveen in June 1914 the desirability of exhibiting the French pictures in the Turner Galleries of the Tate Gallery, the iexipojrt&amp;nce of creating a Gallery of Modern Foreign Art, the atri^us gap in London owing to the absence .f such a Gallery, and that th-e. Lane French pictures would make an admirable nucleus jf such a Modern Foreign Collection.   That as a result cf this discussion Mr. Joseph Duveen began t   consider the presenta-ti n :f such a Gallery in which&apos; to exhibit the pictures and subsequently on hearing of their bequest to the National Gallery, London, decided in consequence to present a Modern Foreign Gallery for their reception which he has since done. That Mr. Duveert wmld not have made the gift of the Gallery t) i,rnd.n but for the bequest of the pictures to the National Gallery.(1.0)

(See Appendix 2.)

The London Modern Foreign Gallery was promised bySir Joseph Duveen mainly as a result of the bequest of the pictures, to the London National Gallery, in Sir Hugh Lane s words &quot;to found a Collection of modern continental Art in &quot;London&quot;,, and it would be a breach of faith with the donor&quot; of tho Gallery to remove the pictures which were the main ground of its gift.4*. Most of the painters represented In the Collectionof 39 pictures are already represented in the Corporation Gallery in Dublin...

S..MAC COLL., I was a friend of Sir Hugh Lano from the tine when he began to form the Dublin Collection. , Ho came to ran for advice and help in hir, struggle with tho opposition to hie project in Dublin, and I gave him my warm support both privately and publicly up to the final rupture of negotiations with the Corporation in 1913-   ^ven then I considered that the loan of tho &quot;provisional gift&quot; to the National Gallery in London might load to a revival of Lo.no&apos;s bridge-gallnry scheme in Xublin..   But difficulties arose over the loan-exhibition in London, and tthrsre.was imminent danger that the &quot;provisional gift&quot; pictures would be lost hot only.to Dublin but to the country generallyi   Lano came to see me immediately on his return from America in February 1914, and told mo he had it in his mind to sell the pictures,, so as to prove their value to the authorities both in Dublin and in&apos;London.   It vac to prevent this that I and other friends persuaded Sir Hugh Lane to offer an exhibition of the pictures at the Tato Gallery, and urged that he. should make them the nucleus of a Modern Foreign Gallery frr London.   VTe met him, by. his invitation,   on March 2nd, 191a-; and on March 4th., as the result of that meeting, I saw Lord curzon with reference to the Tate Gallery proposal,   lie was favourable to this, but anxious to have a definite statement *f Lane&apos;s intentions as to the future of tho pictures,   I -saw Lane afterwards nn this point,   He refused to give any absolute pledge, but authorised me to say that he ,rould stand by the statement contained in his letter of the 12th February 1914 to tho Hationol Gallery viz,i.&quot;     If I thought the giving of tho Collection to London &quot;would moan that stops &quot;-ere taken to create a Gallery for &quot;modern Continental Art, T&quot;hich I feel i3 a crying want, i &quot;should bo greatly tempted to give them but I refused any &quot;definite promise as I do not intend to act hastily.&quot;and ho gave me privately to understand that if a Gallery were obtained this would decide him in favour of the pictures going to London,On Kay 6th 1914 Mr. Joseph Duvoon was in London and I oa&quot;r him on tho subject,   &quot;/hen the Turner wing presented by his father was opened, he had expressed to mo the ^ish to bo informed if thore was any question of further extending the Gallery, and I now put to him the case for a modern foreign section, with the Lane pictures as a probable nucleus..   He was well disposed to tho 3cheme, but spoke of consulting one or two friends before deciding.   I caw Lane next day and told him there were good prospects of a Gallery, and he wan much pleased toy the news.   Mr. Aitken afterwards went further into the matter with Mr, Puveen, but the Suffragette outbreak delayed the exhibition, and the war deferred it further and for the moment interfered &apos;*&apos;ith Mr. Duveen&apos;s plans.Lane knew that the project was only in abeyance, and I and others interested sa*-- him on the very eve of his departure for America oh his last visit.     He gave us no hint whatever of&apos;a change of mind, and knowing the man as I did, I do not believe that he would have withdrawn from an understanding such as he had entered into, so as to leave us in the lurch.
- 13 -.The bequest of the pictures&apos;to the Natiohal GallBiyma.de-it desirable that our part of the understanding&apos; should be carried out, and I reopened negotiations with Mr. Duveen by writing to him on the l6th June 1916 and asked that if he should be able and willing to carry out his intention of two years earlier.he would put himself in communication with Lord d&apos;Abernon, one of the newly, appointed Trustees of the Tate Gallery.    Mr. Duveen shortly afterwards&apos; came to England and by his- generosity-tho Gallery,was scoured.It seems to me therefore that the moral olaim of the national Gallery to the pictures, as well as their legal claim, is complete.    /From my personal acquaintance with Lane, from the part I played in negotiations with him and others, and from the knowledge I gained of the successive phases of the Dublin affair, when I went through Lane&apos;s papers and correspondence with a view to writing his life, I may perhaps claim to be in a position of advantage for interpreting his attitude when he drew up the codicil.     In my judgment his appointmont as Director of the Dublin National Gallery had modified his views to the extent that ho contemplated once more giving tho pictures to Dublin if the Tale Gallery scheme Bhould fall through.     By his interview With Mr. Aitken at a later date is sufficient proof that the codicil represented not his final decision but an alternative, and I do noc for a moment believe that he would have withdrawn from hie understanding with us unless tho prospect of a Gallery had become remote.   He would very likely, as ho indicated, have acquired another Collect ion for Lublin, but the &quot;provisional gift&quot; was still an offer to us subject to the condition I havo rimed.
( b)STATUTORY DF.CLARATI ON BY MR 0HARL5S AITKSN, DIRECTOR OF TIB aATJO^Ii GALS &apos;BRY OF BRITISHDuring tho winter of 1913, Sir Hugh Lano came to sec mo on-several occasions .at the Tate Gallery, and told me of the roj-ec-tion of his pictures by Dublin and its final refusal to build the Gallery he demanded for them and ho told me that he had made a Will bequeathing the 39 modern French&apos; pictures to tho London National Gallery.   I was, I believe, entirely in his confidence in regard to this matter.   Later on in 19i4, when difficulties had arisen in London over the exhibition of the pictures at the National Gallery, he told ne that he intended altering his vTill in favour of -Dublin if the pictures &quot;&apos;ore hot to be exhibited in London.I had meanwhile been trying to arrange for their being ox-hibited at tho Tate Gallery and had in June 1914- communicated with Mr. Joseph Duyeen as to their being shown in the Turner Galleries and also a-s to the provision of a now Gell-ry in which to exhibit the Lane pictures, and I told Sir Hugh Lane in 1914--that wc hoped to show his pictures at the Tatc Gallery and to secure a Gallery .be.retraining built to receive them.   All the necessary arrangements had been made and thoy would have boonex-hibitod there in 1914, but for the Suffragette attacks and then the war, which d&amp;ayod the carrying out of the arrangements.   &apos;Sir Hugh Lane knew  ho reasons for the delay and approved of tho postponement.   I also kept him in touch throughout the latter part of 1914 and tho beginning ef 1915 with the course of our negotiations for.the provision of a Gallery.   At the end of March 1915. only a few days before he sailed for America, he called upon mo at the Tate Gallery and I told him that I was glad to be able to say that there was every prospect of the pictures being exhibited very shortly at Mill-bank and of a permanent Gallery being provided.   Ho expressed satisfaction and said that If these plans were carried out he should decide the ultimate destination ef that group of pictures according to the action of tho authorities in Dublin and London respectively&apos;.It is 4entirely incorrect.&apos;fc say that Sir,.Hugh Lane^ irritation with Dublin was momentary:, . Until there Was the delay in exhibiting the pictures in London In 1914 he entirely -accepted the iftoa, of their remaining permanently in London, From conversations I had..with him I know that the idea of a Modern Foreign Gallery for tho Art of the Allied Nations fight-ing side by side, with the British Empire appealed to his imagination and he was far from, averse to the idea that a small portion qf his whole Collection of pictures should be connected with such a permanent. Collection of the works ef French artists in London.* ..14, r
STATUTORY DECLARATION BY MR. ROBERT WITT.;.I hod known Sir Hugh Lane; for somcJ years and was one of those who were consulted by him over his difficulties in &apos;  -Dublin and in London in connection with the exhibition of hia Collection of French pictures.At the end of 1913 an.  beginning of 1914 I had no official position at the National. Ballery but &quot;had acted as Honorary .&apos; Secretary to&apos; a Committee&apos;oi Trustees-which had investigated from 1911 to 1913 various matters connected with the National Art Collections and had reported on 13th December 1913 (inter alia) that the formation of a Gallery of modern pictures and sculpture was a matter of urgent importance and that the nation was suffering in that until a suitable Gallery was provided theCollection was not likely to grow and that a suitable Gallery was not likely to be provided until there was an important Collection which needed to be housed-Sir Hugh Lane had told me of Dublin&apos;s refusal to build a Gallery on the conditions he thought he was fully justified in Imposihg and I told him of what the Committee was recommending in regard to. a Gallery of modern foreign Art in London.    He told me that, he was deeply -interested in the scheme of a newpermanent Gallery for London and that he was anxious for his French pictures to be well shown in London eiih/j&quot; at the National Gallery or the Tate&apos; GalleryHe gcf/l me to ur/ler-stand on several occasions in 1914 that his jcench picturea should serve  -s a nucleus for the London Gallery if it w-roe provided.     I told him that those specially interested in the National Gallery and in the rational Art-CollectionB Fund,in the work of Which he was&apos; interested, were in negotiation with several possible donors for the provision of a Gallery and even in 1914 we thought we had succeeded in securing one.The last occasion on which I saw Sir Hugh Lane was on the 26th March 1915 when he came to see me and he made no suggestion that his intention to benefit London if he could secure a Gallery there for his French pictures had been in any way , modified.     From what I know of him I feel confident that had he definitely decided to alter his disposition in favour of London in view of all our discussions as to the London Gallery he would have told me so   and that he had greater expectation, :, of London providing a Gallery than Dublin.-15-
STATUTORY DECLARATION BY SIR JOSEPH DUVEEN.

On the 6th May 1914 ? an interview with Mr. D.

S. MacColl at the Wallace Collection. ?, and discussed with him the suggestion of my presenting a Gallery of Modern Foreign Art for London.

In June 1914 I received a letter from Mr. C. Aitken, Keeper of the Tate Gallery, calling my attention to the Hugh Lane Collection of French pictures which were then in London on loan to the National Gallery. He mentioned that he thought there was no doubt that Sir Hugh Lane meant to present the Collection to some public Gallery and that as I was aware that the obtaining of a Gallery of Modern Foreign Art was being discussed and that the absence of such a Gallery left a serious gap in London he thought that the exhibition of the pictures in question would call attention to the good of such a Gallery in London. He mentioned a number of ? pictures and pointed out to me that this Collection was a better nucleus of a foreign modern collection than could easily be obtained then. He proceeded to enquire whether, as my father&apos;s executor. I would consent to their being exhibited in one of the Turner Gallaries presented to the Tate by my father, and pointed out that if I did so if might largely contribute to the obtaining of the foreign modern Gallery which was so much needed.

I promised him to give the matter my most serious consideration. After considering the matter I consented to their exhibition in the Galleries presented by my father.

I became very much impressed by the necessity for providing a suitable Gallery in London for these Lane pictures and of treating them as a nucleus of a collection of modern foreign pictures and I told Mr. Aitken I was considering the question of presenting such a Gallery.

In the early part of 1915 I received from Mr. Witt the Report of the Committee of the Trustees of the National Gallery published as a Blue ?ook in which the need for such a Gallery was strongly urged. I was particularly impressed with the following passage in the Report?-

"An examination of the position shows that the nation "is at present suffering in two ways. No funds are "?onsidered to be available for the purchase of modern "foreign pictures and at the same time donors and "testators are deterred from contributing them to the "National collections owing to there being no obviously "suitable place in which they can be shown".

and in consequence I gave the matter of presenting such a Gallery further consideration.

In May 1915 I heard of the death of Sir Hugh Lane and towards the and of 1915 that he had bequeathed his collection of modern French pictures, of which I had heard from Mr. Aitken in June 1914, to the London National Gallery. I was at the time in service but I at once decided that as the French pictures had not been definitely bequeathed to the London National Gallery by Sir Hugh Lane ?as Mr. Aitken had told me in 1914 would probably be the case ? and that there was no suitable Gallery in which to hang them the moment had come for me to come forward and to, present the Gallery in which they could be worthily exhibited. The dilemma of the nation, indicated in the Trustees&apos; Report, had been "No pictures because no Gallery. Now that Sir Hugh Lane had provided the pictures I determined that it was for me to provide the Gallery. I began to make the necessary preparations accordingly and made the formal offer of the Gallery. This of ? was accepted, the plans have been  
approved   nd tho orooti&amp;n of the (tollsry only aw.\itti the resumption of building operations by the Office -ef Works.I should not have offered tho London Gs11ery to the nation but for the :ivct tnat tho La no modern French pictures had been bequeathed to London and that there woe no aid table Gallery in which to bari  thornt and in ma^inr; my tift I was primarily influenced by the fact that in tho Lane Frenoh pictures tho nucleus of a modern forexapa Gallery had at.last been provided. If the pictures should bo transferred by Parliament from London to Dublin I consider that I should have tho right of rooon-sidaring the terms of my &amp;ift of the Gallery.
\a rc^rds the attitude of the Dublin Corporation and of the Dublin public, which according to the Memorandum ib now unajiimous in favour of the transfer of the pictures to Dublin, it is impo.rtr.nt to note that since the removal from I r el a? id of the 39 pictures by: sir Hugh lanet. on the S7th September 2&apos;&apos;:.Z after the final rejection of his offer, by the Dublin Corpo*.cv tion on the 8th September 1913 and right down to the date of the publication of the terms of hie V&apos;ill in June 1915 no desire whatever has been expressed by the Dublin Corporation or by the Dublin public to have the pictures restored to them and no steps whatever have been taken by the Dublin Corporation to reverse their decision refusing to erect the permanent Gallery on the conditions imposed by sir Hugh Lane:-.In the Irish Memorandum reference is made to Resolutions *f the Dublin Corporation of 2oth January 1913 and of 2nd September 1916 as evidence of a decision to provide a Gallery-. The Resolutions are in point of fact to the opposite effect&apos;. . ^ir Hugh Lances offer of the pictures was. made upon the express conditions that the Corporation should provide a permanent Gallery upon a site and to a design of vhioh he-approved.The Dublin corporation&apos;a Resolution of 20th January 1913 was, as will be1 seen from its term a, itself conditional upon tho public.providing not only the site for such Gallery but about one seventh Of the estimated, cost of erecting the Gallery itself.   That in to say, that it not.only refused to provide the site, which in the circumstances would, of course, have involved a large proportion of the total cost, but even refused to provide the whole of the- cost of Action.subsequently&quot;oh the 8th September 1913 their refusal to accept sir &quot;ijurjtv i.ane* s conditions as. regards the site tod design of the Gallery was finally recorded by the Resolution of the Corporation, the public subscriptions that had been collected were returned and the pictures were withdrawn by Sir Hugh Lane from Ireland.On the 2nd September 191/&apos;?, that, is, over three years after the publication of the &quot;ill bequeathing the 39 pictures to London, the Dublin Corporation passed the Resolution &quot;That thfc Council reaffirms its previous decision to provide a Gallery for the HUJjh Lane pictures provided they were ebtained for the city of Dublin&quot;* and in the Irish Memorandum it is explai ed that wtheprevious decision &quot;was the Resolution of the 20th January 1913. *It.is clear, therefore, that at&apos;no time- whatever hau the Dublin Corporation ever agreed &quot;to provide a Gallery&quot;, that they had throughout ignored and repudiated Sir Hu,^h Lane&apos;a conditions, and that the, Resolution of the 2nd, 3optember 1918 suppresses all reference to&apos;.the Resolution of the Bth September 1913 in which 3ir Hu,*h Lane^s offer and his conditions were finally. refused and rejected.   Yet, these&apos;facts are now put forward in the Memorandum to support .the contention that the Dublin C6rporation has shorn itself ready and willing t* accept Sir Hush Lane&apos;s offer and conditions by providing a Gallery.finally it is to be noted that while Dublin ignored Sir Hu-;h Lane&apos;s withdrawal cf his pictures, on the 27th September 1913 an,, the Dublin Mansion House Committee abandoned its iuea of a Gall cry on the 20 th January 1914, it was only when the announcemcnt of his bequest to London had been made in June 1915 that/the claim,..;.s of Dublin to the pictures be^an to be put forward-.
Tho signatories to - the letter of tht* 7th February 1917 in support of&apos; tho Irish claim contend that &quot;some of tho (Lane) &quot;pictures going to. London&apos;&apos;:an&apos;d some remain-iris in&apos; Dublin would.&apos;&apos; &quot;loss on&apos; the valu;-&apos; of tho whole to artist and student alike.1&apos; It is impossible to -accept&apos; this- view.   Of tho 4^0 pictures collected or presented -by Sir Hugh Lane the Dublin Iluhlcipal Collection consists-of about 300&apos; modern works as against the&quot; 39 bequeathed to London,     It further &quot;includes pictures or drawings by the majority of&apos;the loading French rasters represented in tho bequest to-London.  , Indeed there are fo&quot;&apos; Collections so widely representative of-French&apos; Art as that obtained by Sir Hugh Lane for Dublin,&apos; containing as it dees, representatives of tho following modern French painters: Millet, Corot, Troyon, Diaz, Boudin, I!onticolli,.Harpignios, Fmtin-Latour, Daumier,. Puvis do Chavannes, Rodini Degas, : lionet, Blanche, Cot tot; and tho Italians Legant in i and. Ilancini, The Collection bequeathed to London consists only of 39 pictures.- 19 -
THE VALUE AND PROPORTION OF THE 39 FRENCH PICTURES Bi^UX&amp;JEED TC THE LONDON NATIONAL GALLERY IN DELATION TO SIR HUGH LABlS OTHER REQUESTS UNDER HIS WILL.The 39 pictures in question were valued for probate purposes at  11710.Apart from these Sir Hugh Lane had before his death already presented to or obtained for the Dublin Corporation the large number of pictures and drawings by modern artists including those presented by or purchased from the signatories to the letter of 7th February 1917 (Dublin Memorandum. App. IV p. 19). It is not the case, as seems to be suggested in that letter, that the pictures were all presented by the signatories. Some were sold by them to Sir Hugh Lane and presented by him.At the time of his death, apart from the le.rge number of pictures presented to Dublin during his life, Sir&quot;Hugh Lane still possessed t-lv     The&apos; Collection of modern English pictures lent to Belfast.2,v    Various English pictures in his London house,3,     The Collection of pictures by Old Masters in his London house.     Of the.se the National Gallery of Ireland has elected to take about/40 of the finest and most valuable.4,     The 39 French pictures in question.AH of these, except the 39 pictures passed under his Will to the National Gallery of Dublin as the- Residuary Legatee, not only of his pi ocures- but of his other very valuable estate.As a result, therefore, of the provisions of Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s Will Dublin has,, through the Dublin National Gallery, and the Dublin Gallery cf Modern Art received(a) A large number of pictures, drawings and sculptures of all Schools (including the French) the value of which cannot be less than  60,000, and is probably greater.(b) A sum of about  26,000 in cash, &quot;to be&apos; spent on &quot;buying pictures of deceased painters of&apos; established -&quot;merit.&quot;The value of the 39 pictures in question is, therefore, less than one seventh of the pictures and estate which have passed to Dublin under his Will.
