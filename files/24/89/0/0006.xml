General Staff. -   - -Winston S. Churchill.23rd September, 1919.4-I. Minute by the General Staff.1. The Secretary of State should see this very remarkable narrative of&apos;the 17th Armoured Car Battalions operations in France last year.2. You will remember that in some quarters there has been a tendency to disparage the value of these weapons, notably in the Bird Committee. Such criticism is completely refuted by the brilliant achievements of this improvised unit, the officers and men of which are entitled to the highest credit for their dash and determination.3. It is to he noted that these results were obtained in so-called trench warfare, that is when there was no open flank to manoeuvre round. Imagine the possibilities of half-a-dozen such units boldly handled in conjunction with light tanks and a cavalry force where there is an open flank ! What havoc could they not have played on our left flank during the retreat from Mons had the Germans been liberally provided with these engines and had the pluck and skill shown by these boys of the 17th Battalion.4. In all Eastern theatres the value of these cars is constantly being brought to notice, while for internal troubles and industrial &quot;unrest&quot; they are an admirable specific5. To sum up, it may confidently be said that there is no better value for money to be obtained in any military expenditure than in the provision of armoured cars.II. Operations of the 17th Tank Armoured Car Battalion.In March, 1918, the 17th Tank Battalion was in process of formation at the Tank Training Centre at Wool, when the German Spring offensive resulted in so great a demand being made on the home resources, that it was converted into an armoured car battalion on the 23rd April. On the following day the drivers were selected and 18 armoured cars, which had been earmarked for  he Eastern theatre of war, were handed over to it, the Tickers machine guns.being replaced by Hotchkiss ones.On the 28th April, the cars were embarked at Portsmouth and on the 29th the personnel, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel E. J. Carter, D.S.O., left Folkestone for Boulogne. Thus in 6 days the whole battalion was formed, equipped and landed in France.Immediately on landing the 17th Battalion was attached to the Second Army and ordered to proceed to Poperinghe, but- the tactical situation improving, the battalion proceeded first to the Tank Gunnery School at Merlimont and later to the Tank Dep6t at Mers for instruction.After some 10 days&apos; training the 17th Battalion joined the Fourth Army and went into the line at La Hussoye, being attached to the Australian Corps. A few days later the battalion was transferred to the XXIInd Corps, which was then resting in General Headquarters reserve immediately behind the right flank of the British Army, and battalion headquarters were established at Pissy. Here, training continued until the 10th June, when at 9.30 a.m. instructions were received by Lieut.-Colonel Carter to report to the headquarters of the First French Army at Cbnty..(B19/428)   70   9/39  H&amp;S  7512wo
At Conty orders were issued for the battalion to proceed to Ravenel, near St. Just. The battalion was notified of this by telephone and although the night was very dark and wet and the roads crowded with traffic it reached Ravenel, after a GO miles journey, by 5 a.m., on the 11th June and went into action with the Tenth French Army in its counter-attack at Belloy on that date, In this battle two sections of armoured cars engaged the enemy with machine-gun fire but the quantity of debris scattered on the roads and the fragile nature of the chassis of the cars prevented their being freely used. On the conclusion of these operations the battalion returned to the XXIInd Corps.On the 18th July, the 17th Battalion was ordered to join General FayohVs Army, but did not come into action *on account of delays en route due to congested traffic. Ten days later it was attached to the 6th French Cavalry Division which was operating north of Chateau Thierry folio wing the retreating enemy towards the River Ourcq. On this river the Germans took up a defensive position covering its approaches by machine-gun fire; this brought the French cavalry to a halt, but not the armoured cars, which were able, on account of their armour, to approach quite close to the bridges and open fire on the enemy&apos;s machine gunners. At Fere en Tardenois the battalion greatly aided the French by moving through the main streets of the village which was held by Germans, similar assistance was rendered to the Americans at Roncheres.When the 6th French Cavalry Division was withdrawn to rest, the 17 fh Battalion proceeded to Senlis, and at 9 a.m., having just entered this town,it received orders to proceed forthwith to Amiens and report to the Headquarters of the Australian Corps. Amiens which was nearly 100 miles distant was reached the same night.On reaching Amiens Lieut.-Colonel Carter was informed that his. unit was to take part in the projected attack east of that town. The chief difficulty foreseen in an armoured car action in this neighbourhood was the crossing of the trenches. Although only one day was available wherein to find a solution to this difficulty, it was accomplished by attaching a small force of tanks to the battalion. These tanks were used to tow the armoured cars over the obstacles, or rather along the tracks the tank formed through them.   This solution proved eminently successful.For the Fourth Army operations the 17th Armoured Car Battalion was placed under the orders of the 5th Tank Brigade. On the morning of the 8th August the battalion moved forward with its accompanying tanks, which successfully assisted all its cars over &quot; No Man&apos;s Land.&quot; Beyond Warfusee, several large trees, felled by shell fire, had fallen across the road entirely blocking it; these were speedily removed by the towing tanks, thus clearing the road not only for the armoured cars, but for our guns and transport. After this delay the cars moved rapidly forward and passed through our attacking lines about 20 minutes before the infantry were timed to reach their final objective. To accomplish this, the cars had to run through our own artillery barrage, this they ohd without casualty.The road was now clear and the cars proceeded through the enemy&apos;s lines, scattering any infantry they found on the road, and made for the valley near Foucacourt where the headquarter troops of a German Corps were known to be encamped. These troops were completely surprised and many casualties were inflicted on. them by six cars moving through the valley. The confusion caused soon developed into a panic, the enemy scattering in all directions spreading the alarm.Whilst this surprise was developing, several sections of armoured cars turned south and north off the A miens Brie Road. The former met large columns of transport and mounted officers and teams of horses apparently belonging to the German headquarters at Framerville. These were fired on at short range, four officers being shot down by a single burst of fire. Shortly after this the German Headquarters was reached and the Australian Corps flag, which had been carried in one of the cars for the purpose, was run up over the house which until a few minutes before, had been occupied by the German Corps Commander. At about this time one car came in sight of a German train ; the engine was fired at and put out of action. Later on, the cavalry arriving, captured it.The cars which had turned northwards entered Proyart and Chuignolles, two moving up to the River Somme. At Proyart the cars found the German troops at dinner, these they shot down and scattered in all directions and then, moving westwards, met masses of the enemy driven from their trenches by the Australians. In order to surprise these men, who were moving eastwards, the cars hid in the outskirts of Proyart, and only moved forward when the enemy was between 50 and 100 yards distant, when they moved forward rapidly, shooting down great numbers. Scattering from before the cars at Proyart, the enemy made across country towards Chuignolles, only to be met&quot; by the cars which had proceeded to this village and were once again fired
on and dispersed. Near Chuignolles one armoured car obtained &quot; running practice &quot; with its machine guns at a lorry full of troops and kept up fire until the lorry ran into the ditch. There were also several cases of armoured cars following German transport vehicles, without anything unusual being suspected, until fire was opened at point blank range.Although more than half the cars were out of action by the evening of the 8th, there were no casualties amongst their: personnel sufficiently serious to require evacuation.After repairing the damages sustained on 8th August, the 17th Battalion was transferred to the First Army, and on 21st August took part in the operations near Bucquoy. At the entrance of the village a large crater had been blown in the road -over which the cars were hauled after a smooth path had been beaten down across it by a Whippet Tank. The cars then made their way through the enemy&apos;s lines and reached Achiet le Petit ahead of our infantry, where several machine guns were silenced by them. In this action two of the cars received direct hits, one of them being burnt out and destroyed.On the 24th August the battalion operated with the New Zealand Division in the attack on Bapaume ; the cars penetrated to the Arras Bapaume road where severe fighting took place.In the attack on 2nd September, the 17th Battalion operated with the Canadian Corps in the attack on the Drocourt Queant line. In this action four cars were hit by shell fire, but two squadrons of aeroplanes co-operating with the cars, attacked the German battery so vigorously that the crews of the disabled cars were able to escape being captured.On the 29th September the armoured cars operated with the Australian Corps and the Ilnd, American Corps in the attack on the Hindenburg line near Bony, here numerous casualties were inflicted on the enemy and four cars were put out of action then being burnt.   This position was captured by the Australians on the following day.On 8th October the/ armoured cars were attached to the Cavalry Corps, which was operating from Beaurevoir towards Le Cateau. On this day the cars kept touch with the cavalry, but on the following morning they moved forward through Maretz. About 2 miles beyond this village a section co-operated with South African Infantry and drove the German machine gunners from a strong position they were holding. The cars were able to run right through the hostile machine gun fire, and by enfilading the enemy&apos;s position killed the German machine gunners and captured ten machine guns and two trench mortars.A section of cars made a dash to cross the railway bridge on the Maretz Homchy road, but the enemy&apos;s demolition party saw them coming and lighting the fuze, fled. The leading car, however, got across safely, the charge exploding and blowing up the bridge immediately this car had crossed, and thereby cutting it off from the second car which was some 50 yards behind. The leading car then went through Marios and Homchy, all guns firing ; both of these villages were crowded with troops. Near Homchy church the car ran into a by-road by mistake, at the same moment a group of Germans came out of a house and the car accounted for five of them in the door-way. This incident was described with enthusiasm by a French woman, the owner -of the house, to Lieutenant-Colonel Carter on the following day. After passing Homchy the car was run towards a bridge which was known to exist. Profiting by his previous experience, the commander of the-car determined to save the bridge from demolition and so not only effect his retreat but secure it to the British Army. To accomplish this the car rapidly moved round a corner of the road leading to the bridge with its guns pointing in the direction where the demolition party would probably, be. This action proved successful, the demolition party being scattered by a burst of fire before the charge could be fired, the bridge was thus saved and proved of great importance to the British forces later on. The car then crossed the river and proceeded to the spot where the second car had been unable to cross&apos;, picked it up and then returned with its report, having accomplished a very daring and useful journey.On 4th November, the armoured cars were attached to the XVIIIth Corps and were detailed to operate with the 18th and 50th Divisions in the forest of Mormal. In this district the roads are narrow and at this time of the year were very slippery, armoured car action was therefore most difficult. On the next dav, the cars of the 17th Battalion, now much reduced in numbers, were operating with no less than five Divisions simultaneously. On the 9th, all cars were concentrated and attached to the . Fourth Army Advanced Guard to assist in the pursuit of the retiring enemy.   In the
action which followed the cars were cut off from the Advanced Guard by all the river bridges being destroyed, but in spite of this they were able to continue advancing on a line parallel to the pursuit.   ,At Ramoisies and Lessies three complete trains of ammunition were passed and numbers of heavy guns, lorries and artillery transport, the enemy being in full flight and in a high state of demoralization.On 11th November the armoured cars were reconnoitring towards Eppe, Sauvage and Moustier, near the Belgian frontier, some 7 or 8 miles in advance of the nearest British troops, when at 10.30 a.m. an officer from the 33rd French Division informed the officer in command that he had heard rumours of an armistice ; a few minutes later a despatch rider corrobated this information stating that hostilities were to cease at 11 a.m. Firing went on until about three minutes to eleven when it ceased, breaking out in a final crash at eleven o&apos;clock then all was silence ; a silence almost uncanny to the men of the 17th Tank Armoured Car Battalion who had not been out of gun shot since 17th July, when the battalion opened its eventful career with the French Army on the Marne.Dramatic as had been the short and brilliant action of the 17th Armoured Car Battalion, its work was not yet ended. On the 13th November it assembled at Avesnes and joining the cavalry of the Fourth Army moved towards the Rhine. On the 26th four sections of cars were ordered to Charleroi to deal with a reported disturbance. In this town they were received with the greatest enthusiasm by the inhabitants and at Courcelles were surrounded by excited townsfolk who having collected all available brass instruments crowded round the cars playing the British National Anthem at a range of about five yards.From Charleroi the 17 th Battalion joined the Second Army moving, on Cologne and were attached to the 1st Cavalry Division. On the 1st December the German frontier was crossed at Malmedy whence the battalion was immediately sent on with the 2nd Cavalry Brigade to deal with disturbances which had broken out in Cologne. Five days later, on the 6th, the cavalry halted outside the town and the General Officer Commanding, 2nd Cavalry Brigade, escorted by cars of the 17th Battalion, proceeded to the Rathaus to discuss the administration of the town with the Burgo-master. Cologne was entered at midday, the crews of the armoured cars being the first British troops to enter. That afternoon the western end of the Rhine bridge was occupied and the colours of the Tank Corps run up to flutter over the famous river.The record of this battalion is a truly remarkable one. It was formed, equipped and landed in France in the short space of six days. In six months it fought in ten separate battles with British, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, South African, French and American troops and was three times mentioned, in German despatches, Every car was hit and some of them many times and yet the total losses in killed in action throughout this period was only one officer and four other ranks. At the cost of these five men and seven cars totally destroyed, this battalion must have inflicted scores if not hundreds of casualties on the enemy; that the British Army was not equipped with many more of these units will be a problem which will doubtlessly perplex the minds of future military historians.
