litary Secret.This PocumeuUs the Property ofBritannic Majesty fs Government.Fr.o??( Viceroy, Army Department, io Secretary of Stale for India,7th October 1919.(Received 8th.) 13626.   7th October.   Malleson wires 4th October :-&quot;(A.) Herat. 1. Agent who has special facilities reports 28th September:  Governor of Herat received letter from Kazim Beg from Kagan. Kazim Beg states ho has left Askabad after most successful stay during which he has solidified Mahometan feeling, won.over Turkomans and ensured Persian sympathy. In Kagan he is supervising activities oC &quot; Young Bokhara &quot; party and the training of political agitators. Persia has been sold to British, but time is at hand when from north and north-west, kingdom of the foolish and deported Shah will be invaded by vast Bolshevic and pan-Islam forces and the British expelled. Afghanistan will be given large slice of Korarsan and Persian Baluchistan. Kazim Beg says he is on his way to Tashkent to meet German and Turkish friends. French gradually winning over American opinion, the recent Anglo-Persian treaty has alienated Americans who regard it as typical British Imperialism and treachery to Allies. I give you my strongest personal assurance that Bolshevics are real friends of Mahometans. I can tell you privately, but with authority, that Bolshevics arc getting ready several fleet aeroplanes and much heavy artillery for presentation to the heroic Amir A mantilla.&quot;2. My correspondent states that Governor who has throughout the last few mouths been of moderate tendency, decided not to send on letter to Kabul as it would probably only encourage extremists there.&quot; 3. Lthink account of letter is genuine.&quot; (B.) Both&apos;Bolshevics and Afghans are taking extraordinary precautions against entry of our propaganda, Nevertheless in Askabad it is popularly believed that Afghan troops have seized Kerki and Panjdeh and even Bolshevic officials are positive or apprehensive of Afghan treachery and attribute risings to Afghan machinations. Afghans on the other hand think opening of Orenburg route may lead to Bolshevic aggression in Afghanistan.&quot;(A.) has been repeated to Teheran. ^
