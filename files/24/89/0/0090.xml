The General Situation.In view of the termination of ,the railway dispute, it may be useful this week to take general stock of the resulting situation, which presents a number of points of interest and importance rather than any outstanding single feature of note. The strike has given a new emphasis to such questions as (a) standardisation of wages ; (b) administrative action in wage disputes ; (c) new features in strike policy ; (d) nationalisation ; (e) public opinion. What follows will, therefore, be devoted to a short examination of these in the light of the recent dispute and its terms of settlement, with any comment that seems required as to its future reactions in fields other than that which it directly affects.(C1899)  255  10/19  H &amp; 8 2 T
(a) Wages. In view of future problems it is possible that the present terms of settlement, while they contribute little to the general solution of the question of wage standardisation, may lead to considerable difficulties and embarrassments. When it is said that the settlement contributes little to the solution of the general problem, it is well to recall precisely what that problem is. It arises from the fact that it has now become urgently necessary to transfer the consideration of rates of Avages from what may be called the justiciable to the non-justiciable area. A justiciable dispute is one which arises over the interpretation of certain agreed principles ; a non-justiciable dispute on the other hand involves the fixing of those principles. The decision in the one case is a logical pro-cess that can easily be understood ; in the other it probably is not, The one is therefore far simpler than the other ; and accordingly during the war when people were engaged otherwise than in settling wage disputes, these came to be transferred to the justiciable area, so as to make them comparatively easy of provisional solution; that is, principles were agreed upon, and disputes henceforth became disputes as to interpretation, amenable to solution by an impartial arbitrator. But now the opposite process has to take place : the principles themselves will no longer hold* and new principles must be sought; and it is because the solution of the railway dispute brings us little nearer to the finding of such new principles that we say it has contributed little to the solution of this problem. It can only be said to have made any contribution on the assumption that there is no such new principle in the valuation of economic services rendered, so that this must simply be decided by collective bargaining. If this is so, the dispute and its settlement have at least given everyone some experience of collective bargaining under the most modern conditions and on the largest scale ; and since the assumption referred to may prove to be justified it is as well not to neglect this aspect of the matter.On the other hand, the settlement may very well have laid up considerable embarrass-ments for the forthcoming Minimum Wage Commission. Under the Bill, it is left to this &quot;Commission to decide minimum rates, together with the method of putting them into -operation. Now in both these matters as regards railwaymen the settlement is quite explicit. It may well present the Commission, therefore, with the dilemma of either /sacrificing their initiative and possibly the industrial health of the country in order to make their recommendations fit the railwaymen&apos;s minimum wage settlement or creating anomalies of a serious nature. This is a very practical matter because many grades of. railwaymen lend themselves well to economic comparison with other grades in the com-munity a fact which may have immediate effects ; but this is not.all. It is quite possible that the Commission might desire to bring into operation, apart altogether from rates, some such provision as, e.g., differentiation between localities. But in any such effort, the settlement now made might well prove a difficulty.This is not to say that the settlement achieved was not desirable or the best that could have been arrived at in the circumstances which were not such as to lend themselves to an arrangement highly satisfactory from a general point of view. It is this fact that must next engage attention.(b) Administration. The question of departmental control of wages has come up for review on a number of occasions, but the recent dispute, coupled with what is now the certainty that the Government will not cease with the termination of the war to have control as employer of wages over a very large area, strongly suggests that some satisfactory solution must be arrived at. But it is only a striking example, not an isolated one ; experience in connection with the National Joint Industrial Council and in other spheres points the same moral. Here again, what was good enough for the war period will not do in the future. The fact must be faced that no action taken with regard to wages in any par-ticular industry can be without considerable effect on other industries. That, indeed, and nothing else lay behind many of the difficulties encountered on the governmental side of the table ; and the future embarrassments referred to above are such as must arise out of the present position. Administrative action in this direction is all the more necessary inasmuch as the fact of the interdependence of wage-rates and conditions is well recognised among the workpeople&apos;s organisations, and with the creation of a body such as the Triple Alliance, a considerable step, but probably only the first step, has been taken towards shaping a policy to meet it. In these circumstances there would appear to be three possible lines of action. Either (i) all wages administration must be concentrated in the hands of one Department; or (ii) it must be so co-ordinated as to amount in practice to the same thing, or (iii) the Departments may remain free to conduct their own negotia-tions provided (a) a supreme arbitrating authority is set up to settle cases of dispute; and (b) this authority is free to approach each dispute without being prejudiced by any* Le., broadly, the principle of basing wages on standards of 1914, and making modifications according to other agreed principles on that as a basis.
departmental negotiations which have already taken place. Of these the third method would appear the most promising as well as the most nearly in consonance with other arrangements. Incidentally it is in harmony with the suggestions put forward last week as regards the settlement of disputes in the public service.The objection to complete concentration of wage administration is that wages cannot be dealt with independently of considerations of financial and commercial policy, and therefore general administration of wages cannot be wholly divorced from the authority controlling finance, etc. The second method, i.e., departmental co-ordination might be said to be in operation now. If this is so, it is not effective; and probably if it were rendered theoretically effective it would become practically unworkable.As regards the third method, however, the condition italicised above is of extreme importance in cases in which the Government is in the position of an employer. The absence of such an arrangement is at present responsible for much embarrassment, and it appears to have been as a result of this th&amp;t the Trade Union Mediation Committee discharged, to some extent, the functions usually performed by the Government itself in important disputes. In other words, the Government could not at one and the same time act as employer and as independent mediating third party. In these circumstances, the deputation of 11 Labour leaders, afterwards increased in number to 14, constituted themselves a third party and performed the functions of mediation. This committee could not strictly be regarded as &quot; independent,&quot; inasmuch as it was originally appointed at the Caxton Hall Conference of trade unions &quot; involved or likely to be involved &quot; in the strike, but in the event its mediating offices appear to have been performed with a con-siderable sense of statesmanship and responsibility. It had no real authority to assume the role it played except ultimately the vague and general sense of the community that such a mediating third party was needed.(c) Neiv Features in Strike Policy. Two notable incidents under this head may be briefly mentioned here. The first was the attitude of certain of the printers&apos; organisations. The importance of this is a corollary to the importance of public opinion, in so far as that opinion is shaped through the press. Hitherto, the Government has always been able to secure full publicity for at any rate their side of the case in any dispute, but this con-conceivably might not always be so in the future. This is only another of the novel forms of &quot; direct action,&quot; made possible recently by improved organisation, and it may be compared with industrial action against a particular individual or group, such as was used for political purposes in the closing days of the war, and may be used again.* With regard to the prin-ters, it is significant that in the days of the revolutions in Russia, Germany and Hungary, trouble centred in general not round the government buildings, but round the newspaper offices.The second point of interest is the report that one of the local strike committees offered its assistance to the authority organising emergency means of transport and the fact that there has been talk of suggestions of a more widespread character. It is not proposed here to make further reference to these topics because the general considerations con-nected with them have already been dealt with in commenting on the Winnipeg and other local general strikes.f They are only mentioned as presenting the latest and most vivid evidence of the fact that workpeople are beginning on all hands to look beyond the mere act of downing tools and to speculate in their various ways and circumstances &quot;as to what can be made of the resulting situation.(d) Nationalisation. In a statement issued by Mr. Thomas, towards the close of the dispute, it is said that the strike was not a strike in a public service, but a strike in a &quot; private profiteering speculation &quot; ; and consequently that he would have no objection to the organisation of emergency means of transport, provided it did not redound to the profit of the railway-owner, apparently because by this means it would be possible for the railwaymen to hit the pocket of the railway-owner without hitting anyone else. But an examination of the commercial columns of the newspapers would have shown Mr. Thomas that there was something wrong with his diagnosis of the situation, for with the opening of this war on the railway-owners&apos; pockets with the declaration of the strike, in other words it was noticeable that most railway shares, so far from showing any signs of weaken-ing, took a distinctly upward turn. Apart from any explanation of this curious fact, it is of interest in connection with the general question of nationalisation. It has been argued frequently that the railway strike has defeated the miners&apos; campaign for nationalisa-* E.g. the action of the E.T.U. with regard to the Albert Hall, and of the seamen as regards Mr.. ramsay Macdonald.t See Part I, Report for week ending 30th July.
tion of the mines, since it has shown that State ownership is no guarantee against industrial troubles. But though there may be moral, there is no practical ground for such a conclusion. In the first place, as was pointed out last week, anyone who imagines that State ownership and control will completely do away with industrial disputes is probably merely deluding himself. Secondly, though Mr. Thomas appears to be wrong in his diagnosis of the effect of the strike on railway-owners, this effect having been the opposite of what he appears to have anticipated, he is evidently right in his statement that the railways are not State owned, for if they were there would presumably have been no such direct effect on the stock market. No doubt, the railway strike will be used by both sides in the coming controversy over nationalisa-tion ; but any of the arguments based on the supposed present national ownership of the railways are extremely likely to be invalid.(e) Public Opinion. The importance of Public Opinion was referred to at length in Part I last week. Now that the strike is over, however, it may be pointed out that never before in the annals of industrial disputes has this been exemplified with such clearness as in the case of the railway strike. A feature of the strike has been the explicit recognition by the Government and the railwaymen that the arbiter of the justice oi their respective positions is the public opinion of the community. By Press advertisement, poster, cinema slides, and in other ways both parties brought their respective contentions to the bar of public opinion. In its posters and advertisements the Government asked the man in the street, &quot; Is the strike justified ? &quot; and the railwaymen did everything to secure from the community a verdict in their favour. The recognition on all sides of the moral supremacy of the community is of the greatest significance, for only so, in the last resort, will sectional demands which are at variance with the interests of the community as a whole be defeated.Part II.-Departmental.The Resumption of Interrupted Apprenticeships.The Government scheme providing for the resumption of training, with State assis-tance, by those apprentices whose course was interrupted by service with the Forces, is now in full operation in most of the main industries of the country. The detailed develop-ment of the Governments plans may be considered as practically complete. Negotiations have still in a few cases to be carried to a conclusion, as for example, in the cotton industry, the Irish linen industry and saw-milling. These industries, however, include only a very small percentage of the apprentices for whom it is necessary to provide, and with these exceptions the ground is now completely covered. To meet the case of apprentices in the smaller industries, or those in which the number of apprentices concerned is very low, a comprehensive general scheme has been produced, which covers all industries for which it is not considered advisable to prepare separate schemes, its application to various trades ^depending on sanction by the Minister, which is given from time to time as necessary.Thirty-three schemes have now been sanctioned and are all in actual operation. Up -to the 22nd September, nearly 18,900 applications had been received by the Employment Exchanges from apprentices who wished to be brought under the scheme, about 16,900 of whom wished to complete their training with their pre-war employers, while some 1,980 wished, for various reasons, to finish their apprenticeship with new employers. The number of applications received from employers by the Exchanges was not quite so large, about 16,160 applications having been received by the same date. Of these, a little over 15,000 were made for apprentices who had served before the war with the firms concerned, the remainder being applications for apprentices new to the firms who applied for them. Of these applications, 13,500 in round numbers, had been transmitted for the approval of the Department by the 1st October, and grants had been sanctioned in respect of nearly 13,220 apprentices, distributed between 4,423 firms. Although it has often been necessary to refer these applications back for further particulars, the number of cases in which the State grant has been ultimately refused is exceedingly small, amounting on the 1st October only to 270. The great bulk of the grants made up to the present time have gone to apprentices in sixteen industries, the remainder accounting for only 220 between them. The industry in which it has hitherto been necessary to make the largest number of grants, as was to be expected, is the engineering industry, which accounts for 5,158 of the appren-tices for whom grants have been sanctioned, or nearly 39 per cent, of the whole number. The printing industry in England has 1,975 apprentices receiving assistance, and in
&apos; Scotland 405, a total in all of 2,380. The building trade ranks next in importance, account-ing for nearly 2,200 grants. The numbers in other industries are substantially less, ship-building, in which 965 grants have been made, and the furniture industry, with 550 grants, being the most important numerically.The application of the Governments detailed proposals has been well received, in general, by employers as well as by apprentices. The only serious difficulty encountered up to the present time has arisen in consequence of the attitude of employers in the building and electrical contracting trades in Scotland. The objections raised are of a similar type in both cases. In the building trade, and more especially in the plumbing and joinery branches, the Scottish associations of employers have protested against the wages proposals of the scheme as applied to their industry, and object both to the rates actually fixed and to the retrospective provisions of the schema. The objection comes in the main from the plumbers, who are at present paying rates very much below those set out in the scheme. The rates among the joiners, on the other hand, approximate more closely to those which they would be called upon to pay on acceptance of the Governments proposals. The employers object, in general, that apprentices have lost seriously in skill during their service with the Forces, and that their earning power is so low that the wages suggested under the scheme would be uneconomic, even with State assistance. They hold, further-more, as regards the retrospective payment of higher wages, that it would be impossible to recover from the State amounts sufficient to prevent loss on contracts previously entered into on the basis of the lower apprentice rates which they have been paying. These objections have hitherto interfered to a rather serious degree with the application of the scheme among Scottish building firms in these branches of the industry, although in other branches a more favourable attitude has been adopted. The Kilmarnock and District Master Painters&apos; Association, for example, have accepted the scheme, and a large number of firms in Dumfries have also adopted it. Suggestions for a revision of the building scheme to meet what are put forward as Scottish needs have been referred to the Joint Industrial Council for the industry, who were responsible for the production of the scheme, and from whom any modification which may be deemed necessary to meet these objections must emanate.Similar objections have been made spasmodically by firms in most of the industries to which the scheme has been applied, but have resulted in comparatively few cases in refusal to accept it. Hesitation to bring returning apprentices under the provisions of the scheme has been caused in other cases by apprehension, sometimes undoubtedly justified, of jealousy on the part of other employees, mainly among apprentices who have not served in the war and who now object to seeing their fellow apprentices, with less experience and skill, receiving higher wages, but in some cases among ex-Service men who claim that their own position is equally deserving of State assistance. Sheer inertia has been manifested by some employers, which it has been necessary to overcome by active personal canvassing. In many instances, however, employers have declined to accept the scheme from worthier motives. In almost all industries a number of cases have been reported in which employers have re-engaged their apprentices at rates substantially higher, or on terms which appear more advantageous, than those provided for under the scheme, or have refused to make any claim for State assistance in enabling the apprentices to complete their training at a rate compatible with the age which they have attained. Among the larger and more important firms, especially, a number felt called upon, during the inevitable period of delay during which the Government schemes were under dis-cussion, to put into application special schemes of their own, and they have often decided to adhere to the arrangements so made rather than to bring their apprentices within the scope of the Government schemes.
Paet III. Press Comments.(1) Labour and Socialist Press.(A) Foreign Affairs.Russia.The railway strike has so overshadowed all other topics of discussion in the press, that there is little about Russia except in &quot; The Call&quot; and the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought.&quot; &quot; The Call &quot; advertises the &quot; Hands Off Russia &quot; movement which originated last June at a meeting of Trade Unions in Manchester, and&apos; re-inforces this advertisement by appealing to the workers of the country not to be misled by the tricks of politicians, but to take action &quot;in the most direct and decisive sense of the word.&quot; The &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; as is its custom, deals with history rather than with current politics. Long extracts from an American journal named &quot; The Metropolitan &quot; are given of an interview which Col. Raymond Robins, of the American Red Cross, is stated to have had with Lenin soon after the 7th August this year. Lenin&apos;s attitude of mind as revealed in this interview may be shown by two quotations from it. &quot; Every system of feudal aristocratic social control in Europe was destined to be destroyed by the political democratic social control worked out by the French Revolution. Every system of political democratic control in the world to-day is destined now to be destroyed by the economic producers social control worked out by the Russian Revolution.&quot; f&apos; You may destroy the Russian Revolution in Russia. You may overthrow me. It will make no difference.&quot; The same paper reprints from the New York &quot; The Voice of Labour &quot; an article describing the history and organisation of shop committees in Russia. These factory committees are said to have originated in the Government munition works. It is claimed that they kept Russian industry from complete disintegration .at the time of the Revolution and that together with Peasanfs Committees, through the Supreme Council of Public Economy, they now manage the economic life of Soviet Russia. One of the great advantages of these committees would appear to be that &quot; they are able to check the actions of the trade unions and to contro the trade union officials.&quot;Italy.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; contains an article on d&apos;Annunzio&apos;s seizure of Fiume; this act, this paper considers, was only possible because the Allied statesman had advanced no definite policy with regard to the appropriation of Fiume. In the opinion of the &quot; New Statesman &quot; the effect of d&apos;Annunzio&apos;s action on the Italian Socialists and trade unionists, who are at present much divided, may be to re-unite them and produce a counterstroke. The &quot;Nation &quot; is of opinion that the threat of Socialist agitation in Italy may induce the Supreme Five to take some action in the case of Fiume.La Confederation Generate du Travail, France.; : The &quot;New Statesman&quot; draws attention to the fact that the C.G.T. decided at its Congress to ally itself with the brainworkers, including Government officials, teachers and other professionals who are in sympathy with the working classes. The paper considers this to be especially significant, as it will equip the French Labour movement for something beyond talking and striking.(B) Home Affairs.The Railway Strike.*This review of the opinions of the Labour Press on the railway strike is rendered incomplete by the absence of some of the more important papers, and of the articles of such writers as Mr. Snowden, Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, and &quot; Rob Roy.&quot; The bulk of the articles which are reviewed seem more interested in the political aspect of the strike than in its industrial aspect as a wages dispute. The local I.L.P. papers, however, are the means by which local railwaymen&apos;s leaders put the details of their case before such of then fellow trade unionists as read these papers and thus contain much controversy on the details of the dispute. The criticism of &quot; The Call &quot; and the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; which in times of industrial peace is apt to be so bold, is singularly ineffective. The &quot; Railway Review &quot; presents a novel argument, which does not seem to have been used elsewhere.* &quot; Forward&quot; and &quot; The Socialist&quot; (Glasgow), the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; (Manchester), [&apos; Justice,&quot; and the &quot; Clarion&quot; had not come to hand when this report went to press, apparently owing to dislocation resulting from the railway strike.
The &quot; Eailway Review &quot; devotes the greater part of its issue to a history of negotia-, &quot;tions at Downing Street, and of the course of the strike in London and th &quot;[provinces. The speeches of the men&apos;s leaders at the Albert Hall on the 26th September, and at Clapham Common on the 30th September, are reported in detail. On the first page, however, of its issue, an argument is presented by means of quotations from the passages in the Treaty of Peace with Germany which deal with labour, and from Mr. Thomas&apos;s speech at the Albert Hall. The vague phraseology that first appears to have been conceived in the mind of Mr. Gompers is once more brought forth, and it is argued that the British Government still wishes to treat railwaymen as an article of commerce to be bought cheaply in the labour market, that it has thus declared a war on trade unionism and has failed to give effect to the conditions of the Peace Treaty.Mr. F. W. Jowett, in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; uses the railway strike as an argument for political action. He says that the Independent Labour Party has always maintained that the working class in this country could do everything that was necessary both with regard to improvements in wages and working conditions under the existing social order and in the direction of changing that social order itself, by exercising its political power through legislative and administrative bodies. He maintains that if the working class had elected a majority of Labour members to the present Parliament, there would have been no strike of railwaymen. Mr. Jowett is greatly concerned to point out that the strike had nothing to do with &quot; direct action &quot; and that it was just an ordinary industrial strike to which no valid objection could be taken by the supporters of the present social order. He regards the strike as the first serious attempt of Capitalism in this country to defeat the general demand of the workers for the fulfilment of the promises of better conditions that had been made to them during the war, and describes the Minister of Transport and the President of the Board of Trade as &quot; two of the chief janitors for big business in. the Government.&quot; Capitalism, he thinks, is fighting for its life and cannot bear the cost of the last five years of destruction &quot; unless the workers can be brought into a suitable state of subjection for intensive exploitation.&quot; With regard to the particular points in dispute, he suggests that the Government proposals of guaranteed advances of not less than 100 per cent, on wages and a minimum of 40s., irrespective of any fall that might take place in prices, was, in view of the fact that nobody expects a substantial fall in prices, nothing better than a promise of the old pre-war wages to men who prior to the commencement of the war had determined to submit no longer to the wages that they were receiving. He &apos; does not think the dispute is accurately described as a dispute between the Government and the railway men. In his opinion the Railway Executive controls the railways and is nothing more than a Joint Committee of railway magnates and the only share the Govern-ment has in the business is to, guarantee the profits to the shareholders.The local I.L.P. papers contain much detailed information as to the course of the strike in their respective districts. A letter appears in the &quot; Leeds Weekly Citizen.&quot; from the chairman of the local Strike Committee in which he states the cost of living is now 125 per cent, above the pre-war level, and therefore that the Government was offering a minimum wage equivalent to 15s. per week. He interprets the offer of the Prime Minister that railwaymen&apos;s wages should not be reduced until the cost of living had kept at or lower than 110 per cent, above the pre-war level for three months, as merely an increase of this 15s. minimum to an 18s. minimum. Similarly a local railwayman writes to the &quot; Woolwich Pioneer &quot; and states that the Railway Executive proposals mean at the end of this year a reduction in wages for most of the men up to as much as 15s. per week. The &quot; Worker &quot; describes the decision not to pay the strikers so long as they remained on strike the week&apos;s back pay retained by the railway companies as a security against breach of contract on the part of the employees, as a deliberate attempt to stir up the passions and the bitterness of the men, so that some excuse might be given to treat the strike as an anarchist con-. spiracy, and to justify the use of troops. The Merthyr &quot; Pioneer,&quot; the &quot; Leeds Weekly Citizen,&quot; the &quot; Worker &quot; and the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; all agree in thinking that the Government proposals were merely the beginning of an attack upon the wage rates of every worker in the country and that the recognition of the principle of standardisation as conceded to the enginemen and firemen has got to be won for the whole working class. The Woolwich &quot; Pioneer &quot; calls for the immediate summoning of Parliament in order that the fierce light of public opinion might be focussed on the dispute and fair play be given to labour representatives to state the case of the men. The Merthyr &quot; Pioneer &quot; congratulates Mr. Thomas on his splendid statesmanship and sense of responsibility.In &quot; The Call &quot; Mr. Victor Lantern discusses what he describes as &quot; The Great Strike. &apos; He assumes that the Government is the chief political instrument of the &quot; capitalists &quot; and argues that, as their agent, it has been planning since the armistice the destruction . of working class organisations.  The recent increases in pay granted to the Army, and
the passing of the Police Act, he regards as manoeuvres by which the &quot; capitalist class,-trust to render the forces of law and order obedient.&quot;  Mr. Lantern thinks the railwaymen were forced to strike and that their defeat would be a preliminary to massed capitalist attacks on the workers of other industries.   On the other hand, he thinks that the victory of the N.U.R. would mark &quot; a milestone on the road to the dictatorship of the working class.&quot;  Therefore, he thinks that the strike is &quot; an opening battle in the social revolution.&quot;&apos; The duty of the Trade Unions in such circumstances as these, he thinks, is clear.  They&apos; must compel the Parliamentary Committee of the T.U.C. to summon a national congress to determine a general Trade Union policy and to appoint a committee to take central&apos;, control of the organisations.   Beyond this, however, Mr. Lantern suggests only demon-strations of solidarity, &quot; moral support &quot; and protests. &quot;The Trade Unions, he thinks, are attacked and must act on the defensive.   &quot; By judicious warning and Trade Union discipline, the workers must be enabled to avoid the shambles prepared for them.&quot;   A contributor to the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; is more diffident than Mr. Lantern.   He expresses the same opinions but does not suggest any&apos;course of action that Trade Unionists -might base upon them.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; has a more purely political interpretation to put upon the strike, and suggests that it has merely been a manoeuvre on the part of the Government to recapture the middle class vote. The conclusion is arrived at that the Government wished there to be a strike, and that the main responsibility for the strike rests with the Prime Minister. Mr. Thomas is congratulated on his endeavour to confine the limits of. the strike. The action of the Government in refusing to pay the strikers their back pay is described as &quot; an act of ruthless and irresponsible violence.&quot; One of the most important results of the strike will, in the opinion of this paper, be the moral victory that the Labour movement has achieved in the &quot; qualities of statesmanship and restraint &quot; which &quot; Labour leaders as a whole have exhibited.&quot; &quot; The events of Thursday and Friday will remain the most impressive demonstration of Labour solidarity and of the essential reasonableness and responsibility of the British Labour movement that has ever been witnessed.&quot; In another article in the same journal, Mr. Sidney Webb discusses the details of the negotia-tions. His judgment is that &quot; on that fateful Friday the men were manoeuvred into a false position.&quot; Discussing the more general aspects of the issue he expresses sub--stantially the same opinion as does Mr. Lantern in &quot; The Call.&quot; There is a determination, he thinks, in which the Cabinet concurs, that, irrespective of current prices, wages have got to be reduced throughout industry.The &quot; Nation &quot; ascribes the strike to political and economic causes of a less evanescent type, after first suggesting that the description of the strike as an &quot; anarchist conspiracy &quot; possesses the merit of simplicity rather than of truth. It is stated the lack of success on the part of the Government in controlling prices and profits, together with the belated and inadequate character of the earlier war bonuses, had irritated the men so much that they had become suspicious of the Government and the employing classes, whom they came to -believe to be exploiting the difficulties of the hour and the public spirit of the workers for their own purposes. The exclusion of all representatives of the men from the Railway Executive is described as a &quot; fatal and inexcusable blunder.&quot; A complaint is made that the Prime Minister is still thinking in terms of the old world. Such influences as these, the &quot; Nation &quot; thinks were responsible for the breakdown of the negotiations on the 26th September. The &quot; New Age,&quot; like the &quot; New Statesman,&quot; attributes the conflict to im-mediate political causes. It does not, however, think these political causes have anything to do with the middle-class vote as s uch. It points to the facts, which it describes as obvious and commonplace, that the Government must shortly pass the burden of the railway subsidy on to someone else, that a decision to advance fares and freights will not be tolerated by the public and, therefore, that the Government was endeavouring to cover the deficit out of the wages bill. This case for the Government, thinks the &quot; New Age,&quot; was strong : equally strong, however, in the opinion of this paper, was the railwaymen&apos;s case. There thus resulted a deadlock. The only real and permanent solution to this deadlock that the &quot; New Age &quot; can put forward is naturally a complete and immediate transformation of the system under which such a deadlock has been created.Mr. D. Gilmour, in the &quot; British Citizen,&quot; quotes with approval Mr. W. A. Appleton&apos;s opinion that had the railwaymen balloted on the question of the strike with the true issue before them, they would have rejected the strike policy. Similarly, Mr. G. W. S. Jarrett, in the same paper, expresses the opinion that the N.U.R. leaders have misled their members, and he reproaches Mr. Thomas for allowing false impressions of Governments offers to spread abroad. He, however, equally strongly puts forward the opinion that &quot;there should be no wild talk of &apos; fighting &apos; either the strike or the strikers.&quot; The article in the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; on Monday, the 29th September, from the versatile pen of Mr. W. L. George, advocating the formation of local Labour emergency committees and of a Central-
Peopled Committee, is given great prominence in the &quot; British Citizen,&quot; and Mr. Jarrett calls upon Mr. Thomas to repudiate the &quot; Daily Herald.&quot;The Political Outlook.In an article in &quot; The Call &quot; entitled &quot; A Labour Party in Power, or the Dictatorship of the Proletariat,&quot; Mrs, Montefiore considers that the capitalists and bourgeoisie need have no fear of the Labour government of the near future, and cites, as an example, the history of Labour Governments in Australia. The writer advocates the dictatorship of the pro-letariat on the Russian model as the only sure means of abolishing capitalism. Mr. Joseph King, in the &quot; Worker,&quot; contributes an article on &quot; Spies,&quot; and says that spying to-day is undoubtedly one of the regular methods of the Government, especially in dealing with Socialists and Trade Unionists. Labour, he says, has not yet fully realised the extent and the menace of this secret service system. It appears to be supported as much by the Liberal as by the Tory party : thus it is for Labour to abolish it.Other.The &quot; Democrat &quot; contains an attack on the Ministry of Food, and on the methods by which the Government proposes to deal with high prices and profiteering. The paper maintains that the most effective way to deal with these evils is to make the community-understand that prices depend on production, and that &quot; ca&apos; canny &quot; habits and the lightning strike are more dangerous than the merchant who seeks an excessive profit. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; deals with profiteering and the shortage of houses. The high rents which it suggests are to be charged for the new houses are necessary, thinks this-paper in order to pay the ground rents to idle landlords and profiteering builders. The workers are urged to demand the socialisation of housing to escape from this double burden. The &quot; Democrat,&quot; in an article entitled, &quot; Who pays for strikes 1 &quot; argues that the whole community pays through the depletion of the country&apos;s resources during the stoppage, and still more if the country&apos;s trading resources, its markets, its goodwill, are destroyed or injured. The &quot; Democrat &quot; thinks that the only way of replacing such losses, lies in increased work and production.(2) Ex-Service Metis Periodicals.The &quot; Ex-Service Man &quot; discusses this week the railway strike, the amalgamation of ex-Service men&apos;s organisations and the employment of ex-officers.The Railway Strike.The first article in this paper takes the form of an advertisement calling upon ex-Service men to save their country in the hour of crisis.Ex-Service Metis Organisations. .   -The amalgamation of these organisations is considered in connection with the use to* which the moneys at the disposal of the United Services&apos; Fund ought to be put. A letter appears from the Secretary of the National Association of Ex-Service Men recommending the division of the country into districts, in each of which the Government should organise an association representing all the ex-Service men in the district, to which association should be allotted funds in proportion to the number of ex-soldiers represented. The general secretary of the Comrades of the Great War expresses the opinion that a discussion in the press with reference to the way in which the funds at the disposal of the United Services&apos; Fund would not help General Lord Byng in his task, and therefore refuses to-gpe any suggestions on this point. He, however, expresses himself in favour of amalgama-tion of ex-Service men&apos;s society provided that such amalgamation fulfil three conditions :  (a) membership must be open to all ranks ; (6) there should be no party politics ; (c) that, no civilians should be admitted to membership.Employment of Ex-Officers.An article on this topic mentions two special factors which affect the ex-officer&apos;s position. The ex-officer is anxious to obtain such a salary in civil life as will enable him to maintain the standard of living which he enjoyed in the Army. In any case, the increased cost of living and the fact that the ex-officer is many years older than he was when he left civil employment, make his pre-war salary quite inadequate to his present needs-
It is stated that employers as a whole have recognised the latter considerations fairly : and it is suggested that ex-officers on their part must offer their services not on an Army basis, but on their fair market value in relation to their qualifications and the job sought.(3) The Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.?: &apos; Nil. ,;/&apos;:&apos;:&apos; \Part IV.-General Topics.The Railway Strike.The Negotiations.-An account of the negotiations that took place between the Government and the Railwaymen&apos;s Unions up to the 1st inst. inclusive was given in last week&apos;s Report. On the 2nd inst. no direct conversations took place between the Govern-ment and the N.U.R., but the Trade Union deputation which had visited the Prime Minister on the previous day was very active in pursuing its policy of mediation. In the morning the deputation first met the N.U.R. Executive at Unity House ; following that it visited the Prime Minister and Mr. Bonar Law and resumed the negotiations of the night before. After conferring with the Prime Minister the deputation proceeded to the Fabian Hall where it continued its conference of the day before and in the afternoon it again visited Unit)&apos;- House and conferred with the N.U.R. Executive. Later in the evening the Transport Conference resumed its meeting at the Fabian Hall. A further visit to Unity House was made still later in the evening to confer with the Railwaymen&apos;s Executive. A statement on the negotiations was issued by Mr. J. H. Thomas to the effect that all rumours of a settlement were incorrect, and that the negotiations had broken down inasmuch as the Governments offer was no different from that made on Friday last. He continued that he was satisfied with the strength and solidarity of the strike but that his Executive would do nothing to interfere with the efforts at a settlement which were being made by the other trade unions who had met the Prime Minister that day.On the 3rd inst. the negotiations continued. The Trade Union deputation met the Prime Minister in the forenoon, and reported to the Trade Union Conference at the Memorial Hall in the afternoon. After a short sitting the deputation went to Unity House and conferred with the N.U.R. Executive&apos;. Following this, a further conference was held at the Memorial Hall, and then the deputation and the Executive of the N.U.R. went to Downing Street to confer with the Prime Minister. At this Conference the Government proposed that the principle of the armistice should be adopted, the men to return to work immediately on the understanding that if negotiations were not concluded satisfactorily within a period of seven days, the men would come out again. It was thought that this proposal would satisfy the amour propre of the N.U.R., as the men would still be nominally on strike. But the N.U.R. considered that the acceptance of this arrangement would enable the Government to perfect its machinery for maintaining the essential services of the country, and that at the end of the seven days&apos; armistice, the Government would be in a stronger position than before, while the railwaymen would be proportionately weakened. The N.U.R., therefore, rejected the proposal. At this stage in the negotiations the situation looked exceedingly grave. A complete deadlock appeared to have been reached. Mr. Cramp announced that the N.U.R. Executive would disperse and conduct a campaign throughout the country ; and it was stated that a fully representative trade union conference would take place on the 7th inst. to decide on a definite policy with regard to sympathetic action. The Government, on its part, issued a call for the formation of a Citizen Guard, and considered measures for dealing with any eventuality that might arise.On the 4th inst., however, the trade union Mediation Committee continued its good offices. In the morning it met the N.U.R. Executive, and afterwards proceeded to Down--ing Street, where Mr. Bonar Law received it, and after discussion it was arranged that the Executive Committee of the N.U.R. with Mr. Bromley should visit Downing Street again on the following day. On the 5th inst. accordingly, a further prolonged series of con-ferences took place between the Government, the railwaymen and the Mediation Coni-mittee, as a result of which a settlement was reached.... ; .  The Settlement. The terms of the settlement were as follows :  (1) Work to be resumed forthwith.(2) On the full resumption of work negotiations shall be continued with the under-standing that they will be completed before the 31st December, 1919.
(3) Wages will be stabilised in the United Kingdom at the present level up to the 30th September. 1920. Any time after the 1st August, 1920, they may be reviewed in the light of the circumstances then existing. . ,(4) No adult railwaymen in Great Britain shall receive less than 51s. so long as the cost of living is not less than 110 per cent, above pre-war level,(5) The N.U.R. and A.S.L.E. &amp; P. agree that the men shall work harmoniously with the railway servants who have remained at or returned to Work and the Government and the N.U.R. and A.S.L.E. &amp; F. agree that no man shall be prejudiced in any way as a result of the strike.(6) The arrears of wages which have been withheld in consequence of breach of. contract will be paid after the resumption of work.Parliamentanj Committee of the T.U.C.: This Committee was in session on the 8th inst. and was engaged all the morning in. considering the resolutions passed by the Glasgow Congress and the instructions for giving effect to them. In the afternoon, Mr. Arthur Henderson, M.P., and the other members of the Trade Union Mediation Committee presented a formal report of the intervention in the railway dispute of the 14 mediators. The following official statement of the day&apos;s cblibera-tions was issued by Mr. C. W. Bowerman, Secretary to the Committee : (1) The Mediation Committee met the Parliamentary Committee and a full dis-cussion took place on the desirability of setting up some emergency machinery whereby in the event of another and similar dispute arising, some immediate intervention might be found possible.(2) It was decided to appoint a sub-committee to go into the matter, and as an outcome of their consideration, a special trade union conference may be called later to discuss the question of the standardisation of wages and the adjust-ment and merging of war bonus into standard rates and wages in all trades..(3) The plans for the Labour Congress at Washington were also discussed.Union of Postal Workers.There is evidence that two at least of the decisions reached at the Amalgamation Conference of this body have given rise to much dissatisfaction. The first is the refusal of the Conference to accept the recommendation of the three executive committees to retain Mr. Stuart Bunning&apos;s connection with the postal movement by appointing him to assist the union in an advisory capacity. It is stated that Mr. Stuart Bunning could have had the nomination of the three executives for the General Secretaryship of the Union, and that his election at the Conference would probably have been unopposed. But he decided that as he was not in sympathy with the plans and policy of the Union, it would be better for him not to accept the General Secretaryship, though he had no objection to retaining a connection with the Union of such a kind that his great experience might still be of use to the movement provided that it would not be necessary for him to translate into action policies of which he did not approve. It was in these circumstances that the executives recommended Mr. Bunning&apos;s advisory appointment. The arrangement was a. strange one, and in some ways it is not surprising that the Conference acted as it did. The new executive will probably make further efforts to secure Mr. Bunning&apos;s services, but in the meantime his position in the Trade Union movement is peculiar, as he has apparently no official right to represent any union. It may be noted that, in spite of this, he was appointed a member of the Trade Union Conciliation Committee in connection with the railway strike. The second decision of the Conference which has caused dissatisfaction is the resolution that every branch of the Union should have a right to send a delegate to the Annual Conference. It is pointed out that as this would mean that the Conference would consist of not less than 2,000 delegates, and as it was decided that the travelling-expenses of the delegates should be borne by the general funds, this would mean an annual succession of stunning blows at the funds of the Union. It is considered probable that the executive will revise the decisions of the Conference.Trade Union Topics.M.F.G.B.-U is reported that at a special conference of the M.F.G.B. to be held on the 22nd October, the South AVales Miners&apos; Federation will move that&apos;members of the Federation refuse to pay income-tax as from April last, in view of the refusal of the Govern-ment to raise the exemption limit to  250.
Agricultural Hours. Sixteen branches of the Dockers&apos; and General Workers&apos; Union in Cornwall (with land workers as members) have passed resolutions demanding the inclusion of agricultural workers in the 48-hour week Bill.Ex-Service Men.&quot; Z &quot; Reserve. The question of &quot; Z &quot; Reserve continues to give rise to much dis-satisfaction among ex-Service men. At the great ex-Service demonstration at Hyde Park on the 27th September, &quot; Z &quot; Reserve men were specially strongly opposed to the idea of rejoining the Colours, if called upon during&apos;a strike. At the meeting of ex-Service men in Trafalgar Square on. the 28th September, a vote was taken against blacklegging, even if called up in &quot; Z &quot; Reserve, in any Labour dispute.Ex-Service Organisations and the StriJce.The attitude of the various ex-Service organisations during the strike is of some interest. In general, it may be said, the Comrades of the Great War have been, while nominally neutral, on the side of the Government; the N.F.D.D.S.S. have been officially neutral, but the rank and file have been divided, some supporting the Government and others the railwaymen; and the National Union of Ex-Service Men have been on the side of the railwaymen. That is the general position but it is open to some qualification. On the 1st inst., the Headquarters of the Comrades of the Great War issued a statement advising comrades to avoid taking sides in the industrial dispute but maintaining that it was only in accordance with the common dictates of humanity for the citizens of the com-munity to ensure the essential services. In practice, large numbers of members of this orga-nisation offered their services to the Government. The Headquarters of the N.F.D.D.S.S. also issued an instruction to members to remain neutral, but in many cases members of the organisation spoke from N.U.R. platforms, declared their sympathy with the rail-waymen, and denounced the Comrades of the Great War for supporting the Government. The Shoreditch and Bethnal Green branch of the N.F.D.D.S.S. passed a resolution strongly supporting the railwaymen in their struggle. On the other hand, the President of the Bristol branch of this body offered the help of himself and his 7,800 members to back law and order. The National Union of Ex-Service Men was whole-heartedly on the side of the railwaymen. The Secretary of the Union issued a manifesto calling upon all members of the Union to stand by their comrades of the N.U.R. This action might, of course, have been expected from the history and general position of this Union.Manchester Ex-Service Men.The Manchester ex-Service men who marched to London and interviewed the Minister on the 29th September, returned to Manchester on the 1st October. The Chief Constable of Manchester met the returned marchers in Albert Square, on behalf of the Lord Mayor, and expressed the hope that the visit to London had been a satisfactory one. Mr. Richards, the leader of the deputation, stated that the result of the march had been entirely un-satisfactory and that if by the time winter set in ex-Service men were left in their present position, the Manchester men would take the remedying of their grievances into their own hands.Three-Shift System.At a meeting of the Pearson &amp; Knowles Coal and Iron Company, the Deputy Chairman, Mr. J. J. Beckiy, made some rather interesting remarks in connection with the institution of the three-shift system in the company&apos;s works. The company had not been able to get all the additional men necessitated by the change, but the results already visible were encouraging. The rates of wages were in no case less than they were for the 53-hour week, and the men were earning in most cases twice as much as they did before the war. The output per hour was greater than it used to be and the consumption of fuel per hour -was substantially less.five-Day-Week System.A paragraph on this system appears in the Annual Report of the Chief Inspector of Factories and Workshops for 1918 (Cmd 340), and may be quoted here as interesting in regard to Labour problems : &quot; Individual works in a fairly wide range of industries have found it convenient to adopt a five-day week with no work on Saturday. In the jute industry in Scotland, when it became necessary to shorten hours the workpeople demanded that no work be done on Saturday, but otherwise the system has not been adopted throughout any industry, and there are no signs at present that it is likely to-be very attractive generally either to employers or workpeople.  Generally speaking, five
Part V. Departmental and District Reports. (1) Departmental Reports,Appointments Department.Government Vacancies. Up to the 26th September, 2.366 candidates have been examined by the Selection Board, 705 of whom have been placed. Rejected, cancelled or lapsed applications amounted to 447, thus leaving 1,214 applicants to be dealt with. The various Departments have still to complete their arrangements for substitution under the Ramsay Scheme and vacancies are so far being notified slowly, the latest weekly total being 120.days of practically equal periods of employment have been adopted, but in some cases the hours have been arranged so that one period is worked on three days while another, usually a shorter period, is worked on the remaining two days. In the large majority of works a 10 or 11-hour period is worked on the longest days, in which case one and a half hours are usually allowed for meals, unless the starting hour is at 7 a.m. or later, when it is convenient to allow one break only (varying in different works from three-quarters of an hour to one and a quarter hours). In Scotland where two full meal hours have always been customary in certain industries a 12-hour period was usual on each of the five days. At one large textile factory where the five-day Aveek was tried for some time the output fell off so much, that the firm adopted a six-day week with an after breakfast start at 8 a.m. and one meal hour, with the result, that, notwithstanding shorter weekly hours, the output increased again.&quot; This paragraph should be compared with what was said in this Report for the 20th August, p. 166.London Workers&apos; Committee.The London Workers&apos; Committee held a conference in the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street, on the 27th September. Many trades were represented including railwaymen, &apos; printers, vehicle workers, woodworkers, builders, aircraft workers and engineers. The purpose of the conference was to find out what strength, there was in the movement in London and to discuss the best means of forming a real Workers&apos; Committee. The sec-retary of the Organisers&apos; Committee pointed out the difficulties of organisation in the London district owing to the distances and the unsympathetic attitude of the Trade Unions to the Workers&apos; Committee movement. A resolution was passed unanimously &quot; that this conference resolves that the time is now opportune for the formation of a Central Committee to co-ordinate the activities of the Local Committees in the London district.&quot; Reports were received from Mr. J. T. Murphy and Mr. A. McManus with regard to the work that was being done in Sheffield and in the Clyde area. Mr. Mann urged the workers to identify themselves with the co-operative societies as it was largely through them that the workers would be able to take control of the supply and distribution of food. It was decided to summon a national conference at an early date. A resolution was passed protesting against the treatment of the I. W.W. and the imprisonment of its members in the U.S.A. and it was agreed that the Provisional Committee should study the I.W.W. constitution with a view to joining in an international movement.Professional Workers&apos; Federation.Under the auspices of this body it is announced that a congress of salaried workers will be held in London on the 25th October. Six resolutions will be submitted to the meeting. The most important of these are :-(1) The serious lowering of the economic status of professional workers makes it imperative that the organisations representing the professional classes should co-operate in an effort to restore and maintain a satisfactory standard of life in these classes. (2) The income-tax should be so altered as to recognise, so far as may be practicable, the family as the unit for taxation ; and such relief should be afforded as would represent a substantial proportion of the maintenance of each dependent of the taxpayer. (3) State supervision at every point of the productive system should be maintained in order to prevent the enaction of unfair profits by the various agents of production and distribution. (4) The principles of the Whitley Report should be applied to professional employments, and means should be found of inter-relating-the activities of the bodies which may be established. These proposed resolutions give an interesting indication of the direction in which the organisation of salaried workers may be expected to develop.
&apos; Training Grants Scheme.-Notwithstanding the hindrance of the railway strike the-Ml programme of the Grants Committee panels was maintained. The number of cases dealt with was nearly 200 in excess of the number of new cases received.Appointments. Directorate reports, though not in a complete form enabling the customary statistical return to be prepared, indicate that the work of placing applicants oontinues to show satisfactory results as regards the number of men placed and the number of vacancies notified.Training Department.Facilities in Ireland. The provision of facilities for the training of ex-Service men in Ireland presents considerable difficulty. The military1 authorities are unable at present to surrender accommodation which, it was hoped, might be available for this purpose. It has also been found impossible for the Irish Department of Agriculture to take over the responsibility for agricultural training, as has been done by the Board of Agriculture in England. /Equipment. Training centres have been hindered by the railway strike from receipt of the necessary equipment and goods required for establishing training courses.   Efforts , are being made to provide equipment at all instructional factories, complete for all courses.Employment Department.Out-of-Work Donation. On the 19th September, 408,703 full time out-of-work donation policies were remaining lodged at the Exchanges. Of this number 366,905 were for men;. 36,553 for women, 3,111 for boys, and 2,334 for girls. In addition, there were on the 12th September, 29,863 short-time policies lodged by 6,050 men, 18,602 women, 1,640 bovs and 3,571 girls.It has been decided that the recent strike modifications of the donation scheme shall cease to be operative on the 16th October.Prosecution for Fraud. Up to the 3rd October, 1,336 cases had been referred to the-solicitor with a view to prosecution for attempted fraud in connection with out-of-work donation. In 529 cases the defendants were fined, in 132 cases sentences of imprisonment were passed, and in 52 cases the defendant was bound over. In 121 cases the summonses were dismissed.Discontinuance of Employment Councils. Owing to the pressing need for economy, it has been decided to discontinue the work of the Employment Councils. Originally established at the time of the armistice for rendering assistance to the Local Employment Committees in dealing with problems of demobilisation and resettlement, these primary functions are drawing to a close. Although the Minister would have been glad, to avail himself of their further services, he has reluctantly decided to dissolve them as from the 1st November.Court of Arbitration.During the week ending the 4th October, 1919, the Court of Arbitration resumed the hearing of the claim of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation for an advance of 12s; a week, to workpeople employed in connection with tramway undertakings throughout the country.   The hearings this week took place in London and Manchester.   The Award,, which was issued on the 7th inst., is as follows : (1) The additional war bonuses or war advances now being paid to the workpeople concerned who are members of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation and its affiliated unions providing for tramway and omni&apos; bus workers in the employment of the several undertakings in the respective districts mentioned in the reference shall be increased by 4s. a week in the case of those of 18 years of age and over, and 25. in the case of those under 18 years of age.   (2) This award shall not apply in those cases in which it has been the practice to regulate the wages of those work-people concerned by movements in the wages of workpeople of a similar class employed in trades or industries other than tramway and motor omnibus undertakings.   (3) In the case of the London General Omnibus^, Company, the British Automobile Traction Company, Limited, the National Steam Car Company, Limited, and Messrs. Tillings, Limited, the award shall apply.only to those grades of employees with respect to whom there are agree-ments between the companies and the London and Provincial Union of Licensed Vehicle Workers.   (4) The rates of pay in force under the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Acts 1918-1919 for the classes of workpeople concerned in the several districts as modified by this award shall be the substituted rates of wages of the workpeople concerned for the purpose of such Acts.   (5) This award shall take effect from the beginning of the first pay period following 1st October, 1919.
Wages and Arbitration Department.Scottish Shale Oil Workers. At a conference in Glasgow on the 26th September, an agreement was arrived at between representatives of the Scottish oil companies and the unions of shale oil workers for the immediate resumption of work. The present con-ditions and wages will continue until January, 1920, when inquiry will be made into the position of the industry. If it then proves that the industry cannot afford a 7-hour day, present conditions will continue, regard being had to the difference of shale oil workers&apos; and colliers&apos; hours in the event of a reduction in coal miners&apos; wages. See also Part VI (6),&apos; page 317.Railway Wagon Building. The Committee of the National Conference to reach a settlement as regards employment in this trade has arrived at an agreement which is being circulated among the employers and unions concerned for confirmation. Meanwhile it was agreed that the works of Messrs. Charles Roberts &amp; Company, Limited, Horbury, where the dispute originated, should be reopened pending a general settlement. The proposed agreement provides, in cases where the unions on application cannot supply men, for the employment of ex-Service men, not more than 21 years of age on the 1st January, 1919, as apprentices for a period of four years on terms to be settled by the employers&apos; association and the union concerned. Failing a full supply from these sources, preference is to be given to ex-Service men. In case of a slump, preference is to be given to men already employed ; and men returning from the Forces shall be employed, on application to their old employers. The agreement to be reviewed within six months on application from any of the parties.Joint Industrial Councils Division.Asbestos. The trade union representatives on the Joint Industrial Council have agreed that their application for an increase in wages shall come before the Council instead of going to arbitration.Tin Mining.-At a meeting of the Joint Industrial Council held at Gamborne on the 26th September, the workers&apos; side raised the question of submitting their claims for increased wages to arbitration. The chairman pointed out that, in view of the present state of the industry they could have no hopes of success. He would submit proposals to the Government Commission of Inquiry, which, if accepted, he thought would be of the greatest benefit.  After prolonged discussion the workers agreed not to proceed further.The employers&apos; side, on the question of output, asked if the trade unions could not help by insisting that their members should work the full number of shifts agreed upon. It was pointed out in reply that compulsion might lead to desertion of the union, hut that the union officials&apos; hands would be strengthened if employers would agree to employ only&apos; unionists. The Output Sub-Committee was instructed to consider means for bringing all connected with the industry within the scope of their respective organisations.Trade Boards Division.The Shirtmahng Trade Board (Ireland) have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the :29th September, 1919, to fix : (i) General minimum times rates of Is. Q\d. per hour for male workers, other thancutters of 22 years of age and upwards, with lower minimum rates for male Workers under that age.(ii) General minimum time rate of Is. 5d. per hour for male cutters of 22 yearsof age and upwards. .(2) District Reports.London and South-Eastern.Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the 19th September shows a ; total decrease of 2,834, representing 2,580 men and 254 women. The following are the occupations chiefly affected by unemployment-conveyance of men and goods, engineering and general labouring. Martinsydes&apos; Aircraft Factory, Woking, is discharging wo: kers. The Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, is still dismissing large numbers of workpeople. The prolongation of the ironmoulders&apos; strike is having a very serious effect, as an increasing number in the Engineering and Allied Trades are being thrown out of work owing to the shortage of castings.The Railway Strike.-Manufacturing establishments throughout the division were generally able to carry on during the strike by improvising transit for raw material and : stocking finished articles.
Shortage of Labour. A shortage of all classes of skilled labour in the sawmilling industry is reported from Tunbridge Wells.Shortage of Transport and Materials-Local building and public works at Croydon are held up by scarcity of material and a lack of transport facilities.Employment of Disabled Ex-Service Men. The National Scheme has been fully endorsed by the London Chamber of Commerce. A growing number of employers in the different areas are accepting &quot; the undertaking &quot; under the scheme.Training. Clapham Junction Committee has recommended the training of women in the area in tailoring, dressmaking and cooking. In order to relieve the shortage of skilled labour, Tunbridge Wells Committee suggests the training of ex-Service men in the sawmilling industry.Representation Of Ex-Service Men on Committees. Enfield Committee has invited representatives of the local branches of discharged men&apos;s societies to explain their claim for special representation other than through their trade unions. Bermondsey Com-mittee has approved of the principle of the representation of ex-Service men through their own societies and is inviting nominations from the bodies concerned.South-Midlands and Eastern.Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the 19th September shows a total decrease of 836, representing a decrease of 843 men and an increase of seven Women. The progress of demobilisation maintains a check upon the downward course of the register. Decreases at Cambridge, Colchester, Loughborough, Lowestoft and Luton are due to a general improvement of trade. A considerable number of discharges have taken place at Messrs. Short Bros., Aircraft Manufacturers, Southend. A few workers are being engaged in other districts but housing accommodation offers considerable difficulty. At Peterborough, it is reported that the strike of ironmoulders is likely to throw out of em-ployment a considerable number of employees in allied trades. Approximately 400 Workpeople who were unemployed consequent upon the lockout of painters at Tilbury Docks have resumed work.Shortage of Labour. The payment of wages in excess of the current district rates to carpenters and joiners at Slough Motor Depot is stated to be responsible for the with-drawal of this class of labour from local builders in the Reading area.Special Impediments to Production. The Watford Committee reports that the local brickyards are not producing to their fullest extent, owing to the fact that the Government insist on paying the ordinary contract prices for the manufacture of bricks of a special kind, known as plastic hand-made. Romford U.D.C. has stopped the erection of the proposed chemical factory at Gidea Park.Employment of Disabled Ex-Service Men. The number of firms up to the 19th September who had given an undertaking to enter the National Scheme for the Employ-ment of Disabled Ex-Service Men was 27. The number of undertakings from firms awaiting consideration and acceptance by the Employment Council was 64.South-Western.Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the 26th September shows a total increase of 487, consisting of 94 men and 393 women. For this no general reason is given. There are increases of over 100 in two areas only, at Bristol (591) and Bourne-mouth (141). It is reported that 1,000 men are to be discharged from Portsmouth dockyard this week. The United Aircraft Factory, Gosport, have paid off the greater number of their men owing to lack of orders.The Railway Strike. There appeared to be a considerable amount of feeling against the railway strike amongst ex-soldiers. The dislocation caused the closing down or short time working of a number of factories, and the employees were not altogether pleased with having been placed in this position by the Railway Unions.Training. Training in domestic service for women demobilised from the Land Army is under consideration at Salisbury. Devon and Cornwall County Council report that instructions have been received from the Board of Agriculture that no further able-bodied men are to be accepted for training in agriculture.New Developments.-T.h.e Wilts Farmers, Ltd., are building a milk depot at Savernake Station. The Devon Small Holdings Committee report the purchase of 2,752 acres at a cost of  97,000 since June, There are 251 outstanding applications from ex-Service men and 246 from civilians.   The United Aircraft Factory, Gosport, are transferring their -
business to the building of cycle parts. The Admiralty Mining School and Gun Wharf are to be transferred to Gosport and the Admiralty have asked for the building of 500 houses to meet the influx of men. Plymouth Chamber of Commerce and Plymouth Port Development Committee are urging the use of the dockyard for commercial purposes.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the 19th September shows a total decrease of 4,984, representing 4,803 men and 181 women. There are 10 decreases of over 100, the two heaviest being Leeds (2,084) and Sheffield (1,094). There are increases of over 100 in two areas only, Huddersfield (169) and Lincoln (131). This general improve-ment has taken place largely on account of the increase in the supply of coal.The Railway Strike. Throughout the area the position during the past week was by no means unsatisfactory. The clothing and woollen trades in Leeds, Dewsbury, Batley and Huddersfield were not seriously affected. In Bradford, the position was more serious and a number of firms closed down during the week. At Hull, the docks were idle on account of the shortage of wagons. At Keighley, there is a large amount of unemployment. For three or four days Leeds was entirely isolated, so far as mails were concerned, as a result of a resolution of the Postal Workers not to handle mails unless they came by train.Impediments to Production.- The following factors are reported from this division as the chief impediments to production-(1) railway strike ; (2) shortage of houses; (3) shortage of bricklayers ; (4) shortage of coal; (5) the retention of skilled men with the Colours, and (6) shortage of roadmaking materials.Employment of Disabled Ex-Service Men. The establishment of a basket-making factory for the purpose of absorbing disabled ex-Service men is proposed at Mexborough, where the chief industry is coal-mining and a number of men cannot find local employment on account of their disabilities.Training. The Derby Committee recommends that Local Technical Advisory Com-mittees be set up for the engineering, the building and the glass trades.West Midlands.Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the 19th September shows a decrease of 1,605, 864 of whom are men and 741 women. The effect of the ironfounders&apos; strike is beginning to be felt in many districts in the Midlands and in a few more days the position will be serious.The Railway Strike. The Unions whose rates and war-advances have not been consolidated tended to regard the railwaymen&apos;s case as a test case, by which the result of future negotiations on this question could be gauged. In several cases in the area, the railwaymen and the ironfounders held joint meetings.Training.-The, Birmingham Central Care Committee (Juvenile Employment Com-mittee) is taking the lead in an effort to revive the custom of apprenticeship in the majority of the industries of the city. The matter has been taken up officially with the Joint Industrial Councils which have been invited to draw up schemes for the employment of juveniles in those industries. Birmingham Women&apos;s Sub-Committee is making arrange-ments for the training of women in tailoring, dressmaking and domestic service.Northern,Unemployment. The live register for the&apos; week ending the 19th September records for the first occasion for nine weeks an increase in the number of unemployed. There is a rise of 792 in the figures for men and one of 166 in the figures for women, making in all a total increase of 958. The chief reasons given for this rise are the ironfounders&apos; strike, which has caused many firms to close sections of their works, and the shortage of coal, intensified by the recent North-Eastern railway strike. Many firms have not been, able to recover sufficiently to provide against an extended stoppage of transport. The districts in which male unemployment is most serious are Carlisle, Gateshead, Jarrow,, Newcastle, Sunderland and Workington. Unemployment is most rife among women and girls at Darlington, Gateshead, Jarrow, Newcastle and Sunderland.The Railway Strike. The railway strike brought all trade at Sunderland to a stand-still, all shipments automatically ceasing at the South Dock, as there were no trains to convey coal from the pits,  The Seaton Carew Works suspended operations owing to lack of coal, and the South Durham Steel Works employing 1,700 men closed down.  Most of the. blast furnaces in the Tyneside area, comprising the district covered by Middlesbrough,
Stockton, Hartlepools and Redcar, ceased work. Shipbuilding on both the Tyne and the Tees was unaffected. No disturbances have been reported in the Division. Mass meetings of ex-soldiers have expressed sympathy with the railwaymen, but it is suspected in some quarters that these meetings were packed.Shortage of Labour.-The Sowerby Ellison Glass Works, Gateshead, are seriously handicapped by lack of skilled labour.Shortage of Transport and Materials. Messrs. J. Cook &amp; Sons, Colliery Engineers, Washington, report great difficulty^ in getting delivery of steel bars and timber for the making of colliery tubs. Messrs. W. Swinburne &amp; Company, Metal Founders and General Engineers, Wallsend, the Dunstan Engineering Works, Dunstan, and the Metallurgical Company, Limited, Walker Gate, complain of serious delays in transport. Attention is again, called to the acute congestion at the goods station, South Shields.Lack of Housing Accommodation. The shortage of houses is seriously affecting the number of people employed by Messrs. J. Cook &amp; Sons, Colliery Engineers, Washington. This firm has made unsuccessful endeavours to rent from the Disposal Board 30 brick cottages standing empty at Usworth Aerodrome. The Grange Iron Works, Limited, Durham, could absorb over 100 additional men, if houses were available.Effects of Ironmoulders&apos; Strike. Messrs. Teesdale Brothers, Agricultural and General Engineers, Darlington, the Dunstan Engine Works, Dunstan, and Messrs. Head, Wright-son &amp; Company, Thornaby, report the serious effect on their work of the ironfounders&apos; strike.New Developments. Extensions are being made to the ship-repairing works of Messrs. T. Nicholson, Limited, Friars Goose, Felling. Messrs. Parsons &amp; Company, Heaton, Newcastle, have a large scheme in hand which extends their business to locomotive engineering. A conference has been held at Berwick to discuss plans for the development of the local fishing industry. The Employment Council is pressing for further informa-tion as to the Ministry of Munitions&apos; intention regarding the future of Gretna Factory.North-Western.Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the 19th September shows a substantial decrease of 4,80.1, of which 3,285 are men and 1,516 women. Thirteen areas record a general decrease of over 100, the outstanding ones being Manchester (1,388), Bolton (967), Liverpool (576), Chester (347), Wigan (284) and Blackburn (284). Investiga-tion has proved that 90 per cent, of the workers now out in the engineering industry are out entirely through the foundry strike, as the majority of firms in the area buy their castings locally and to that extent are independent of railway transport.The Railway Strike. The general position in the area remained quiet in spite of the Tailway strike and no disturbances of any sort were reported.General. There is a danger of trouble in the building trade owing to the National Conciliation Board&apos;s refusal to deal with the men&apos;s demand for 2s. per hour, until those who are out on strike return to work.Wales.Unemployment. The total decrease on the live register for the week ending the 19th September amounts to 335, of which 246 are men and 89 women. It is anticipated that the ironfounders&apos; strike will not begin to be acutely felt until a week or so after the railway-men have resumed work, as the railway strike itself so seriously affected many works that the stacks of castings could not be touched&apos;.The Railway Strike. The railway strike threw many thousands of men into enforced idleness miners, steel and tin-plate workers and various grades of port and dock labour. The coalfield was completely cut off from the seaports except by road transport. The only important industry not affected was ship repairing. It appears that the strike decision came as a great surprise to most railwaymen, and they were not aware that there was a serious dispute between the Executive and the Government until the strike threat was made. The fact that sympathetic action would involve calls upon strike funds and disqualify for unemployment benefit has had a steadying effect upon labour outside the strike. Among the South Wales miners, resolutions of sympathy with the railwaymen were adopted at a few meetings, and sympathetic action was threatened in some quarters, if blackleg labour was employed to remove coal stacked on colliery premises. When a local strike of railwaymen forced a number of collieries in South Wales to stop work in September, 1918, the Coal Controller ruled that the war-wage of 3s. per day was payable in cases where workmen were ready to work but withheld from doing so by causes beyond
their own control. Instructions were accordingly issued to the coalowners to pay. The miners who were thrown out of employment this week have again demanded payment of this war-wage. The Coal Controller, however, has decided that it is not payable, but that the men are to receive out-of-work benefit. The matter is to be brought up before the next delegate conference of the coalfield.Impediments to Production. The following are reported as the chief factors impeding production in this division (1) sectional strikes ; (2) shortage of railway wagons and transport difficulties ; (3) shortage of housing accommodation ; (4) shortage of skilled labour, principally in the building trade ; (5) high cost of building materials.Training. Basket making, mat making, catering, tailoring, boot and shoe repairing, sign writing and lettering, are under consideration at Colwyn Bay as trades suitable for the training of disabled men. &apos;New Developments-It is reported that a recently formed Fuel Company intends to erect a large works at Llanelly. After a stoppage of 18 months due to fire, the Pacific Fuel Company, Swansea, has resumed production. New flour mills are to be erected at Cardiff. Maesteg reports that five local authorities are projecting a combination for a joint sewerage scheme at a cost of  258,000. In order to ease the labour situation at Pembroke, the Admiralty is sending a light cruiser to the dockyard for completion. It is also proposed to use this dockyard for mercantile reconditioning as far as possible. A new line of steamers is shortly to start between Newport and Antwerp, and also between Newport and the North French ports.General. From Dowlais it is reported that although the notices to 2,000 workers at Messrs. Guest, Keen &amp; Nettlefolds expired on the 27th September, the firm have decided to keep certain departments and workpeople working on day-to-day contracts. At Neath,, the Tinplate Employers are prepared to extend the 12^ per cent, increase to the whole trade, provided that the men who first received it will make no further claim.Scotland.Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the 19th September shows a total decrease of 2,064, which represents 1,411 men and 653 women. The fall is.most noticeable at Glasgow (1,126), Inverness (372) and Paisley (192). At Renfrew a good num-ber of men among skilled trades in the shipbuilding and engineering industries-riveters, caulkers, platers and boilermakers are out of work. At Stirling most of the men on the live register are miners for whom there are no vacancies in the pits in the locality. At Clydebank there is an increase in the number of women on the live register as a result of dismissals at Messrs. Beardmore &amp; Co., Ltd. It is reported that unemployment is rife among the general labouring classes.The Railway Strike. The railway strike caused Iron and Steel Foundries, Glass Factories and Smithy Shops everywhere to close down. But Shipbuilding and Engineering Yards in the East of Scotland and on the upper branches of the Clyde continued at work. The Parliamentary Committee of the Scottish Trades Union Congress and the Glasgow Trades and Labour Council both approved of resolutions in similar terms directing their constituents neither to undertake nor to facilitate the undertaking of any work formerly done by railwaymen. This direction was meticulously observed. The A.S.E. engineers left off work in locomotive repair shops. Members of the Scottish Union of Dock Labourers refused to handle goods which normally arrive by rail; and many carters of the Horse and Motormen&apos;s Association carried the principle to extreme lengths. The Lanarkshire Miners&apos; Union instructed its members to cease work at mines where coal was being binged. But, contrariwise, the Fife Miners&apos; Association accepted Mr. Smillie&apos;s recommendation to permit such work pending the determination of a policy by the Miners&apos; Federation. The rank and file appeared instinctively to feel that Trade Unionism was being challenged. They blamed the N.U.R. leaders for affecting the methods of secret, diplomacy and were keenly aware that in the long run they could not win against the sober and considered opposition of their fellow citizens. Employers generally believed that the Government was fighting their battle and thought that the result would be decisive; for their position in industry. On all hands the withholding of the railwaymen&apos;s wages&apos; was deplored. As the strike lengthened, public opinion became perceptibly more hesitant over the issues, feeling that the dispute was too real and wide to be regarded as a revolu-tionary and anarchist conspiracy.Shortage of Labour-kt Dunfermline and Renfrew, there is a shortage of building tradesmen. At Glasgow there is an urgent need for skilled workers in the fancy box-making trade. At Dundee, bricklayers are still wanted for housing work. Dilution has been suggested, but it is believed that this will not be sanctioned by the Building Trades Union..
Shortage of Transport and Materials. Complaints of shortage of material come in a general form from Leith and Renfrew. At Arbroath. the definite shortage of raw flax is instanced. At Wick, the barrel-making industry is absolutely at a standstill, owing to shortage of wood for staves and practically the whole of the coopers are unemployed. Delay in the delivery of machinery is hindering the full working of the Morton Carpet Manufacturing Company, at Stirling. At Alloa, some hundreds of men are out of work owing to insufficient supplies of electric power. .Special Impediments to Production. At Stirling it is reported that Lord Leverhulme is not taking further steps in connection with the proposal to grow willows for basket * making, owing to the strong opposition made by the crofters in the district.  A committee of coal trimmers at Leven has raised objections to the employment as miners of men alleged to have been formerly coal-trimmers, and a strike of coal trimmers is threatened.Employment of Discharged and Disabled Men. Motherwell Employment Committee suggests that the figure of 5 per cent, disabled men as proposed in the National Scheme is too high for the iron and. steel industry in view of the nature of the trade, but that dis-abled men on a 5 per cent, basis or even higher could be absorbed in the carriage and wagon building industry, this, however, involving the displacement of physically fit men. Storna-way Employment Committee has passed a resolution, calling upon, the Ministry of Pensions to substitute disabled ex-Service men for others who have not served with the Forces.Training. Owing to Trade Union disapproval, the suggested training of women in dressmaking at Kilmarnock has been dropped. Glasgow Women&apos;s Sub-Committee has appointed a sub-committee to make arrangements for a scheme for the training of women in the tailoring trades. The training of men in motor mechanics and motor engineering at Lewis is proposed at Stornaway. Rutherglen Employment Committee calls upon the Government to take immediate steps to absorb by means of training schemes all men in receipt of 40 per cent, disablement pension and over, who are unable to follow their former occupations. &apos;New Developments-Tltie Morton Carpet Manufacturing Company, in Stirling, has a large factory which promises to absorb a great number of women. Permission to work in two shifts has been granted to the Crown Rug and Carpet Manufacturing Company under D.O.R.A., and the success of the firm depends upon the extended permission of this order. A new hosiery factory will begin at Falkirk in two weeks. The Scottish Employment Council has passed a resolution urging the necessity of the taking of immediate steps by the Government to carry out the recommendations of the Interim Report of the Water-Power Resources Committee, especially with reference to the schemes for Lochs Awe and Nani[Part VI. Disputes. (a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.Buijding and Allied Trades.Bricklayers, Edinburgh. A number of bricklayers employed in Lanarkshire steel works have come out on strike for 9d. an hour increase. A complete stoppage of the works is threatened unless a settlement is reached.Mining and Quarrying.Goaf, Mines, Coalburn. It is reported that the dispute at the Coalburn Colliery over starting time has been settled but no details are forthcoming. The lock-out has lasted since the 16th July and involved 2,000 men.Metal, Engineering and Shipbuilding.Ironfounders. No material change in the situation has occurred since the beginning of the railway strike. The National Strike Committee which consists of the Executive of three Trade Unions The Friendly Society of Ironfounders, the Amalgamated Society of Core-Makers and the Iron, Steel and Metal Dressers&apos; Trade Society held a meeting in Manchester on the 8th inst., and resumed the activities which were suspended during the railway strike. This meeting considered the possibility of bringing about a meeting with the employers, especially in view of the offer of several non-Federated Firms to pay the 15s. advance demanded by the men. Reports were submitted from various centres of the strike and dealt with by the Com-mittee. Large numbers of men engaged on engineering work of one kind or another have been discharged or have received notice of discharge during the week. In the Newcastle District the Strike Committee has arranged for the men to be addressed at a series of meetings.
Railway Wagon Building.Horbury Junction. In connection with the dispute at Messrs. Charles Roberts &amp; Co., Horbury Junction (see Report for week ending the 24th September, p. 275), a conference was held at the works on the 22nd September, when a provisional agreement was come to and work resumed pending a final settlement.  See also Part V (1), p. 311.Cardiff. Practically the whole of the men employed in the wagon building and repairing trade at Cardiff came out on strike at the beginning of last week. The trouble has arisen out of an alleged attempt on the part of the employers to force the men to work on an unsatisfactory price list. The men are members of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Vehicle Builders, Wheelwrights, &amp;c, and, the Union District Secretary states that the employers rejected a sugges-tion to suspend the putting into effect of their decision regarding the price list pending a joint conference.  It is probable that the dispute will extend over the whole of South Wales.Ship Painters, Shipwrights, &amp;c.London Docks. A settlement of the dispute with regard to the employment of unskilled labour on certain work which led to a lock-out of about 2,000 ship painters and shipwrights at the Port of London Docks on the 9th September was settled on the 20th September, the men agreeing to accept the arrangement which has prevailed as from the 1st July, 1919, and which admits this practice on certain terms.Woodworkers (Engineering).Ipswich. The strike of 144 men employed by Messrs. Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jefferies, Ltd., which began on the 4th June, in connection with a demand for the abolition of the premium bonus system, was settled on the 27th September, the majority of the men resuming work on the old terms.Jewellery Trade.Birmingham. A strike of approximately 1,000 employees in the jewellery trade began on the 3rd inst. owing to the refusal of master jewellers to recognise the National Union of Gold and Silver and Allied Trades.Textile.Weavers, etc.: Carlisle. A settlement of the strike of 100 weavers, winders and other skilled and unskilled textile workers employed at Messrs. Thos. Brown &amp; Co., Ltd., Albion Mills, which began on the 26th September was reached on the 29th when the men returned to work.Spinners : Nottingham.-T!h.e threatened strike of 1,300 cotton spinners employed by Messrs. Wm. Hollins &amp; Co., of Nottingham and Pleasley (see Report for week ending the 1st October, p. 295), took place on the 8th inst.Transport.Railwaymen. (See Part IV.) Woodworking.Furniture Trade Lock-Out. In consequence of the Railway Strike no information is available regarding the acceptance by the men of the agreement arranged by the Joint Industrial Council. It is stated in the Press that 400 Nottingham furniture workers resumed yesterday (after being locked out for 11 weeks), on the concession by the employers of an advance of 2d. an hour.Food, Drink and Tobacco.Baking: Ireland. The disputetin the Irish Bakery Trade which led to a lock-out of London-deny operative bakers on the 27th September was settled on the 30th, the men having agreed that the points in dispute shall be referred to arbitration.(b) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.Mining and Quarrying.Shale Oil Mining: Scotland. The dispute in the Scottish Shale Oil Industry was settled on the 26th inst., without a stoppage. Por the terms of the settlement, see Part V (1), p. 311. It is reported that Mr. Robert Simpson, the agent for the Scottish Shale Miners, has resigned his position because the settlement does not meet with the approval of a considerable section of the miners and oil workers.
, Textile.Woolcombers. The second ballot of the woolcombers on the offer of the employers relating to wages and overtime has resulted in a majority for the acceptance of the offer, the votes numbering 6,978 for and 3,085 against the proposals. The terms include a weekly increase of 6s. Id. for men and is. id. for women and youths, to be granted on the ratable wages paid to wool-combing operatives and warehousemen in 1918, with a system for overtime working on a definite basis, overtime to be paid in accordance with the terms of the existing overtime agreement.Go-operative Employees.In connection with the dispute in the North-Western Area over the interpretation of a wages clause in the recent agreement, a joint conference was to have been held in Manchester on the 27th inst. This was postponed, however, until after the settlement of the railway strike.R. S.
