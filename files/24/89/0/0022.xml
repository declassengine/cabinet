G.T. 8222.

THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE TO BE HELD AT WASHINGTON? OCTOBER 1919? UNDER PART 13 OF THE PEACE TREATY WITH GERMANY.

Memo by Mr.G.N.Barnes. (Previous paper G.T. 7998)

1. The Government delegates to the above Conference will require instructions as to the line they should take on the subjects which are to be discussed at Washington. I have already put forward a paper on this subject. (G.T.7998)

2. Arrangements for the holding of the Conference are alMost complete, and I shall be glad to receive the sanction of the Cabinet to the proposals contained in the attached sheet.

In making these arrangements three groat difficulties havo arisen owing to the fact that

(l) the Unites States Government has not yot ratified the Peace Treaty;

(2) European Labour has declared itself unwilling to participate unless invitations wore extended to German and Austrian delegates; and

(3) both the Ministry of labour and the Employers&apos; Federation have hesitated to allow their best officials to leave this country in the autumn, when serious labour unrest may arise here.

President Wilson appears to have surmounted the first difficulty and has definitely committed himself to holding the Conference in October at Washington.

The second difficulty has been met by the recent decision of the Supreme Council to leave the question of the admission of the ex-enemy States to be determined by the Conference itself. This decision has been communicated by the american delegation in Paris to the Austrian trad German delegates.

The third difficulty has been overcome by the Employers federation, and I am hopeful that the Ministry of Labour will be able to nominate one or two expert technical advisers on unemployment.
