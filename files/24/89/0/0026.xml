Railwaymen on. behalf of the various grades of railway employees, and it is at the moment the subject of negotiation with, the Government. Similar claims were put forward earlier in the year by the various Unions connected with the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades, and in certain cases by Unions having members in other industries. Under the agreements for regulating wages in these trades, the claims were not discussed, between the Trade Unions and the employers, but were referred to the Interim Court of Arbitration. Coupled with the claims was a demand for an increase in wages, but at the time that the claims were heard the &quot; cost of living &quot; figures shoAved a considerable fall, as compared Avith the date of the last advance, and a good deal of the discussion upon the several claims was devoted to the request for consolidation. The awards of the Court of Arbitration did not grant consolidation, the Court taking the view that, having regard to the special terms of the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act-which in effect grants a form of consolidation for the period of that Act-they were not in a position to concede the claim. It may be that, apart from the terms of the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act, the Court were influenced also by the practical consideration that the proposal of the Unions was one which ought to be discussed and settled between the employers and the Unions directly. The task of consolidating war advances into rates of wages in the case of time workers could be reduced to a matter of simple arithmetic, but to attempt to &quot; consolidate &quot; the advances and bonuses that have been given in the case of the various classes of pieceworkers in the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades would be a task of extreme difficulty. A different percentage upon piece price lists would have to be given for almost every section of pieceworkers in the trade con-concerned, and the matter is obviously one which requires to be discussed and adjusted by the employers and workpeople themselves.There is, however, a broader consideration, namely, the extent to which employers will be prepared at the present time to concede consolidation of this kind either at all or without some very definite quid pro quo. The result of the war advances has been very greatly to increase the cost of production, and it may be that without some con-current readjustment of conditions the industries concerned could not continue to stand the effect of the very high, rates.There is no doubt that the members of the Unions are very much concerned at the position of insecurity which exists in relation to the continuance of the war wages, and at the present time it is probable that more importance is attached to this question than to a claim for any increase in the amount of the wages.The Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation, the Amalgamated Society of Engineers and the National Federation of General Workers have recently placed before the Minister of Labour their views about the desirability of securing the consolidation of war advances and war bonuses into permanent rates of wages. The Minister pointed out to the deputation that it had been the intention of the Government that the period during which, the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act was to operate should be utilised by employers and Trade Unions to get together to determine for them-selves the methods by which wages questions should be adjusted in future, and the arrangements whereby the present level of wages should be considered and, where necessary, adjusted. It was evident that the question of the readjustment of base rates of wages by means of the incorporation of war advances and war bonuses was one which could most properly and most suitably be discussed and settled by the employers and workpeople in the various trades. Some progress in this direction has been made by a number of Joint Industrial Councils. The Ministry are drawing the attention of Employers&apos; Associations and the Trade Unions to the importance of considering this matter, and it is to be hoped that in the near future the various joint bodies will be induced to give it consideration.
Fart II. Departmental.The Work of the Employment Exchanges.The fact that the work of the Employment Exchanges during the period of resettle-ment has of necessity not been of a spectacular nature should not be allowed to obscure its fundamental importance in the work which has fallen to the lot of the Ministry of Labour during this period. The Exchanges have conducted their operations under circumstances of considerable difficulty. In addition to their primary functions of co-ordinating labour supply and demand by bringing into touch employers with work to offer and workers seeking for employment, and of providing through the Un-employment Insurance scheme for certain of those for whom it was temporarily impossible to provide work, the Exchanges were called on from the time of the Armistice to put into application the out-of-work donation scheme, and to establish such contact with the dispersal centres as to ensure that due touch was kept with all discharged ex-Service men who might benefit by the facilities for employment which the Exchanges could oner. They have had also to take special measures to secure the reinstatement of disabled men in civil life, and have been called upon to co-operate in the application of the Scheme for the resumption of interrupted apprenticeships and the various training schemes for dis-abled men and for unemployed women inaugurated by the Ministry. The activities of the Local Employment Committees have also involved additional work by Exchange officials. This expansion of their normal activities had. necessarily to be carried through with the assistance of augmented and, in part, comparatively untrained staff. As regards the special activities of the Exchanges in connection with the resettlement of the de-mobilised members of the Forces, it will be remembered that by the beginning of September approximately 3,200,000 men (other than commissioned officers) and nearly 59,000 women have been demobilised. The amount of work involved&apos;in the application of the out-of-work donation system may be estimated to some degree, when it is remembered that the number of recipients of donation rose rapidly to a little over a million at the beginning of May, while the progressive decline in numbers since that date, which by the 5th September had reduced the number of recipients of whole-time donation to a little under 450,000, has been offset to a certain extent by an elaboration of the provisions of the scheme, which (has rendered its application a more complicated and difficult task. In their final Report the Committee of Inquiry into the scheme have stated that the staff work on the whole Jias been exceedingly good. &quot; While dissatisfaction has been expressed by a few witnesses with the treatment received by applicants for donation, there is a consensus of opinion that in general the local officials discharge their duties with zeal and intelligence.&quot;As regards the registration and placing of labour during this period of resettlement, when in addition, to the flooding of a dislocated market by some 3-1 million members of the Forces, it is estimated that approximately 3 million munition workers found them-selves called upon to discover new occupations, some statistical measure may be given of the successful work performed by the Exchanges. The number of applicants for employ-ment with whom the Exchanges have been called&apos; upon to deal, has naturally been exceptionally large. The live register for the United Kingdom stood on the 25th April at approximately .1,190,000 for men and women alone, of whom nearly 657,000 were men and 533,000 women. By the 16th May the total had fallen to a little over l,037,000,the number of men standing at 637,000, and number of women at 400,000. By the 13th June the total had declined for men and women to 793,000, of whom 564,000 were men and 229,000 women. On the 18th July the total live register, including boys and girls, stood only at 695,000, of whom 505,000 were men, while the number of women had fallen to 162,000. On the loth August the live register was reduced to 655,000, the number of men being approximately 491,000, and the number of women only a little in excess of 129,000. By the 12th September the total live register had. fallen again by over 100,000, the figure then standing at nearly 545,000. Of these 419,000 were men, and the number of women had been reduced to 100,000. Since the high-water mark of unemployment at the end of April, therefore, the number of men for whom the Exchanges have been called(C .1893) 20 2
upon to provide work has fallen by over a third, while that of women has been reduced by four-fifths.*The reduction in the live register is naturally dependent upon the general improve-ment in the economic position, in which the facilities for the ready provision of labour by the Exchanges form only one small factor. The records of placings by the Exchanges show, however, that this factor should not be neglected. Throughout the period &apos; he Exchanges have placed, week by week a number of applicants for work which has remained singularly constant. Excluding exceptional.periods such, as holiday weeks, during which the total number of placings has on occasion fallen as low as .17,000, the weekly placings for the United Kingdom have oscillated about a- round figure of 25,000. Of this total it may be said, with sufficient accuracy that men have accounted for a proportion lying between 12,000 and 13,000, and women for a figure in the neighbourhood of 7,000. The highest point reached may be taken as roughly 30,000, a figure which was attained in the middle of June. During the last three weeks for which the figures are available, the total number of placings for the United Kingdom has been 26,400, 25,300 and 23,600 in round numbers, the placings having shown, some tendency to decline since the middle of August.The number of fresh vacancies notified by employers to the Exchanges has, however, varied rather more considerably. Again excluding holiday periods, however, it has fallen below 35,000 only for three weeks since the middle of June, the highest figure reached being nearly 46,000 for the week ending the 20th June, and the lowest a little under 32,000 for the week ending the 25th July. During the last three weeks for which figures are available, the totals have been approximately 37,000, 35,000, and 36,000.In view, however, of the fact that the number of vacancies at the disposal of employers inevitably varies considerably, it is obviously not possible to indicate statistically the extent to which employers are giving the co-operation which, is necessary for the full success of Employment Exchange work. It may on the whole be said confidently that the earlier prejudices which tended to hamper the operations of the Exchanges, and which still echo occasionally in the Press, are steadily being removed. One small, indication of this change may be gathered from the fact that the largest firm of drapers in the West End have recently promised to notify all their vacancies to the Employment Exchanges before resorting to newspaper advertisements as a means of filling them. The publicity campaign which has been conducted in recent months has not been without effect, and local reports show that Exchange officials are showing much enterprise and energy in their endeavours to extend the scope of Exchange utility. From a general point of view the activities of the Exchanges form at the present time a useful indication of the progress of the return to peace-time activities. The facts recorded above, especially the statistics showing the constant character both of the demands made by employers and of the numbers of vacancies filled week by week, are strong evidence that this is now going forward suc-cessfully.Part III.-Pe.ess Comments.(1) Labour and Socialist Press. (A) Imperial and Foreign Affairs.Russia.Special articles in &quot; Justice,&quot; &quot; The Call,&quot; the Nation,&quot; the &quot; New Statesman &quot; and the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; deal with Russian policy, as reconsidered in the light of the so-called Bullitt &quot; disclosures &quot; and the announcements with &quot;regard to British and Allied policy, which were appearing in the daily press last week.  Mr. Hyndman, in &quot; Justice,&quot;* The live register in itself does not necessarily provide a complete register of unemployment; thus during August and the early weeks of September it is known that a considerable number of workpeople have been unemployed in consequence of the coal shortage, caused by the Yorkshire miners&apos; strike, who have not registered for employment at the Exchanges.
America.The &quot; New Statesman&quot; records with obvious pleasure the act of the American Miners&apos; Conference in endorsing the so-called &quot; Plumb Plan &quot; and in determining to for-mulate a policy on similar lines for the national ownership and joint control of the American coal mines. Dr. F. C. Conybeare continues in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; his review of President Wilson&apos;s policy at Paris, and imagines the arguments that were used there to achieve what he thinks has been a conversion of the United States into a satellite of the British Empire. He states that &quot; the insaner of our Imperialists &quot; desire an immediate war with America, and then proceeds to outline what might be the comse of such a war.declares that, though he hates the Bolshevik regime in Russia, he is convinced that the immediate withdrawal of our troops from &quot;Russia is imperative. He suggests that it is time that all the members of the Cabinet were impeached &quot; for the crime they have com-mitted and the ruin they have wrought.&quot; Nevertheless, he thinks we should recognise and &quot; morally support &quot; the popular Governments which have been established in various parts of Russia, &quot; against and in spite of Bolshevism,&quot; but he omits to state which are these Governments. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; makes an attack upon the Secretary of State for War and suggests that he wishes to adopt a plan by which Von der Goltz who is stated to be in Courland with a force of 100,000 men should be used to destroy the Soviet Government. Therefore, the &quot; New Statesman &quot; believes that &quot; his departure from office is crucial, and until that event takes place, the public will do well to discount any statements and declarations purporting to assure them that our policy in Russia has been changed in any essential respect.&quot; The &quot; Nation &quot; expresses the opinion that the military situation of the Bolsheviks is likely to improve, and nothing is to be gained by delaying &quot; recognition of peace.&quot; This paper suggests that the world will have to adjust itself to the permanence of the Soviet system in Russia and remarks that &quot; much that has been denounced as a vice in that system is not peculiarly Bolshevik, but simply Russian.&quot; The Soviet Government is complimented on its administration, on the work it has done in education and science, and on its policy of giving the land to the peasants. Mr. Joseph King, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; maintains that &quot; in the 1919 campaign Lenin has won handsomely,&quot; and that, unless Russia herself wishes it, the Soviets will not fall. The leaders of the independent Liberals are blamed in this article for not protesting against expeditions to Russia until &quot; the Soviets, under the two most remarkable geniuses of the war, had won,&quot; and the Secretary of State for War is exonerated from the whole respon-sibility for the expeditions. In &quot; The Call,&quot; Mr. V. Lantern is similarly jubilant. Never-theless, in spite of his belief in the victory of the Moscow government, he does not think the matter is yet at an end and warns the members of the B.S.P. that the action of British workers must be &quot;directed not merely towards securing the evacuation of British troops from, Russia, but to the more comprehensive purpose of preventing &quot;any aid, either in shape of men, munitions or money being given to the foes of the workers of Russia, Hungary or any other European country,&quot;The evidence that Mr. Bullitt has given before the Foreign Relations Committee of the American Senate is dealt with at considerable length in the &quot; Nation,&quot; and in the I.L.P. papers a paragraph on the matter circulated by the Labour News service appears. These express implicit trust in his word. The &quot; British Citizen &quot; expresses complete satisfaction with the description of his evidence as &quot; a tissue of lies.&quot; With regard to the internal condition of Russia, the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; publishes an account, supplied by the &quot; Peoples Russian Information Bureau &quot; of the duties and policy of the Russian &quot; Peopled Commissariat for Social Welfare,&quot; and. an account of the Bolshevik policy towards the Church and Education. In the &quot; Democrat,&quot; Mr. W. A. Appleton tells of the recent visit to the offices of the G.F.T.TJ. of three Russian Socialists who each were opposed to the evacution of the British troops in Russia, and suggests that a, good defence of Koltchak may exist. He calls upon the Government to overcome its fear of the &quot; direct actionists,&quot; or else to resign office. He refers to the history of the police strikes in Liverpool and Boston. (U.S.A.) to show that the anarchy that has characterised the Bolshevik regime in Russia must not be thought impossible in England in certain eventuali-ties, and summons the Government to adopt a firm attitude and policy. &quot; Anything is better than indefiniteness and indecision.&quot; In this paper, also, M. tssaiev concludes his analysis of the economic policy of the Moscow Government. He argues that the Bolshe-vists have found it necessary to revert in some measure to the methods of production in vogue under the old regime. He does not think, however, that even such measures will save Russian industries from annihilation, so long as the Bolshevists retain power.
Australia.A Melbourne correspondent to the &quot; New Statesman.&quot; deals with the situation in Australia. He praises the smoothness and the speed with which the work of demobilisa-tion was carried out.&apos; All the other aspects of Australian life, however, in his opinion reveal confusion and sectarian strife. To heal this confusion in politics he hopes for the elimination of Mr. Hughes and for a revival of the progressive tradition, which he states was inaugurated by the first Federal Liberal Party, and afterwards assumed by the Labour Party. He shows some fear of a possible assumption by Mr. Ryan, the Queensland Prime Minister, of the leadership of the Federal Labour Party, because he thinks Mr. Ryan&apos;s advent might make certain a partnership, more or less formal, between the Labour Party and the Roman Catholic organisation as inspired by Archbishop Mannix. Such a partner-ship be thinks would only increase the sectarian strife which he asserts to be now prevalent in Australia. In the industrial world he similarly regrets the importance which more or less academic discussions of Socialist theory have. He records that the movement to form the Labour unions into &quot; One Big Union &quot; has failed, and that the course of the shipping strike showed an absence of Bolshevist feeling among the workers. Therefore he thinks that Australian Labour Leaders should cease repeating the &quot; old conventional threadbare &quot; formulas and concentrate upon providing a constructive solution of the social issue.Other.Lord Loreburns book on the origins of the war attracts the attention of Mr. F. W. Jowett, in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer (Mr. Jowett confines himself to quoting extracts from the review of the book in last week&apos;s &quot; Nation &quot;), and Mr. P. Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader.&quot; Mr. Snowden regards the book as a scathing indictment of Viscount Grey&apos;s foreign policj^. He recommends the book to the attention of Professor Gilbert Murray, who, however, makes some reply in the &quot; Nation&quot; to this paper&apos;s review of the book. The &quot;New Statesman&quot; expresses the opinion that it is to everybody&apos;s interests that Germany and Austria should be fully represented at the forthcoming International Labour Convention at Washington. &quot; The Call&quot; contains an article denouncing British. Rule in India from the pen of Mr. Manabrenda Nath Roy. Mr. Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; calls for the immediate creation of an International Coal Commission to ensure a fair distribution of the world supplies of coal, and. secondly for the establishment of inter-national credits for the benefit of the impoverished enemy countries.(B) Home Affairs.Trades Union Congress *The Trades Union Congress meeting at Glasgow is dealt with in all papers. &quot; The Call &quot; and the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; are enthusiastic. Mr. G-. Ebury, in &quot; The Call,&quot; refers to the Congress as the fl great Congress.&quot; He compares it with past Congresses and describes it as a &quot; revolution.&quot; He believes that it has accepted and established the principle of &quot; Direct Action.&quot; Similarly the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; regards the Nationalisation, Conscription and Russia resolutions as marking a new era, in that they lay down the principle that &quot; Conference decisions must be followed by action.&quot; The &quot; Socialist,&quot; however, is less pleased with the proceedings of the conference. In the opinion of this paper, though at the Congress much may have been said about &quot; compelling the Government,&quot; the means by which the Congress might enforce its will were never indicated clearly. The Triple Alliance leaders, it is hinted, have really made a blunder in taking the issues of nationalisation, &amp;c, to the T.U.C. &quot; from a fighting organisation.&quot; This paper has no hope that put of the T.U.C. may procedure the Social Revolution, and therefore presses for a &quot; reorganisation of the worker in terms of industry.&quot; u Neglect this reorganisa-tion ; untold delay and suffering are the inevitable result.&quot; The I.L.P. papers are much more temperate in their judgments. They are more interested in the details of the work-ing of the Congress than in stating their opinions of its worth as an institution to the  , -  * Of. Report, 17th. September, pp. 235-237, 242-243, 246-248.
Socialist movement.  Mr. F. W. Jowett, in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; deals with the failure of the miners to secure representation on the Parliamentary Committee.   This he attri-butes to the block method of voting which enabled those unions, who were aggrieved at the decision of the miners not to support the return of such old members as Messrs. Sexton, Gosling, and Stuart-Bunning, to form combinations to exclude the miners altogether. He hopes that the Proportional Representation method of voting, which will be used next year, will prevent the recurrence of such incidents.   The &quot; Labour Leader&quot; rehearses the terms of the Nationalisation resolution which, in the view of this paper, puts the miners in a position to force this question to an issue.   The &quot; Cotton. Factory Times &quot; deals with the decision of the Congress with the action of the Parliamentary Com-mittee in refusing to summon a special conference to discuss the- Russian and Allied questions and with the composition of the new Committee.   This paper defends the action of the Committee, suggests that the Congress was wrong in thinking that the Committee, acted on mere caprice and that the Congress in coming to its decision was influenced by sentimental motives.   With reference to the composition of the new Parliamentary Committee, it is explained that the miners lost representation on it because of their decision not to vote for any of the members of the Committee who had resisted the calling of a special conference.  In another article in this paper, it is suggested that the Trades Union Congress is as much in need of reform as the House of Lords, and that one useful step would be to reduce the number of delegates to 300 and thus to make it a deliberative assembly rather than a public meeting.  Mr. T. Johnston, editor of &quot; Forward.&quot; discusses in his paper the direct action debates.  He regards them, as most uninstructive and unimpressive.  He shows most approval of Mr. Frank Hodges&apos; speech, and says that he was quite correct in demanding that the issue of direct action should be settled upon a specific question, but Mr. Johnston fears that Mr. Hodges always had at the back of his mind not a specific question, but a general social revolution.  Mr. Johnston lays down the rule that direct action is justifiable by a majority in a democracy when a minority prevents the majority from exercising its will, and proceeds to demonstrate that on the Russian and Conscription issues direct action is justifiable.  &quot; Rob Roy,&quot; in the same paper, adopts a different attitude and asks this question,&quot; If a class lurried in ignorance (Mr. Hodges&apos; phrase) in December, 1918, went wrong politically, is the lapse - of a few months going to put it right when it votes in its trade union lodges on a method which it has not had time fully to consider, and which involves a enormous break with the past methods of organised labour ?&quot;   He again recalls M. Jaures&apos; opposition to the French scheme of direct action.  In the &quot; Clarion,&quot; Mr. R. B. Suthers (the financial expert of this paper) discusses the proposal put forward at the Trade Union Congress for thenational-isation of the banks.   He criticises in detail an. article in the &quot; Morning Post&quot; on this subject and argues that the time has come for the State control of the financial system of the country.  Mr. W. Thorne, M.P., in &quot; Justice,&quot; recommends Mr. Stuart-Bunning&apos;s presidential address.   He considers that every organisation affiliated to the T.U.C. should take a vote of its members as to whether they are prepared to strike for the nationalisation of mines, &amp;c, in order that the Congress might come to a clear decision upon the direct action question.   He describes the Congress as the greatest labour assembly that has ever been held in this or any other country, referring, however, only to the number of trade unionists represented.   The &quot; New Age &quot; discusses the resolution in favour of the national-isation of the banking system and asks &quot; if the State cannot now control the relatively dispersed power of finance, who shall control the State when the concentrated power of finance is in its hands ?&quot;   The &quot; Nation &quot; thinks the Congress was right in avoiding committing itself to any dangerous generalisation for or against direct action in the abstract. At the same time its proceedings, in the opinion of this paper, have made it certain not only that every effort will be made to exhaust all other methods before direct action is resorted to, but also that direct action, if and when it becomes necessary, will be directed towards an appeal to the country rather than to the enforcement of any limited specific-object.   The &quot; British Citizen &quot; would seem to have arrived at the same view of the Con-gress proceedings as the u Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; and &quot; The Call.&quot;   &quot; Trade unionism: as represented by the T.U.C. has claimed the right to force its will upon the community whether the constitutional representative body of the people agrees or does not agree to its views.&quot;  Reference is made to the preponderating influence of the extremists among the delegates, and sympathy is expressed with Mr. Havelock Wilson in his failure to prevent the Congress from passing its resolution on the nationalisation of the mines.The Political Outlook..This week&apos;s papers discuss the political outlook in the light of three events, the Widnes by-election result, the publication of   The Future,&quot; and the negotiations rumoured in.
the Press between the Prime Minister and certain Labour leaders. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; congratulates Mr. Henderson on &quot; a notable victory &quot; at Widnes, and then proceeds to argue that the fact that Mr. Henderson received a large measure of support from Liberal voters does not mean any corresponding obligation on the part of the Labour Party to stand aside elsewhere for a Liberal candidate. &quot; Justice &quot; is pleased with the result, but thinks that the independence of the Labour Party candidates at general elections has been weakened by the fact that Mr. Henderson received official Liberal support. &quot; The Call&quot; states that Mr. Henderson has received an almost unanimous chorus of congratulation from the Capitalist Press, and suggests that the reason is that Mr. Henderson is a &quot; safe &quot; Labour leader and will assist the Capitalist in patching together the &quot; rotten &quot; Capitalist system. In the &quot; British Citizen,&quot; Mr. J. Terrett hopes that Mr. Henderson&apos;s return will act upon the Coalition and its organisation as &quot; a cold bath of realism.&quot; The &quot; New Statesman &quot; hopes that Mr. Henderson in the coming session will be found in his proper place as leader of the Labour Party in the House of Commons. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; attributes the issue of &quot; The Future &quot; to an attempt on the part of the Government to counteract the opposition which he says it is receiving from every neAvspaper in the country, except the &quot; Daily Chronicle.&quot; Mr. A. M. Thompson, in the &quot;Clarion,&quot; states that the Prime Ministers manifesto admits the whole of the &quot; Clarion&apos;s &quot; case against the present industrial system, and suggests that it is plainly hinted in. it that the leaders of Trade Unionism and. the Labour Party will be invited to help in the task of reconstruction. Mr. Thompson hopes that such Labour leaders as Mr. Clynes, Mr. Thomas and Mr. Henderson will help the Prime Minister to secure an instalment of social reform in preference to waiting for an indefinite time for the formation of a purely Labour Government. &quot; Justice &quot; remarks that the distribution of free literature is the most costly and ineffective form of propaganda, and suggests that the programme outlined in &quot; The Future &quot; is an old one and that the people are now looking for performance as well as for programmes. The &quot; British Citizen &quot; welcomes the mani-festo, but emphasises the fact that it is necessary not only that the Prime Minister should receive substantial support in the matter of votes, but even more that each person in the country should make &quot; economy and production &quot; the guiding principles of his conduct. The &quot; New Age &quot; discusses the effect of the nationalisation resolution, of the Trades Union Congress on the political situation. It points out that in the resolution there is nothing to show just what the Congress meant by &quot; the Majority Eeport&quot; of the Sankey Corn-mission. In the opinion of this paper, the worst that can happen to the Government is the concession of nationalisation upon terms ruinous to the miners. A general election fought on the issue, this paper is confident, would result in overwhelming defeat of nationalisation. The &quot; New Age,&quot; however, believes that the Labour Party in an immediate general election might gain some 20 or 40 seats, and suggests that this increase in the number of Labour members of Parliament, and not nationalisation, is the main object, if not the sole motive, &quot; of the political wire pullers &quot; of the Trade Union Congress. Mr. G. W. S. Jarrett* continues in the&apos;eBritish Citizen&quot; his series of articles upon the political situation. He discusses the prospects of an immediate general election, and after reviewing briefly the various groups and parties, states that the only group in the House at present that has a definite programme and the courage to commit that programme to paper, is the National Democratic Party. The N.D.P., he affirms, may be the nucleus of the Party of the future.Ireland.In a leading article, the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; deals with the problem of Ireland. The only positive suggestion, however, as to the policy which ought to be pursued towards Ireland is put in the form of a question,&quot; Are the British people going to tolerate a policy in regard to Ireland which makes a lie of all the professions which have been made during the last five years of a desire to give freedom to small nationalities crushed by the oppression of alien Governments ? &quot; &quot; The Call&quot; is more positive, and. states that the only solution of the Irish question is the immediate granting of. self-determination to the Irish people. In &quot; Justice &quot; the opinion is expressed that the passing of the resolution on Ireland at the T.U.C. was a useless performance. The new Parliamentary Committee, however, are recommended to consult with the Labour Party Executive as to how best they can enter into something like cordial relations with organised labour in Ireland. The &quot; Clarion &quot; makes a similar suggestion.* Cf. ibid., p. 244.
SiIncreased Production.The paper considers that the constant exhortations to produce more are necessary in order that the expenses of reconstruction may be met. Although it considers that strikes may often be justifiable, a. &quot; slow strike&quot; will not help to &quot; earn the money.&quot;Canteen Funds.&quot;f &apos;The paper again expounds its scheme for the allocation of the so-called canteen funds. It advocates that the seven million pounds, which it assumes are available, should provide the basis of a gigantic ex-Service man trust, to be developed on the lines and in the spirit of mutual co-operation, so that all soldiers who have subscribed &quot; may benefit, and. not merely the minority belonging to one or other of the existing organisations. The paper invites the various organisations to state their schemes for the administration of these hinds. The National Union of ex-Service Men has already expressed their view that the funds should be used for the better education of the orphans and for setting up the widows in small businesses.(3) The Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.Tlve Kirufs Proclamation.The Proclamation is welcomed by the &quot; British Citizen.&quot; Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; is doubtful whether the plan for retaining disabled men. in private employment will, in the long run, prove quite satisfactory. A private employer conducts his business for profit, and unless the men are efficient he will always tend to dispense with their services on some excuse or another. Therefore, Mr. Snowden considers that the obligation to ensure employment at the standard rate of wages to these men is one that the State cannot transfer to private individuals.* Gf. ibid, p. 243. f Cf. ibid. p. 245.(C1893) * 2 PIncreased Production.^Mr. W. McLaine contributes yet another article on this question to &quot; The Call.&quot; He quotes from the report of the committee set.up by the Ministry of Reconstructon on Trusts to show that in many industries control of output was a raison cVetre of trade combinations, and repeats the argument that over-production was, before the war, the cause of periodical trade depressions which resulted in acute unemployment. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; discusses the question of payment by results in relation to the furniture trade dispute. The varying opinions on systems of&apos; payment by results, both amongst trade unionists and amongst employers, are recorded, and. the conclusion is drawn that &quot; it is clearly preposterous to treat the case for payment by results as axiomatic or to assume without argument that payment by results necessarily means increased output and lower cost of production,&quot; &quot; The question of payment by results versus time work is one which has to be faced and argued out on the merits of each individual, case,&quot;Other.The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; contains a long article by Sir Leo Chiozza Money dealing with the Royal Commission on Income Tax. Mr. H. M. Hyndman in &quot; Justice &quot; draws atten-tion to the anomalous position of the Ministry of Food where, in his opinion, affairs are drifting into a chaotic state owing to the fact that the Government will not make up its mind as to whether the Ministry shall be permanent or not. It is- quite possible, he thinks, that the Ministers are playing the game of the profiteering capitalists who are anxious to prove that management in the interest of the whole community must be a failure. The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; in a long article discusses the problem of the employment of married women in factories. In an article in the Merthyr &quot; Pioneer,&quot; the miners&apos; leaders are accused of apathy and indifference regarding the appointment of colliery examiners : the writer outlines a scheme by which the examiners should be selected. The &quot; Worker &quot; quotes from a pamphlet issued by the Ministry of Reconstruction, entitled &quot; The Mission of the British Army.&quot; The paper urges that this should be read by every ex-soldier and trade-unionist, alleging that it sets forth &quot; without anv varnish &quot; the policv of the War Office.(2) Ex-Service Men&apos;s Periodicals.The &quot; Ex-Service Man&quot; this week discusses the question of increased production, and the scheme for the allocation of the Canteen Funds.
Part IV.-General Topics.Discharges and Unemployment.In this Report for the 3rd September, it was pointed out that some trouble might be expected as a result of the unemployment that would result from the sudden orders of the Government to cease work on naval and other contracts. In the meantime the policy has been adopted of securing that, as far as possible, such discharges should take place gradually. In spite of this precaution, however, there is considerable unrest, especially in the Dockyard towns and at Woolwich. At Woolwich a committee called the United Unions Discharges Protest Committee was recently formed, and it appointed a deputation which has succeeded in obtaining a personal interview with the Prime Minister. At Chatham the discharges have produced an accusation emanating from Labour circles that the authorities have followed a policy of picking out for discharge active trade union officials, and the suggestion has been made that the Industrial Councils should be boycotted and the Union representatives on the Central Committee withdrawn. In some cases, e.g., at Plymouth, ex-Service men&apos;s organisations are pleading that special consideration should be shown towards ex-Service men. Large numbers of discharges are reported from aircraft manufacturing firms, such as the Handley Page and Martinsyde Companies, and from the National Aircraft Factory, Waddon. It is announced that the Nieuport Aviation Company have closed down entirely. These workers will probably speedily be absorbed in other forms of employment in the woodworking trades.Union of Postal Workers.This body was definitely formed on the 18th inst. by the amalgamation of the Postmen&apos;s Federation, the Postal and Telegraph Clerks&apos; Association, and the Fawcett Association. Last week was a week of conferences for the constituent unions of the new amalgamation. The annual conference of the Postmen&apos;s Federation took place on the 16th and 17th inst. under the presidency of Mr. G. Hodd. Various delegates expressed themselves in strong terms on the housing question. On the question of wages, in connection with which many resolutions were on the agenda, Mr. Stuart-Bunning stated that it had been agreed that in a very short time a general and permanent wages policy would be prepared and sub-mitted on behalf of the new amalgamation. On the 17th inst. a meeting of the Fawcett Association was held. Mr. C. G. Ammon, who presided, urged that democratic control should go hand in hand with national ownership, and stated that they were looking forward to the time when the Post Office would be administered in some part by persons who were engaged in the daily round. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution protesting against the proposed recruitment of special constables from the ranks of Post Office servants. A meeting of the Postal and Telegraph Clerks&apos; Association was also held on the 17th inst.On the 18th inst. the three unions met at a special amalgamating conference. Formal resolutions inaugurating the amalgamation were passed by delegates of each of the com-ponent bodies, and the completion of the long negotiations was hailed with much enthusiasm. For a history of these negotiations see this Report for 14th May, p. 9, the 28th May, p. 9. the 16th July, p. 53, and. the 20th August, p. 164. The amalgamation is of importance .as it brings together into one organisation the three most important unions in this Depart-ment of Labour, and there seems little doubt that some at least of the less important unions will soon seek to merge themselves in the new body, which has a membership of about 110,000. It is stated that this body will adopt the policy of direct Parliamentary action, affiliation with the Labour Party, the Trades Union Congress, and the Scottish and Irish Trades Union Congresses.On the 19th inst.. several resolutions were passed. The Executive Council were instructed to proceed immediately with the preparation of a general wage claim, and to ensure that only one Whitley Council for the Post Office should be established. A com-posite resolution calling for the withdrawal of troops from Ireland and Russia, and for the repeal of the Military Service Acts, and demanding self-government for Ireland, Egypt and India was carried by an overwhelming majority. A proposal was put forward on behalf of the General Executive recommending that Mr. Stuart-Bunning should retain a connection with the Union of Post Office Workers in a consultative capacity at  200 a year. This was defeated by a large majority, and Mr. Stuart-Bunning intimated that he withdrew his name from nomination for the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress. This raises the whole question of Mr. Bunning&apos;s relationship to the Labour movement. There can he little doubt that various activities of his in connection with the T.U.C. have not increased his popularity.
On &quot;the 20th inst. the Conference carried, motions demanding the reinstatement of conscientious objectors in the Post Office Service, and instructing the Executive Committee&apos; to demand the abolition of split attendances. It was agreed to become part owners and controllers with the N.U.R. and the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation of the Central Labour College.  How far this will mean some modification of the C.L.C. remains to be seen.Amalgamation.In connection with, the proposed scheme for the amalgamation of Engineering trade^ unions (see this Report, pp. 164 and 250), the London District Committee of the E.T.U. has passed a resolution declaring that the scheme proposed is detrimental to the interests of the workers in the electrical trade because (1) it perpetuates the craft system of organisa-tion ; and (2) under its constitution no man will be eligible for membership who is employed in the boiler house of a power station, and none of the auxiliary members of the E.T.U. engaged in cable factories, Post Office, etc., will be eligible for membership. The scheme,, therefore, it is feared, will split the industrial organisation of the E.T.U. It is reported that proposals for the amalgamation of the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assist-ants, Warehousemen and Clerks, and the National Association of Grocers&apos; Assistants, have now taken definite form. The members of the Shop Assistants&apos; Union have given a mandate for amalgamation, and the grocers&apos; ballot papers were returned on the 20th inst.. For the amalgamation of postal workers see the&apos; preceding paragraph.Labour Anti-Profiteering Demonstartion.A large demonstration took place on the 21st inst. at Hyde Park organised by the. London Joint Advisory Council of Trade Unionists and Co-operators and the Metropolitan District Co-operative Conference Association, supported by the Co-operative Party,, the London Joint Committee, of Co-operators, the National Labour Party, the London Labour Party and the London Trades Council, The speakers included H. M. liyndnian,. F. Bromley, George Lansbury, Tom Mann, Robert Williams and many others. The resolutions passed condemned the latitude allowed to profiteers, expressed suspicion at the Profiteering Act, urged the Government to free itself from the influence of trusts and make full use of the co-operative movement, and urged local co-operative and labour bodies to secure representation on local profiteering committees. The resolutions also included a protest against the increase in the price of coal by 6s. last July, and a demand for the nationalisation of the coal mines.Disabled Men&apos;s Allowances.A deputation from the N.F.D.D.S.S. waited upon the Minister of Labour on the 17th inst. and claimed that the rates of allowance for partly disabled soldiers undergoing training were insufficient. The deputation^ main complaint was that the allowance includes both the amount of the pension to which disabled men are entitled and the allowance which they claim they ought to get as trainees. It was suggested that the latter allow-ance ought to be at least 40s. The Minister told the deputation that the Government had very carefully considered the matter and had every desire to do the utmost possible in regard to disabled men. The principle which the Government followed was that recommended by the Select Committee on Pensions. He pointed out that the training which was being afforded to disabled men would fit them to take their place as skilled, men on the labour market, and the scheme could only be run at a great cost to the State. A man in training was not a wage earner, he was receiving training at the expense of the. State. The Minister regretted, therefore, that he was unable to meet the suggestions of the deputation.-International Union of Ex-Service Men.&apos;.        .     .        .    . . . &quot;&quot;The membership of this Union, which is of an extremist character, is reported to be;7,000.  The Union is now affiliated to the Clyde Workers&apos; Committee. *(C 1893)* Reference to the Railway strike will appear in next week&apos;s Report.2P2
Part V. Departmental and District Reports. (1) Departmental Reports.Appointments Department.Agricultural Scholarships, At a meeting of the District Selective Committee in the Perth Directorate, among other subjects, the number of agricultural scholarships at the disposal of the Scottish Board of Agriculture was discussed. In the opinion of the Com-mittee the number was inadequate, in view of the demand for agricultural experts and lecturers. A resolution was passed to the effect that the committee considered that a further number of agricultural scholarships should be granted by the Treasury.Government Vacancies, A further meeting of the Departmental Committee on vacancies in Government Departments has been held. The following proposals were confirmed as definite instructions to the Selection Board : (1) In future all temporary Government vacancies should be notified to the Selection Board by the Government Department concerned, and these vacancies should then be communicated by the Board to the Appointments and Employ-ment Departments, who will thus have the opportunity of submitting candi-dates for such vacancies as may occur.(2) The Selection Board should accept no applications direct, but should deal only with cases submitted to them by the Appointments and Employment Depart-ments.(3) Candidates from the provinces whose names are submitted, by the local officers of the Appointments and Employment Department should be interviewed in the first place by small local Interviewing Boards, and Travelling Boards should also be arranged for.Training Department.Forestry. Arrangements for the training of disabled and fit ex-Service men in forestry have been discussed. With regard to the latter class it has been agreed that, subject to such Treasury sanction as m y be necessary, the Ministry of Labour shall undertake the general responsibility for training in forestry, including that of men already in training, and provide any new buildings t may be required for the purpose. The Interim Forest Authority will provide and pay for the educational staff and equipment, and shall in future be responsible for the selection of the men before they are admitted to training.Interrupted Apprenticeships. Up to the Sth September 32 schemes had been approved and applications had been received in respect of all of them. The total number of appli-cations from employers was 14,635, and from apprentices 17,298. The total number of grants sanctioned up to the 17th September was 11,736.Employment Department.Work of the Courts of Referees. Up to the 11th. September 306,066 claims to out-of-work donation had been referred to appeals officers in Great Britain. Of this number 280,488 cases had been heard by the Courts of Referees. An analysis of 265,782 claims heard shows that 67,280 were allowed, .197,996 were disallowed, and in 506 cases a corn-promise was arranged. The proportion of disallowances to claims heard was therefore 74-5 per cent. Of the total disallowances 49-1 per cent, were disallowed owing to refusal to accept suitable employment.Prosecution for Fraud. Up to the 19th September 1,289 cases had been referred to the solicitor with a view to prosecution for attempted fraud in connection with out-of-work donation. The solicitor has reported on 795 cases. In 510 instances the defendants were fined, in 124 cases sentences of imprisonment were passed, and in 50 cases the defendant was bound over.   In 111 cases summonses were dismissed.Unemployment. On the 12th September 418,843 men and 100,213 women were on the live register, and vacancies remained available for 38,302 men and 45,022 women.  The -number of juveniles remaining on the live register was 25,811 and the number of juvenile vacancies available was .14,134.Wages and Arbitration Department.Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act. At a conference held at the Ministry of Labour on the 19th September with representatives of the engineering trade unions, the topics discussed were germane to the considerations referred to in Part I of this Report.    The discussion
centred round the consolidation of wages, the expiration of the Wages (Temporary Regula-tion) Act, and the consequent termination of the periodic revision of wages by the Court of Arbitration. Mr. J. Hill, on behalf of the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federa-tion, suggested that to the unions consolidation was at the present time a matter of far greater importance than advances, and he wished to know whether the Court of Arbitration had power to consolidate war advances into permanent base rates. As regards the expiration of the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act, he asked if the periodic hearings of the Court of Arbitration could be continued : otherwise agreements between employers and workpeople would be more difficult to arrange and enforce. Mr. Brownlie, for the A.S.E., held that the Court of Arbitration had been guided in its awards almost exclusively by the cost of living. His union were determined that there should be no reduction in wages when prices fell. Representatives of the National Union of General Workers protested against their repeated applications for consolidation being met by reference to the Minimum Wage Act, the object of which, they held, was not consolidation but the establishment of a subsistence basis. The Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act had been of great benefit to the ill-organised, trades, and it was submitted that if the Act was not to be extended, other machinery should be devised to take its place.The Minister stated that the Court of Arbitration could not consolidate war bonuses and suggested that consolidation could be best achieved by direct negotiation with the employers. There appeared to be a general opinion among the unionists that employers were waiting to take advantage of the termination of the Act, but it was felt that further consultation with the rank and file of the unions was necessary before recommending the stabilisation of wages by legislation.Joint Industrial Councils Division.Asbestos Manufacturing. A meeting of the J.I.C. was held on the 3rd September to discuss wages questions. Proposals were brought forward for the conversion of all war bonuses into wages; minimum rates of Is. Id. per hour for asbestos weavers and Is. Ad. for all other grades; and an all-round increase of 15s. per week for workers over 18, and 7s. 6d. for those under that age. The employers&apos; associations were unable to agree to any advance in wages at present. The Chairman stressed the difficulty of retaining, markets, the need for increased output and the importance of a large export trade. The workpeople contended that wages had not kept pace with the cost of living. It was ultimately decided that the operatives should produce for consideration a memorandum on the cost of living, and the employers one showing the increase in wage rates since 1914.Match Manufacturers. A meeting of the J.I.C. on the 10th September decided to approach the Board of Trade with a view to the removal of the prohibition on the import of chlorate of potash. As a number of the principal firms are working double shifts, involving the employment of women later than 9 p.m., the Home Office are to be approached as to the extent to which permission may be given for the employment of women at night.Needles and Fish-hooks. The Executive Committee, meeting on the 9th September, decided to recommend to lihe Council the adoption of the shop steward system, and con-sequently to leave the matter of works committees in abeyance.Packing of Textiles for Export. At a meeting of the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee on the 5th September, it was unanimously agreed to convert the Committee into a J.I.C., questions as to the extent of organisation and the demarcation of the industry being left over until the next meeting.Court of Arbitration.During the week ending the 20th September the Court of Arbitration heard 22 cases, 18 in London, 3 in Belfast and 1 in Dublin.(2) District Reports.London and South-Eastern.Unemployment. There is a decrease of 2,376 in the live register.General. The shortage of housing accommodation, together with the bad state of the roads, is hampering industrial development at Southall; but the London Chemical Works, Ltd., are extending their new factory and there is a likelihood of other new works, being started soon in the neighbourhood. The Mertonand Marden U.D.C. are under-taking a scheme of surface water-drainage with the intention of preparing suitable build-ing sites.  Attention is called to the shortage of carpenters and joiners in this area.  The(C 1893)2P3
iron-moulders&apos; strike has made the engineering trades apprehensive of their position. The dismissals at Government establishments, especially at Woolwich, are creating mi-easiness (vide Part IV).South Midlands and Eastern.Unemployment. The live register shows a decrease of 618. Dismissals from aircraft works are responsible for an increase on the register in the Bedford area.General. Work has been begun on the Tilbury Section of the joint sewerage scheme. The Road Board has granted  10,000 to the Essex County Council for bridge-work. A commercial company is prepared to finance a fish distribution scheme at Lowestoft for the employment of.disabled men only. At Oxford, it is believed that there will be a wholesale discharge of agricultural workers after the harvest.South-Western.Unemployment.-rF]ie live register shows an increase of 648. The two highest increases  at Southampton (876) and at Portsmouth (231) are largely in consequence of the cancellation of Government contracts.Training. Disabled ex-Service men are to be trained in monumental lettering at Torquay. There will be no difficulty in absorbing the men locally when trained. The Board of Agriculture have established a training centre for able-bodied ex-Service men in general farm work at Quodgley.General.-Lack of apprentices in the building trade foreshadows a shortage of skilled men in the future. The strike of carpenters and joiners at Southampton is still in pro-gress. It is reported that the Dolcoath and Levant tin mines, Cornwall, are working at a loss, although an advance of 10 per cent, in the price of tin has taken place. The A.S.E. embargo against overtime has created difficulties at Avonmouth Docks.West Midlands.Unemployment. There is a decrease of 1,442 on the live register. The amount of juvenile unemployment is now practically normal. An increase of 143 on the register is reported from Shrewsbury where a general shortage of materials is holding up trade. The high cost of production and American competition are held responsible for the closing of the works of the Willingsworth Iron Company at Wednesbury. The position in the Black Country leaves a good deal to be desired.Training. A scheme for the training of women in dressmaking is being arranged at Stoke.General. Messrs. E. G. Wrigley &amp; Co., Ltd., of Smethwick, have acquired the Govern-ment factory at Black Heath, which, during the war, employed 5,,000. Iron-manufacturers are claiming that deficient output and waste of fuel are resulting from the working of 8-hour shifts. It is urged that the only way to make the system successful is by constant production by triple-shifts throughout the 24 hours, but this is at present impossible with the men now available.With reference to the ironfounders&apos; strike, the General Workers&apos; Union and other societies such as the Brassworkers, who are members of the Federation of Foundty Unions, have instructed their members to continue at work. In the engineering trades in the Birmingham and Wolverhampton districts, arrangements have been made between the Employers&apos; Federation and the unions for the regulation of overtime on plant work, tools, and work preparatory to production.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Unemployment. There has been a decrease of 16,402 on the live register due to the reabsorption of labour after the coal strike.Resettlement of Disabled Ex-Service Men. The Local Employment Committees generally support the National Scheme but press that the difference between the men&apos;s learnings and the full rate should be made up by the State.General. The slow progress made in connection with the carrying out of housing schemes is creating difficulties. The question of the shortage of bricklayers is under investigation. With reference to the ironmoulders&apos; strike, the engineering firms in this area may be able to carry on for a fortnight. It is reported that at Keighley, Bradford, and in Leeds, the men are reluctant to strike but are abiding by their executive^ decision.
North Western.Unemployment.--The live register shows a decrease of 2,989 and the division reports a steady improvement in trade.General. The building trade is extremely busy, but an acute shortage of all classes of skilled labour exists. Complaints of the retention of skilled men with the Colours are still being made. With regard to the situation in the furniture trade, the employers appear to think that the men will soon restart on the old terms, owing to the exhaustion of their funds./Northern.Unemployment. The live register shows a decrease of 841. The present indications are that the live register total will not maintain the same rate of reduction that has been made during the past few weeks, and with the speeding-up of demobilisation, it is believed that there will be a tendency to maintain, if not to increase the present figures. On the other hand, large numbers of skilled shipbuilding tradesmen are required and as these are forthcoming, a corresponding amount of employment will be offered to less skilled workers in those establishments.Resettlement of Disabled Ex-Service Men. From the attitude of many of the employers in this area towards discharged soldiers, it is not anticipated that the National Scheme will get the support it deserves. Some general expressions of regret, however, have been heard owing to the fact that the Scheme has not been made to apply directly to ship-building and engineering.Training. The Lemington Glass Works, Ltd., are discussing the question of training disabled ex-Service men. There has been a shortage of skilled men in this trade for a considerable period.General. Curtailment of the Admiralty programme has resulted in dismissals of skilled shipyard workers at the Naval Yard of Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co. Lack of riveters is seriously hampering employment for other skilled trades. At South Shields, the shortage of ships&apos; plates continues. This shortage is ascribed to lack of. output at the steel works and to an embargo placed by the railway authorities against the delivery of goods to the South Shields district owing to congestion. The steel works complain of shortage of labour and special application is being made for the release of their employees m the Army.Wales.Unemployment. There is an increase of .181 on the live register. The heaviest increase (423) is at Merthyr, and is due partly to the closing down of the Cyfarthfa blast-furnaces. An increase at Llanelly is due to stoppage at tinplate factories, caused by shortage of water. Eight tinplate works are now on short time and over 4,000 men have been thrown out of employment. Owing to the settlement of the recent strike of transport workers at Swansea Docks, the Swansea area registers a noteworthy decrease in the number- of men on. the register.General, Difficulties of transport are holding up the full development of industry. The housing problem remains acute&apos;. The South Wales coalfield is still free from serious disputes and for the moment little is heard of nationalisation. Iron foundry employers are generally favourable to holding out against the strike. They complain of reduced output and increased working cost. The Cambrian Aircraft Constructors, Ltd., Cardiff, will close their works within the next fortnight and 800 employees will be affected.Scotland.Unemployment. There is an increase of 157 on the live register. There is unemploy-nient in the East Coast amongst sea-faring men owing to the continued shortage of shipping, and the dispute in the fishing trade. At Dumbarton, the calico-printing and dying in-dustry is affected by lack of transport orders and raw material. Want of supplies ,of phosphate is causing a Glasgow firm of seed-merchants and manufacturers of fertilizers to pay off 300 workers at Dundas.General. Trade union restrictions are stated as the cause of the removal of a firm of engineers from Wishaw to the Isle of Man.  The Edinburgh Roperie Company and the
Crown Carpet Manufacturing Company, Arbroath, desire an amendment of the Factory Acts in order to allow the working of a double-shift. Under these conditions it is stated that the present number of workers could be almost doubled. Shortage of orders in the cotton-bleaching trade is responsible for short-time working ; this is ascribed to delay in transmitting cable-messages to India. There are urgent demands for building tradesmen and boilermakers.  New works for steel smelting have just been completed at Coatbridge..Part VI.-Disputes. (a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.Building and Allied Trades.brick makers. Nottingham. The strike in the Nottingham building trade which has been in progress for eight weeks is not yet settled. Conferences were held during last week-end, but as no agreement could be reached the masters have been forced to let the kilns go out.Mining and Quarrying.Coal Mines (Staffordshire). The strike at Holly Bank Colliery which arose through a dispute between the management and a checkweighman, Daniel Cartwright, involving 1,300&apos; miners, was settled on the 17th inst. The men still demand the re instatement of Cartwright, but have agreed to return to work pending his appeal. (See Report for week ending the 10th September, p. 232.)Warwickshire. Nine hundred miners at Exhall Colliery came out on strike on the 17th inst. to protest against the action of the clerks who by refusing to work overtime had necessi-tated keeping in hand an extra day&apos;s wages.Lanarkshire. The dispute between the Miners and Firemen over the question of which Union shall own the latter has caused one colliery to cease working. The management refused to allow the firemen who had withdrawn from the miners&apos; union to descend the pits, and the other firemen came out in sympathy, thereby throwing the whole colliery idle.Metal Engineering and Shipbuilding.Ironfounders. The threatened national strike of ironfounders took place on the 20th inst. involving 50,000 men. The immediate cause of the strike is the refusal of the Federated Em-ployers to concede a national increase of 15.?. a wreek before the arbitration hearing which, under an agreement made in 1917, is due to take place next month. The three Unions with-drawing from the agreement are the Friendly Society of Ironfounders, the Amalgamated Society of Coremakers, and the Iron, Steel and Metal Dressers&apos; Trade Society. Both Employers and Trade Unions have put forward an official statement of their case the Union officials state that due notice of their intention to withdraw from the agreement was given by the three Unions involved, and therefore the refusal of the employers to hear their application separately was a legitimate ground for action by the men. The Employers state that at a joint Conference held on the 4th inst, they refused to grant priority of treatment to any one of the Unions concerned in the National Wages Agreement, and endeavoured to persuade the three Unions to wait until the Court of Arbitration should adjudicate their case. Other branches of the industry are already feeling the effects of the strike; the largest number of men out in any one district is 1,400 in Lancashire. Other districts are stated to be affected as follows. It has been freely alleged that the Moulders have repudiated their agreement. Any judgment about this must be made in the light of the fact that the original agreement contained no provision for termination. It was presumably to last as long as the war, which, it will be remembered is not technically over yet.Birmingham. The coremakers on strike are reported to number between three and four hundred, and about 820 ironfounders are idle. Including West Bromwich and Smethwick, it is estimated that 2,500 men have ceased work.Chatham Dockyard. The ironfounders applied, for a week&apos;s leave of absence, which was granted.  Officially, therefore, there is no strike at Chatham Dockyard.Leeds. All the iron and steel foundries and about 1,200 men are idle. The employers state that the outlook is very black, and that within a fortnight in Leeds a further 36,000 em-ployees in the engineering trade will be out of work if a settlement is not reached. The em-ployers intimate that their attitude in face of the unconstitutional step taken by the men&apos;s union is one of waiting and seeing.  .South Staffordshire-A grave view of the situation is taken in South Staffordshire, where castings are in great demand. In the area embracing Wolverhampton, Dudley, Walsall, Wednesbury, Tipton, Wellington, and Oakengates, approximately 1,500 men have ceased
Metal Engineering and Shipbuilding contd.work. Trade union officials estimate that before the end of the week 16,000 skilled and semi-skilled workers in Wolverhampton borough alone will be directly affected.Woohvich Arsenal. With the exception of 11 foremen, who decided to remain at work until Tuesday in order to &quot; book up,&quot; every member of the Boilermen&apos;s and Ironfounders&apos; Society employed in Woolwich Arsenal answered the roll-call at a meeting at the A.S.E. Institute, Woolwich, yesterday morning.  The total number out is nearly 300.*Railway Wagon Building.Horbury Junction. Further attempts have been made to settle the dispute at Messrs-Charles Roberts &amp; Co., Horbury Junction. A conference was held at the Ministry of Labour on the 18th inst. and a joint committee was appointed to review the whole position and report on the possibility of a national settlement which would include Horbury. It was decided to hold a meeting of this Committee on the 22nd inst. at the Horbury Works.Transport.Docks and Wharves, Hull. The strike of dockers which took place at Hull on the 16th inst. (see Report for week ending the 17th September, pp. 256-257) was settled on the 17th inst., the men agreeing to resume work pending negotiations at a National Conference to be held on the 25th September.Grimsby. The dockers who have been on &quot;strike since the 30th August returned to work at the end of last week on the understanding that a conference with Sir Sam Fay will take place.Ireland. The strikes of dockers at Dublin and Belfast were settled on the 18th inst. At Dublin an agreement as to rates of wages was reached at a joint Conference on a basis of 16s. a day for the discharge of general cargo. The Belfast men agreed to resume work pending further negotiations.Woodworking.Furniture Trade.
