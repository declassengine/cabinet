The &quot;Thite&quot; organisation have agreed to send them parcels of provisions twice a weok.\ ,; mm mm^The enemy flotilla on Lake Onega is at Petrozavodsk and consists of a mixed force of small protected paddle boats and steamers arued with 4&quot; guns, 2 torpedo boats and 3 armed launches. The flotilla does not cruise further North than Petrozavodsk owing to fear of mines.    The force has no mines.Archangel*The small hospital ship carriers &quot;Lord Kortonrt and &quot;Edinburgh Castle&quot; were sunk in deep water  on the evacuation, being unseaworthy.    The bir crane and the dredgers &quot;Corn all-. &quot;General Diaz&quot; and &quot;Tilburian&quot; were left behind, but the Russians hope to be able to tow them to Murmansk by 2nd October.Finland ...
The difficulties in connection with the disembarking of the repatriated Red Finnish Legion from Archangel have now been practically overcome.. The s,s. &quot;Kursk&quot; is still detained with 540 of the Legion aboard.    It is honed to complete the disembarkation by Ilth October.The Supreme Council of Paris deciied on End October that the.Russian Battleship &quot;Volya&quot; is to be handed over to Denikin.&apos; The French Naval Base at Varna has received orders to send the 2 Bulgarian Torpedo Boats and 1 Submarine to Sulina.   They should have gone on September 4th.   This Ease is to prepare to close down shortly.&apos;&apos; iThe Admiralty have emphasised that the role of His Majesty1s Ships in the Black Sea is that of supporting the British Forces occupying Batoum.General Denikin has been requested to remove the Volunteer armed guard ship at Batoum. \The.Mine Clearance of the Ivlediterranean and Aegean is completed.  The Mediterranean Clearance Force is, hoy/ever, continuing work until November to clear certain important areas for our Merchant Shipping in the Black Sea.It is not practicable under the Mine Clearance Con^ tract, nor is it understood to be desirable, at present,,to complete a general clearance of,the Black Sea.   This Sea was not embraced as a mine clearance by the Allied Council at the time of the Armistice, on account of the Bolshevik situation. Its eventual clearance will be a matter for a future agreement between the nations directly concerned.    In any case,&quot;the Weather will not admit of work before the Spring of 1920.The Black Sea force of 1,500 Officers arid men are expected to return home at the end of November.The ships of the Caspian Flotilla have now received full complements from General Denikin.t    The Naval situation is satisfactory on the whole, but owing- to the great unrest in Transcaucasia fostered by the Bolsheviks and German agents, the situation on shore is generally serious.    This unrest threatens Denikin&apos;s oil supplies from Grozni..   ML.: ,After the assumption of.Goveirnment at Budapest by Bela Kun, the river was mined in order to prevent ourflo-tillas from reaching Budapest..The rainelaying personnel was available from the Officers and men of the late Austro-Hungarian Navy, especially those who had served in the Danube Monitors and ffining Service during the far;   they weie consoouently professionallyproficient ...
proficient, while the mining material at command was of the best quality. ,   ,    ,A mine-clearing service was organised under Commander George!5. Leilh, C.B.E., K.u., ,The mines to be dealt with were laid in three fields.    Operations commended on the 10th August - by the 14th August a channel 150 yards wide had been cleared of mines.    A Pilot Service was established, and the Danube thus opened for navigation throughout from the source to the mouth. ,   ,    ,       , . vOwing tc lack of personnel, the local population, together with their horses, were pressed into the service of&quot;dragging the mines to the beach where they could be dealt with.B.ii., 3rd LL&quot;ht Cruiser Sauadron, reported on 1st October that Jugo Slavs are stated to be concentrating on a line outside Fiume.Reports received up to 1st October state that Fiumeis quiet.Rear Admiral telerraphed on End October that it is reported from Venice that ih the event of blockade of Fiume being enforced, famine in the town, or drastic measures taken by Italian Government or Allies against Fiume party, light craft at Venice will proceed to Fiume fully stored, officers being powerless to stop them.It is also reported that neither Army or Navy at Venice would act against DUanunzio if called upon.   In view of this unsatisfactory state of the Italian Navy, Rear Admiral considers that British Naval Force in Adriatic should either be withdrawn or strongly reinforced.The American representative at Paris continues to press the question as tc whether England will re-inforce her1 naval forces in the Adriatic, and said that he had asked M. Clemenceau whether the french would do the same, to v/hich M. Clemenceau had replied that he was most reluctant to do so. Possibly, however, this may not be M. Clemenceau^s final decision, and Sir 8, Crowe is disposed to share Mr. Pol^s opinion that if tho British, French, and United States Governments were to show a united front and clearly manifest their determination to have peace kept between the Italians and Jugo-S&amp;avs, it would help to keep the situation auiet.General House oppressed the earnest hone that America, ftngLmd and France would stand and act &quot;together in this natter.The views of the English Naval and Military Authori-ties as to whether co-operation with French and American forces in the Adriatic in preventing further incidents would be possible, is as follows -     The Army Council deprecate the despatch of isolated battalions as not being able to cope with disturbances when they arise, and as being therefore either left in difficulty or subjected to a hasty withdrawal.  Ho troops are available for employment in the Adriatic unless taken from the Army of the Rhine, DanUig, Kernel, Silesia, or other places in Central Surope.     The Admiralty do not pro-Pr0senT^end *he instructions already issued to the Senior naval Officer m the Adriatic until some modification of the present policy in regard to the Adriatic is communicated to them.    jhile the employment of British troops in the Adriatic seems vndeeirabU, the question of British Naval co-operationwith ...
with the American Squadron would he for the Admiralty to decide when a decision as io a policy has been reached at Paris.ii. Trumbitch said that DlAnnunziofa &quot;Ardcnti&quot; had cn October 2nd fired on ind pillaged the village of Zaraeta.He had reason to believe that the Italian Navy was showing itself pre-disposed towards DfAnnunzio&apos;s soldiertr and ho requested, if it was possible, to have one or two Cruisers in the Bocohe di Cattaro, in order to guard against any possibility of unfortunate incidents.The &quot;Leonardo Pa Vinci&quot; has been refloated and placed in dock at Taranto, keel up.   She is to be broken up.There are 85 cases of ammunition and 249 cases of fri6tion tubes, the property of the British Government intended for vladivostock. now lying at Naples, discharged from the Italian s.r. &quot;Gablonz&quot;.    The crew refused to sail with ammunition to be used against the Bolshevists, and were support-ed by the Italian Seamen&apos;s Union.    No ordinary steamer can carry it.    S.N.O.. Malta, has been requestod to send one of H.M. Ships to fetch this ammunition to Malta, and report what steps are being taken. , ,   .On September 25th the Naval Squadron composed of the &quot;Pisa&quot; flying Admiral Grasses Flag, the &quot;Sardegna&quot; and the two Scouting Vessels &quot;Racchia&quot; and &quot;Kiboty&quot; left for the Eastern Mediterranean.Admiral Kiddla has been appointed as the British Representative of the Naval Allied Mission of Control for exacting tho Peace Terms withAttstria.  It is probable that an Italian Officer will be President.Captain Luigi Rizzio has boon appointed by BUnnunzio as Commander of the Quarnaro Fleet.Tho Italian Ministry of Marine atates that Rizzio no longer belongs to the Navy and that by joining DfAnnunziofs forces &quot;he has incurred no disciplinary penalty.Admiral Caaai arrived in Fiune on September 25th incognito, and met D^Annunsio in the Governors palace.  After an interview which lasted two hours, the following statement was published by D!Annunzio&quot;Arlmiral Canpai arrived in Fiume to ask Commander PUnnunzio to treat with the Government.  Commander BfAnnunzio answered that he does not acknowledge the present Government and refuses to treat with it&quot;.Admiral Cagni has returned to Rome and has informed tho Government of the failure of his Mission.Rear Admiral Nunes was sent with a letter from the Commandernn-Chiof of tho Uoper Adriatic and Pola to the Presi-dent of the Fiume National Council, Grossich, requesting Commander DlAnnunzio immediately to set free Admiral Casanuova. Attached to the letter was a Proclamation 4o the Officers, Petty Officers, and crews of the Royal Navy and Naval Eetab-lishments of Fiuine and the Upper Adriatic ordering all those illegally absent from their posts to rejoin.  President Grossich answered that on September 12th the National Council had handed over all powers to Commandants D&apos;Annunzio, who had requested the Council to remain in Office.   Grossich agreed^v8!^8 &quot;Bante Alighieri&quot;, &quot;Kirabello&quot;, &quot;P. Nullo&quot;, and G.C. Abba&quot; ought to remain in Fiume at the Commanderfs dis-posal, also that Officers, Petty Officers and men should return on board.  DUnnunzio had already issued orders to that effect.Admiral ...

Ships.  H.H.S. &quot;Dartmouth&quot; at Rio has been directed to proceed to Callao via Magellan Straits.H.M.S. &quot;Cambrian&quot; has left Jamaica to relieve H.M.S. &quot;Constance&quot; at Belize.The Military situation in Somaliland in giving cakse for some anxiety.   &quot;Cornflower&quot; has been ordered from Red Sea to Berbera.&quot;Odin&quot;, at present delayed at Malta with defects, will relieve &quot;Cornflower&quot; and will remain on the Aden Division of the station until further orders.   On relief, &quot;Cornflower&quot; will return to Red Sea.C-in-C, Mediterranean, now reports that arrange-ments have now been made to repatriate all the Turkish Prisoners of War from Mudros. with the exception of a small proportion required for working parties until the Base is closed, or until they can be dispensed with.As soon as the Turkish prisoners have been repatriated from Lemnos, the total strength of the Marine garrisons in the Aegean is to be reduced to 450, including Officers.
