MILLS.......................................... &quot; 9IRELAND............................................. &quot; 9SUMMARYIndustrial unrest, rather than revolutionary development, has been the feature of the week.   The Parliamentary Committee ctf the Trades Union Congress are making ready for tfceir interview with the Prime Minister, but until this has taken place any kind of political direct action is unlikely.The question of a general strike on the railways still hangs in the balance.The unrest caused by the cry of profiteering and the difficulty of obtaining houses is accentuated by the approach of Winter.   The discontent in rural districts is reported to be acute.The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is conducting a propaganda campaign in the Midlands.   Mr. Lansbury&apos;s constitutional optimism has apparently affected the accuracy of his facts.   His overdraft of  2000, believed to have been guaranteed by Mrs. Fels, was about to be foreclosed, but he is reported to have received remittances from Berne, probably from John de Kay, which will relieve him of the iimaediate consequences.In London, Labour will contest 1000 out of the 1362 municipal seats at the November elections.There is a rumour that it is intended to bestow upon the Federation of Discharged Soldiers a capital sum for tho establishment of clubs..   As the active members of the Ex-Soldiers Federations are prone to fall into the hands ofextremists/
extremists, it would bo well that any gift of money shoul not be in the form of capital, but in monthly or periodic grants to meet expenditure: otherwise the oapital may be used for revolutionary purposes.. One provincial and, seven Dublin nor/spapers have boon suppressed- for publishing tho prospectus and application form of tho Irish National Loan.
boTHIS POLICEPublic interest -in the police strikers is waning, and their financial position is said to cause them grave anxiety. An indication of this was given in the reoent suggestion that the strikers1 children should be &quot;the guests of Trade Unionists.    The only contribution of note to the Police Fund during the week has been the sum of  100 from the National Union of Shop   Stewards.     The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; has refused &quot;on principls&quot; the request of the London Distriot Committee cf the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades to open a subscription list.At a meeting of the Workers&apos; Freedom League in Victoria Park on September 21st, Tom Th6rne&apos;s special appeal for money produced only 28s. from an audienoe of 800 people. A further sum of 2s.  d, was raised by the next speaker.In Birmingham ex-polieemert have opened a fruit and vegetable stall to supplement their meagre strike allowance.THE BOUSING PROBLEM. ,As the cold weather approaches, the need cf houses is becoming more acute:   building operations are hampered, and makeshift acooraaodation which is possible in-the summer months, becomes less tolerable.    The unrest caused by the lack of houses oannot be exaggerated;   It is further accentuated by evictions and by the erection in certain distriots of Kinematograph Theatres instead of houses.    The public notification that the provisions against the use of temporary material, v&amp;ioh are embodied in local Building Acts, are suspended, has come rather late.The dilatory methods of Local Authorities are particularly noticeable in the South Western Counties.    At Portsmouth, for example, and all over &quot;Wiltshire and Dorset, the sites for Workmen&apos;s Dwellings have:even yet not been decided upon.The/
(English) - 2 -The eviction of a totally disabled ex-Service man at Upper Clapton caused a demonstration of the Discharged a Demobilised.bailors and Soldiers on September 17th, who paraded the streets with posterB inscribed, &quot;Where are the houses for disabled heroes?   The country^ gratitude -eviction after 15 years&apos; service.&quot;    At a meeting arranged by the Stepney Trades Council and the Whitechapel St, George&apos;s Labour Party on September 22nd a resolution was passed calling upon the Government to stop the &quot;mischievous iniquity&quot; of evictions at Brick Lane.At Nottingham, the successful opposition of certain Councillors to the City housing scheme, as approved by the Ministry of Health, has caused an outburst of resentment. On September 21st a meeting of some 1500 better class artisans: expressed entire sympathy with the statement that vested interests were making every effort to &quot;scrap any decent housing scheme.&quot;My correspondent reports that at Newcastle the housing difficulties are still acute and cause much discontent,THE COST OF LIVING.    .The feeling against hi$i prices, which becomes daily more intense, was well illustrated by the demonstration in Hyde Park on September 21st, in which over half a million people took part.    The primary object of the: demonstration served as a basis for violent denunciation o,f the Government, for the general opinion appeared to prevail that the, Government is shielding and supporting profiteers while the Profiteering Tribunals are viewed with   -considerable suspicion, owing to the supposed possibility of their oontrol by interested tradesmen.    In towns where there is delay in setting up these tribunals, the working people complain of procrastination. .
In Trades Union circles there is discussion as to the advisability of concentration on the reduction of prices, rather than on an increase of wages.The prices of milk, meat and clothing appear to give rise to the greatest resentment.The idea that the Government itself is profiteering finds expression in Lancashire, where it is said that the Government woulA rather lot food rot than sell it at a low price.In districts, however, where, prosecutions have taken place public resentment appears to have been allayed......IiABOUB AND THE FORTHCOMING MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS.I have in previous reports drawn attention to the active preparations made by Labour to seoure a majority of seats on Municipal and Borough Councils throughout the United Kingdom.    This movement should not be regarded as evidence of a tendency towards constitutional action, but rather as means to en aid.    For some time there have bo en signs that Labour leaders, whether moderate or extreme, have realised that a revolution is doomed to failure, unless it is accompanied by quick re-organisation of the means of transport and supply.    They are now fully alive to the wide scope of municipal power, embracing as it does control of local expenditure, food supply, gas, light, water, sanitation, transport and education.    In London alone 1000 Labour candidates will contest 1362 seats.EDUCATIONAL LABOUR PROPAGANDA.The need to counteract the pernicious influence of labour colleges cannot be over-emphasized.    For instanoe, the preliminary notioe of the Nottinghamshire Labour College classes announces a programme devoted to Marxian economics which makes a special appeal to the semi-educated.    The college is acting in conjunction with theCentral/
Central Laboxtr College.Classes have also been organised throughout Vfe3.es by students from Buskin College and Central Labour College, On the other hand, ray correspondent reports that the minors prefer discussion of sporting topics to attendance at socialist classes,   The British working man&apos;s innate love of sport is the healthiest antidote to extremist teaching, and in this connection it may be noted that the shorter working day offers excellent opportunity for the provision of additional facilities for playing games.Private funds for anti-revolutionary propaganda cannot be better expended than in founding and supporting labour Colleges&apos;where sound Economics are taught.   They would have slightly to outbid, the existing labour Colleges in order to. attract students,THE INCO/aS TAX question a resolution demanding exemption for all incomes under *   250 was passed by the Trade U^ion Congress at Glasgow.There have been fewer public demands of late for the exemption from taxation of all incomes under  250 per annum, but the question is continually discussed by Trade Union branches and is now regarded as a national one, In Wales, for instance, large bodies of miners are urging the Executive Council of the South Wrjles 3liners1 federation to arrange a national conference on the subject,WOOLVTCOHWoolwich is still a happy huntinc:  round for agitators, on account of the recent and impending discharges of workmen. -T^e temper of the district i3 undoubtedlyngiy/
(English) . 5 - gougly.   Many of tho workers are in genuine dread of unemploy-ment, and, unless the deputation to the Prime Minister this week can obtain an assurance in regard to the prospect of future employment, the consequences may be serious.A similar state of unrest exists in the Government dockyards% notably at Chatham, where the workers affected by discharges demand the conversion of the plant for purposes of national industry.TEB IPTOING AICTO PISOiJARGSD S0LDISR9The national demonstration of discharged men on September 27th, foreshadowed in my reports of the 4th and 11th Se-september, will take place in Hyde Park.   Ten platforms have been arranged and the organisers expect an attendance of 1,000,000*   Tie men  who are marching from Manchester expect to arrive in time to take part in the demonstration,Many branches of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors r,nd Soldiers are. reported to have joined the more revolutionary National Union of ex-Service Men, partly as a result of the support given by the former to the anti-Bolshevik film.A special conference of the Northern Council of the Shtional federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers was held at Nev;oaetle on September 20th, at whioh 100 delegates represented four Northern Counties,The following were the more important resolutions passed1,   That the Army Canteen Tun&amp;s be used for the financial assistance, rather than for the recreation, of ex-Sr-irviee men,2. That payment for odd days should be made to men training under the Ministry of Pensions scheme,g.   That in order to have equality of treatment , with Conscientious Objectors military prisoners convicted of minor offences be released.
4.   That the delay in examining disabled men reoommended for medical boards be abolished.6.   That enquiry be rn;de into the treatment of ex-Service men by the Medical Boards at Newcastle and Simderland.6,   That men training under the Ministry of Labour - be not put into the huts at Birtley, which have been condemned as insanitary by the local Council,In Yorkshire unrest is rife regarding the new scale oipensions and the non-payment of men in the &quot;2&quot; reserve.Mass meetings are being organised throughout the country to protest against the discrepancy between the gratuitypromised to men in the Ax^ny of Occupation and that grantedto those who served during the war.At Wakefield the men are complaining bitterly aboutthe alleged unsympathetic attitude of the Pensions appeal tribunal.In. Leicester the National Union of Ex-Service Men appears to be making headv/ay.My correspondent reports that the temper of ex-Service men in Glasgow is unsatisfactory.   They complain bitterly of the unsympathetic treatment by employers and. are drifting rapidly into the ranks of the extremists.On the other htvad, the opposition of discharged men to extremist meetings in Glamorganshire is so marked that Morgan Jones, organiser of the Y/alsh Independent Labour Party, has failed on every occasion to get a hearing.On September .22nd ex-Service men at Cardiff passed the following resolution&quot;(That the ex-Service men should send a &quot;deputation to&apos; interview the retiring members of &quot;the City Council with a request that five of&quot;the seat3 should be placed at the disposal of&quot;the nominees of the ex-Service men.&quot;THE/
(Sto&amp;lish)TKS INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE WORLD  -    .My correspondent reports that the British section of the Industrial Workers of the World movement is a dead letter. The majority of the members never attend meetings, although officials of the Tfosi End branches endeavour to maintain enthusiasm.   On September 14-th the speaker hooked for Victoria Park stayed at home on account of the rainy weather.THE &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is conducting a propaganda campaign which began-at -Birmingham last week and Is being continued : this week at Nottingham.   Mr. Danebury stated that he hoped to increase the present circulation of 260,000 to a million, and that the capital with which the paper was first started now stands at  100,000.   Mr. Lswsbury16 facts have been affected by hie optimism.   Actually, the capital of the paper is  25,000, v/ith 10s.0d paid up.   There is a bank overdraft of  2,000, vhich he expects to pay off by drafts from Berne, and it is significant that a correspondence has just been intercepted, showing that Mr. John de Kay has, with considerable difficulty, sold Mexican Bonds in order to pay a draft of  2,00$ due on the 23rd-September..   The matter is being conducted with secrecy, as it would no doubt be undesirable in Mr, Danebury&apos;a Interests for it to become publicly known that his paper was being supported, from abroad.. .   &apos; - :The sale of the paper has been considerably pushed by the Shop Stewards, who have insisted upon their members . buying it.   The chief sufferer is the &quot;Daily News&quot;, whose sales have fallen off.COLONEL/
a 1COLONEL JOHN WARD. M.P.Colonel Ward, who was returned unopposed for Stoke-on-Trent at the General Election, has been making useful speeches on the subject of Bolshevism in Russia.   Speaking at the annualdinner of the Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union, he said :-&quot;Men could not see what I have seen and &quot;then hear disputations as to whether Bolshevism &quot;would not be a good thing for this country, &quot;There is only one good thing about Bolshevism -&quot;they ostracise lawyers.&quot;He described Russia as a country reduced to a state of jungle.He appears not to he quite decided in his mind whether to return to political life or to continue in the Army.   While in Russia he was made a Hetman of the Don Cossacks - a remarkabl experience for an English Labour Member.1ROBERT WILLIAMS.  In a recent cablegram to the New York &quot;Liberator&quot; Robert Williams reviewed the Labour situation in the following terms&quot;Every olass-conscious act of the working people tends more and more to become a political act and only*fools would draw a clear dividing line between industrial and political action.   To-day, we of the Triple Allianoe j are challenging the Governments policy in maintaining conscription, military intervention in Russia and military intervention in Trade Union disputes .... We know through experience that conscription means the possibility of breaking strikes by means of the intervention of armed soldiers and sailors.   Therefore we are taking the only means at our disposal to compel the Government to abandon conscription, and get out of &quot;Russia.&quot;Addressing/
Addressing the^demonstration in Hyde Park on Sunday last Mr. Williams oalled for cheers for the &quot;International Socialist revolution&quot; and is reported to have said that , -  &quot;the only hope of the common people was to emulate what,  - .,   y;&quot; i :&quot; &apos;  0&apos;.&apos;     &apos; i ..the Russian revolutionists had done and to seize the common neoessarieb for their existence.&quot;Mr. Williams1 support of revolutionary policy is not new, hut he is certainly becoming bolder.J.E, MILLSMills, who is secretary of the Royal Arsenal Shop Stewards Committee, and en active member of the London Workers&apos;- Committee, has been selected by a large majority as Labour candidate for Dartford.   He has the support of*the Independent Labour Party and of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers and kindred Unions.Mills followed S. Bradley as local socretary of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers in 1917, and in tug same year was one of the chief agitators during the engineers&apos; strike at Woolwich; at that time he was in close touch with Arthur MacManus and there is no reason to suppose that he has severed tho connection.Although Mills has never served he is Vice-President of the local branch of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers.ireland there has been no appreciable change in the state of public feeling in the Provinces during the week.-  The suppression of the Irish Republican Parliament has,&apos; occasioned very little excitement, a fart, which points to the small hold the Dail Eireann has on Irish psychology.   The press also affect,to pretend that it will have no effect onthe/
(English)the progress of their policy.The Police raid bh Sinn Fein Clubs and houses of most of the prominent leaders throughout the country has resulted in the seizure of a very large quantity of seditious literature and orders of the Dail Bireann.   Although in a few instances small quantities of arms, ammunition and explosives were confiscated, nothing of much importance appears to have been secured.The following newspapers were suppressed on the 20th instant and their printing machinery dismantled for publishing the prospectus of the Irish National Loan (1919):-   &quot;The Leader&quot;, &quot;Nationality&quot;, &quot;Fainne an Lae&quot;, &quot;New Ireland&quot;, &quot;Irish World, &quot;The Republic&quot;, &quot;Voice of Labour&quot;, and &quot;The Cork Examiner&quot;.   The first Beven are Dublin papers and In each case have given a guarantee that no future copies will be printed until permission to do so .. is given by the Competent Military Authority.   The plant . of &quot;The Cork Examiner&quot; has been restored on the proprietor giving an: undertaking not to publish anything contravening D.R.R.   &quot;The Cork Sxaminer&quot; has probably the largest circulation in the South of Ireland,,A daring higiway robbery took place in Cork, when two officials of the Cork District Lunatic Asylum were robbed of  1,340.   In Dublin things have been fairly quiet.It is reported that efforts are being made to givi an international character to the Irish Republican Brotherhood, which is a secret society formed for the destruction of *the British Empire.   It is suggested that this Society is mainly responsible for the recent raids on barracks and assassination of ike Police.   The Priests, however, In many cases, are preaching against the growth of secretsocieties/
(English)societies.Sinn Feinism is reported to he on the wane in Kerry, South Tipperary and Wexford. -Although the Irish Labour Loaders are closely watching the progress of events in England, the Labour movement in Ireland shows little tendency towards Bolshevism.   Walton Kewbold has delivered a series of lectures, generally to small audiences, in which he expressed the sympathy of English extremists with the Irish desire for a Republican form of government.B.H.T.
