Military Secret,1098From Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,2M September 1919.13259.   Malleson wires, 27th September :--&quot;Moscow publish, by wireless following: &apos; According to communication from Paris the British Government Lad despatched (? 2,000) Persian soldiers for the occupation of Askabad.&apos;&quot; 2. It is unnecessary to state that no movements of Persian troops have taken place, nor lias there been any movements of our troops other than in August, which resulted in slight reduction in numbers north of Kuchan.&quot;3. It is possible that Bolsheviks have deliberately invented above statement in order to pick quarrel with Persia. All my information from Turkestan is to the effect that, since publication of Anglo-Persian treaty, attitude of Bolsheviks towards Persians in Turkestan had become very questionable.&quot; 4. I do not know whether Teheran Government receives any report from Persian Consul at Askabad. If so, reports should be viewed with doubt, as I am told Consul is terrified by Bolsheviks and is busy making large private gain by selling passports.&quot;
