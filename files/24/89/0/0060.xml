(11331.)Arrangement of May .1.916, commonly known as the Sykes-Picot Agreement.[English Text.]IT is understood between the French and British Governments-1. That France and Great Britain are prepared to recognise and uphold an independent Arab State or a Confederation of Arab States in the areas (A) and (B) marked on the annexed map, under the suzerainty of an Arab chief. That in area (A) France, and in area (B) Great Britain, shall have priority of right of enterprise and local loans. That in area (A) France, and in area (B) Great Britain, shall alone supply advisers or foreign functionaries at the request of the Arab State or Con-federation of Arab States.2. That in the blue area France, and in the red area Great Britain, shall bie allowed to establish such direct or indirect administration or control as they desire and as they may think fit to arrange with the Arab State or Confederation of Arab States.3. That in the brown area there shall be established an international administra-tion, the form of which is to be decided upon after consultation with Kussia, and subsequently in consultation with the other Allies, and the representatives of the Shereef of Mecca.4. That Great Britain be accorded (1) the ports of Haifa and Acre, (2) guarantee of a given supply of water from the Tigris and Euphrates in area (A.) for area (B). His Majesty&apos;s Government, on their part, undertake that they will at no time enter into negotiations for the cession of Cyprus to any third Power without the previous consent of the French Government.5. That Alexandretta shall be a free port as regards the trade of the British Empire, and that there shall be no discrimination in port charges or facilities as regards British shipping and British goods; that there shall be freedom of transit for British goods through Alexandretta and by railway through the blue area, Whether those goods are intended for or originate in the red area, or (B) area, or area (A); and there shall be no discrimination, direct or indirect, against British goods on any railway, or against British goods or ships at any port serving the areas mentioned.That Haifa shall be a free port as regards the trade of France, her dominions and protectorates, and there shall be no discrimination in port charges or facilities as regards French shipping and French goods. There shall be freedom of transit for French goods through Haifa and by the British railway through the brown area, whether those goods are intended for or originate in the blue area, area (A), or area (B), and there shall be no discrimination, direct or indirect, against French goods on any railway, or against French goods or ships at any port serving the areas mentioned.6. That in area (A.) the Bagdad Railway shall not be extended southwards beyond Mosul, and in area (B) northwards beyond Samarra, until a railway con-necting Bagdad with Aleppo via the Euphrates Valley has been completed, and then only with the concurrence of the two Governments.7. That Great Britain has the right to build, administer, and be sole owner of a railway connecting Haifa with area (B), and shall have a perpetual right to transport troops along such a line at all times.It is to be understood by both Governments that this railway is to facilitate the connection of Bagdad with Haifa by rail, and it is further understood that, if the engineering difficulties and expense entailed by keeping this connecting line in the brown area only make the project unfeasible, that the French Government shall be prepared to consider that the line in question may also traverse the polygon Banias-Keis Marib-Salkhad Tell Otsda-Mesmie before reaching area (B).8. For a period of twenty years the existing Turkish customs tariff shall remain in force throughout the whole of the blue and red areas, as well as in areas (A) and (B), and no increase in the rates of duty or conversion from ad valorem to specific rates shall be made except by agreement between the two Powers.
There shall be no interior customs barriers between any of the above-mentioned areas. The customs duties leviable on goods destined for the interior shall be collected at the port of entry and handed over to the administration of the area of destination.9. It shall be agreed that the French Government will at no time enter into any negotiations for the cession of their rights and will not cede such rights in the blue area to any third Power, except the Arab State or Confederation of Arab States, without the previous agreement of His Majesty&apos;s Government, who, on their part, will give a similar undertaking to the French Government regarding the red area.10. The British and French Governments shall agree that they will not them-selves acquire and will not consent to a third Power acquiring territorial possessions in the Arabian peninsula, nor consent to a third Power installing a naval base either on the east coast or on the islands of the Red Sea. This, however, shall not prevent such adjustment; of the Aden frontier as may be necessary in consequence of recent Turkish aggression.11. The negotiations with the Arabs as to the boundaries of the Arab State or Confederation of Arab States shall be continued through the same channel as hereto-fore on behalf of the two Powers.12. It is agreed that measures to control the importation of arms into the Arab territories will be considered by the two Governments.[French Text.]II demeure entendu que :1. La France et la Grande-Bretagne sont disposees a reconnaitre et a soutenir un Etat arabe independant ou une confederation d&apos;Etats arabes dans les zones (A) et (B), indiquees sur la carte ci-jointe, sous la suzerainete d&apos;un chef arabe. Dans ia zone (A) la France, et dans la zone (B) la Grande-Bretagne, auront un droit de priorite sur les entreprises et les emprunts locaux. Dans la zone (A) la France, et dans la zone (B) la Grande-Bretagne, seront seules a fournir des conseillers ou des fonctiormaires etrangers a la demande de 1&apos;Etat arabe ou de la confederation d&apos;Etats arabes.2. Dans la zone bleu la France, et dans la zone rouge la Grande-Bretagne, seront autorisees a etablir telle administration directe ou indirecte ou tel controle qu&apos;elles desirent et qu&apos;elle jugeront convenable d&apos;etablir apres entente avec 1&apos;Etat ou la confederation d&apos;Etats arabes.3. Dans la zone jaune* sera etablie une administration internationale, dont la forme devra etre decidee apres consultation avec la Russie, et ensuite d&apos;accord avec les autres Allies et les representants du Cherif de La Mecque.4. II sera accord^ a la Grande-Bretagne: (1) les ports de Caifa et d&apos;Acre; (2) la garantie d&apos;une quantite d^finie d&apos;eau du Tigre et de FEuphrate dans la zone (A) pour la zone (B). Le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste, de son cote, s&apos;engage a n&apos;entreprendre a aucun moment des negociations en vue de la cession de Chypre a une tierce Puissance sans le consentement prealable du Gouvernement fran^ais.5. Alexandrette sera un port franc en ce qui concerne le commerce de 1&apos;Empire britannique, et il ne sera pas etabli de difference de traitement dans les droits de ports, ni cTavantages particuliers refuses a la marine ou aux marchandises anglaises; il y aura libre transit pour les marchandises anglaises par Alexandrette et par chemin de fer a travers la zone bleu, que ces marchandises soient destinees a la zone rouge, la zone (B), la zone (A), ou en proviennent; et aucune difference de traitement ne sera etablie directement ou indirectement aux depens des marchan-dises anglaises sur quelque chemin de fer que ce soit comme aux depens des marchandises ou des navires anglais dans tout port desservant les zones mentionnees.Caifa sera,un port franc en ce qui concerne le commerce de la France, de ses colonies et de ses protect or ats, et il n&apos;y aura ni difference de traitement ni avantage dans les droits de port qui puisse etre refuse&apos; a la marine et aux marchandises francaises. II y aura libre transit pour les marchandises franchises par Caifa et par le chemin de fer anglais a travers la zone jaune, que ces marchandises soient en provenance ou a destination de la zone bleu, de la zone (A) ou de la zone (B) ; et il n&apos;y aura aucune difference de traitement directe ou indirecte aux deepens des marchandises franchises sur quelque chemin de fer que ce soit comme aux depens des marchandises ou des navires frangais dans quelque port que ce soit desservant les zones mentionnees.* Printed brown in the map.
6. Dans la zone (A), le Chernin de Fer de Bagdad ne sera pas prolong^ vers le sud au dela de Mossoul, et dans la zone (B) vers le nord au dela de Samarra, jusqu&apos;a ce qu&apos;un chernin de fer reliant Bagdad a Alep dans la vallee de l&apos;Euphrate ait et6 termine, et cela seulement avec le concours des deux Gouvernements.7. La Grande-Bretagne aura le droit de construire, d&apos;administrer et d&apos;etre seule proprietaire d&apos;un chemin de fer reliant Caifa avec la zone (B), et elle aura, en outre, un droit perpeluel de transporter ses troupes, en.tout temps, le long de cette ligne. II doit etre entendu par les deux Gouvernements que ce chemin de fer doit faciliter la jonction de Bagdad et de Caifa, et il est, de plus, entendu que, si les difficultes techniques et les defenses encourues pour 1&apos;entretien de cette ligne de jonction dans la zone jaune en rendent Fexecution impracticable, le Gouvernement francais sera dispose a envisager que ladite ligne puisse traverser le polygone Barries-Keis Mar il-Silbr ad-Tel Hotsda-Mesuire* avant d&apos;atteindre la zone (B).8. Pour une p riode de vingt ans les tarifs douaniers turcs resteront en vigueur dans toute l&apos;6tendue des zones bleu et rouge aussi bien que dans les zones (A) et (B), et aucune augmentation dans les taux des droits ou changement des droits ad valorem en droits sp6cifiques ne pourra etre faite si ce n&apos;est avec le consentement des deux Puissances.II n&apos;y aura pas de douanes inteVieures entre auoune des zones ci-dessus mentionnees. Les droits de douanes prelevables sur les marchandises destinees a Tinterieur seront exig^s aux ports d&apos;entree et transmis a 1&apos;administration de la zone destinataire.9. II sera entendu que le Gouvernement francais n&apos;entreprendra, a aucun moment, aucune negotiation pour la cession de ses droits, et ne cedera les droits qu&apos;il poss^dera dans la zone bleu a aucune tierce Puissance, si ce n&apos;est 1&apos;Etat ou la confederation des Etats arabes, sans 1&apos;agrement prealable du Gouvernement de Sa Majesty, qui, de son cote\ donnera une assurance semblable au Gouvernement franc,ais en ce qui concerne la zone rouge.10. Les Gouvernements anglais et francais se mettront d&apos;accord pour ne pas acquerir, et ne consentiront pas qu&apos;une tierce Puissance acquiere, de possessions territoriales dans la peninsule arabique ou installe une base navale ni sur la cote est, ni dans les iles, de la mer Rouge. Ceci, toutefois, n&apos;empechera pas telle rectifi-cation de la frontiere d&apos;Aden qui pourra etre jugee necessaire, par suite de la r^cente agression des Turcs.11. Les negotiations avec les Arabes pour les frontieres de 1&apos;Etat ou de la confederation d&apos;Etats arabes continueront par les memes voies que precedemment aux noms des deux Puissances.12. II est entendu, en outre, que des mesures de controle pour 1&apos;importation des armes sur le territoire arabe seront envisagees par les deux Gouvernements.* In the English text &quot; Banias-Keis Marib-Salkhad Tell Otsda-Mesmie.&quot;
ANGLO-FRENCH DECLARATION OF NOVEMBER 7, 1918.LE but qu&apos;envisagent la France et la Grande-Bretagne en poursuivant en Orient la guerre dechainee par l&apos;ambition allemande, c&apos;est raffranchissement complet et definitif des peuples si longtemps opprimes par les Turcs, et i&apos;etablissement de gouvernements et administrations nationaux puisant leur autorite dans 1&apos;initiative et le libre choix des populations indigenes.Pour dormer suite a ces intentions, la France et la Grande-Bretagne sont d&apos;accord pour encourager et aider a letablissement de gouvernements et d&apos;administrations indigenes en Syrie et Mesopotamie, actuellement liberees par les Allies et dans les territoires dont ils poursuivent la liberation, et pour reconnaitre ceux-ci aussitot quils seront effectivement etablis. Loin de vouloir imposer aux populations de ces regions telles1 ou telles institutions, elles n&apos;ont d&apos;autre souci que d&apos;assurer par leur appui et par une assistance efficace le fonctionnement normal des gouvernements et administrations quelles se seront librement donnes. Assurer une justiceimpartialeet egale pour tous, faciliter le developpement economique du pays en suscitant et en encourageant les initiatives locales, favoriser la diffusion de 1&apos;instraction, mettre fin aux divisions trop longtemps exploiters par lapolitique turque telest le role que les deux Gouvernements allies revendiquent dans les territoires liberes.
English Translation of Letter from the Sherif of Mecca to Sir II. McMahon, His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner, Cairo, dated February 18. 1916.In the name of the Merciful, the Compassionate. To the most noble his Excellency the High Commissioner (may God protect him).4(After compliments and respects.) 14 Rabi al Akhar (February 18, .1.916).WE received your Excellency&apos;s letter, dated the 25th Rabi al withdrawal, and its contents filled us with the utmost pleasure and satisfaction at the attainment of the required understanding and the intimacy desired. I ask God to make easy our purposes and prosper our endeavours. Your Excellency will understand the work that is being done, and the reasons for it, from the following : Firstly, we had informed your Excellency that we had sent one of our sons to Syria to command the operations deemed necessary there. We have received a detailed report from him stating that the tyrannies of the Government there have not left of the persons upon whom they could depend, whether of the different ranks of soldiers or of others, save only a few, and those of secondary importance; and that he is awaiting the arrival of the forces announced from different places, especially from the people of the country and the surrounding Arab regions, as Aleppo and the south of Mosul, whose total is calculated at not less than 100,000 by their estimate ; and he intends, if the majority of the forces mentioned are Arab, to begin the move-ment by them; and if otherwise, that is, of the Turks or others, he will observe their advance to the Canal, and when they begin to fight, his movements upon them will be different to what they expect.Secondly, we purposed sending our eldest son to Medina with sufficient forces to strengthen his brother (who is) in Syria, and with every possibility of occupying the railway line, or carrying out such operations as circumstances may admit. This is the beginning of the principal movement, and we are satisfied in its beginning with what we had levied as guards to keep the interior of the country quiet; they are of the people of Hijaz only, for many reasons, which it would take too long to set forth; chiefly the difficulties in the way of providing their necessities with secrecy and speed (although this precaution was not necessary) and to make it easy to bring reinforce-ments when needed ; this is the summary of what you wished to understand. In my opinion it is sufficient, and it is to be taken as a foundation and a standard as tn our actions in the face of all changes and unforeseen events which the sequence of events may show.   It remains for us to state what we need at present Fi?*stly, the amount of 50,000L in gold for the monthly pay of the troops levied, and other things, the necessity of which needs no explanation. We beg you to send it with all possible haste.Secondly, 20,000 sacks of rice, 15,000 sacks of flour, 3,000 sacks of barley, 150 sacks of coffee, 150 sacks of sugar, 5,000 rifles of the modern pattern and the necessary ammunition, and 100 boxes of the two sample cartridges (enclosed) and of Martini-Henry cartridges and &quot; Aza,&quot; that is, of those of the rifles of the factory of Saint-Etienne, in France, for the use of those two kinds of rifles of our tribes ; it would not be amiss to send 500 boxes of both kinds. *Thirdly, we think it better that the place of deposit of all these things should be Port Sudan.Fourthly, as the above provisions and munitions are not needed until the beginning of the movement (of which we will inform you officially), they should remain at the above place, and when we need them we will inform the Governor there of the places to which they may be conveyed and of the intermediaries who will carry orders for receiving them.Fifthly, the money required should be sent at once to the Governor of Port Sudan, and a confidential agent will be sent by us to receive it, either all at once or in twoinstalments, according as he is able, and this (oj is the (secret) sign to be recognised for accepting the man.
Sixthly, our envoy who will receive the money will be sent to Port Sudan in three weeks&apos; time, that is to say, he will be there on the 5th Jamad withdrawal (9th March) with a letter from us addressed to Al Khawaga Elias Effendi, saying that he (Elias) will pay him, in accordance with the letter, the rent of our properties, and the signature will be clear in our name, but we will instruct him to ask for the Governor of the place, whom you will apprise of this person&apos;s arrival. After perusal of letter, the money should be $ given to him on condition that no discussion whatever is to be made with him of any question concerning us. We beg you most emphatically not to tell him anything, keeping this affair secret, and he should be treated apparently as if he were nothing out of the way.Let it not be thought that our appointment of another man results from lack of confidence in bearer ; it is only to avoid waste of time, for we are appointing him to a task elsewhere. At the same time, we beg you not to embark or send him in a steamer, or officially, the means already arranged being sufficient.Seventhly, our representative, bearer of the present letter, has been definitely instructed to ensure the arrival of this, and I think that his mission this time is finished, since the condition of things is known both in general and in detail, and there is no need for sending anyone else. In case of need for sending information, it will come from us; yet as our next representative will reach you after three weeks, you may prepare instructions for him to take back. Yet let him be treated simply in appearance.Eighthly, let the British Government consider this military expenditure in accordance with the books which will be furnished it, explaining how the money has been spent.To conclude, my best and numberless salutations beyond all increase.[Unsigned.]
Letter from Sir H. MoMahon, His Majeitys High Commissioner, Cairo, to the Sherif of Mecca, dated March 10, 1916.Cairo, March 10, 1916 (6 Jamad Awwal 1334).(After customary greetings.)WE have received your letter of the 14th Rabi-el-Akhar (18th February), duly delivered by your trusted messenger.We are grateful to note the active measures which you propose to take. We consider them the most suitable in the existing circumstances, and they have the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government. I am pleased to be able to inform you that His Majesty&apos;s Government have approved of meeting your requests, and that which you asked to be sent with all haste is being despatched with your messenger, who is also the bearer of this letter.The remainder will be collected as quickly as possible, and will be deposited at Port Sudan, where it will remain until we hear from you officially of the beginning of the movement and of the places to which they may be conveyed, and the intermediaries who will carry out the orders for receiving them.The m cessary instructions, as set forth in your letter, have been issued to the Governor at Port Sudan, and he will arrange everything in accordance with your wishes.Your representative who brought your last letter has been duly facilitated in his journey to Jeizan, and every assistance has been given him in his mission, which Ave trust will be crowned with good results.We have arranged that, on completion, he will be brought to Port Sudan, whence he will proceed by the safest means to join you and report the results of his work.We take the opportunity, in sending this letter, to explain to you a matter which otherwise might not have been clear to you, and which might have given rise to misunderstanding. There are various Turkish posts and small garrisons along the coasts of Arabia who are hostile to us, and who are said to be planning injury to our naval interests in the Red Sea. We may therefore find it necessary to take hostile measures against these posts and garrisons, but we have issued strict instructions that every care must be taken by our ships to differentiate between the hostile Turkish garrisons and the innocent Arab inhabitants, towards whom we entertain tvuch friendly feelings. ,We give you notice of this matter in case distorted and false reports may reach you of the reasons for any action which we may be obliged to take.Wc have heard rumours that our mutual enemies are endeavouring to construct boats for the purpose of laying mines in the Red Sea and of otherwise injuring our interests there, and we beg of you that you will give us early information should you receive any confirmation of such reports.We have heard that Ibn Rashid has been selling large quantities of camels to the Turks, which are being sent up to Damascus.We hope that you will be able to use your influence with him in order that he may cease from this practice, and, if he still persists, that you will be able to arrange for the Arabs who lie between him and Syria to seize the camels as they pass a procedure which will be to our mutual advantage.I am glad to be able to inform you that those misguided Arabs under Sayed Ahmed el Senussi who have fallen victims to the wiles of Turkish and German intriguers are now beginning to see the error of their ways, and are coming in to us in large numbers asking for forgiveness and friendship.We have severely defeated the forces which these intriguers had collected against us, and the eyes of the Arabs are now becoming open to the deceit which has been practised upon them.The capture of Erzerum and the defeats sustained by the Turks in the Caucasus are having a great effect in our favour, and are greatly helping the cause for which we are both working.We ask God to prosper your endeavours and to further the work which you have taken in hand.In conclusion, we beg you to accept our warmest salutations and expressions of friendship.A. H. McMAHON.
