U.3.Naval Forces Operating in Purbpean r&apos;waters, 30 Grosvcnor Gardens, .V&quot;&apos;.1. September 3rd 1919,From: Tho Force Commander,To:    Tho Secretary of the Admiralty.Subject:   RIGID AIRSHIP:   Purchase Abroad by the U,S.NavyReferences:    (a) Force Commander Lottor of August 6th 1919.1.    The Force Commander has received further instructions from the Navy Department in regard to taking up actively vrith the British Government, the possibility of purchasing a rigid airship in Groat Britain.2.    The Force Commander would appreciate an expression of opinion from the Admiralty in regard to the possibility of reaching an agreement with tho U.S. Navy on either one or both of the following proposals, together with an approximate estimate of the costs involved thereby,1st.- The Tj,S.Navy to purchase from tho Admiralty one of tho 2,700,000 cubic foot rigids which we^o under construction for the Admiralty and contracts for which it is understood have been cancelled.     Tho purchase of one of these vessels in this manner by tho U.S.Navy would have to be coupled with tho fol lo1 zing arrangements:(a) That from tho date of the completion of the ship which it is presumed would bo in the Spring or the Summer of 1920, until the Spring of 1921, it would be necessary for tho U8S.Navy to lease from tho Admiralty direct, or from one of the private builders through the Admiralty, a shod capable of housing the ship, as delivery is not desired in the United States until tho Spring of 1921, which is presumably tho estimated date of completion for the airship sheds which arc to be constructed there.(b) An arrangement with tho Admiralty by which, from the date of completion of the ship until the Spring of 1921, tho U0S,Naval personnel could bo trained under tho supervision&apos; of British Lightor-than-air Flying Officers.    Such an arrango-ment would, of course, contemplate either a lump sum payment for tho training given or an arrangement by which the United States would assume all costs in connection therewith, including the salaries, etc., of the British Officers engaged in this training,2nd,- In vie1,; of tho fact that the IT.S.Navy has available for t&quot; o purchase of an airship abroad the sum of $2,500,000, it is desired to Investigate tho possibility of constructing a larger airship than those already put in hand by the Admiralty with a view to taking a further stop in adv.an.ee in the develop-ment of Lightor-than-air craft.    v&quot;itb. this and in view, would the Admiralty bo willing to work in direct conjunction with the IT,S.Navy In the design, construction and trials of a rigid airship of, say, 5,000,0^0 cubic foot capacity?    This proposal would contemplate tho payment of the U.S.Havy of all costs involved in the employment by tho Admiralty of tho nccossary porsonnel for tho preparation of tho d:sign and tho supervision and inspection of tho&apos;construction, in conjunction with person-no 1 which would bo supplied direct by tho U,S,:;/avy.     It might be pointed out that such, an arrangement as outlined in the second proposal would bo of mutual advantage to both Services *Enclosure 1.
the tUSoNavy would have the benefit of tho drill and experience of tho Admiralty designers and constructors, while, on the other hand, the Admiralty would have tho advantage, without cost to tho British Government, of the experience and develop^ &apos; ment gained in the design and construction of this larger type of shlpw    In Case an arrangement along those lines wore arrived at, it would bo necessary to make a separate arrange-mcnt whoreby tho Admiralty would undertake tho training of the TJ*S*Naval personnel in tho care and operation of lightor-than-air ships   all cents of such training to be paid by the U*S. Navy.oV Early consideration of these tentative proposals together with an expression of the Admiralty^ opinion thereon, would be much appreciated, in order that the IJ,S*Navy Department, may, as soon as possible, be put in possession of the necessary information to enable it to reach a final decision in regard to the placing of a contract in Great Britain or elsewhere for the rigid airship authorised by the U.S. Congress in June last,.

Enclosure II.U.S,Uaval Forces Operating in Furopean &quot;tvtcrs,30 Grosvenor Gardens, S.v&apos;.l* R.l. August 6 th 1919,From:   The Force Commander*To:      The Secretary to the Admiralty.Subject:   RIGID AIRSHIP:   Purchase Abroad.1.     The Force Colander has been informed that tho recent Act of Congress making appropriations for the U.S.Naval Service has authorised the purchase abroad of a rigid, airship, and. it is understood that the amount made available for this purpose is $2,500,000.2.    The Navy Department has requested the Force Commander to make preliminary investigation in regard to the possibility of purchasing or having constructed in Great Britain one of the largest type dirigibles.    The Force Commander would appreciate it if tho Secretary of the Admiralty would inform him if, in case the U.8S..Navy Department desires to make such r. purohase or to place such a contract in Great Britain, such a coxirso would moot with tho approval of the Admiralty? furthcrmore, If in such a case whether the Admiralty would be willing to co-operate with the lT..S,Naval Authorities and. tho contractor for such a rigid dirigible, witb a vie&apos;&quot; to assisting them in obtaining the most modern and efficient airship of this type. It is of course understood that such co-operation would be mutual and that any experience gained with such a ship or developments in its construction would be at the full disposal of the Admiralty.(Sgd)By Diroction.
C. S e c. S.13370/19. Enclosure III.25th Scptombor 1919.Sir,I am commanded by Hy Lords Commissioners of tho Admiralty to transmit for the information of tho Air Tinistry the accompanying two, letters which have been received from the Force Commander, United States Navy, containing proposals for the purchase of ,a Rigid Airship by tho United States Government and for the, construction of a Rigid Airship of improved type by thai Government in co-operation with tho British Government.    Tho Force Commander has boon, informed that the-Air Ministry will reply to his communication,2,    I am to state In for arding this correspondence that Their lordships view is that, subject to Cabinet approval, the first proposal should be accepted,-   3.    The second proposal relates to future policy after transfer of the service to the Air Ministry, and My Lords therefore refrain from discussing the cuostion whether, in tho construction of airships, such co-operation is desirable, or could take place under conditions which would render it unobjectionable,    Thoy would observe, however, that in regard to warships and naval war material generally, they would not consider co-operation on such lines admissible at the present moment, nor that it could be justified except by/much closer relationship between the two countries than that which now 1 exists, or so far as is known in the Admiralty, is in contem-contemplation.4.    A copy of this correspondence has boon sent to the Trar Cabinet.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Unsigned).
