(P 5938) From Viceroy, 22nd September 1919.(Received 25th, 3 pan.)1364 S. Foreign Secret. Afghanistan. My telegram of the 20th September, No. 1360 S. Until relations with Afghanistan are placed on permanent footing it would plainly be embarrassing to engage in discussion with Afghan Government regarding Mahmud Tarzls attempt by his letter to open direct channel of communi-cations with the British Government. I suggest, therefore, that his letter should be ignored. Question of His Majesty&apos;s replying to Amir&apos;s letter can be deferred until it reaches you. I do not propose to reply to Amir&apos;s letter to me until it appears whether lie will fulfil his promise of allowing British Agent to return to India.
