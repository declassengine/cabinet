It was rather an attempt to force the resignation of the present Government in the hope of bringing in immediately a Labour Government with the Railway leaders in authority.   It will fail because the public is determined not to be starved into submission, and because tho rank and file of the railway&amp;railwaymen are beginning to weaken.   The leaders are already seeking a way of escape without loss of prestige.   Though the public generally is&quot;&quot; hostile to the strikers in the South of England, they find more support as one goesNorth, though in Scotland, with the exception of parts of Lanarkshire, the public is hostile. There has been very little sabotage and no rioting.   Some suggestions are given as to the real causes of the strike.The Sinn ft in group in Liverpool is believed to number not more than 4,000 persons.The views of discharged soldiers have varied very much in the present crisis.   Whils many have volunteered for service, others, especially those who are transport and vehicle workers, are anxious to join the strike.
rm RAILWAY 8-TRIKHi. ...The Railway Strike, which, began at midnight on the 26th September, has thrown all other movements into the background.    The leaders, while freely misrepresenting the attitude, of the Government, have been very oareful to maintain their contention that the strike is purely industrial, and to forbid any acts of violence.    They havo also rejected the help of known revolutionaries and have not officially enoouraged them to speak on their platforms. There has been a marked absenoe of violence and aots of sabotage;   those that have taken plaoe have been of a minor oharaoter.There has never been a labour crisis of this magnitude in which there was so little talk of revolution. If the orisis had,ooourred last February the position would have been really dangerous, but the example of Bussia and the ill-timed extravagances of the extremists have brought saner views into the minds of working men and women and it will probably be found that this strike was the first step in the process of England &quot;finding herself again af;ter the War.It seems olear that -there was no foreign influence behind the strike.,   ,The, seoret springs of the actions of Messrs. Thomas and Cramp seem to be that Cramp&apos;, a declared revolutionary, has for some time been soheming for the foremost plaoe in the Bailway world.    He intends to stand as Labour oandldate for Carlisle, and he has the extreme element in the National Union of Railwaymen behind him. 1 While Thomas was absent in America, a good deal of feeling was worked up against him, and he found that if he did not join in the movement, to foroe the hands of the Government, he might lose his position. -The same motive actuated Bromley, -who hates Thomas, but who was pushed into aotion by members of his Union belonging to the national Union of Bailwaymen.    Onoelaunched,
r&apos;1(i&amp;aglish) - 2 - J !)launched, Thomas showed duplioity and adroitness in misrepresenting the faots, which even now are not to a large number of the men.    The leaders realise % to give way without saving their faoes would oost their influenoe for ever;   henoe the deputation of % Traneppi-t Workers to the Prime Minister on the 1st * October to feel the way for a new Conferenoe.    While Thomas and Bromley are shouting that they have won,% are turning nervously from side to side, for a way of escape from their position.The real motive of the leaders was to foroe - themselves into an important political position.    Bsj believed that they held their fellow^oountrymen in the hollow of their hand, that the present Government wovli fall flat at the first blast of their trumpets, and i a Labour Government, with important plaoes for Messrs, Cramp, Thomas and Bromley, would immediately, suooeedI They had, as Is common with all trades Unionists, an exaggerated estimate.of their strength and a curious blindness to the potentialities of the silent middle-&apos;     classes.At a seoret meeting on the 1st Ootober, it was deoided to pay strike pay at the rate of ,12s. Od. for Sohedule A, which includes about  three-quarters of tin men, and 6s. Qd. and Is. Od. to each child for the remainder.    This was the prs-V/ar rate, which takes no acoount of the rise in the oost of living, but no alteration could be made without a general meeting.   1 &apos;:   delegate confessed immediately after the meeting that they darod not publish this to the Branohes, for all men would slink back to work,   tfhey were saved the trod for the information was at onoe sent to the Press.There has been a quite remarkable hardening of pub opinion against the strikers.    In London, working men and women have booed the processions, but as one goes I
North one finds more and more supporters for the National Union of ftailwaymen, until in Newcastle, usually so sound throughout the War, the support for the Railwayman&quot;seems almost universal.    The chief Railway oontre is London, and the attitude of the publio has had a very depressing effect upon the spirits of the strikers, while the universal oheerfulness of the publio under difficulty, and the admirable arrangements made for the feeding of London, as well as the response to the call for voluntary workers, has made the failure of the strike a praotioal certainty.The effeot of every abortive strike is to disoredit the extremists. and if the ardent desire of all classes of the population that the Authorities may stand firm is realised, there will be peace and quiet in the Labour ;.world for many weeks.THE police the dismissed polioemen have been trying hard to get the National Union of Railwaymen to adopt their oause and make reinstatement a cardinal demand.    They have been told, apparently, that the Railwaymen have trouble enough on their hands, and that the question of reinstatement is a matter for Labour generally;.

The speakers oondemned private ownership which they maintained was the oause of slums and narrow streets.Prom the short&apos;report of the meeting in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, which followed extensive preliminaryadvertisement,/
(English)*M      6f      Hadvertisement, it seems olear that the demonstration fell far short of the organisers1 expectations.SIM Fiffl IN LIVERPOOL.A correspondent reports that this organisation has a membership of not more than 4,000, made up ofthat18 to 23 Groups, and/there is very little 00-ordination between the groups.     Attendances at the meetings are small and little money is obtained.These meetings are held at no fixed spot but in membershouses or shops.    The outside influenoe of theorganisation is reported to be almost nil; and there Isconsiderable fear of the looal Police, in fact a prominfmember has stated:&quot;Vte haven&apos;t been touched yet beoause we have &quot;been careful not to hand out any paper (leaflets, &quot;eto.) and not done much &apos;spouting&apos;, but there is &quot;no doubt that the.police.have a &apos;down&apos; on us and &quot;if we do get pinched we&apos;ll &quot;oop out&quot; but they &quot;leave us alone as long as we don&apos;t hold big &quot;meetings so we just go to each others houses in &quot;turns, but it does not Rive us a chance to Ret w^oinK anl/howVr&quot;These small organisations are all Roman Catholics - and take every opportunity of &quot;doing in&quot; any other seot.   In the recent riots they attaoked protestant shops purely for making trouble,   ; .   , .. ,8HE8FFIEIJPOne of the oentres of revolutionary propaganda in Sheffield, where there is still a good deal of unrest, is the A.S.B. Institute, where meetings are held every Sunday evening.   4.T. Murphy, Dr. F.W, Chandler and Watkins, a member of the looal branoh of the National Union of Baiiwaymen, are frequent speakers-, but there usually at least one prominent visiting agitator. speakers include:-John/

Gal,la oh er Wad laOn September 21st the speaker was Baklatvala, who delivered an adoress on &quot;Universal Socialism&quot;.   He oondemned Trades Unionism, arguing that class distinction is a corollary to craft unionism.   He also stated that the seizure of the railways, of mines or of isolated industries would be useless if.-trie workers did not follow the example of their .:iuast&amp;n friencis ana oommandeer tne sources of supply.MLINQ AIVLQWQ3T DISCtUMEX)k. meeting of the discharged men who marched from Manchester was held in Trafalgar Square on September 28th, David Ramsay and Arthur EoManus were amongst the speakers, as a meeting of the Bast, London Workers&apos; Committee had been arranged for t-;e saiae time and place,   kr. Thomas, of the London branch of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers, called upon the audience to take the following oath by a show of hands &quot;I swear that I won&apos; t blackleg in this present Labour crisis, even if called up in &quot;Z&quot; tfeserve, or in any other Labour crisis.&quot;    The speeches of the marchers were decidedly hostile to the Government; one man paid tribute to the.good work done by the King during the war, alleging that the misohief done was by the gang surrounding him.The discharged men interviewed the.Minister of Labour on September 27th, and again on the 29th, when they were entertained at lunoheon.   The men Bet out on a return journey shortly before noon, in a large motor&apos; ohar-a-bano,which/
(English)whioh Sir Robert Home had suooeeded in obtaining foil their, use.   Before leaving, they expressed great appreciation of the Minister^ consideration,I am informed that at the Hyde Park&apos;demonstrate , on September 27th the ex-Service men appeared unanimot in their decision not to rejoin the Colours during thi present strike. This feeling was particularly marked in the oase of &quot;2&quot; reserve men, to whose alleged grievances I have recently drawn attention. The Execi of the National Federation of Discharged and Demo bill Sailors and Soldiers is stated to be considering what action Bhall be taken, if the &quot;2U Reserve is oalled if in an emergency. The Chairman of the Metropolitan Divisional Counoil is reported to have issued a denia that his organisation is assisting the Government, Ji added that members have been enjoined to maintain a strictly neutral attitude.The General Committee of the National Union of . Ex-service Men in the Manchester area is said to have sent to Unity House.a resolution supporting the N-jttio Union of Railwaymen.Discharged soldiers are still muoh concerned aboj housing difficulties and the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers and t] Comrades of the Great War have established a section to. deal with evictions of eat-Servioe men.It is reported that members of the Federation arj beooming restive about their offioials&apos; salaries; in Leeds, for instance, salaries cost  400 and the approximate income is  440: it is further said that many of the offioials have not served Overseas.At/t
At Halifax a new organisation has been formed under tfte name of the &quot;National Association of Halifax Comrades.&quot;Ex-Servide men are finding employment in open air markets in several towns.: &apos;:.!-.&apos;.-    --- -*&apos;&apos;      &quot; &apos;        . . ..........THE WORKERS SOCIALIST FEDERATION.... -This organisation states in a ciroular letter dated- .September 3rd that it is very short of runas and has many outstanding liabilities to meet.Negotiations are still in progress regarding the formation of a Communist Party to be composed of the Workers Socialist Federation, British Socialist Party, Socialist Labour Party and the South Wales Socialist Society.   A referendum of the members of the joint societies is being taken in regard to the following basis of agreement:&quot;1.- The Dictatorship of the proletariat.&quot;2.   Soviets substituted for Parliament.&quot;3.   Adherenoe to the Third International.&quot;A vote of the membership of the United Party &quot;to be taken 3 months after its formation to 1&quot;decide whether:&quot;4.   The Communist Party shall apply for affiliation to the Labour Party, and&quot;5.  ,Whether the Communist Party shall take Parliamentary aotion,MWIMBLEDON LABOUR PARTYThe Labour Movement in Wimbledon seems to be making progress.   The attendance a^ a meeting of the looal Labour Party in Wimbledon Theatre on September 28th was so crowded that many could not obtain admittance. The speakers were itx. Andrew Maolaren, prospective LabourCandidate/
Candidate for the constituency, Mr. George Lansbury, IChairman, Lai, the Indian extremist, and a National III of Railwaymen striker. mThe speeohes were sooialistrio rather than revolum and the National Union of Railwaymen striker endeavoui Ito explain the oause of the railway strike.

PANKHUESTOn 25th September Miss Pankhurst left Southamptonfor France.   In an artiole sent for publication in the&quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; to Miss 0&apos;Callaghan, she writesas follows regarding the railway strike:&quot;The raiiweymen cannot beat the government, &quot;if the government is really determined to resist &quot;now, unless other workers oombine with them.   If &quot;the railwaymen; are to win, the sympathetic strike &quot;and as the situation develops, the sympathetic &quot;act also, of workers in many branohes of industry &quot;end in the Army and the Police force, must be &quot;brought in to help them.&quot;&quot;The same thing is true of the miners, and &quot;any and every seotion of workers; unless the work &quot;unite and make common oause, the government will &quot;triumph over them.&quot;&quot;To be defeated by the forces of the &quot;Government is harmful, it often means the &quot;victimisation of the most stalwart fighters; it . ,;alwtuyrt means a disheartening set-baok for the 8orfze.n;&quot;nation.   But it is still more harmful for -;   &quot;tho cvgfinieation, for all its members to give V*y Uocminiously before the threats of the &quot;G^r^jamont without putting up a fight.   To &quot;do th&amp;i sops the courage and vitality of all tonv-vt-red. . Such a failure destroys the real  -* ivre cf a movement in a way that defeat in a &quot;woll fought struggle oon never do.&quot;in/
s\ k nIn conclusion, Hiss Pankhurst urges that the strikers should plaoe revolutionary aims in the forefront of their programme.It is reported that the Committee of the People&apos;s Russian Information Bureau, of which Miss Pahkhurst is a member, has reoently received  1,300 from Paris.   In this oonneotion, Miss Pankhursfs visit to tfranoe is not without signifioanoe.An interesting sioelight 1b thrown on Kir. Hodges oy John k. Jones, &quot;the Official Representative&quot; of the Triple alliance in the United States,   Writing in the &quot;Rebel Worker&quot;, a bi-monthly periodical published by the Hew York Central Committee of the Industrial Workers of the World, Jones says &quot;Frank xlodgos oarries a paid up 1,&apos;tf.W. membership oard and is proud to have it known.&quot;CQLQ1&amp;3L -M3DGW0QD. M.P, *Colonel Wedgwood, who recently took an active part in the Independent Labour Party oampaign in the Pottery district, has now joined the National Union of right-Service ,   ken.   This Union is olosely connected with the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and is the most extreme of the ex-tfervioe men&apos;s organisations.MR. W. L. ofio-mThe author, W.L. George, who has been a special correspondent for various papers in ?ranos, Belgium and Spain, published a rennvrkable incitement to revolution in the issue of tho &quot;Daily Herald&quot; of September 29th.
A(English)It will be remembered that Mr. George has tried in turn the rSles of analytical chemist, engineer, barrister, soldier and business man and has proved unsuccessful in them all.   He has, however, been consistent as a paoifist, an anti-nationalist and a republican.Under the heading &quot;Be Prepared.&apos;   people!   Make ready to rule&quot;, he urges the immediate establishment of a &quot;Labour Emergency committee&quot;, in other words a Soviet, on the following lines:1.    That tho secretary of every Trade Union branohin the country should immediately appoint a delegate to the looal Labour Emergency Committee.2,    Teat tnese delegates should provide substitutesfor present local authorities.3.     That they should nominate a delegate to thoCounty Committee, which would toko over the funotionof the present County Counoils.4.    That each County Committee should appoint a delegate to the &quot;Central People&apos;s Committee&quot; which should sit in Westminster &quot;to determine the distribution ofthe highest functions and to take over national polioy,such as defenoe, taxation, foreign relations and to lay down for the guidance of-the,looal oommittee general rules as to food, ooal and transport,&quot;He concludes:   &quot;That is, briefly, how I see the way for Labour to rise,to tne opportunity whioh may be given to it, and for Labour to perform itB duty to itself ... And, at the worst, if we have met in vain, if, through circumstances or hesitation, the strikes are ended before the weok is done, Labour will not have wasted its time; it will have gone tarou^h a, drill in organisation.The/

On the 30th it published a violently revolutionary article by W, L. Oeorge, the novelist, entitled, &quot;Be PreperedJ People&apos; Jtoke ready to rule&quot;.   It has consistently misrepresented the faots, but owing to difficulty of transport, its circulation out of London is very muoh curtailed in spite of the efforts of the strikers to push it.
