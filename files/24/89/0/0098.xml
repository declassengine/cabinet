TWO events have brought the situation in the Baltic States to a head: (a) the ultimatum sent to the German Government by the Paris Conference, (fc) the Peace negotiations between the Baltic States and the Soviet Government. In order to appreciate the significance of these two events it is necessary to summarise the history of the relations between the Baltic States and Germany on the one hand and the relations between the Baltic States and Russia on the other. This will be followed by a brief review of the existing political situation in each of the three Baltic States.2. Relations between Baltic States and Germany.The conflict between the Baltic States and Germany in its present form dates from the Armistice of the 11th November, 1918. By the terms of the Armistice (paragraph XII) &quot; all German troops at present in territories, which before the war formed part of Russia, must return to within the frontiers of Germany, as soon as the Allies shall think the moment suitable, having regard to the internal situation of these territories.&quot; At the time of the Armistice the Allies had formed no plan for supporting the Baltic States other than employing any troops that were on the spot to protect them against the Bolsheviks. It is unlikely that the German Govern-ment had&apos; any definite plan either, being mainly occupied with its own internal situation, which, during November and December was very acute. This was, however, just the opportunity for men of the stamp of Von der Goltz, who had been forced to leave Finland, to attempt a new plan of campaign in the Baltic States while attention was concentrated elsewhere.The first step taken by the Germans was to prevent the organisation of the new Baltic States that had again been formed after the Armistice. The easiest method of attaining this end was to hand over the country to the Bolsheviks. No doubt the disorganisation of the German troops was partly the natural result of the German defeat and the German Revolution, but there was method in the madness, for, as the German troops began to retire from the occupied provinces, they handed over their military material to the Bolsheviks, and it was owing to this sudden help that the latter quickly overran Esthonia, and at the end of December were within a few miles of Reval. A large part of Latvia and Lithuania were also overrun by them.The Esthonfans were the first to recover, and, helped by Finnish volunteers and afterwards by British war material, they succeeded in driving the Bolsheviks from their country in the beginning of February. The Letts and Lithuanians were not so successful, as large numbers of Germans still remained in their country, and their contact with the Allies was not so close.It was after these first events that the Germans, under von der Goltz, began to organise the policy which they have pursued so skilfully and persistently ever since. Von der Goltz arrived at Libau towards the end of February, and soon had 20,000 Germans with a small force of Baits under his command. The nominal intention of these German troops had been to fight the Bolsheviks, but it has always been clear that the real aim was the control of the Baltic States through the local Baits and the. East Prussian Junkers.German activities were at first concentrated on Latvia, which was the least organised of the new States. The first step was the overthrow of the National Lettish Government under Ulmanis and the establishment of a nominally Lettish Government under Needra, which was really controlled by the Bait Landeswehr and German soldiers. The next step was the capture of Riga from the Bolsheviks, the removal of the Needra Government thither, and the execution of as many Letts as possible on the plea that they had been aiding the Bolsheviks.Meanwhile, the Germans had not been hindered by the Allies to any appreciable extent, but the rapidity of the German advance forced the Paris Conference to act. Tlje Allied authorities in Riga succeeded in putting a stop to the executions carried out by the Bait Landeswehr under Major Fletcher, and in June, when the Germans [1056] B
and Baits began to threaten the Esthonians, who had been joined by a small force of Letts, Marshal Foch, acting for the Paris Conference, sent an ultimatum to the German Government demanding the evacuation of the German troops. By this time the British Military Mission, under General Gough, had arrived, and, through its agency, a truce was concluded on the 3rd July between the Esthonians and the Letts on the one hand, and the Germans and Baits on the other.Up till this time the Germans had had it practically their own way, but once the British Military and Political Missions set to work matters seemed to improve. The Germans evacuated Libau on the 25th June and Riga on the 6th July, and a few days later a new Lettish Government, under Ulmanis, returned to Riga.German policy now underwent a new phase. German troops were transferred as rapidly as possible from the German divisions to the Baltic Landeswehr, and close relations were established with Russian forces which were beginning to arrive from Germany. Von der Goltz met all demands for the immediate evacuation of the German troops, first with one excuse, then with another, at one time bringing forward the plea that the Lettish Government had promised the German soldiers land in recognition of their services against the Bolsheviks, at another time pleading that time was needed before the evacuation could be carried out. Since the capture of Riga the Germans have done nothing further in the fighting against the Bolsheviks. They have evacuated their ^advanced positions and are now concentrated in Mitau and Courland generally, where they are in close contact with various forces of anti-Bolshevik Russians. Von der Goltz stopped the further evacuation of German troops, and reports seem to show that the numbers of his troops are increasing rather than diminishing. No exact figures are forthcoming, but he is supposed to have anything between 40,000 and 100,000, probably nearer the latter figure. Lettish soldiers have been disarmed and the Lettish flag has been torn down, the German and Russian Imperial flags being hoisted instead. There are Russian troops, under Colonel Bermont, in close touch with the German troops, who, it is reported, intend to march through Latvia together against the Bolsheviks. The Lettish Government is alarmed, and has made anxious appeals to the Allies to see to the instant evacuation of the Germans and the separation of the Russian troops from the Germans and their evacuation from Latvia.Thus von der Goltz &apos;s policy, after several months of persistent work, is at last coming to a head. He has collected round him a considerable number of Russians, and has increased his own forces to such an extent that the Letts and the other Baltic peoples, feeling themselves too weak to resist the German-Russian combination on the one hand and the Bolsheviks on the other, are now preparing, as a last resort, to enter into peace negotiations with the Bolsheviks.3. Relations between Baltic States and Russia.(a.) Anti-Bolshevik Russians. The attitude of each of the three Baltic States towards the anti-Bolshevik Russians has remained the same. Each of them has put in its demand for complete independence, and the Delegation of each State at the Paris Conference has refused to discuss the position with, the Russian National Com-mittee in Paris. They all maintain that they refuse to accept any guarantees from the representatives of Kolchak and Denikin, though they do not exclude the possi-bility of federation with a future democratic Russia on their own terms. No means have been found for bringing them closer together, and their recent experience of Russo-German intrigues in the Baltic has alienated them still further.In the exchange of notes between Kolchak and the Allied Governments the former, on the 4th July, guaranteed &quot; as from the present time the autonomy of the various nationalities,&quot; but that the limits and conditions of such autonomy would be &quot;settled differently as regards each of the nationalities concerned.&quot; He further agreed to &quot; have recourse to the collaboration and good offices of the League of Nations with a view to arriving at a satisfactory settlement.&quot; These conditions were accepted by the Allies, but refused by each of the Baltic States.The Esthonians have had closer relations with the anti-Bolshevik Russians than either the Letts or the Lithuanians. In Esthonia the main body of the Russians under Yudenich has been fighting the Bolsheviks, and there have been frequent nego-tiations between the Esthonian Government and Yudenich. Though a temporary political agreement was reached between the North-Western Russian Government, of which Yudenich was a member, nothing came of it, as the Allies refused to ratify it. Thus at the present moment the agreements between the two parties are purely of a military nature. ,
The Letts and the Lithuanians have had no negotiations with the Russians. The Russian forces on their territories have been equipped by the Germans^ and remain in close touch with them, and the one desire of both the Lettish and lithuania-anian Governments is that all the Russian forces should be evacuated as speedily as possible.(b.) The Soviet Government. The three Governments of the Baltic States, while refusing to co-operate with the Russian Whites against the Reds in a campaign into Russia, had up till recently declined to come to any terras with the Soviet Government.It was on the 31st August that the Soviet Government made the first move, offer-ing peace on conditions which the Esthonian Government decided were worth con-sidering. The Esthonian Government agreed to send representatives to Pskov to meet the Soviet representatives, and the negotiations opened there on the 16th Sep-temfoer. Before that date, however, there had been held a, Conference at Reval attended by representatives of Finland and the three Baltic States. It was decided, amongst other things, that peace should only be concluded conjointly. Hence the Esthonian representatives at Pskov asked for a postponement far a fortnight, that they might have time to discuss the question with Latvia and Lithuania, who had also been offered peace by the Soviet Government on the 11th September.Following upon these decisions, a Conference of the Baltic States and Finland met at Dorpat from the 29th September to the 1st October. An agreement was arrived at which has still to be ratified by the Governments concerned within six days. The principal points of the agreement are as follows : (1.) The three Baltic States are to inform the Soviet Government that they are ready to begin preliminary negotiations not later than the 25th October.(2.) Finland will put the question definitely to the Diet, and will communicate its decision to the other States before the 23rd October, The actual date of the first negotiations will not be fixed before the Finnish answer arrives.(3.) None of the States will consider separate peace provided that a military convention between them has been made before negotiations begin.(4.) The Soviet Government must recognise the self-determination, i.e., the sovereign independence, of the three Baltic States. The same right will be applied to the Finnish population of the provinces of the Olonets and Archangel Governments, and as far as possible to the Finnish and Esthonian inhabitants of Ingermanland.(5.) The Soviet Government must agree not to make or support directly or indirectly Bolshevik propaganda in any of the four States.(6.) A neutral zone must be fixed outside the ethnographical frontiers of the Baltic States.(7.) Any special claims by an individual State, including financial and economicclaims, must be supported by them all. (8.) The Entente shall first be told that the four States desire to discuss withthem the time at which commercial relations between themselves and theBolsheviks might be opened and the nature of those relations. (9.) The Entente shall be asked to organise the administration of the neutral zone.(10.) The Entente shall be asked that either themselves or the League of nations will control the execution of any treaty made. (11.) The manifesto will be addressed by the three Baltic States to the Govern-ments and to public opinion of the Entente countries.On the 25th September His Majesty&apos;s Government sent instructions to its Repre-sentatives in the Baltic States informing them: that no pressure would be brought to bear to deter the Baltic States from concluding peace, as it was for the latter to decide what was in their best interests. At the same time an assurance was given that when the final status of the new States was decided by the Peace Conference or the League of Nations &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government will exert such influence as they may possess to secure the satisfaction of the legitimate aspirations of Esthonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, so far as may be consistent with a final and peaceful settle-ment in North-East Europe.&quot;4. Relations between von der Goltz and the Russians.The Russian forces in the Baltic States are in such a. jumble that it is difficult to say which of the leaders are in touch with von der Goltz and which are not.   On[1056] B 2
the north-west front facing the Bolsheviks there are two commanders., both of tihem nominally under Yudenich, viz., Rodzianko and Arsenyev. Of these, the former has been working with the Allies, while the latter is entirely with the Germans. Yudenich himself has remained with the Allies, though Arsenyev and others have tried and are still trying to bring him over to the German side.It is in Courland and Lithuania, however, that the pro-German Russian troops ( are concentrated, with their headquarters at Mitau, in Latvia, and Schawli, in lithuania-Stefania. There are two Baits nominally at the head of. these troops, Prince Lieven and Count von Keller, but the active officers in command are Colonel Bermont, in Cour-land, and Colonel Virgolich, in Lithuania. The numbers of the Russians in Cour-land are uncertain; in Lithuania they are reported to number 2,000, and it is said that another 2,000 are coming from Germany.The Russian forces are equipped and paid by the Germans, and are largely com-posed of Germans dressed as Russians. They make no secret of the fact that they look to Germany to restore Russia from the Bolsheviks, and they treat the Letts and Lithuanians with ill-disguised hostility. If, however, the Russians could be sepa-rated from the Germans the majority might be quite willing to leave Courland and join Yudenich on the north-west front.Von der Goltz is, of course, in the closest touch with these Russian troops, and there is a Russian Committee in Berlin which presumably works hand in hand with. the German organisation that supports von der Goltz. There is, however, not sufficient information to determine the nature of von der Goltz&apos;s organisation it is reported to be financed by a consortium of banks or its relations with the German Government. Nevertheless, one thing is certain : that many Russians who have been in Berlin have been sufficiently impressed by (1) its efficiency, (2) its ability to take Petrograd. so that they have now thrown in their lot with the Germans in preference to the Allies.     *5. Internal Situation in -(a.) Lithuania. Lithuania is in much the worst position of the three Baltic States. The Lithuanian Government only controls the old Russian Government of Kovno and part of that of Suwalki, while the Germans are in occupation of Schawli, together with a force of Russians, and the Poles hold the rest together with Vilna.The Lithuanian Government, with its headquarters at Kovno, is a Coalition Government based on the Taryba or National Council. Like Latvia, Lithuania has not yet had a chance of summoning a Constituent Assembly, and the present Govern-ment is therefore of a provisional character. The Prime Minister, M. Slezevicius, is a Popular Socialist, M. Voldemar, who at one time was with the Lithuanian Delega-tion in Paris, being Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Coalition contains ChrisLan Democrats, Nationalists and moderate Socialists.The army, under the command of General Zhukovsky, numbers only 12,000 fully equipped and another 12,000 without equipment. What equipment it posessses has been obtained from Germany.The Government^ present, policy is to conclude peace with the Bolsheviks, who occupy scarcely any Lithuanian territory, in conjunction with the other Baltic States. They then hope to get rid of the German forces with the help of the Allies, after which they will concentrate against the Poles, to whom they are more bitterly opposed than to the Bolsheviks or any other Russians.(b.) Esthonia,-Esthonia is the only one of the three Baltic States which has had an opportunity of summoning a Constituent Assembly. This Assembly met on the 23rd April. Its first act was the formation of a Coalition Government contain-ing representatives from the three most important parties : the Labour Party (Social Democrat), the Radical Socialist Party, and the National Party. Of these three parties the Labour Party holds the largest number of seats in the Diet-43 out of 120 but the Prime Minister, Strandman, belongs to the Radical Socialist Party. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Poska, comes from the National Party. ^ Scon after the formation of the Coalition Government the independence of Esthonia was declared by the Diet on the 14th May, and the Allied Governments were notified of this decision. Since then the Diet has been mainly occupied with the new Land Bill, which is of a very Radical nature. So far the first and second readings have passed the Diet, but no final decision has yet been reached, as there are strong differ-ences of opinion between the Radical Socialist and Labour Parties with regard to the size of estates.
oAt the end of August there was a good deal of dissatisfaction with the Govern-ment owing to the bad food distribution. This came to a head on the 1st September, when the Government was forced to deport ninety extreme Socialists from Esthonia to Soviet Russia. There is no doubt that the moral of the army has been weakening, a fact that has been admitted by Poska, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and it is this, together with the agitation of the Labour Party in the Diet, which had led to the opening of peace negotiations with the Soviet Government. At the moment interest in Esthonia is mainly concentrated on (1) the discussions at Dorpat, begin-ning on the 29th September, between the Baltic States and Finland to decide upon a joint line of action with regard to the Soviet Government; and (2) the plan for a League of the Baltic States, to include Finland also if possible.(c.) Latvia-The present Lettish Government, with ITlmanis as Prime Minister and Meirovich as Minister for Foreign Affairs, was formed in the beginning of July at Riga after the evacuation of the town by the Germans. It is a Coalition Govern-ment. formed of the two chief non-Socialist parties, the Farmers&apos; Party and tho Latvian Democratic Union. The Socialist Party has refused to join the new Govern-ment, but there are two Bait representatives, Erhardt and Magnus, and one Jew, Minz. The present Government was elected by the Lettish National Council (Tautas Padomi), which numbers 102 members, consisting of 78 Letts and 24 representatives of the National Minorities. The present National Council has grown out of a much smaller body, numbering thirty-nine, which was called together in November, 1918, on the basis of thirteen representatives from the Farmers&apos; Party, thirteen from the bourgeois parties, and thirteen from the Socialists. The National Council is a purely provisional body until the opportunity comes for electing a Constituent Assembly. This, of course, cannot be done until the Germans have evacuated Courland.There is little activity as regards internal politics, as the chief interest is in (1) the peace negotiations with the Bolsheviks and (2) the evacuation of the Germans. The chief difficulty in the negotiations with the Bolsheviks will be.the fact that the latter occupy the whole of Lattgalia, the western portion of the Russian Government of Vitebsk. In spite of the desire for peace on the part of the Lettish population, there would be very strong opposition to coming to terms with the Soviet Govern-ment unless the latter agrees to hand over Lattgalia,The Lettish army probably numbers about 16,000, under Colonel Ballod, and is vastly inferior in numbers to the German forces in Latvia under von der Goltz and the Russian forces under Colonel Bermont, the latter being reported to number about 10,000.October 1, 1919.
