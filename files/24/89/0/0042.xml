-.....;   -    ,, . .........   ;.r        /v J   aWAR     CABINET ^ .&apos;v:&apos;      302: Emergency Food ArrangementsMemorandum, by the Pood Controller&apos;I: desire to lay before the. Cabinet the following statement.   ; of the arrangements made by the Ministry of,Pood to meet the emergency which has now arisen.1*   Emergency measures for the supply and distribution of food-stuffs were considered during the war for the purpose of meeting any dislocation of transport which might become Inevitable,   In the early part of the present year these arrangements were revised in view of the serious Industrial unrest and possibility of strikesj and the taking over by my-Department of the organise ation set up by the Road Transport Board facilitated the formation of&apos;schemes for substituting transport.2, - The measures&apos; In contemplation fell under three heads:-(a) The delegation of considerable powers to Local Authorities, i.e. Local Pood Committees working through Divisional Pood Commissioners&apos;:&apos;(b) The shifting of stocks through, the ports to inland centres, and the&apos; encouragement of wholesalers and retailers to hold unusually large stocks, of goods:(c ) The . elaboration iv&apos;of a-complete&apos; system of road transport.3.   Delegation of powers.   It was always recognised that the functions of Local Authorities, which contributed very largely to the success of rationing, must be considerably increased in&apos;, any emergency such as thisj and for some months Divisional Food Commissioners have been in possession of instructions, which have been modified from time to time in order to keep them up to date, as. to the general lines of actierivwhioh.&apos;they should follow in case of need. They have been given and are now exercising very.wide powers of.-restricting- consumption by&apos; schemes of local rationing, of fixing maximum prices &apos;in the case of uncontrolled foods, and of requisitioning supplies,-in order to secure equality of distribution. Divisional Commissioners were also instructed to prepare and have ready for Is sue:, immediately upon tho declaration of a strike detailed Instructions: to the local Pood Committees in their area,//relating e.g. to theSupply, conservation transports protection of foodstuffs etc- etc.These arrangements appear, up to the present, to have Worked well. No complaints .have been received of any excessive run upon shops or of the formation of queues, such as occurred in January 1918,. The retail-shop-keepers have, further, rendered.every assistance in their power to prevent any undue depletion of their stocks,4i Transfer of stocks.   In the case of most foodstuffs retailers . hold from ten to fourteen days1 supply, and In the case of; rationed foods, such as sugar and butter, the reduction in the ration put into effect by the Ministry at once operated to increase this by some 50$* . Moreover, steps&apos;had already been taken to deposit at suitable points inland stocks of flour, canned meat, canned salmon, and condensed milk, in order to form an immediate reserve in case transport difficulties became acute. Up to the present there-has been no necessity to draw on these artificial reserves.
5*, Road Transport.  The following two examples, showing the arrangements made&apos;&apos; by the Ministry, may be given,(a) The scheme for supplying London with milk by means of road transport has been given some prominence,   In the case of London, Hyde Park is used as a Central Wholesale Depot.. From this Depot the lorries with empty churns proceed within a radius of 100 miles round London to the usual railway stations at whioh farmers and factories deliver their milk.   At these stations empty churns are dropped, and full churns are picked up and transported to Hyde Park. There the milk is distributed by the Yfholesale trade. In the same manner as if it were picked up by the wholesaler on arrival by rail.In order to bridge over the interval which must of necessity occur at the outbreak of a strike, a .day-and-a-halfts supply of milk was, jithin the past week., collected and stored in cold storage.Schemes similar to that for London were worked out and are in operation for all the big centres of population normally dependent for their milk supply upon the railway services.(b) The arrangements for distributing yeast may also be mentioned.   Supplies come mainly from Scotland and Ireland, The yeast is being brought by Admiralty ships from the ports in Scotland and in Ireland, where the distilleries are situated, to ports all round the coast.  From these Admiralty ships it Is conveyed inland in bulk by Road Transport to Inland Distributing Centres.From these Centres., it is transported by light Ford vans throughout the country,6.   So far as distribution effected by the Government ia concerned, the strike came at a favourable time for ail articles of food excepting sugar.   The September allocations of sugar are In many cases still upon the railway, where reports, especially in the North-West of England., reveal a considerable accumulation, of foodstuffs, most of them fortunately of a non-perishable character.   It is essential that steps should be taken to effect a clearance of these foodstuffs If distribution is to become anything like normal.    Similar difficulties occur in the case of meat at ports, which cannot be unloaded into trains there ready to receive it, but the general arrangements in respect of meat supplies have proved satisfactory.On the other hand, the arrangements for supplying fish have worked out better than was expected, and there seems every reason to believe that a sufficient number of potatoes to maintain London&apos;s normal supply will be forthcoming in the course of the present week, owing mainly to the development of coastwise traffic.7.   Among the minor measures taken to meet the emergency, may be mentioned a stricter limitation of the quantity of foods whioh. may be acquired or held in any household, the reduction of tho, ration of sugar and of butter, the restriction of the quantities of essential foods to be consumed in public eating places and the imposition of maximum growers1 and wholesalers1 prices.for potatoes and other vegetables in common use.GEO.
