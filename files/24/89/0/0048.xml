RATES OF WAGES IN THE BUILDING TRADE.

Memorandum by the First Commissoner of Works.

There is a growing tendency in the buildings trade for masters and men to agree upon rates of wages which are considerably in excess of those recently authorised, thus adding seriously to the cost of all building construction.

Private concerns - anxious to get ahead with business and unable to combat the trade combination - submit to these excessive rates, but the Government are bound to resist these unreasonable demands if their Housing Schemes and Pensions and other buildings are to be carried out at a rate other than extortionate and within a responsible time.

As an example of the present position. I would quote the case of the Woodpark Park Huts at Epsom, which are to be adapted by my Department for the Ministry of Pensions for the training of disabled officers and men. The Epsom rates were authorised by the Ministry of Labour as recently as May last and nothing has since that date arisen to justify any increase therein. In spite of this the District Federations have mutually agreed upon considerable advances contrary to their own area scheme; these advances the Ministry of Labour, acting on the recommendation of the Building Labour Committee, is unable to sanction; the result is that higher (London) rates are being paid on the construction of a Cinema Factory, which is of doubtful utility, while the urgently needed premises for the disabled cannot be proceeded with because no labour is ? at the proper rates for the district.

A similar situation exists at Liverpool, Nottingham and Leicester, and there is little doubt that the trouble will spread throughout the country unless immediate stops are taken to find a remedy for the disease.

As an individual Minister, I have only two courses open to me: either I must yield to the pressure of the local Associations and pay the higher rates or I must suspend all work. The former course I regard as impossible as it would involve the setting aside of the carefully considered opinion of the Building Labour Committee, ratified by the Minister of Labour, with the consequent scramble between Government ? for the available labour and the rapid rise in the cost of all Government Building construction. The latter course would involve a serious delay in the work of other Departments and in the case of the Ministry of Pensions would lead to grave discontent on the part of the very men who are most deserving of the gratitute of their follow countrymen. Neither of these alternatives is therefore open to me as a 
Siresponsible Minis toy, &apos;, -&apos;.1 understand that tho Ministry of Health cro considering a scheme for tho granting, of priority licences for building, whioh, while not so rigid rs that in force during tho War, would cause building labour aafl materials to bo devoted to the most necessary purposes,     A scheme on those linos it; I consider urgently required to moot the abnormal conditions at present prevailing ,-.-nd I would strongly ur6e that such a schomo should be brought into ;:&apos;force   at tho earliest possible moment.The Memorandum da tod tho 20th ultimo -(G.T.8194) by tho Minister of Pensions also relates to this question, but -as regards -ihe &apos; sc? b. d paragraph of thsct Memorandum, I should state, that elt&amp;r^gft&apos;i have me do GWtuirioa, I cannot find that the tendon County. -gevuaoll are carrying on any building work -at Epepm at&apos; the present time.(SiS-nod)     ALffEED HCNL,Storey^ Goto, S/7.1. 1st october, 1919,(j
