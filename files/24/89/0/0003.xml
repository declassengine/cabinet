HYRDDIK IVAHS.(1)Letter from Lord Torrin^ton to Mr, O.B. Droyy.DEFENCE OF TH3 realises.I LOSSES COI-SUSSIOiUCrone House,15, Curzon Street, Hayfair, London,22nd September, 1019.Sir,   &apos;I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo inviting my views as ChM^van of the Pcfence of tho Realm LossessCommission, on the accompanying -report of the Interdepartmental Committee submitted to the Van Cabinet and the memorandum of the --Secretary of State thereon,I have carefully considered these documents.1 think the report states most ably and accurately thepresent and prospective position as regardn claims r:v*&apos;. com r--sation, and the problem which has to be solved, and it become aunnecessary for me to cnlar;e further upon it,I agree entirely with the opinion expresses&quot;j by the Secretary of State in his memorandum, and I concur In his ro-corincndation that the second alternative proposed by the Committeis the preferable one to adopt,   T think the propose&quot; Bill givin claimants statutory rights, tc pi^Cei Oa?mc, should make the tribunals statutory tribunals, with pcwei tc administer oaths9 to compel the attendance of Fitnesses, and. the pro-0 notion and discovery of documents.   I may,add that the present uncertp^tr,
owing to the Do Keyser judgment, is ^roviiift very embarrassing to the Royal Commission, and it is urgently neca&amp;sary that the-&apos;&quot; proposed Bill of Indemnity on the line a recommended should be passed into law with all possible despatch,I       Sir,Yours faithfully,(Sgd)   TE?ir.IlTGTOSr.(2)Letter fhom Lord Jersey to Iir. G-    P^igy.Admiralty Transport arbitration board,10th September, 1919.Dear Sir,In answer to your letter of the 21st August I think that the principles on which this Board has acted should, be declared valid and that all claims inconsistent with them should be barred.   As those principles have not been officially declared in any way it it desirable for me to state them shortly.The construction which the Board under my direction or with my approval, has placed on the Proclamation of the 5 August 1914 is that it authorises payments for the use of vessels re-quisitioned and compensation for damage to or loss of such vessels clue to such use, but does not authorise compensation for any other damage or loss which the requisition may have caused inoi-dentally to the owners or thin- persons who may happen to have had contractual relations with them.As regards payments for the use of vessels the Board has held that increase of market values or rate&apos;, due to the war should not be taken into account and that payments should be based on a liberal estimate of the profits that an owner could have made if there had been no war.As regards claims for loss or damage the Board has refused to entertain them unless they could be brought within the terms of the Proclamation construed as above.   The claims consequently rejected were claims for indirect damage suffered by owners ci- third parties.   In my op&quot; .ion claims of that char-acter are r r should be inadmissable even apart from the proclamation-mation: th-j; are of the nature of losses to which all members of the community were exposed more or loss durin? war.   The inter-conferenee with trade and business caused by the requisition of vessels is an ordinary and necessary result of war,   The conse-quences to individuals must vary according to the nature of their business and affairs, ami it appears to me that the only proper course is to leave each individual to bear the loss which happens to fall on him.I further think that it would he impossible to deal effectively with the innumerable claims which might bo put forward if the nrinciple of indemnity for indirect losses were allowed.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd)   JERSEY(President).G.H. Drury Esq.,C/o The Secretary,Y;ar Office, S,w,
