The total area of land administered, by the Board remains the same as that men-tioned ir-i last week1 s report, namely, 18,643 acres.Treasury sanction to the purchase of the Titchfield Estate for the purposes of a Farm Settlement has now been received.The total number of ex-Service men working at the Farm Settlements at the end of last week was 245, consisting of 60 settlers, 148 probationers and 37 other ex-Service men working as wage-earners.     In addition 22 men have been accepted as probationers, but have not yet commenced work.    During the present week the Board will obtain possession of five additional Parm Settlements, namely, Berwick St. James, litchfield, Kilnington, &quot;Vantage and Kinson, and arrangements are being made for ex-Service men to obtain holdings or commence work at these Settlements at once.     In some cases, however, the men will have to travel from a distance and will not be able to do so until train services are resumed.Owing to the Railway Strike and the consequent delay in the mails, only two of the weekly reports from the Directors have been received.     Arrangements have, been made to let as from the 11th prox. the remainder of the available holdings at Holbeach   to suitable ex-8ervice men who have completed their period cf probation. A 2-J- ton &quot;Burford&quot; Motor Lorry has been supplied to the Heath Hill Parm Settlement during the week. .   At Holieston the principal work has been ploughing, thatohing, clearing out&apos; dykes and trimming hedges.    A commencement has been made with the erection cf two Army Huts as dwellings for married men.     At Amesbury most of the men are engaged in digging the potatoes and carting them to the station.     260 tons of potatoes have been sc&amp;d at . 8 a ton, and 120 tons of hay at  12 a ton.     133 acres of winter oats have now been sown a,t this Settlement.(ijj   Work cf Agricultural Executive Committees.Determination of Tenancies.   In February last the Beard made an Order determining the tenancy of 7  acres of land at Lett on, Norfolk^ whicn was being cultivated in an unsatisfactory manner.     The tenant exercised his right of appeal to arbitration, and in April last the Arbitrator reported that none of the land was cultivated according to the rules of good husbandry, but considering that it would probably be difficult to cbtain a new tenant at that time, he suggested that the tenant should be allowed to remain until Michaelmas of this yeai%     The Arbitrator was, therefore, instructed tys postpone making his Award.     He now reports that the land is in a foul state, and that there has not been the slightest improvement
ainoe his previous report.   He has, therefore,   issued his Award whioh states that it is desirable, in the interests of ft cod husbandry&quot;, that the tenancy should be determine!, and directs that the costs of the-- arbitration should be paid by the Norfolk Agricultural lixocutivo Committee,Tho Board have received an application from t**.e Somerset-Agricultural Ilzecutive Committee for an Order determining the sub-tenancy of a farm of 316 acres at \ialton-in-O-ordano, tho lessees of which are the Committee of the Clevedon Oolf Club.   The Executive Oomoittee report that the crops on the arable land are mostly a failure, and that some of the pas cure      land is very rough, consisting- raainlv oi g&apos;orse and briar.   An independent report made by the Joardl-s Sub-Commissioner states tnat the arablefields generally show   neglect and lacic of supervision.   In one of the barns the corn sheaves had been dumped and were being put through a chaff cutter for cattle iood.   There appeared to be no attempt to deal with the manure.   The Board have, therefore, issued an Order determining the sub-tenancy forthwith.The total number of determination Orders issued by the Board up to the present is 771, covering an acreage of 58220 acres.Precision of land for Allotments.The Board have recently investigated a number of complaints reoeived from allotment holders to the effect that land cultivated as allotments is being ta:cen for the provision of houses, notwithstanding the fact that uncultivated land, equally suitable for housing purposes, is available in the district.   In some cases the Board have been successful in securing a concession to the allotment holders, but in other cases the connlaints have been received too late for the Board to tame any effective action,.plans for the lay-out of the iiousing Scheme having been approved by the Ministry of Health, the loan sanctioned, etc.The Board are anxious not to put any obstacles in the way of carrying out the Government Housing Scheme, out it 3eems clear from the cases which have been investigated that there is a danger of allotment holders being dispossessed unnecessarily.     Allotment land usually is level, possesses good frontage and is easily accessible.   It consequently aposaly strongly to housing authorities, with the result that reasonable claims of allotment holders are often overlooked.   The Ministry of jriealth have, -therefore been asked to instruct their Housing   Commissioners not to approve any schemes for taring allotment land for building purposes until the Board1s local District Commissioner or Allotment Inspector has concurred. It is understood that the iiinistry are favourably consider in: this proposal.(iv) Land Drainage,River Ouse,    A new crane has   been installed on the dredger wording in the iiarsh   Cut, and tlie dredging- is now proceeding satisfactorily.River Lee.   A conference of representatives of the various authorities interested was held at the Ministry oi Health to discuss measures for tho prevention of flooding.   The Board are unable to initiate any action under tie Land Drainage Acts, as the problem is largely a Metropolitan one-   a ccmmunicaticn is ejected from the Ministry of Health with regaid to possible legislation.Shropshire.   The County Council are promoting an amalgamation of the drainage authorities cf areas draining into the Severn with a view to a single authority for tho main river --rii.Ji its tributaries be in.-; ultimately established.

The reports show that in about 120 of these cases the grounds are used for the purpose of -recreation as intended, but that about 30 arc not being used for the purpose of recreation.     Some cf the reports disclose cases of encroachments by private landowners upon the grounds and of the unlawful use of the grounds for purposes other than those for which&apos; they Were allotted.     In other cases surplus rents arising from the Recreation Grounds have been applied in directions not authorised by the Inclosure Acts.     The Board are in communication with the Trustees in all such cases of irregularity.Ah &quot;Ixchange under the Inclosure Acts, of land in the Parishes of ?lucklcy and &quot;Sgerton&apos;between F.G..

The estimated production of Sulphate of Ammonia during the ensuing three months is 97,000 tons and on the basis of last year1s figures it is estimated that the home agricul-tural requirements during that period will amount to rather lees than 80,000 tons.     The Sulphate cf Ammonia Association, by whom exports arc arranged, has therefore been informed that they may proceed on the assumption that 15,000 eons of eul./nate will be allowed to be exported during the quarter.     It is necessary to make arrangements in advance but the final authority is only given shortly before shipment and exports can be restricted in the event of evidence being produced that the home demand was not beings met.

Ho expects to be able to obtain about&apos;P.65 per ton which on the current price of hemp is a reasonable figure.Transport.   In view of com.laints made by growers in Kent that the fruit and vegetable traffic Was net being well handled at Blackfriars and that in consequence they were unable to deliver to Covent garden, visits were paid both to Blackfriars Station and to Covent Garden late at night and during the early morning at the time when the traffic is being received..     The complaints made against tho railway appeared to hnve no foundation in fact, the system of handling the market traffic was good and tho entire staff at Biockfriars Station wore found to be working at high pressure. The premises of several dealers at Covent Garden were however&apos; closed and several railway vans had in consequence tc wait several hours before they were able to deliver;    the number of such cases was, however, r elat i vely sma11,The Ministry of Transport has asked for the observations of the Board on the agricultural position in the districts which would be served by the following proposed railways, powers for the construction of which are now being sought, viz.   Light Railways between Torrington and Halwill;   Bridgwator and Vatchett;   Ongar and elienfield.The enquiry as to tho need for additional transport facilities in rural districts which was commenced in February 1918, is now practically completed.     Tho total number of districts investigated is 205.     The number of districts where there is sufficient traffic to justify any largo outlay is small, though there are a lorgo number of districts where a few motor lorries could be employed with advantage,     So far as is possible to form an opinion, the prospect of an increase in agricultural traffic as the direct result cf the provision cf additional facilities is doubtful, but tho whole question needs further consideration from the point of view of land settlement.     Thoprovioion of transport facilities to meet the requirements of the small holdings which are now being developed will be considered separately.export of Seed --otatoes.     Applications .nre being received for licences tc export large quantities of seed, potatoes to Spain, the Canary Islands and other places.     By arrangement with the Kinistry of Pood licences are being granted freely for potatoes which are dressed to a standard sc\,d size, hut none are allowed to be shipped from districts affected with \ art Disease, and the export cf the rarer varieties is being closely regulated.Technical Division,Requirements and,Disposal Section.

These grants have hitherto been administered as a portion of the Research Scheme promulgated by the Board and Development Commissioners in 1911.   They wore intended, in the main, to foster the investigation of local problems relating to agriculture and to provide technical advice to agriculturists.   It is now proposed to transfer the cost from the Development Amd to the Beard&apos;s Vote, and to include it in the ordinary &quot;maintenance&quot; grants made to Agricultural Colleges.Application lias been received from Bristol University for the purchase of Ycnnswood Yarn, Long Ashton, about 260 acres in extent for the purposes of the Yes ear oh Institute in Yruit Grcing.

Consideration hao been given to the question of the salaries paid by Local Education Authorities tt the staff engaged in the provision of instruction in agriculture and allied subjects,     Under the regulations naw in force the Board are empowered to refund to Local Authorities 30% of the salary and expenses of the Agricultural Organiser, and the Treasury have recently sanctioned grants at the same rate to the Horticultural Superintendent in a maximum of twenty selected counties.     In order to secure that men of adequate technical and administrative ability should be- scoured for these posts, it is considered that  400 and  300 per annum should be regarded&apos; as the minimum starting salary of the Agricultural Organiser and I orticultural Superintendent respectively, and the Poard have therefore intimated to Local Authorities that the full 80f Grant will not be approved in respect of salaries&apos; below these figures unless adequate reasons exist for the payment of lower salaries.Training Branch.1.

Cases of diseases are als^ being found in considerable numbers in the South West.     In most cases the reporting of the diseases is to be traced to the publicity given by the posters on Wart Disease prepared and circulated by the Board.An example of good work done by a policeman in Gloucestershire is reported.     Several years ago the disease occurred in his garden, and as a result he took great interest in the question and reported further eases.     One.of these cases occurred in the garden of a local seedsman, and the policeman was largely instrumental in getting this seedsman to stock only immune varieties, and orer 50 tens of seeds of these varieties were distributed in the locality.    No further oases of Wart Disease have come to light in this locality&apos;,,1 Other potato Diseases *   Blight is more prevalent than, in previous reports, but as*the crop is being lifted dry very little &quot;disease is reported on the tubers.Corky Ssab is reported as being very prevalent in North Derbyshire, it is else common an the /borderlands of Lancashire and Yorkshire,     More cases of Black Leg have-been reported.As regards crop, the immune variety -Ally is reported to he giving Very ge*d results in Wales.and elsewhere, and it is noteworthy that good reports are -being received of its good eating qualities whereas Scottish grown Ally is notorious for its bad bating -qualit iesMajestic and Tinwald-o Pen jc tire immune late varieties are also giving.goad crops, the latter being very promising in ?ales where Great Scot and King George are still in great favour.

Government assistance for the Autumn Herring Fishing. The Cabinet decided at the end of the last week to purchase up to 600,000 barrels, the Autumn Herring ? at Yarmouth and Lowest of at a price fixed upon the basis of 45/ per cran to the fishermen, and 32/- per barrel to the curer. The profits accruing from the sale by the 

Government of the barrels abroad or elsewhere to be divided in the following proportions:-

75% to the Government.

25% to the Curers.

All sections of the Herring Industry were notified of this decision ? telegram on Saturday afternoon, and a meeting of the Trade Executive Committee had been summoned for Thursday afternoon, when it is possible that most of the members of the Committee will be able to managed to obtain transport of some kind, to enable them to attend. How far it will be possible for the Industry to benefit by the offer on the part of the Government remains to be seen, in view of the present situation, but the Board are proceeding with all the necessary arrangements so as to be in a position to carry put the terms of the Government&apos;s offer is so required.

Transference of Admiralty Drifters for use by ex-service skippers. In the course of last week an urgent appeal was received from 8 ex-Service skippers for the transference from the Admiralty of certain drifbers lying at Lowestofts and ? elsewhere, which they were anxious to use during the coming Autumn Fishing. The Admiralty were approached in the matter and an arrangement has now been arrived at whereby, at all events, drifters will be available in a few days, and will be handed over to the fishermen on certain conditions, the most essential conditions being that the Admiralty, ? the Board, on their behalf, remain as owners of the vessel, and received the owners&apos; share of the profits. The only charge falling on the Board as representatives of the Admiralty will be the cost of insuring, which is now being investigated, and the cost of saying an overseer to represent the fishermen in all negotiations with the Board, whose foe will amount to £1 per boat per week, together with travelling expenses, if any.

Malayan Fisheries (F.3669). The Fisheries Deparment of the Federated Malay States have asked for plans and particulars of British  steam and motor drifters, and the fishing gear used with ? view to the introduction of such vessels in Malayan waters. The Board are endeavouring to obtain the information.

Shortage of Trawler Hands at Fleetwood. The attempts of the Board to meet requests for assistance by trawler owners st Fleetwood have been frustrated by the Railway Strike which renders it impossible for unemployed men at other ports to go to Fleetwood.

Sale of British trawlers to Colonial Buvers, (F.3541/1919) An enquiry was recently addressed to the Board as to whether there are any regulations in force as regards the sale of trawlers to British Colonial buvers. The applicants have been informed that there are no such restrictions in force at present.

English Trawlers fishing in Canadian Waters. (F. 3670/1919). An enquiry was recently made of the Board as to whehter any licence is required to send and English trawler to fish, temporarily, in Canadian waters, and land her catch at Canadian ports. The reply was in the negative.

Supply of Coal for trawlers (F.3628/1919). The Board were recently ? by the owner of a steam trawler at Burnham-on-Crouch to invoke their assistance in getting a supply of coal for his vessel. The case was taken up with the Coal Controller who arranged for the needed coal to be sent.

At the markets last week both fat cattle and sheep were shown in larger numbers, but supplies were still below those returned at the end of August.  Calves for slaughter were slightly dearer. Dairy cows of the best quality showed a further advance in price, but store pigs were decidedly cheaper. Barley continued to advance in price, while oats are also very dear. Potatoes were more plentiful and cheaper.

The number of claims received to date under the guaranteed price of corn is 112,000. Of these 79,000 have been examined.

Certificates were issued for the export of 322 sheep by the Agricultural Relief of Allies Commitee, 40 horses and 6 pigs to France; for 2 horses, 11 cattle and 50 sheep to Argentina; for 4 cattle to Uruguay. Also 9 certificates for the export of forage to Jersey were issued.

Farm Workers&apos; Branch.

Staffordshire agricultural strike has collapsed, and the man have returned to work, except a few who seem to have got work elsewhere. The Staffordshire Farmers Union have been induced to pass a resolution in favour of reinstating all the strikers.

The representative of the Farm Workers&apos; Branch also urged on the farmers the advisability of forming a conciliation committee to deal with such matters in future. No decision was taken on Saturday, the attendance being comparatively small owing to the railway strike.

Agricultural Wages Board.

A meeting of the Wages Board was held on the 24th September, having been specially confirmed by the Chairman to consider a communication received on the 23rd inst. from the President of the Board of Agriculture acting under Section 5 (5) of the Corn Production Act, 1917, directing the Agricultural Wages Board to reconsider their decision of the 22nd to reduce the number of hours per week on which the minimum rates are based from 54 to 50 in October and the following summer. After careful consideration it was unanimously resolved that the Board reaffirm their decision.

An employer was prosecuted at Shrewsbury on the 24th September in respect of the underpayment of three workers. One of the workers showed that he had applied three times for the minimum wage and failing to get it, had left the employer. The employer denied this, and stated that he was quite ignorant of the Board&apos;s Orders. It appeared that the defendent had had correspondence with the Wages Board, and that he read a newspaper in which the Orders of the Wages Board are advertised.

The Bench did not convict but ordered payment of arrears to two of the workers amounting to about £15, and costs. The summonses in respect of the third worker were withdrawn as a Permit of Exemption had been granted since the Inspector&apos;s visit.

An employer was prosecuted at Hurst Green, Sussex, in respect of the underpayment of a number of his workers, including


several women. In the case of the women, arrears had been paid before the hearing, but a fine of £10 was imposed. Two soldiers employed in agricultural work were involved in the case, and a conviction was recorded, in each case. There were also four boys concerned, who were stated to be learning farming. In the case of three of them the Magistrates ? the fourth case was dismissed as the Benin decided that the boy was not employed in agriculture. The fines imposed in respect of all the convistions amounted to £45 in all.

During the week 94 cases of complaint of non-payment of the minimum rates were received, the largest number from a slagie county being 12 in the case of Anglesey, l.3 cases were sent to Inspectors for visits enquries by correspondence were made in 261 cases, and 131 cases were completed. Reports were received from Inspectors in 157 cases.

Work on the Wash is proceeding with a reduced number of me: namely 92. The introduction of a bonus system of payment has alrea? reduced the working ? on the bank by over 30 per cent, although the men themselves have been able to earn more money. The excavation and deposition of material ? now be taken as costing about ls.9d. per cubic yard as compared with 3s? 6d. at the beginning of operations.

The dismantling of the Camp at Falmouth is proceeding but no material has been seat forward to St Burvan.      Similarly, the six motor, lorries purchased for Cornwall have been retained in London at the present moment they have been placed at the disposal of the Ministry of Transport.

Establishment Branch.

Arrangements have been made as far as possible to meet all contingencies that may arise ? connection with the Railway Strike ? far as this Department in connection. Of the present, staff of the Board&apos;s London Offices numbering ? it appears ? are absent owing to the strike. But the number may be less ? to th? fact that, some proportion may be absent owing to sickness, etc.

It is estimated that at least 700 members of the staff (male and female) will he able to at tend without transport assistance of any kind.  Of the ? who would experience difficulty in getting to the office without some means of transport it is consider that the attendance of at least 120 will be essential for giving attention to the more urgent work of their respective Branches. St are being taken so provide bedding  accommodation on the Board&apos;s premises for ? if necessary at the principal offices. This will leave rather more than ? of the staff whose, presence at the office not absolutely essential to find whatever means may be available to getting to and from the office. Many will no doubt continue to con on bicycles as they are now doing, covering in some cases ? distances. But there will ?main an appreciable number who, ? the event of the trams and buses ceasing to ran will find it practically impossible to attend. In their case it will probably be necessary grant special leave of absence. They should be required in every case to offer their services  locally to any representative Government Authority ? who are working in connection with the ? Ministry of Transport, alternatively to the ?. Authority with a view to their employment in some user ? capacity. I understand that the Treasury are to issue instructions on this point. Full information will be required as to any such work that may be undertaken.
On the whole it is anticipated that between 850 and 900 members of the sta:rf will be able to attend their effaces not/with-standing any extension of the strike.
