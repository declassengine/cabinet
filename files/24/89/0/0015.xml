(THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY Off HIS ERIMHIO MAJESTY&quot; S GOVERNMENT).SECRET, Q.T.8215.W A R    CABINET.SITUATION IN IRELAND.Memorandum by Mr. LongoI have just returned from a visit to Ireland, where I saw the Lord Lieutenant and many others, officials and layme n.There is a great deal of had feeling, and it is more than probable there will be more serious crimes when&apos; the days get short.   It is very difficult to prevent this, as it is &apos; Impossible to get evidence,,   The police frequently know who -the criminals are, but they cannot get witnesses to come forward.     I think it is more than probable that tho Irish Government will be compelled to impose martial law in order to conviot the,.guilty and protect the innocent.The lord Lieutenant and Chief Secretary are doing splendid work;   they have the complete confidence of all law-&apos;&quot; abiding people and thousands of unhappy people who long for peace but dare not say so, are looking to them for protection.The lord Lieutenant and the Chief Secretary deserve and require the warm, outspoken support of everybody in the United Kingdom.     The Irish Government have been given prao-tically a free hand;   and I am not aware that they need any additional authority.   But this is of course a matter for the Lord Lieutenant and the Chief Secretary, and not for no. But that this is so is not.understood even by many well informed people in Ireland;   and having regard to. the fact that the
Irish Government may be compelled to adopt most stringent measures., it is most desirable that everybody in Ireland should be made to understand that tho Irish Government have behind them tho whole support and might of the British Government a   To this end, I venture to suggest that an early and definite declaration should be male on Irish policy. It cannot be ignored that the members of the Irish Govorn-raent are faced with a more difficult and dangerous situation than any Irish Government has had to deal with for many years; and they can only succeed if they are relieved of petty anxieties, and if it is known that their policy Is the policy of His Liajesty^s Government as a whole,I therefore desireto recommend that it should be made clear in a public statement that it lb the. intention mf &apos; the Government not to tolerate existing crime and lawlessness: that they can have no dealings with Sinn Fein, whose leaders openly declare that it is their intention to set up an Irish Republicanism\ci ; ami to ta^e immecLwte steps, following upon the appointment of the new Irish Government,, to bring about union with the Republic of the United States of Anorica.It is well known in Irelam&apos;, that these are the oof in intentions of Sinn Fein; ami a ^roat deal of surprise is expressed In many quarters that His I:ajesty!s Government have not already declared their undying hostility to any policy of the kind.The Act of 1914 is on the Statute Book; and all thoughtful Irishmen understand the true meaning of this; while the Sinn Feiners and others claim that it compels &quot;he Government at an early date to accept that Act of Parliament. I think many of the best Informed people in Ireland fully realise that it is not withvn the range of practical politics for the Government bluntly to repeal the Act: indeed, some of
thorn have said as much to me, ana have added that thoy do not &quot;believe that if the Government v/ish to do bo, thoy could obtain a majority in the House of CommonsoVihat, therefore,-is to be dons?    Ireland urges that she has many grievances against England,.    Most of them are imaginary; some belong to the long dead pa3tp and are not worthy of consideration, even of, recollection.    But some, unhappily still exist.    One seems to me to overeha&amp;cw all the rest;   it is that successive British Governments have refused to rocognise obvious facts in Ireland, and have tried to comfort themselves with the belief that their ov/n particular policy, if adopted, would save the country, e.g., Home Rulers believe with a touching confidence that if only m would grant a full measure of Homo Rule,, all would be well.    They ignore the fact that an Irish Parliament on Dominion lines      and none other would be accepted by the Home *iule Party in Ireland   would be inuo&amp;Iately used, as I have indicated, to set up a Republic, and would be manned by those who are largely responsible for the present state of law-lossness.    Opponents of Home iiule believe   with ecual confidence that all measures of self-government should be denied,,, and that all that is required is a rirm administration of the lrw.      They, in their turn, ignore tho fact that in a considerable part of Irelrnd there xb lw irrepressible desire for some form of Home Governmont, and that this demand is strongly supported in our Dominions and in the United States of ..&apos;jnerica.Isi it not possible to find a middle, policy, and to announce it as one wnich has boon deliberately adopted, and which tho Government mean to pursue to the end?    If this can be done, I firmly believe t.&apos;a.&apos;t many existing difficulties would dis appear, and. t*.rt givau/lly and slo-ly, but surely, ... the condition of Irol nd would vstly improve. .   The country
OQis very prosperous:   all olfiBses h:.veplenty of money - and there is c growing fooling on the part of ;-. great arse of the population, that they would bo foolish if they were to give power to the idli, thriftless and mischievous, to play ducks and drakes with the prosperity of the country and the property of others.My recommendations therefore are  1*    That the Government of Ireland shall be given in public, the assurance ox the entire confidence and sujport of His Majesty1 s&quot; Government,, who are determined that treason, crime, and outrage, shall not be allowed to continue.2.    That on the adoption of tho Federcl Scheme for the United Kingdom, Ireland shall receive such Parliaments as may be thought necessary,     Obviously there must bo two one for Ulster and mother for the three Southern Provinces. In some ,Luarters it 1b thought th:t it v^uld be better if there were more than this, and the Southern Provinces divided up      but this is a detail.It will be urged that these proposals will not satisfy Sinn Ijein:   granted.    But nothing short of the setting up of a Republic will satisfy Sinn Fein.    Therefore why not recognise the fact and ery so frankly?    If the rederal System be adopted, England who doos not care much   about it, will loyally accept and make the best of it a    Scotland and Yfoles, where the   feeling in favour is much stronger, will do the same.    Ulster will accept and make a success of it. -Yhct then is to   be done with the three Southern Provinces, assuming that they decline to adopt the Federal plan, or adopt it, and proceed to use it as I heve indicted above? In either of these circumstances His HajVestiyr-s Government should now state frankly and deliberately that if either of these conditions rrise^ /
they will be compelled to govern that part of tho United Kingdom which refuses to accept and make proper use of a measure of solf- Overnnent r/hich is being granted all round, as if it were a Orovm Colony,I have discussed these proposals with experienced and compet^t Irishmen; and while there are differences of opinion on details, even in some cases serious differ-ences, there is a very general acceptance of the plan, and a universal opinion that, even if it is open to criticism^ it will have tho enormous advantage of clearing up the situation and giving a definite prospect of moderate self-government in the future.(Intd)   77.H.L.admiralty, S.W.
