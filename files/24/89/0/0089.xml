SEORETDIKSCTOR^Jg Off INTELLIGENCE,467(Home Office)Speoial Report Ko. ,10Scotland House, S.W.1,7th October, 1919.(Circulated &quot;by the Home Secretary)UNREST AMONG THE NEGROEST-ia race riots in Washington and Chicago hvve naturally produced speculation &amp;s to whether the unrest which prevails all over the world hag extended to the negroes, not only in the United States but in the British Colonies and Africa.   It now seems clear that the riots were not the sporadic outcome of race prejudice, but the first fruits of the doctrine of sooialistic equality preached by agitators to negro audiences throughout the country.   (See Appendix 1).   It was hardly to be ejipeoted that coloured troops could be employed in Prance without stirring up race-conaciousne3S among returning soldiers. The coloured leaders of the new movement have been talking incessantly for the last nine months, and they have left no doubt as to v/hat their real objects are: the moderate educated negro opinion has been silent, and it is therefore specially interesting to hear the views of a coloured officer, Major W.H. Loving, lately of thePhilippine Constabulary.   With all his judicial attitude towards the aspirations of his race, it is evident that he himself ha3 not been left quite untouched by the feelings of his class.&quot;Socialism mom ki&amp;rqes&quot;Until about four years, ago .radical&apos; sentiment among &quot;negroes was of a moderate character and confined to &quot;denunciations of lynching, disfranchiseraent, Jim Crow-ism,
&quot;etc.   For the most part It consisted of editorials in &quot;tho negro press and speeches of negro orators aimed &quot;directly at the perpetrators of each offence.   Early &quot;in 1915, however, a number of the younger and more &quot;intellectual negroes abandoned the attitude of the old &quot;men and boldly adopted socialism.   Their advent into &quot;the socialist party marked a new epoch in the politica &quot;and social history of the American negro and had far-reaching results.. : Many negroes, especially of the &quot;younger generation, flocked to meeting halls and stres &quot;corners to hear men of their own race expound a new &quot;philosophy and attack the Government to which they &quot;attributed all the social and economic evils suffered &quot;by black and white races alike.&quot;Hew York City, with-a negro population of over &quot;100,000, has long been the fountain head of radical &quot;propaganda among negroes in the United&apos;States, and it &quot;natural that negro socialism should have its inceptioi &quot;in thi3 City. A^ong the more prominent negro leaders &quot;in the City are Cbandler Owen, Philip Randolph, the E &quot;George Frasier Miller and W.A. Domingo. Domingo is a &quot;able yomig man of West Iodian birth; he i3 director ol &quot;the &quot;Messenger&quot; (See Appendixll) and recently drafted &quot;the Socialist plan of campaign among negroes, a copy i &quot;which was published in the daily press following the; &quot;on the Rand School of Social Science. Black sooialie&quot; &quot;has been given added impulse by the bitter feeling am-&quot;negroes throughout the country in regard to the alleg &quot;maltreatment of negro officers and enlisted men in M &quot;,-is reported by returned soldiers and as published in &quot;&apos; Crisis&apos; and other negro journals through the United &quot;States.tee/
&quot;Next in importance to the Socialist movement among &quot;Negroes is the League for Democracy,   This organisation &quot;is composed of,Negro Officers and enlisted men who served &quot;in France during tho war.   The headquarters are in New &quot;York City and &quot;branches ere being established all over the &quot;United States.   Under ordinary circumstances, this &quot;organisation would h5ve no more significance than any &quot;other organisation of ;ter Veterans, but on account of the &quot;insidious propaganda alleged to have been carried on in &quot;Prance by Y/hite Americans against Negro troops, the &quot;Oeague &quot;for Democracy has taken its place .:mong other Radical &quot;organisations dedicated to the Negro cause *   Coloured- &quot;soldiers who were not embarked for France are al30 &quot;eligible for membership, which is expected to reach at &quot;least 150,000.   A weekly newspaper, &quot;The Commoner,&quot; his &quot;recently been started in New York City as the official &quot;organ of the League..   It i3 edited by O.E. HcICaine, &quot;formerly 1st Lieutenant .367th Infantry, .,*.nd who   is also &quot;Field Secretary of the I-eaguo.   The League has been &quot;popularised and,democratised by a waiving of all former &quot;rank held in the.army.   Every member joins on the same &quot;b.;:,sis and is eligible to hold any office in the League. &quot;Applications for membership are coming in daily from all- &quot;parts of the country, and it has been ascertained that.a &quot;welcome will be extended to other radical elements &quot;interested in the negro movement.THE INDUSTRIAL WDRgEKS Og THE WORLD ;&quot;?or several years ;.i limited number of Ne^ro workmen &quot;have been members of the Infustri^l v7orJsers of the World. &quot;But during the past two years sever:! thousands of Negro &quot;labourers have joined the organisation in, response to &quot;vigorous propaganda conducted by its leaders.   Unlike theAmerican/
&quot;American Federation of Labour, the Independent Workers &quot;of the World has never discriminated against Negro &quot;workmen and has always welcomed them to its ranks.   In &quot;fact there is a clause in its constitution prohibiting &quot;discrimination on account of race, creed er colour. &quot;Another distinction between tho two organisations is &quot;that while the American Federation of Labour is primuri] &quot;an organisation of skilled workmen,   the Industrial &quot;Workers of the World .1s an organisation of unskilled -&quot;workmen.   As the majority of NegrO warJanen follow the &quot;unskilled occupations, such as farm hands, day labourers &quot;etc. (thoy had been barred from the skilled trades by &quot;the American federation of Labour) it has been a &quot;comparatively easy matter for the Industrial Workers of &quot;vthe World to enlist them in its ranks.   At. its recent &quot;convention in Atlantic City the American Federation of &quot;Labour abolished its traditional colour line and voted &quot;to accept Negro members on the same basis as white &quot;members of labour unions.. This belated action will hai &quot;no effect on Negroes who have already joined the ranks &quot;of tha Industrial Workers of the World, but if the &quot;American Federation of Labour carries out its pledge in &quot;good faith it may be .expacted to prevent any great &quot;number of Negro workmen from joining the Industrial &quot;Workers of the World in the future.   The natural tenden &quot;of the average negro is to be regular and follow a &quot;beaten path. . He becomes irregular and departs from tltf &quot;beaten path only as a last resort, when he finds that fl &quot;other method will accomplish results.   Under these &quot;oircumstances he is, perhaps, the most radical of all &quot;radicals, his trend of thought swinging from one ertrei &quot;to the other.   The future relation of the Negro workman &quot;and his affiliation with the Industrial Workers ef theWorld/
&quot;World will depend entirely upon tho spirit in which the &quot;Asterloan Federation of Labour carries out its pledge. &quot;If the pledge is not carried out, the Industrial Workers &quot;of the World will eventually enlist in its ranks a vast &quot;majority of the Negro workmen throughout the United &quot;States.   It may be added that the American Federation of &quot;Labour, by reason of its hostility toward ne*?ro labour, &quot;extending over a period of many years, arouses but little &quot;confidence in the Negro workman.UNIVERSAL NEGRO D/IPRQY)l!!vfBNT ASSOCIATION&quot;Tho avowed Object of this organisation is to awaken &quot;race consciousness among Negroes of the United States and &quot;Africa, with the aim of gradually bringing about a unity &quot;of purpose between the Negro peoples of both Continents. &quot;The scheme is very broad in scope and includes the &quot;establishment of closer relations between ail the &quot;coloured races of the world with a view to their mutual &quot;co-operation.   This work is being carried on by clever &quot;propaganda directed principally by Earcus G--.rvey, a &quot;West Indian Negro, whose office is at 56 We3t 135th &quot;Street, New York Oity.   (See Appendix III).,   &quot;This movement, like most others of its character, &quot;originated in New York City and has a weekly newspaper, &quot;&quot;The Negro World/ as its official organ.  -The 1 &quot;Association holds1 periodical mass meetings which are &quot;usually well attended; with the exoeption of Garvey and &quot;Domingo, however, most of its leaders lack intellectual &quot;equipment possessed by the young negroes in the Socialist &quot;Pnrty.&quot;It has been ascertained that there has been &quot;considerable correspondence between the Officers of &quot;the Universal Negro Improvement Association in New York* and/
&quot;and prominent coloured men in foreign countries, and &quot;that such correspondence or exchange of views between &quot;American Negroes and prominent coloured men in other &quot;countries, such as Africa, India, China, Japan and the &quot;west Indies, cannot fail to have its effect in due time &quot;in the establishment of a closer relationship between &quot;the coloured races of the world.&quot;After the peace has been ratified it Is the intents &quot;of the association to raise funds and send agents to &quot;the countries named above to spread the propaganda, &quot;This is to be/accomplished, not by public lectures,.but &quot;by establishing personal relations of friendship with tb &quot;the more radical natives of each country and leaving to &quot;them the work of getting the message to the masses.NATIONAL ASSOCIATION&apos; FOR THE. ADVANCEMENT, Ojg COLOURED PEOPLE &quot;This organisation was formed about ten years ago &quot;for the purpose of promoting the welfare of coloured &quot;people and opposing by lawful means, all forms of &quot;injustice resulting from, race prejudice.   V/hile&apos; organis &quot;for the benefit of negroes, this movement differs from &quot;those already mentioned in that among Its founders and. ^members are some of the most prominent white men of &quot;America, who have always been active in its affairs and -&quot;have&apos; contributed funds to its support. . This organisati..... . i&quot;has about 50,000 members scattered throughout the &quot;country.   One of the leading spirits in the National &quot;Association for the Advancement of Coloured People is &quot;Uajor J..13. Spingam, who was at one time connected with &quot;the Military Intelligence Department.   Mr.,Oswald Garrt &quot;Villard has been one of its principal financial backetTHE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THIS PROMOTION 01* LABOUR UNIONISM AMONG NEGROES       _^&quot;This organisation was formed in Jr-ne 1918, in new york/
- v -        &apos; &apos; 470&quot;York City by Philip Randolph and Chandler Owen.   Its &quot;object is to create and develop a spirit of harmony, &quot;goodwill, and brotherhood between black and white workers, &quot;Its Advisory Board is composed of radical white labour &quot;leaders and prominent Socialists.   Its programme is &quot;detailed and far retching, and caused the New York &quot;State ,&quot;Legislature to assign $30*00 to the Lask Committee for &quot;the investigation of radical organisations, $tc.&quot;iraong those connected with the National Association &quot;for the promotion of Labour Unionism among Negroes are &quot;Horris Hill emit, the -well-known Socialist, who polled &quot;135,000 votes for LUyor of Now York at the last election; &quot;Charles W. Ervin; Editor of the New York &quot;Call,&quot; a &quot;Socialist organ; Jacob Panken, Socialist Judge of the &quot;Municipal.Court, New York City; Joseph Schlossberg, &quot;Secretary of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America &quot;and Rose Schneiderman, President of the Workers&apos; Trade &quot;Union League.THE HAMITIC LEAGUE 0? THE WORLDA New Yojflc branch of the Hamitic League of. the World has recently been organised.   It numbers among its members John E. Bruce (sometimes known as &quot;Bruce Grit&quot;), Arthur Schomberg, Mra. Augusta Waring, E. Latimer, Anselmo Jackson, (of &quot;Our Boys and Girls&quot;) and Cyril V. Brlggs.John. E. Bruce is a V/est Indian of British origin and is an extreme radical.   It is reported that he was the editor of the &quot;African Tiwes of the Orient&quot;, published in London, which was suppressed by the Government.   Anselmo Jackson is editor of &quot;Oar Boys and Girls.&quot;   Cyril V. Briggs is editor of the &quot;Crusader.&quot;   The League would seem to have been organised by G. McLean,Ogle, of British Guiana, who has had articles in tho. &quot;Clarion&quot; from time to time,and/
and is described in that magazine as their British Guiana;: correspondent and organiser of the British Guiana branch f of tho Hamitic League of the World.UNREST IN THE BRITISH COLONIESMeanwhile there ,have been slight disturbances in British Honduras and Jamaica..  In-the latter Colony there was a riot on the night of the 18th July, in which the hooligan element of Kingston joined with some -discharged coloured soldiers and sailors, whose slogan, it is reported, was &quot; ill the Whites.&quot;   It was believed to be a counterblast to the riots in Cardiff and Liverpo Some sailers of H,?I*S. &quot;Constance&quot; were attacked and wounded, as well as one or two white civilians.   There was, howc-ver, nc recurience of the disorders on the following evening, which was the night of the Peace celebrations.The grievances of the coloured troops appear to be due to their treatment at Taranto.   They complain that they were made to do work which should have been assigns to a Labour Company, and that they were not treated by fj the Commandant as members of a fighting unit.   This is said to have been the cause of the outbreak at Belize, in which some local disaffected negroes took part.An educated negro named P.E.M. Hercules arrived ing Jamaica on the 5th July. Up till the 14th August he hai done nothing on which any action against him could have been taken, but it was significant that there was a str; in the workshop of the Jamaica Government Railway after he had addressed the men. There ha3 also been a stride among the dock labourers.-In Burbadoes there has been no disorder, and a rising of black and coloured people against the whitesWm
M      y      Mia considered most unlikely, for the coloured men are very loyal to the Sovereign, and are strongly imbued with the love of their Island and a desire to possess a small, &quot;spot&quot; of land.    Nevertheless, there is undoubtedly some industrial unrest owing to the high oost of living and the general feeling that wages ought to rise as they have in other countries.It is oertaln that the various negro organisations in the United States will not leave the British Colonies alone.   A body oalling itself the &quot;International Uplift League,&quot; conducted by a Dr. Campbell, a coloured man, has already been sending out its literature to Jamaica.   The leaflets bear the figure of a woman representing Liberty, holding in either hand the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes.   It contains the demands of the &quot;Hanitic&quot; or black raoas, and invokes retributive justice on the heads of the Governments who fail to grant the demands.conclusion in conclusion it is vrorth noting that the NationalRace Congress of America, which is to meet in Washington on October 7-11th, has issued the following manifesto:&quot;Conditions arising from the late world-war and &apos; the grave and pressing demands of real Democracy incident thereto, will make the work of the Congress this year far more Important than in any session during its entire history.   This will be known as the SUFFRAGE SESSION of the Congress, at which an effort will be made to determine as to how the civil rights of the Negro in those States in which he has been deprived of his right to vote, may be restored, and how in those States in whivh he enjoys the right of franchise, the ballot may be properly safeguarded and used to the best advantage.To this end, and to the end that all the interests of the race may have prompt attention, plans have been laid- to raise&apos; a fund of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($ 50,000), known as a Defense Fund.   This fund-is under the management of Prof. J.R. Hawkins, Executive Seoretary, 1541 - 14th Street, Washington, D.C., to whom allcontributions may be sent and will be administered under/
under direction of our Executive Committee.Tiie annual Membership fee in the Congress is $2,00 per delegate, and it is indispensable that every unit be represented this year, and that as many additional units be secured as possible, At the Session last year, the Congress, had an audience with President Wilson, the Secretary of the Treasui and Director Gener:d of Railroads and a number of the Senators and Members of Congress. More will be attempted this year. The president of the Congress attended the Pan-African Conference and the Allied Peace Congress in P&apos;.*ris, and much data has been gathered during the past year which will make the sessions ox the Congress this year of unusual interest :vnd supremely profitable.Some of the most able i-nd thoughtful men and women of our race in America, and leading statesme from Tdoeria, &amp;v.iti, India, Prance, England and probably from J*?an, have been invited to deliver addresses during&apos; the sessions of the Congress.The present negro situation of the TJ.3.A. would thappear to be due to the growing race-consciousness of teducated negro and to the use made of the colour ruestilby revolutionary agitators to stimulate a sympathetic  junrest among the coloured races in order to make the breakdown of the Capitalist system universal.IIt is very unlikely that there will be any. racial j solidarity between the negroes of the different countrijWhen asked what .he thought of the. agitation among the  11Amerioan negroes, the coloured President of Liberia sail] that that was a matter entirely for the American negroel he was a Siberian and was concerned only with liberian I politics. Tne danger is that negro agitators rartiatingl from the United Scutes may inflame the negroes in Britil Possessions by playing upon their own local grievances.!Appendix IRADICAL AlTO flATIOIULISTIC GROUPS - tjgggO RIOTS&quot;Alter four days of disturbances the rc&apos;.ce trouble i\&quot;Chicago h.:s apparently subsided.   Thirty-three is &apos;$iven&quot;as the number of lives lo3t, and 500 in the totrl of&quot;estimated casualties.   Thirty-six fires are reported as&quot;being of incendiary origin.   T;i.e negro population ofCdeagi
&quot;Chicago is estimated at 150.0)0, and order was not &quot;restored until Governor Frank 0. Lor/den had ordered out &quot;6,000 State troops to reinforce the polioe force which &quot;had been augmented, by 2,000 special polioe.   Tnat there &quot;is behind these outbreaks more th^n the smouldering &quot;antagonism of race feeling is shown by the evidence that &quot;the negroes of this country are the object of a vioioua &quot;and well financed propaganda, which is directed against &quot;the white people and which seeks by newspapers, pamphlets &quot;and in other ways, to stir&apos;up discontent among the negroes, &quot;particularly the uneducated class in the Southern States. &quot;Documents are said te show that among the radical &quot;organisations active in this propaganda are the &quot;Industrial Workers of the World, certain factions of the &quot;radical Socialist element, and 33olshevists.&quot;Reports from the Department of Justice show that &quot;Victor D.-tly, the negro business manager of the partieiilarly &quot;radical publication known as the JlB3SWJi!R, was &quot;interviewed by an agent, who asked him if he expected any &quot;trouble among the negroeB in How York.   He seemed very -&quot;loath to answer and then finally said that he did not.   He &quot;is reported to have said that 1 The-Wellington and Chicago &quot;demonstrations were the outcome of economic conditions&apos;; &quot;but admitted that &apos;a contributing cause to the demonstration &quot;might possibly have been the professional agitators, but &quot;stated that the main factors were the large immigration of &quot;negroes into the Industrialvcentr/es during the war, the &quot;culmination of many of these industries due to the &quot;Armistice, poor housing conditions,- the new valuation of &quot;life held by the returned negro soldiers, the realization &quot;that conservatism will never raise his standard, and of &quot;course the increased prices of the necessities of life.1&apos; &quot;Added to these, he stated, was &apos;the age-long breach ofinequality/
&quot;inequality existing between the whites and blacks brought &quot;to a climax desire on the part of the negro race for &quot;race equality. appendix II RAfltCAIi NEGRO PUBLICATIONS    .&quot;THE MESSENGER - New York City.&quot;The-Messenger is a monthly Socialist Magazine edited, &quot;by two negro Socialists, Chandler Owen and A. Philip &quot;Randolph.    Although a very young publication, it has &quot;attracted wide attention by reason of its extreme &quot;radicalism and its excellent diction.    Its first issue . &quot;was limited to 1000 copies, hut so rapid has been its &quot;growth that within six mtaiths its circulation has boen &quot;increased to 33,000 copies.    Its editorials havo been &quot;quoted and commented&quot;upon, not only by radical journals, &quot;throughout the country, but by the daily press cf the &quot;large cities.   To illustrate the popularity and growth &quot;of this publication the faot may be cited that on June &quot;1st it placed $25,000 worth of stock on the market at &quot;$5.00 per share and before June 30th more than $18,000 &quot;of this amount had been subscribed.    This circumstance &quot;resulted in an investigation of the. MESSSLTGBR by the &quot;District Attorney of New York County.    Among those who &quot;have written letters of congratulation to the editors &quot;of the MESSENGER on the success of their publications &quot;are, Reverend John Haynos Holmes, one of the foremost &quot;divines of New York City; Thomas W. Churchill, former &quot;President of the New York City Board of Education; &quot;H.W.L. Dana, former Professor of English and Comparative &quot;Literature for ten years in Columbia University, New &quot;York City, and Miss Mary White Ovington, a well known &quot;social worker of New York.

It &quot;is about ten years old and is edited by Dr. V/.E.B. Du &quot;Bois, a graduate of Harvard University and one of the &quot;foremost writers of the Negro race.&apos; It was the CRISIS &quot;that aroused the bitter resentment of Negro.es throughout &quot;the country by exposing the propaganda carried on in &quot;France by white Americans against Negro troops and the &quot;race prejudice exercised by white officers in the &quot;administration of military affairs.&apos; The circulation &quot;of the CRISIS is about 50,000 copies monthly. &quot;THE CRUSADER - New York City. .&quot;The Crusader Magazine of New York City is a &quot;radical monthly jmblioation edited by Cyril V. Briggs, &quot;a West Indian Negro.   It does not compare in &quot;circulation or quality with the MESSENGER or the &quot;CRISIS.&quot;THE CHALLENGE -Hew York City.&quot;This is a radical monthly magazine edited by a &quot;nan named Bridges, who is also a street orator.   The &quot;remarks regarding the CRUSADER, are also applicable to &quot;this publioation.Appendix IIINOTES ON CERTAIN OF THE INDIVIDUAL AGITATORS,     AND PROPAGANDISTS , _^  &apos;W^Konroo, Trotter - Boston-. Mass&quot;Mr. Trotter has teen an advanced radical for many &quot;years.   He is a Harvard graduate and a resident of &quot;Boston, Mass., where he edits his weekly newspaper,the/
&quot;the &quot;BOSTON GUARDIAN.&quot;   Some time ago he suooeeded ifjP &quot;going to France (after haying been refused a passportf nin Washington) as a member of the orew of a steamer. &quot;His object was to place before the Peace Conference a &quot;statement of the wrongs inflicted upon the Negroes in &quot;America.   That ho attained some measure of success is &quot;indicated by cable reports in the daily press showing &quot;that he contrived to establish oontaot with some of t! &quot;foreign delegates at the Conference,&quot;Mr, Trotter returned to the United States recent &quot;and received an enthuaiastio welcome. It is reported &quot;that he has collected a great deal of data bearing on &quot;the treatment of Negro soldiers in France and is about &quot;undertake a speech-making tour throughout the country jj &quot;expose injustices similar to those reported by Dr. &quot;W.E. Du Bois in the CRISIS. About a year ago Mr. &quot;Trotters influence appeared to be on the wane, but thf &quot;method he employed to reach France and his success in &quot;obtaining publicity in the Frence Press have revived hi! &quot;former influence and he will be a power to be reckoned &quot;with in the future. This is evidenced by the enthusiast &quot;reception accorded him by an audience of 3000 people at &quot;the Palace Casino, New York City, where he spoke on the &quot;27th July 1919.Hubert H. Harrison - New York City&quot;Mr. Harrison is a Negro of West Indian birth.   He &quot;is a scholar of broad learning and a radical propagandist &quot;Most of his time is spent in lecture tours in cities &quot;having largo Negro populations.   He is not affiliated &quot;with any political party and frequently oriticises all of/
&quot;of them.   Ho differs from other Negro radicals in that his &quot;methods are purely scholastic.   He typifies tho professor &quot;leoturing to his classes rather than a soap &quot;box orator &quot;appealing to popular olamour.   One of his favourite &quot;themes is to review the history of the exploitation of &quot;Africa, India and other countries hy the Caucasian races. &quot;HjyB3.eotufos on this subject are always interspersed with saroastio and ironical references to what he terms &quot;the &quot;brazen hypoorlsy&quot; of the white races, espocially the &quot;Anglo-Saxon.   He also makes frequent attacks upon the &quot;Church, asserting that its influence has been inimical to &quot;the progress of humanity by enslaving the minds of the &quot;people with foolish dogmas and theories that will not &quot;bear tho light of reason.   He pictures the heads of the &quot;Church as being in league with the master capitalists in&quot;&quot;a pact to plunder tho proletariat of all nations. &quot;Thoroughly versed in history and sooiology, Mr. Harrison &quot;i*j a very convincing speaker and his influence is &quot;considered to be more effective than &quot;that of any other&quot;individual radical, because his subtle propaganda, delivered &quot;in scholarly language and backed by the facts of history, &quot;carries an appeal to the more thoughtful and conservative &quot;class of Negroes who could not bo reached by the &quot;cyclone&quot; &quot;?aothods of the extreme radioals.  As a matter of fact, Mr. &quot;Harrison1s lectures might well be considered as a &quot;preparatory school for radical thought in that they prepare &quot;the minds of conservative Negroes to receive and aooept &quot;the more extreme doctrines of Socialism.   Without any &quot;deliberate attempt to serve in such a oapaoity, he Is tho &quot;drill master training reoruito for the Socialist Army &quot;led by the extreme radioals, Messrs. Owen and Randolph. &quot;Mr. Harrison^ lectures are always well attended and he &quot;ranks as one of the very important factors in the dissemination/
&quot;dissemination of radical thought among Negroes,&quot;Mr, Harrison has recently returned to this city &quot;ftftor an extended locture tour through the South and &quot;i3 now engaged in addressing street meetings in &quot;H-vrlom,Rev. R.D. Jonv.s (&quot;Prophet&quot; Jonas) - New York City&quot;Tho Reverend Jonas is a white man and has been-t &quot;subject of many reports to your office during the war &quot;He wa3 one of the loading spirits in the defunct Seas &quot;for Darker Peoples.   Since the signing of the Armistibox&quot;the Revd. Jonas has become a eoap/orator on Lennoxi&quot;Avenue in Harlem, and was also engaged in assisting t &quot;run a co-operative store located near the Northwest &quot;comer of 132nd Street and Lennox Avonue, Ho resides &quot;with his wife in the home of a coloured family at &quot;233 West 137th Street. The Revd. Jo^js tos no influe. &quot;of any great extent with Negroes and I do not believe &quot;he warrants any special attention from the Government,Marcus Garyey&quot;Marcus Garvey is a strong force among the negro &quot;throughout the East, and perhaps he is strongest in &quot;Chicago, where he associates with the Left Wing and &quot;I.W.W. elements.   He is not openly endorsed by the &quot;more moderate leaders or by the preachers, but the &quot;churches are nevertheless open to him.   He is a &quot;friend of Ida V/nicholls Burnett, a race agitator of some &quot;twenty years standing.. She issued memorial buttons &quot;in memory of the black troops of the 24th regiment &quot;who created a riot ia the early days of the war, andwho/
&quot;who were afterwards executed.W.E. Burfthardt flu BqIb&quot;W.E.B. Du Bel- is the head of the National &quot;Association for the Advancement of Coloured Peoule, and &quot;the BfUtor of the &quot;Crisis.&quot;  Ho is a well educated &quot;negro, and was at one time the leading agitator.   The &quot;younger and more violent leaders among the agitators, &quot;Much as Mircus Garvey and -Chandler Oven, profess to &quot;find Du Bois too moderate for them, and criticise him &quot;adversely in their journals.   It is reported, however, &quot;that on the auiet there is more connection between &quot;Du Bois and the extremists than appears on the surface. &quot;Du Bois was sent hy the negroes to Puris, it is thought &quot;overtly with the consent of the American Authorities, &quot;but he is not supposed to have dono nearly so well &quot;there as the now all influential Trotter.   Du Bois &quot;had some intercourso with the &quot;African Tlriea&quot;  *$e&apos;r &quot;in London.B.H.T.
