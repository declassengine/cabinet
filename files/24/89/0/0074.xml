Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. SEORET.^eiMBiilate to my colleagues a memorandum which I. have received from His sslie Aga Khan.co&apos;//     ^ - E. S. M.IfiL . -^^&quot;&quot;TVliile it was not only possible, but quite practicable, to have given America a mandate from the League of Nations over the whole of the Turkish Provinces of the former Turkish Empire, plus Armenia, such a solution of the question is to-day beset with so many difficulties as to force me to the conclusion strongly to advise you, and, through you, the British Government, not to encourage it, and to have nothing to do with it.To begin with, the hesitation of the United States Senate and absence of a direct lead from public opinion in America have so weakened confidence in the power of that Government to carry out such a mandate with the standard of efficiency needed, as to have handicapped the work even if, by any chance, the United States finally decide to put their shoulder to the wheel and with all their strength to carry out this huge task.You must not, from the fact that England rules 320,000,000 people in India and 20,000,000 more in Egypt, come to the conclusion that it would be an easy matter for a Power like the United States to take in hand a mandate over the territory from Thrace to the Caspian-which, after all, is inhabited by at most 15,000,000 to 20,000,000 people. The work of England in India to-day is the result of 150 years of labour, and for the first 50 or 60 years we all know through history how inefficient, how difficult, how incomplete, how very shadowy beyond the territory actually occupied by troops, that rule was. Besides, the Turks are a martial race who have not submitted to foreign rule so far in their history in any part of the world, who are more or less armed, and have a country that is not opened out; and the business of forcible occupation of their country against their will would be of such an unpleasant nature as to make the public in America, with its concentration on its own problems, not over-anxious to complete it, even if, nominally, it fell to their lot to do so.I must now immediately tell you that a mandate forced on Turkey and given to Great Britain or Italy or France as a single Power, would also break down for similar reasons, pins the fact that it would mean taxing the resources of any of these, countries to an extent that it would not be worth while any of these Powers, after such a war and its national exhaustion and economic troubles, to take it in hand. Compared to this task, if it is to be carried out against the wishes of the people of the country, the occupation by Great Britain of Afghanistan, plus the frontier, would be chilcfs play.There remains the crime of partition of the Turkish-speaking provinces, namely, Thrace and Adrianople on to the Caucasus, which is feasible, but it would be an act of such barefaced immorality that I cannot imagine, after all you have all preached, your practising a thing compared with which the partition of Poland itself was an act of virtue. Ton know, as well as I do, that the partition would lead to infinite trouble in India, and would probably for ever render the position of England delicate and difficult, while inflicting on the King&apos;s Mahommedan subjects a wound that would never heal up. It would mean for you in India, as long as you remained there, a moral Alsace-Lorraine. It would be as dangerous au ulcer for you as the Poles were for Russia.You must know, as well as I do, what is now taking place in India amongst the Mahominedans, how the Turkish problem is the burning question of life and death for them, and if your representatives, plus your police-out there, are worth their salt, you should receive reports which will leave no doubt in your mind as to how disastrous it would be to divide up Turkey. What you and I think of its moral side I will not lay stress on now, for I know that we agree on that point, and that it would be an act of barefaced injustice moved by religious intolerance which no words of mine, in any case, can describe.It is true that one Turkish lady, the daughter of the late Sultan Abdul. Hamid, told me that the best thing for her country would be an American mandate including Thrace and Adrianople up to the Caucasus.   But she was the only individual who io 19  100  10/19
told me this, and the reason she seriously gave was of such a contradictory nature as to make me put it out of court right away. We. are agreed that what the world wants to-day is rest and peace, and the Turkish problem will undoubtedly be, if taken in hand the wrong way, even locally and in Asia Minor, a hornet&apos;s nest for the&apos; country that goes in, not unlike what the Spanish adventure was to Napoleon and the Caucasus for 40 years and Shamil to Russia.Before I go any further, I must tell you exactly what I consider the position of the future prospects of Germany is amongst the Turks. I can honestly say and I say this with the full sense of responsibility that amongst no nation, not even, among the French, are the Germans so execrated to-day as amongst their former allies of all schools, including the Committee and former friends of Enver and Talaat, with whom I spoke. Whatever else happens, even if Germany, phoenix-like, rises from her ashes and once more challenges your dominion of the sea on the Atlantic and in the North Sea, there is one thing we can -say with certainty, and that is, that they may get slaves in Turkey, but they will never get friends there. The overbearing and open disloyalty of the Germans towards their unfortunate and unwilling allies, the want of the slightest sign of chivalry or disinterested goodwill, their readiness to take all and leave nothing, their abuse right and left of the Turkish character and the Turks, their letting out of the bag the fact that, if victorious, they had intended to make Turkey a German Colony, all this has turned their most unfortunate Moslem victims against them to an extent of which I had no idea before, and of which I think few non-Moslems can ever, understand the force and strength ; and, unfortunately, the Moslems of India do not appreciate this, because, unlike myself, they have not had direct personal relations and friendships with Turks all. their lives. But what has finally shattered the possibility of anything except hatred and contempt for the German on the part of the Turk, has been the attitude of the Germans as a nation, and through their Press and publications, towards the Turks since defeat and the Armistice. Rifaat Pasha, formerly Ambassador in London, a personal friend of King Edward, and then highly respected Ambassador in Paris, and the last Turkish Ambassador in Berlin, who was in Berlin until well after the signature of Armistice, himself told me what has been the attitude of the Germans towards the Turks since defeat. These are his very words: &quot;They have quite forgotten that we ever existed.&quot; This is to Orientals, with their peculiar ideas of devotion and personal loyalty, an unpardonable sin, and 1 can honestly say that, whatever else happens, you can, so long as the Turkish race lasts, be sure that the Germans will not have friends there. They may have to look to Russia, to Italy, to Japan, but a Germano-Turkish Alliance again is far more out of the question than even such a relationship between France and her Eastern enemy.A great friend of.Talaat and Enver, a member of the Committee, a passionate patriotic Turk, a bigoted Moslem whom I met in St. Moritz and who had been in Berlin throughout the war, without any kind of leading question or opening from me, exclaimed : &quot; After the Crimea, the English remembered us for forty years. The Germans forgot us the day after the proclamation of the Holy War failed.&quot; This was a real cri clu camr, and I am certain, from all the data before me, that this is what the Turkish babe will learn from his mother.Such are their sentiments, which would be far more comprehensible to Englishmen if they knew more of the disloyalty with which the Germans acted towards their unfortunate allies and victims. The German Ambassador had already begun to give himself the airs of an Anglo-Indian Resident, and you know enough about India to realise that the atmosphere so created does not lead to affection. This, also, is a conclusion I have come to from Turkish sources, and not from any leading question on my part.I often look at the German Press, and I must say that, since defeat, I have never come across a single word of sympathy for or even interest in the fate of Turkey.Seeing now, that whatever happens, there is no danger of German revanche enrolling the. Turks as allies in the future (for that clanger you must look further East or further West), now we must consider the question from a dispassionate, disinterested point of view, bearing always in mind that morality and honesty are their own reward in public life more than in anything else ; that justice will pay you hand over fist, and that plus these advantages there are immediate moral&apos; benefits, incalculable in their scope, if a wise and honest policy is pursued.What should that wise and honest policy be ? The Turkish position is that the Sultan and the immediate population in Constantinople are cowed down by defeat and misery, but the Turks in the interior are not quite so downhearted.   From this
a wrong deduction Las been reached, namely, that while one party will submit, the others will not. No greater mistake could be made. I am convinced that the policy I advocate in this Memorandum, if carried out, would reunite all factions in Turkey, would be accepted by the nationalists of the interior as loyally as by the terror-stricken leaders of Constantinople. The Turks are not. capable of helping yon in national suicide; if you want to get rid of them you must do so through murder, but they will not raise a hand to help you with the knife. It is no use expecting a policy which has ulterior motives of harm aiid injury to them to succeed ; but, on the other hand, nothing would be easier, nothing would be more just, nothing would help you from every point of view more than a right and honest policj&apos;- of assistance, of guidance to this unfortunate race. The Germans are now oat of the way and so are the Russians. One of the greatest sources of trouble a source of trouble not properly understood in India, and which my Moslem countrymen in India have not yet realised has been removed from your path without you taking any pains to remove it. All the Turks of all schools that I have met are unanimous in desiring a final separation from the Arabs. If, from the Indian point of view, it is necessary for the moral prestige of the Sultan as Khalif that he should have some kind of nominal suzerainty, or necessary to send a decoration or a carpet to Mecca or Medina, by all means have it so; but the Turks themselves do not want any longer to be entangled with the Arabs. They realise that it would mean perpetual mischief and discord, and to cut adrift from the Arabs once and for all in any event politically is as much an article of faith with them as to get out of the British Empire is with the Sinn Feiner. The Sultan&apos;s position as Khalif, they assure me, is more than guaranteed by the fact of, if he is allowed to maintain it, his sovereignty over the Holy Tombs and relics of Adrianople and of Room (i.e., Constantinople), and the possession of the personal relics of the Prophet. Towards Mecca or Medina or Jerusalem, if he is allowed to send a carpet or something of the kind, it would fully satisfy the Turks, no matter how it might be received in India. But I think an honest solution of the Turkish question to the satisfaction of all friends and of the Turks, even if on the Arabian side it left the Indian Moslems dissatisfied, could be found by bringing the Turks them-selves in to convince their Indian brethren of their mistaken anxiety as to the Arabs.I came to the conclusion that the Turks as a nation have realised that the time for conquest has gone ; that their own homelands, where they are the majority, if left to them, are more than ample for them, and their grandchildren to the seventh generation ; that they are rich enough in natural resources, and that the one need of the country is peace and the prevention of future rebellions and Avar, which any connection with the Arabs would entail. They are themselves in favour of a clean cut from. Alexandretta to. the north of Moussel. But where they are adamant, and where I am convinced that justice and morality are on their side, is, first, that countries like Thrace and Adrianople, where the majority of the population has been Moslem for several centuries, that a.city which, by rights, should be as much Turkish as Fiume ought to be Yougo-Slav, namely, Smyrna which is a necessary port of outlet from the economic point of view for the Turkish homelands of Asia Minor)  that these Mahommedan countries should not be handed over to the Greeks, their hereditary and inhuman enemies.What are the conclusions we arrive at? Namely, that Thrace and Adrianople, Constantinople down to the confines of northern Syria, and then a line dividing the northern limits of the Syrian desert light up to Adrianople, and then to the Persian frontier including the Kurdish-speaking countries, should be left to the Sultan as an independent and free country.It will be essential in fact, the only condition that could guarantee them or give the Moslems in.India any confidence in this solution-that -Turkey, namely, the Turkish-speaking part of the ancient &quot;Turkish Empire, be invited to join the League of Nations as a member as soon as possible. Without this, there will be no guarantee of, peace and prosperity. But there is another point without which this solution would, according to the Turks themselves, fail, and that is, while they may come into the League of Nations as members, they should, like Persia, be allowed to depend on British and French capital for their public works, for their finances, for their commercial development, and on British advice for their judicial, adminis-trative and political organisation. Thus,&quot;their economic technicians would come in from England, France and Italy, for the development of the untold wealth that undoubtedly exists, and which is badly needed by Europe, and which you can only
extract out of the soil if the people of the country are at peace and are not at perpetual guerilla warfare with you. Their political and judicial specialists, however, they would get from Great Britain. I am assured by the Turks I met that, with SO or 100 high-class Englishmen engaged as advisers with executive powers, they would not only be received with open arms, but would be well paid by Turkey, and that the Turks are ready to make the conditions sufficiently attractive so as to obtain the very best kind of man from Britain. Unlike the Persians, who have a horror and distrust of Anglo-Indians, the Turks seem to desire men with Indian experience to be at least mixed up with the purely home-grown article. I am convinced that such a course could be carried out to the advantage of all concerned, and it would only need a final decision on the part of our Government, binding on both parties, and. five years of goodwill and peace, to make this one of the best works of reconstruction for mankind after this disastrous war.Now I turn to the problem of Armenia.   This must be approached with patience and dispassionately.   1 think I am right in saying (arid if you will look up old books of statistics and geography you can verify this) that never, during the last 10 or 11 centuries, have the Armenians been anything but a minority, varying from one-third to one-sixth, in those parts of the Turkish Dominions to which the name of Armenia was mistakenly given.   The horrible events of the war, the terrible massacres that took place (and from which both Moslem and Christian suffered) enormously reduced the population of those vilayets.   While it is correct to say that the Armenian population has been reduced by one-third approximately, the same applies to the Mahomrnedans of those Provinces.   AVhatever the crimes that have been committed on both sides, to-day the problem of Armenia is that the country needs peace and equal opportunity for all of its inhabitants.   To hand over the Moslem majority to the small Armenian minority is impossible, for the simple physical reason that the Armenians could not rule over or govern the country, but would be open to constant rebellion and massacre on the one hand, and.&apos; suppression on the other.   The only way to do that would be to have a British Army of Occupation holding the horns of the Moslem cow while the Armenian minority milked it.   I need not labour the consequences of such fanatical and unjust action on the part of Christian Europe, nor can anyone honestly suggest that you should wash your hands of the fate of the Armenian race.   What is the solution that will meet the case ?   The suggestion made to me by the Armenians whom I met who, I must frankly state, have been for many years residents of Switzerland, but in touch with their country all the time---is that, after Turkish independence and integrity have been properly guaranteed in a way that will assure the Turks of their continuance as a nation, that then a meeting between Turkish representatives and Armenian representatives, presided over by an Englishman chosen by both parties, should take place and some reasonable constitution for the two or three Turkish vilayets in which the Armenians form a large minority, under the suzerainty of the Sultan, be worked out, in republican forms and with equal rights for all; each particular state receiving a Governor-General nominated by the Sultan on tlie advice of Great Britain, and the details of this Constitution to be left to the representatives, in equal numbers, of the Armenians and the Turks and the Kurds.   In the interests of the Armenians theni-selves, nothing could be worse than that they should be handicapped at the start with, the ill-will of the majority of their co-citizens.You must also bear in mind that, now that Russia has disappeared from the Caucasus, unless you are practically willing to commit the crime&apos; of bringing Denikine and Tsarist Russia back (a Government that was more hated by Georgian, Armenian, and Moslem alike than even Turkish rule, by Armenians alone), unless you are willing- to do that, then that curious salad of nations which is Trans-Caucasia will have to evolve some kind of live-and-let-live form of government (perhaps to a certain extent on the Swiss model) for the Moslem and Christian populations of those countries alike. If what takes place there on a large scale could be repeated oil a small scale in the two or three Turkish vilayets in question, under the suzerainty of the Sultan, you would find that in time the whole of Trans-Caucasia, right up to the Caspian, would develop into small autonomous republics, where economic interests, plus the fear of Russia, would hold together all their inhabitants.- These are the conclusions to which I have come, after a study which, though unfortunately, and through no fault of mine, I did not carry out in Constantinople or in the Caucasus, hut through conversations with many of their typical and representative citizens in Switzerland, but which none the less I believe is a sound and fair presentation of the case.Aga Khan.
