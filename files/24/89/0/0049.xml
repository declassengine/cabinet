The aim oi the operation is stated to be revenge for the attack on Cronstadt.SoiuO., Baltic, reports that H.;.I.ci. &quot;lestcott&quot; has damaged a propeller, which needs shifting.    He has asked when a dock will be available.Approval has been riven for the sale of two ,40 ft, C,^,BJs to Finland, at  3,00(5 each, and of ei-:ht torpedoes for  7,200.   ii,H,0. reports, that only one 40 ft, (ILL&apos;,3. is now available, and recommends that the 5 remaining 55 ft, 0,K.BJ,s should also be offered for sale in November.On relief of 20th D.F, in October the number of Destroyers in the Baltic-will bo 25.   SJkOc reports that ii will not be possible further to reduce this numbercOn&apos; 20th September, S.rhO. intercepted the Swedish s,f, &quot;Eskilstuna 3&quot; coming out from petrograd loaded with flax, and turned her over to the Finns.    Entering Biorko Sound she ran arxound, and S.N.O. reports that she is likely to remain there,Latvian Government have chartered the German s.s. &quot;Echo&quot; to take, about 900 tons of flour from Danzig to Riga.  An escort is not considered necessary.The latest report re &quot;Kursk&quot; is to the effect that the Finns refuse to accept her passengers except in small batches, and that Esthonians will not allow any to be landed at Reval. Arrangements were made to send 300 to Helsingfors in a locally chartered vessel.    The N.T.O. has refused to allow &quot;Kur&amp;k&quot; to act as &quot;Ferry boat&quot; on account of danrers of navigation, and has submitted that pressure be brought to bear on Finnish Government to carry out their agreement for repatriation dated 19th July.On the night of 22nd-23rd, while passing through Karnsund Fiord, s,s. &quot;La Plata&quot; struck a submerged rock and developed leaks,s,s. &quot;Edward Hermann&quot;, with refugees from North Russia, is proceeding to Danzig, if practicable, to land Foles there, Libau, Riga and Reval,
The following telegram has been sent to 8.N.O., Baltic -&quot;On account of need for economy in all air materiel and difficulty of supply, it is undesirable to carry out bombing operations unless military objectives are likely ic be attained.   If possible use of planes should be confined to reconnaissance&quot;....She exact fate of the Bolshevik Dreadnought &quot;Petro-pavlovsk&quot; is not clear.    S.N.O., Baltic, states that she was torpedoed in the Kronstadt raid, but reports from Kronstadt itself       disprove this and state she is undanaged.   The Droad-nought &quot;Sevastopol&quot; may soon be ready for sea.IiOBTH WMLki.Evacuation of all British forces from Archangel was completed at 1800 on 27th SeptemberaThe withdrawal from the forward areas on the Kern front continues according to plan.The evacuation of Murmansk will commence at once, and it is hoped that all troops will be withdrawn by October 7th, A force of Marines will hold Murmansk until the&apos; last troopship transport leaves, when they will be embarked on board lord*Ships.JLirJ,aMoThe repatriation of the Red Finn &quot;Legion irom Murmansk is not proceeding satisfactorily.    The majority of them are still on board s.s. &quot;Kursk&quot; at lieval.    The Sstnonians will not allow them to land, and the Finnish Government will only take then in small batches.The situation in Baghestan is seriouso  Press reports from Tiflis state that the Volunteer Army has been driven out of Temir Khan Shura and Derbent by insurgent bands, so that Petrovsk - which is used as the Naval Base of the Caspian Flotilla - is the only town now left in North Caucasus in the hands of Denikin.On information from Greek sources, the French s.s. &quot;Prance&quot; was searched at Pandura, and 3,800 rounds of S.S*A. were discovered and seized,A small motor caique was also seized near Pandura containing 47 rifles.Any gun-running in the Sea of Karmora is of little importance compared with the general traffic in arms throughout Turkey, and the retention of two Destroyers for this duty is not considered justifiable.   One is therefore being employed elsewhereeE,.A. reported situation all quiet in Odessa on 20th Soptocher. Petlura had apparently retired some distance from Razdely&amp;na, and volunteer&quot; troops from the Vosnescnsk district were advancing to oppose him.R,A*   3rd Light Cruiser Sduadron  in ILlLSo &quot;Cardiff&quot; arrived at Malta with troops, from Fiume 20th September/and leftMalta....
*1 4OldMalta for Fiume p*m. 22nd September.He reported on 26th September that Italian troops . surrounding Fiume were all in sympathy with the rebels, and Maritime Blockade would be quite ineffective, as Fiume can get supplies by land under the present conditions.it is believed that Military Advisers would welcome an open breach with Serbia.   Admiral Ua&amp;ni. who has been sent on the Mission to Fiume., is fanatically&quot;anti-Serbian.   This feeling is reported to bqfeven stronger in the Navy than in the Army. -The Naval Attache -at Rome,, who has just returned from Bucharest andspent one day at Vinskovsci, observed three trains ;i th troops and artillery proceeding west.   The Serbian officers informed him that they were going to Dalmatia with a view to opposing any Italian Advance from Fiune,As D?Annunzio will not leave Fiume except under com-pulsion, and as Nitti, though willing, is not able to compel him, the annexation of Fiume must be acquiesced in, or the Peace Conference must deal with the situation.The possibility of D&apos;Annunzio attempting a general seizure of Dalmatia also ,cannot be ignored, and tnere^is definite information that he has designs on Abbazia and Lovrana.  From the tone of the Italian iress he would have a large section of the Public behind him in such action,After the meet in&quot; of the Council of Five on the 25th September the Five Plenipotentiaries discussed the situation in the Adriatic.   Attention&quot;vws called to the situation at Soalato, where at present an American Force is stationed charged by the Supreme Council ;dth the duty of enforcing the ArmisticeThere are also 2,u00 Jugo-Slav Troops in the Town.   Two American ilen-of-V/ar arc on &quot;the spot, which will shortly be reinforced by two more ships.   It is therefore clearly of the utmost importance for the Italian Government to prevent any incident from arising that would lead to disturbances in which the American forces would inevitably be involved.Sign*;? Sciagola, tho Italian Plenipotentiary explained that they had -already requested the French Government to keep their ships for the maintenance of order at Cattaro whence tie Italian troops had been withdrawn.Mr. Folk begged the Italian Plenipotentiary to urge upon his Government the necessity of preventing any Italian ships proxseeding^Spalato.   It had been easy for D&apos;Annunzio and his followers to get into Fiume by land, as the place was so close to the Italian Border.   But any raid on the other Dalmatian Ports, entirely surrounded as they were by Jugo-Slav territory, would have to come by sea.   It was unfortunately clear that in the present circumstances no Italian ship could be relied on not to throw in her lot with D!AnnunzioTs party.. The question of Inter-Allied action in the Adriatic is therefore  or consideration.   The British Naval Force in these waters at the present moment consists of 1 Light Cruiser flying the Flag of Rear Admiral Hope, and 2 Destroyers.Of troops there is the 1 Battalion recently trans-ported from Fiume&apos; to Malta, which could, no doubt, ii necessary, be re-embarked, and placed at such Adriatic ports as may be thought desirable.    There is a platoon still stationed at Scutari, which numbers some 30 men and is drawn from tho Battalion recently evacuated from Fiume.   &apos;/e. have no other troops on the Eastern shoro of tho Adriatic.   Owing to the-present situation there, it is proposed to withdraw&apos; the platoon at Scutari.It is clear that if 11.11. Government were to decide upon some active form of co-operation with the French and Americans, the instructions by which our Naval Forces in the Adriatic are now bound would have to be modified.The
The French Ambassador at Rone has made a statement &apos;to the effect that French Naval and Military Forces have now completely evacuated Fiume, leaving the responsibility for their Base to tho Italian Government,   The situation ;ii Fiume appears to be quiet and Admiral Oagni has now gone there apparently on an unofficial mission of conciliation.The late Minister of 1,&apos;arine, Vice Admiral A, Del . Bono, has been appointed O-in-C.. Naples, in place of Vice Admiral D. Simonettij who comos to the Ministry of Marine as Vice President of the Superior Naval Council.Vice Admiral Presbitero, President of the out)prior IiiVal Council, will shortly reach the age limit for retirement, !,/hon he vacates his appointment it teems probable he will be succeeded in it by Vice admiral illlo, now C-in-C*, Dalmatian Coast.Vice Admiral Bellcni, of the Naval liesorve, who has been for about the last two years Director of the Llercantile Port of Genoa, has now been appointed Director General of the iMercantile Marine,The Italian Light Cruiser &quot;Francesco Ferruccio&quot; left Gibraltar on 24th September for Leghorn.The Italian Depot Ship &quot;PUN. Alula5&apos; left Aden for Italian Somaliland on 23rd September.The &quot;Conte di Cavouf&quot; returns from her American &quot;Showing - tho - Flag&quot; cruise in November.BAMSLBatoimi is to remain in British occupation for the present,, and sufficient troops are to remain there to maintain British authority and pro toot the province.DJOTffU.^;AN,The evacuation of stores from Kuoros is proceeding satisfactorily, and if transport facilities remain good, it is hoped to complete the evacuation by the middle of OctoberMinesweeping is in progress off the Bulgarian Coast, Dardanelles, and Crete. The total number of mines swept up. during the last fortnight is about 30.The mine clearance Officer reports that the clearance of the Aegean is being delayed by bad weather.The French reported that the coast between ALEXAIJDHLiTTi and LLnSINA was clear of mines, but thai; they were still sweep-ing the western Pea ts of the Gulf of ISh^ND.LiKUl&apos;1, and that this area had b-&quot;en heavily mined.No sweeping has been done on the Kamaranian coast yet, and probably will not be commenced till next Suirjner,The Turkish authorities reported that there were no mines, but their information cannot bo relied on, and it is rocom-mended to keep outside the lou fathom line and not to visit i OnT aGIIULII^N or POnT C-Yill^iB.O-in-C., Mediterranean, reports that arrangements have br-en made to repatriate all Turkish prisoners of war from Mudros with the exception of a small proportion required for working parties until base is closed.
b- 317liRH.......lihiu.On the 10th August the SoNcO,, Red Sea Patrol reported that it was possible that &quot;JBspioaLe&quot; would be asked to. proceed to. the  omali Coast on account or Native troubles, and on the 12th August the Commissioner at Berbers requested tho presence of one of H.11. Ships,- &quot;Lspiegle&quot; was accordingly sent to Berbera on 12th August with orders to report what Naval Assistance was required   On &quot;the 13th August, the S.N.,0., Red Sea patrol (in &quot;Lspiegle&quot;) reported that the Commissioner wanted &quot;Espiegle&quot; to convey troops from Borbera to Las Khorai, arriving on the 1(3tli august to arrest the Sultan of the 7arj&apos;angali, to cover the landing and embarking of troops and prisoners, also to visit Dlaiya to distribute rice and ascertain the condition of populace reported destitute, and that the Commissioner attached great importance to the presence of a Man-cf-7ar.  Approval was given f or. :,Espiegle&quot; to undertake the proposed operations which have now been successfully completed,Gun-running is still being carried out across the Suez C^nal.   It is credibly reported that 100 rifles can be introduced into Egypt by this route each week. , So far, the measures taken against it do not appear to have been co-ordinated very well, the captures amounting to about 30 rifles in all, up to date, and in no case wore the men concerned arrested, ar the Ghaffir patrol who intercepted them wore not armed,The whole scheme of anti-gim-running is now being re-organised under two Officers from ^H.Q., and it is anti-cipated that better results will     ^    accrue0R.A., Egypt, has reported chat the R.N.0,, ,1&apos;ort Suran, is being dispensed&quot; with, and tho &apos;7/T Station will be; turned over to the Sudan Government on 1st October,Admiral Troubridge reported on September  th asfollows :-&quot;&apos;The Flotillas of K,/a Ships remain at Duna x fentele, 40 miles S, of Budapest.   The Vedettes patrol the river.The Naval clauses of the Armistice with Austria-Hungary of November 4th, 1918,   and the Hungarian Military Convention of November 13th, 1918. which have been broken by the revolutionary Governmrnt, I have now ro-inforced.   The Hungarian monitors and two vedettes have been disarmed and are under the surveillance of H*1L Ships at Duna Pentele. while the mines placed in the river have been lifted,&quot;BIDMILUThe Bulgarian Delegates state that their minesweening resources are insufficient to. deal with the Varna and Burghaz minefieldsc    It. has been pointed out to them that unless they do the work, trade to their ports will be seriously handicapped, and that it must not be assumed that Gr^at Britain can under-take any further work after November.The Greek Government have imposed a quarantine of 10 days at either Corfu or Salamis on-arrivals from all Russian Ports.The ....
The ;//T Unit of Athens is no longer considered necessary, and the O-in-C., Mediterranean/ has approved of the British Section being closed on September 28th.IIMBLiThe Admiralty are pressing for the repatriation of the 3 turkish Military prisoners from Lomnos before 1st November,, These number about seven hundred.ii.IiA.BlA.aThe Holy Garnet arrived at Jeddah on August 28th.Sheikh El Sayed Senussi has passed through Alexandria on his way to Mecca, Acting on their present policy the Italians nave given him every facility, and he was to have proceeded from Suez to Jeddah in tile Italian Light Cruiser &quot;Coatit&quot; but, owing to some question of his baggage going astray, ne is now probably going in the ordinary Khodivial mail boat.Ibn Saud appears to be perfectly quiet, and has made no move to attend the Pilgrimage.Anti-Dutch feeling engendered in Belgium by the negotiations for the revision of the Treaty of 1839 has been accentuated by certain recent incidents arising from the Dutch Government exercising their authority ii^ver the &quot;navigation of Dutch waters and the Scheldt.   Two military barges on passage from, the Rhine to Antwerp in connection with the transport of supplies for the army of occupation wore recently detained at ; Looith, and the crows (soldiers in plain&apos;clothes! sent bach to the Rhine by the Dutch authorities.&quot; The Belgians believe the action of the Dutch authorities was instigated by certain Dutch-men who feared that the barges (recently belonging to a German firm the shares of which have been bougnt by the Dutchmen/ would be sequestered as,enemy property on arrival at Antwerp.Another &quot;incident1&apos;&apos; arose on the 5th September.., when the Italian training ship &quot;Francesco Feruccio&quot;, Whilst proceeding to Antwerp, was stopped by a Dutch torpedo boat; off Flushing, as previous permission to pass up the Scheldt had not been obtained from the Dutch Government.   The vessel was allowed to proceed after her Commandinr: Officer had put forward the request for permirsion.The Belgian press appear to be active in their campaign of propaganda in favour of their claims now be in-- discussed by the Committee of Revision.(MLThe &quot;Admiralitat&quot; which now forms part of the &quot;Reichswehr Ministcrium&quot; under Noske, (Einirter of Defence) is under the head-shin of Admiral von Trotha.P.A.N.A.C. nas informed Admiral Gootto that contraband of war and unauthorised private merchandise hav.* been found in the vessels &quot;Guldjemal&quot; and &quot;Akdenis&quot; which carried repatriated Russians from Hamburg to Constantinople.    An explanation ir asked for and. steps are to bo taken to prevent further similar irregularities.
WMfood, destroyed the necessary telegraphic communications ana seized all reserve depots of food. &apos; He suggests that the Rou-Banians he called upOn to return the necessary rolling stock.The Supreme Council have directed the Inter-Allied Mission to inform the Hungarian Authorities that they do not intend to interfere at all in the internal affairs of Hungary. Their only wish is the constitution of a stable Government and with this in view they hope for the speedy constitution of a gendarmerie force capable of maintaining order after the with-arawai of the Roumanian Army.    The Roumanian military authorities are to be informed of the above and invited in the most categorical way to give every facility, ao long as they occupy Hungarian territory, for tie formation and armament of their gendarmerie.   In no case can there be any question of a loan.The Netherlands Government has decided to undertake the reclamation of the Zuider Zoo. for which it obtained the necessary powers by the Act of 1918.  A sea dyke will be built from the mainland near the island of /ieringen to Piaam and the ^uider ^ee will bo replaced bv the fresh&apos; water Ijssel Meer, The area of Holland will thus&quot; be increased by 207,200 hectares (480, OuO acres) of land.During the war Dutch Trawlers were prohibited from disembarking and selling their catches at British ports.   The   -Netherlands&apos;Government Have now reouested that this prohibition oe withdrawn.    The Board of Agriculture is reluctant to refuse this as it is in accordance with the North Sea Convention Act of.1882 and night imperil the superior in:erest to British fishir trade of being able to land and sell its catch in foreign, ports. Nevertheless,&quot; transport facilities do not at present allow of the disposal of more fish than are brought to port by British fishing vessels.It is to be attempted therefore to arrive at a com-)mise which, admitting the right of Dutch vessels trading in sh in this country, will place it in abeyance for the timepromi fish be in?Delivered up to -&apos;idnightf 27.9.19,Mai.British.......................       213French.......................        88L .
