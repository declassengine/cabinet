Communication from Sherif of Mecca to Mr. Storrs, Oriental Secretaryto British Representative, Cairo.To the dear honourable, may God protect him.I PRESENT to your dear honour my affectionate regards and respects, and hope that you will do your best to make the enclosed note, containing the proposed conditions, effective, as you are capable of doing.And in this connection I declare to you and your Government that you need not be anxious about the ideas of the people here, because they are closely bound to your Government by community of interests.Do not be at pains to send aeroplanes or men-of-war to throw reports and rumours, as was done before, because the matter is now decided.- - What we desire to beg you is to open the way for the Egyptian Government to send the charitable offerings of corn for the Holy lands, i.e., Mecca and Medina, which were stopped since last year.For verily, the sending of this grain for this year and last would be an important factor in laying the foundations of our mutual advantage.This should suffice for a person of your grasp.In conclusion I offer you my best salaams and respects.July 14, 1915 [2nd Ramadan 1333].Kindly do not trouble to send any correspondence until you see the result of our operations; except the reply to the note and its enclosure, which should be through the bearer only; and, if you should think fit, give him a written token to make it easy for him to reach you when we find it necessary. . He.is all right.[Unsigned.]Enclosed with foregoing.To his Honour.WHEREAS the whole of the Arab nation without any exception have decided in these last years to live, and to accomplish their freedom and grasp the reins of their Administration both in theory and practice; and whereas they have found and felt that it is to the interest of the Government of Great Britain to support them and aid them to the attainment of their firm and lawful intentions (which are based upon the maintenance of the honour and dignity of their life) without any ulterior motives whatsoever unconnected with this object;And whereas it is to their (Arabs&apos;) interest also to prefer the assistance of the Government of Great Britain in consideration of their geographical position and economic interests, and also of the attitude of the above-mentioned Government, which is known to both nations and therefore need not be emphasized;For these reasons the Arab nation sees fit to limit themselves, as time is short, to asking the Government of Great Britain, if it should think fit, for the approval, through her deputy or representative, of the following fundamental propositions, leaving out all things considered secondary in comparison with these, so that it may prepare all means necessary for attaining this noble purpose, until such time as it finds occasion for making the actual negotiations: Firstly. England to acknowledge the independence of the Arab countries, bounded on the north by Mersina-Adana up to the 370 of latitude, on which degree falls Birijik, Urfa, Mardin, Midiat, Amadia Island, up to the border of Persia; on the east by the borders of Persia up to the Gulf of Basra; on the south by the Indian Ocean, with the exception of the position of Aden to remain as it is; on the west by the Red Sea, the Mediterranean Sea up to Mersina. England to approve of the proclamation of an Arab Khalifate of Islam.Secondly. The Arab Government of the Sherif to acknowledge that England shall have the preference in all economic enterprises in the Arab countries whenever conditions of enterprises are otherwise equal.
Thirdly. For the security of this Arab independence and the certainty of such preference of economic enterprises, both high contracting parties to offer mutual assistance to the best ability of their military and naval forces, to face any foreign power which may attack either party. Peace not to be decided without agreement of both parties.Fourthly. If one of the parties enters upon an aggressive conflict, the other party to assume a neutral, attitude, and in case of such party wishing the other to join forces, both to meet and discuss the conditions.Fifthly. England to acknowledge the abolition of foreign privileges in the Arab countries, and to assist the Government of the Sherif in an international Convention for confirming such abolition.Sixthly. Articles 3 and 4 of this Treaty to remain in vigour for 15 years, and, if either wishes it to be renewed, one year&apos;s notice before lapse of treaty to be given.Consequently, and as the whole of the Arab nation have (praise be to God) agreed and united for the attainment, at all costs and finally of this noble object, they beg the Government of Great Britain to answer them positively or negatively in a period of 30 days after receiving this intimation; and if this period should lapse before they receive an answer, they reserve to themselves complete freedom of action. Moreover we (Sherif&apos;s family) will consider ourselves free in word and deed from the bonds of our previous declaration which we made through Ali Eff.[Undated and unsigned.]
Sir H. McMahon to His Highness the Sherif Hosayri (titles), dated August 30, 1915.After compliments and salutations.WE have the honour to thank you for your frank expressions of the sincerity of your feeling towards England. We rejoice moreover that your Highness and your people are of one opinion, that Arab interests are English interests and English Arab. To this intent we confirm to you the terms of Lord Kitchener&apos;s message, which reached you by the hand of Ali Effendi, and in which was stated clearly our desire for the independence of Arabia and its inhabitants, together with our approval of the Arab Kaliphate when it should be proclaimed. We declare once more that His Majesty&apos;s Government would welcome the resumption of the Kaliphate by an Arab of true race. With regard to the questions of limits, frontiers and boundaries, it would appear to be premature to consume our time in discussing such details in the heat of war, and while, in many portions of them, the Turk is up to now in effective occupation; especially as we have learnt, with surprise and regret, that some of the Arabs in those very parts, far from assisting us, are neglecting this their supreme opportunity, and are lending their arms to the German and the Turk, to the new despoiler and the old oppressor.Nevertheless we are ready to send to your Highness for the Holy Cities and the noble Arabs the charitable offerings of Egypt, so soon as your Highness shall inform us how and where they should be delivered. We are moreover arranging for this your messenger to be admitted and helped on any journey he may make to ourselves.Eriendly reassurances.  Salutations.(Signed)        A. H. McMAHON.
English Translation of Letter from the Sherif of Mecca to Sir II. McMahon, His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner, Cairo, dated September 9, 1915 [29th Shawal, 1333].To His Excellency the. Most Exalted, the Most Eminent The British High Commissioner in Egypt; may God grant him Success.WITH great cheerfulness and delight I received your letter, dated 19th Shawal, 1333 (30th August, 1915), and have given it great consideration and regard, in spite of the impression I received from it of ambiguity and its tone of coldness and hesitation with regard to our essential point.It is necessary to make clear to your Excellency our sincerity towards the illustrious British Empire, and our confession of preference for it in all cases and matters and under all forms and circumstances. The real interests of the followers of our religion necessitate this.Nevertheless, your Excellency will pardon me and permit me to say clearly that the coldness and hesitation which you have displayed in the question of the limits and boundaries by saying that the discussion of these at present is of no use and is a loss of time, and that they are still in- the hands of the Government which is ruling them, &amp;c, might be taken to infer an estrangement or something of the sort.As these limits and boundaries demanded are not those of one&quot; person whom we should satisfy, and with whom we should discuss them after the war is over, but our peoples have seen that the life of their new proposal is bound at least by these limits, and their word is united on this.Therefore they have found it necessary to first discuss this point with the Power in whom they now have their confidence and trust as a final appeal, viz., the illustrious British Empire.(Literal translation of the above passage.)&quot; And therefore they saw the discussion in it first the place of their confidence and trust the. axis of final appeal now, and that is the illustrious British Empire.&quot;Their reason for this union and confidence is mutual interest, the necessity of regulating territorial divisionsandthe feelings of their inhabitants, so that they may know how to base their future and life, so not to meet her (England?) or any of her allies in opposition to their resolution which would produce a contrary issue, which God forbid.(Literal translation of above passage as follows)&quot; the feelings of its inhabitants to know how to base their future and life for not to meet her or one of its allies in front of their resolution when the thing comes to a contrary result, which God forbid.&quot;For the object is, honourable Minister, the truth which is established on a basis which guarantees the essential sources of life in future.Yet within these limits they have not included places inhabited by a foreign race. It is a vain show of words and titles.May God have mercy on the Caliphate and comfort Moslems in it.I am confident that your Excellency will not doubt that it is not I personally who am demanding of these limits which include only our race, but that they are all proposals of the people who, in short, believe that they are necessary for economic life.Is this not right, your Excellency the Minister?In a word, your High Excellency, we are firm in our sincerity and declaring our preference for loyalty towards you, whether you are satistied with us as has been said or angry.with reference to your remark in your letter above mentioned, that some of our people are still doing their utmost in promoting the interests of Turkey, your Goodness [lit., &quot; Perfectness &quot;) would not permit you to make this an excuse for the tone-of coldness and hesitation with regard to our demands, demands which I cannot admit that you, as
a man of sound opinion, will deny to be necessary for our existence ; nay, they are the essential essence of our life, material and moral.Up to the present moment I am myself, with all my might, carrying out in my country all things in conformity with the Islamic law all things which tend to benefit the rest of the kingdom, and I shall continue to do so until it pleases God to order otherwise.In order to reassure your Excellency, I can declare that the whole country, together with those who you say are submitting themselves to Turcb-German orders, are all waiting the result of these negotiations, which are dependent only on your refusal or acceptance the question of the limits, and in your&apos; declaration of safe-guarding their religion first and then the rest of rights from any harm or danger.Whatever the illustrious Government of Great Britain finds conformable to its policy in this subject communicate it to us and specify to us the course we should follow.In all cases it is only God&apos;s will which shall be executed, and it is God who is the real factor in everything.With regard to our demand for grain for the natives and the monies (surras) known to the Wakfs Ministry, and all other articles sent here with pilgrims&apos;- caravan, 0 High Excellency, my intention in this matter is to confirm your proclamations to the whole world, and especially to the Moslem world, that your antagonism is confined only to the party which has usurped the rights of the Caliphate, in which are included the rights of all Moslems.Moreover, the said grain is from the special Wakfs, and has nothing to do with politics.If you think it should be, let the grain of the two years be transported in a special steamer to Jeddah in an official manner, in the name of all the natives as usual, and the captain of the steamer or the special &quot; Mamur &quot; detailed as usual every year to hand it over on his arrival at the port, will send to the Governor of Jeddah asking for the Mamur of the grain at Jeddah, or a responsible official to take over the grain, and give the necessary receipt signed by the said Mamur, that is, the Mamur of the grain himself. He should make it a condition that he would accept any&apos;receipt but that signed by this Mamur.Let the captain of the steamer or the &quot; Mamur &quot; (detailed with the grain) should be instructed that if he finds anything contrary to this arrangement, he should warn them that he will return home with the cargo. Thereupon the Mamur and the special committee detailed with him, which is known as the committee of the grain for the natives, will take over the grain in the proper form.Please accept my best regards and salutations.If you choose to send a reply to this, please send it with bearer.29th Shawal, 1333 [September 9, 1915].
Letter from Sir E. McMahon, His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner, Cairo, to the Sherif ofMecca, dated October 25, 1915.To the Sherif of Mecca (with titles).October 25, 1915.I HAVE received your letter of 29th Shawal with much pleasure, and your expressions of friendliness and sincerity have given me the greatest satisfaction.I regret that you should have received from my last letter the impression that I regarded the question of the limits and boundaries with coldness and hesitation; such was not the case, but it appeared to me that the moment had not yet arrived when they could be most profitably discussed.I have realised, however, from your last letter that you regard this question as one of vital and urgent importance. I have therefore lost no time in informing the Government of Great Britain of the contents of your letter, and it is with great pleasure that I communicate to you on their behalf the following statement, which I am confident you will receive with satisfaction.The districts of Mersina and Alexandretta and portions of Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Hama, Horns, and Aleppo cannot be said to be purely Arab, and should be excluded from the proposed limits and boundaries.With the above modification, and without prejudice to our existing treaties with Aral) chiefs, we accept those limits and boundaries and, in regard, to those portions of the territories therein in which Great Britain is free to act without detriment to the interests of her ally France, I am empowered in the name of the Government of Great Britain to give the following assurances and make the following reply to your letter: Subject to the above modifications, Great Britain is prepared to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs within the territories included in the limits and boundaries proposed by the Sherif of Mecca,Great Britain will guarantee the Holy Places against all external aggression and will recognise their inviolability.When the situation admits, Great Britain will give to the Arabs her advice, and will assist them to establish what may appear to be the most suitable forms of government in those various territories.On the other hand, it is understood that the Arabs have decided to seek the advice and guidance of Great Britain only, and that such European advisers and officials as may be required for the formation of a sound form of administration will be British.With regard to the vilayets of Baghdad and Basra, the Arabs will recognise that the established position and interests of Great Britain necessitate special measures of administrative control, in order to secure these territories from foreign aggression, to promote the welfare of the local populations, and to safeguard our mutual economic interests.I am convinced that this declaration will assure you beyond all possible doubt of the sympathy of Great Britain towards the aspirations of her traditional friends the Arabs, and will result in a firm and lasting alliance, the immediate results of which will be the expulsion of the Turks from the Arab countries and the freeing of the Arab peoples from the Turkish yoke,&apos; which for so many years has pressed heavily upon them..I have confined myself in this letter to the more vital and important questions, and if there are any other matters dealt with in your letters which I have omitted to mention we may discuss them at some convenient date in the future. -It was with very great relief and satisfaction that I heard of the safe arrival of the Holy Carpet and the accompanying offerings, which, thanks to the clearness of your directions and the excellence of your arrangements, were landed without trouble, or mishap, in spite of the clangers and difficulties occasioned by the present sad war. May God soon bring a lasting peace and freedom to all peoples !I am sending this letter by the hand of your trusted and excellent messenger, Sheikh Mohammed Ibn Arif Arayfan, and he will inform you of various matters of interest, but of less vital importance, which I have, not mentioned in this letter.(Here follow the usual compliments.).   A. HENRY McMAHON.
Translation of a Letter from the Sherif of Mecca to Sir H. McMahon, His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner, Cairo, dated 27 el Hijj, 1333 [November 5, 1915].[literal translation.](Iq the name of God the Merciful the Compassionate.)To his Excellency the most exalted and eminent Minister who is endowed with the highest authority and soundness of opinion. May God guide him to do His &quot;Will!I received with great pleasure your honoured letter, dated 15th Zul Eijj (24th October, 1915), to which I beg to answer as follows : 1. In order to facilitate an agreement and to render a service to Islam, and at the same time to avoid all that may cause Islam troubles andhardships seeing moreover that we have great consideration for the distinguished qualities and dispositions of the Government of Great Britain-we renounce our insistence on the inclusion of the vilayets of Messina and Adana in the Arab Kingdom. But the provinces of Aleppo and Beyrut and their sea-coasts are purely Arab provinces, and there is no difference between a Moslem and a&quot; Christian Arab; they are both descendants of one fore-father.We Moslems will follow the footsteps of the Commander of the Faithful, Omar Ibn Khattab, and other Khalifs succeeding him, who ordained in the laws of the Moslem faith that Moslems should treat the Christians as they treat themselves. He, Omar, declared with reference to Christians &quot; they will have the same privileges and submit to the same duties as ourselves.&quot; They will thus enjoy their civic rights in as much as it accords with the general interest of the whole nation.2. As the provinces of Irak are parts of the pure Arab Kingdom and were in fact the seat of its Governments in the time of Ali Ibn Abu Talib, and in the time of all Khalifs who succeeded him; and as in them began the civilisation of the Arabs, and as their towns in those provinces were the first. towns built in i Islam where the Arab power became so great; therefore these provinces are greatly valued by all Arabs far and near, and their traditions cannot be forgotten by them. Consequently we cannot satisfy the&apos;Arab nations or make them submit to give up such a title to nobility. But in order to render an accord easy, and taking into consideration the assurances mentioned in the fifth article of your letter, to keep and guard our mutual interests in that country as they are one and-the same, for all these reasons we might agree to leave under the British administration for a short time those districts now occupied by the British troops without the rights of either party being prejudiced thereby (especial y those of the Arab nation, which interests are to it economic and vital) and against a suitable sum paid as compensation to the Arab Kingdom for the period of occupation, in order to meet the expenses which every new kingdom is bound to support, at the same time respecting your agreements with the Sheikhs of those districts, and especially those which are essential.3. In your desire to hasten the movement we see not only advantages, but grounds of apprehension.. The first of these grounds is the fear of the blame of the Moslems of the opposite party, as has already happened in the past, who would declare that we have revolted against Islam and ruined its forces. The second is that, standing in the face of Turkey, which is supported by all the forces of Germany, we do not know what Great Britain and her Allies would do if one of the Entente Powers were weakened and obliged to make peace. We fear that the Arab nation will then be left alone in the face of Turkey together with her Allies, but we would not at all mind if we were to face the Turks alone. Therefore it is necessary to take these points into consideration in order to avoid a peace being concluded in which the parties concerned may decide the fate of our people as if we had taken part in the war without making good our claims to official consideration.
4. The Arab nation has a strong belief that, after this war is over, the Turks, under German influence, will direct their efforts to provoke the Arabs and violate their&apos; rights, both material and moral, to wipe out their nobility and honour and reduce them to utter submission, as they are determined to ruin them entirely.   The reasons for the slowness shown in our action have already been stated.5. When the Arabs know that the Government of Great Britain is their Ally, who will not leave them to themselves at the conclusion of peace in the face of Turkey and Germany, and that she will support and will effectively defend them, then to enter the war at once will, no doubt, be in conformity with the general interest of the Arabs.6. Our letter dated the 29th Shaual 1333 (9th September, 1915) saves us the trouble of repeating our opinions as to Articles 3 and 4 of your honoured last letter regarding administration, Government advisers and officials, especially as you have declared, 0 exalted Minister! that you will not interfere with internal affairs.7. The arrival of a clear and definite answer as soon as possible to the above proposals is expected. We have done our utmost in making concessions in order to come to an agreement satisfying both parties. We know that our lot in this war will be either a success which will guarantee to the Arabs a life becoming their past history or destruction in the attempt to attain their objects. Had it not been for the determination which I see in the Arabs for the attainment of their objects, I would have preferred to seclude myself on one of the heights of a mountain, but they, the Arabs, have insisted that 1 should guide the movement to this end.May God keep you safe and victorious, as we devoutly hope and desire.(Unsigned.)Dated 27 el Eijj 1333 [November 5, 1915].
2QQW W 4/Letter from Sir H. McMahon, His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner, Cairo, to the Sherif of Mecca, dated December 14, 1915.To Sherif Hussein :(After customary greetings and acknowledgment of previous letter.)I AM gratified to observe that you agree to the exclusion of the vilayets of Mersina and Adana from the boundaries of the Arab territories.I also note with great pleasure and satisfaction your assurances that the Arabs are determined to act in conformity with the precepts laid down by Omar Ibn Khattab and the early Khalifs, which secure the rights and privileges of all religions alike.In stating that the Arabs are ready to recognise and respect all our treaties with Arab chiefs, it is of course understood that this will apply to all territories included in the Arab kingdom, as the Government of- Great Britain cannot repudiate engagements which already exist.With regard to the vilayets of Aleppo and Beyrout, the Government of Great Britain have taken careful note of your observations, but, as the interests of our ally France are involved, the question will require careful consideration, and a further communication on the subject will be addressed to you in due course.The Government of Great Britain, as 1 have already informed you, are ready to give all guarantees of assistance and support within their power to the Arab kingdom, but their interests demand, as you yourself have recognised, a friendly and stable administration in the vilayet of Bagdad, and the adequate safeguarding of these interests calls for a much fuller and more detailed consideration than the present situation and the urgency of these negotiations permits.We fully appreciate your desire for caution, and we have no wish to urge you to hasty action, which might jeopardise the eventual success of your projects, but in the meantime it is most essential that you should spare no effort to attach all the Arab peoples to our united cause and urge them to afford no assistance to our enemies.It is on the success of these efforts and on the more active measures which the Arabs may hereafter take in support of our cause, when the time for action comes, that the permanence and strength of our agreement must depend.Under these circumstances I am further directed by the Government of Great Britain to inform you that you may rest assured that Great Britain has no intention of concluding any peace in terms of which the freedom of the Arab peoples from German and Turkish domination does not form an essential condition.As an earnest of our intentions, and in order to aid.you in your efforts in our joint cause, I am sending by your trustworthy messenger a sum of 20,000L(Customary ending.)(Signed)        H. McMAHON.
English Translation of Letter from the Sherif of Meeea to Sir TI. McMahon, His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner, Cairo, dated January 1, 1916 [25th Safar, 1334].In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate!To his Excellency the eminent, energetic, and magnanimous Minister.WE received from the bearer your two letters, dated 9th Safar (17th December, 1915), with great respect and honour, and I have understood their contents, which caused me the greatest pleasure and satisfaction, as they removed that which had made me uneasy.Your honour will have realised, after the arrival of Mohammed [Faroki] Sherif and his interview with you, that all our procedure up to the present was of no personal inclination or the like, which would have been wholly unintelligible, but that everything was the result of the decisions and desires of our peoples, and that we are but transmitters and executants of such decisions and desires in the position they (our people) have pressed upon us.These truths are, in my opinion, very important, and deserve your honour&apos;s special attention and consideration.With regard to what had been stated in your honoured communication concerning El Irak, as to the matter of compensation for the period of occupation, we, in order to strengthen the confidence of Great Britain in our attitude and in our words and actions, really and veritably, and in order to give her evidence of our certainty and assurance in trusting her glorious Government, leave the determination of the amount to the perception of her wisdom and justice.As regards the northern parts and their coasts, we have already stated in our previous letter what were the utmost possible modifications, and all this was only done so to fulfil those aspirations whose attainment is desired by the will of the Blessed and Supreme God. It is this same feeling and desire which impelled, us to avoid what may possibly injure the alliance of Great Britain and France and the agreement made between them during the present war and calamities ; yet we find it our duty that the eminent Minister should be sure that, at the first opportunity after this war is finished, we shall ask you (what we avert our eyes from to-day) for what we now leave to France in Beyrut and its coasts.I do not find it necessary to draw your attention to the fact that our plan is of greater security to the interests and presumption of the rights of Great Britain than it is to us ; and will necessarily be so, whatever may happen, so that Great Britain may finally see all her own peoples in that contentment and advancement which she is endeavouring to establish for them now, especially as her allies being neighbours to us will be the germ of difficulties and discussion with which there will be no peace of mind. In addition to which the people of Beyrut will decidedly never accept such isolations, and they may oblige us to undertake new measures which may exercise Great Britain, certainly not less than her present troubles, because of our belief and certainty in the reciprocity of our interests, which is the only cause that caused us never to care to negotiate with any other Power but you. Consequently, it is impossible to allow any derogation that, gives France, or any other Power, a span of land in those regions.I declare this, and I have a strong belief, which the living will inherit from the dead, in the declarations which you gave in the conclusion of your honoured letter. Therefore, the honourable and eminent Minister should believe and be sure, together with Great Britain, that we still remain firm to our resolution which Storrs learnt from us two years ago, for which we await the opportunity suitable to our. situation, especially in view of that action the time of which has now come near and which destiny drives towards us with great haste and clearness, so that we and those Avho are of our opinion may have reasons for such action against any criticisms or responsibilities imposed upon us in future.Your expression &quot;we do not want to push you to any hasty action which might jeopardise the success of your aim &quot; does not need any more explanation, except what we may ask for when necessary, such as arms, ammunition, &amp;c. &apos; -I deem this sufficient, as 1 have occupied much, of your honour&apos;s time. I beg to offer you my great veneration and respect.(Unsigned.)Dated 25th Safar, 1334 [1st January, 1916].
Letter from Sir II, McMahon, His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner, Cairo, to the Sherif ofMecca, dated January 25, 1916 (?). ,(After customary greetings.)Cairo, January 25, 1916 (?).WE have received with great pleasure and satisfaction your letter of the 25th Safar (1st January) at the hands of your trusty messenger, who has also transmitted to us your verbal messages.We fully realise and entirely appreciate the motives which guide you in this important question, and we know well that you are acting entirely in the interests of the Arab peoples, and with no thought beyond their welfare.We take note of your remarks concerning the vilayet of Bagdad, and will take the question into careful consideration when the enemy has been defeated and the time for peaceful settlements arrives.As regards the northern parts, we note with satisfaction your desire to avoid anything which might possibly injure the alliance of Great Britain and France. It is, as you know, our fixed determination that nothing shall be permitted to interfere in the slightest degree with our united prosecution of this war to a victorious conclusion. Moreover, when the victory has been won, the friendship of Great Britain and France will become yet more firm and enduring, cemented by the blood of Englishmen and Frenchmen who have died side by side fighting for the Cause of Right and Liberty.In this great Cause Arabia is now associated, and God grant that the result of our mutual efforts and co-operation will bind us in a lasting friendship, to the mutual welfare and happiness of us all!We are greatly pleased to hear of the action you are taking to win all the Arabs over to our joint Cause, and to dissuade them from giving any assistance to our enemies, and we leave it to your discretion to seize the most favourable moment for further and more decided measures.You will doubtless inform us by the bearer of this letter of any manner in which we can assist you, and your requests will always receive our immediate consideration.You will have heard how El Sayed Ahmed el Sherif el Senussi has been beguiled by evil advice into hostile action, and it will be a great grief to you to know that he has been so far forgetful of the interests of the Arabs as to throw in his lot with our enemies. Misfortune has now overtaken him, and we trust that this will show him his error, and lead him to peace for the sake of his poor misguided followers.We are sending this letter by the hand of your good messenger, who will also bring to you all our news.With salaams,
