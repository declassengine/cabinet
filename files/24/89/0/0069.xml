PR03RKSS OF FARM WORK.On account of the favourable weather conditions many jfarmers havo not only completed the harvosting of corn but have been able to make good progress with stubble ploughing.   During the week Ihe threshing of grain proceeded in many parts of the country as rapidly as the supply of machinery permitted.   The sowing of catch lirops also engaged attention to a greater extent than usual ewing tt-he exceptionally favourable soil conditions.In some districts the potato crop was checked during I-he week by night frosts and blight which completed the decay ef the laulms.

cattle feedingFair mrppli-es of oattle feeding cakos a-nd &quot;i^rire-Tr^eals are available; the high prices ar*e deterring farmers from buying largely^ The Deportment are at present engaged j]n tho allocation of a quantity of feotton soed meal stocked at Irish ports by the Ministry of Pood.FLA   X.Several protest meetings were held last week in regard to the price fixed for flax.   The farmers are making arrangements for withholding flax from the markets until a settlement is arrived at, It is being argued that over a million of raone&apos;ja has been spent by the Government in England to encourage flax growing, and that now the Irish growers are being deprived of about an equal sum by the refusal of the P&amp;ax Santos Control Board to agree to advance the price of flax by 10s. per stone, which, it is alleged, is oonsider-ibly less than the difference between the fixed prioe and the market price of fibre.   Growers hold that the price which has been fixed loes not put them in a position to grow flax in competition with jontinenta.1. countries, or with other crops0A further meeting was held on the 26th ultimo between nillowners&apos;. and scutchers&apos; representatives, but they failed to irrive at an agreement on the question&apos;of piece rates.,   ^n some listricts the scutchers demanded a rate of ?s.M, per stone for scutching and refused to accept any lower scale.   But for this demand, It is likely that the Trade Union representatives would have agreed to a rate of   ls,10d. per stone generally.   In the absence of any general agreement on the question of wages, raillowners are new proceeding to arrange terms with their own scutchers independently, tt is considered likely that agreements will be made generally without my necessity for Government intervention,FOOD   COITTROL   SECTION.
