5171\mi   V;(THIS SOOPMEflT IS THE PROPERTY Off &quot;HIS HRIIAflBIO MAJESTY&apos;S GfOTTBRHMBNT) *SJL2.-? ULWAR    0 A B I M B ItWiiA0,HES of       LAWS Off WAR by th3 EMY,Observations &quot;by tho Air Council upon tho recommendations of tho Attorhoy-Goneralrs Committee.11000/5,4,Sir,AIR MUflSIBST, J lngoway,26 th Ssptomber, 19ISI am commanded by the Air Counoil to request that you will l--;y before the !7ar Cabinet the following observations upon the recommendations upon eir matters made by the Attornoy*GensralT sCommittee appointed to investigate breaches of the laws of by the Enemy &quot;SEftarThe Committee have adopted the reports presented by the Sub-Committee to the effect th:5jb certain air-raids over London, e.g. j those of the 13th June 1917, 7th July 1917, Gth December 191?, 18th December 1917 and the 19th-20th May 1918, constituted in-disoriminate /:nd promiscuous bombing ef London, and that tho peisons taking port in these operations are guilty of war crimes. Consequently, that any prisoners in 3ritiah custody taken in such operations should be tried for such offences, end that the surrondor of any other ,offleers and mon now in Germany who par-ticipated in these raids, and whoso names can bo obtained, should be demanded from tho Gormen Government for tho same purpose,,The offoot of this conclusion^ appears to be that if, in an aerial attack on a town, military objectives escape and civilians ., suffer damage, tho bombing is to be rogarded as indiscriminate and that each one of the persons who took part in it is responsible for the damage caueod during any part of it (gaga 332 of First and Second Interim Reports, dated 3rd June 1919).     Applying this rule to the case of London, tho Committee accordingly, notwithstanding tho multitude of military objectives which ozist end the practi-cal difficulties of identifying \nd hitting targets, rogard as broaches oiptfews of ;7ar those raids whioh resulted in damage to private property, and civilians oven though military objectives (such .i s the General Post Office and certain Railway Stations in the raid of July 7th 1917) were also struck or apparently aimed at.The Main Committee do not appear to havo mado any direct recommendation on the principles of concerted action, beyond that at page 28 of tho report above mentioned, but it was understood that the majority of the Air Sub-Committee approved of tho principles contained in a memorandum reoently presented/to Sir A. Bodkin which layj down the &quot;propositions:-(1)That superior orders form no Miich -:.xo deemed illegal:defence to actions* 0.1.7806.
(2)   That where part of a raiding force bombs (so-called) illegitimate objectives, the whole of the force Including those whoso operations were confined to ?.ogitimatc objectives are liable to a prima-facle c:.arge of war crime.The Air Poi*ce representatives on the Sub-Committee have consistently expressed their strong dissent from these re-commendations, conclusions, and propositions, and have presented the Air Staff point of view in a reasoned memorandum which will he found printed at page 341 of the Reports above mentioned.On this last question of superior orders and concerted action, it is not necessary to explain the disastrous effects of the application of such principles to aerial warfare upon the morale of an Air Force.   The proposition is so self evi-dent that It hardly requires a concrete instance in support; if one were&apos;required, it would be afforded by the Reports re-ceived by the Air Council in the Summer of 1918 upon the effect upon British morale of the German threats of execution as war criminals of British airmen dropping controversial literature among the German troops.   The Air Council are there-fore strongly of opinion that no such doctrine should be accepted without the most careful consideration from the stand-point of expediency, including its possible reverberations upon the Royal Air Force, or, Indeed, any disciplined force whatever. &apos;On the main question of the so-called indiscriminate bombardment of London, the Committee appear to consider the raid of the 6th December 1917 as the most felonious instance, apparently on the ground that the large majority of the bombs dropped were, not high-explosive^ but Incendiary, and that consequently &quot;the mail-1 intention was to start a wide-spread conflagration throughout the Metropolitan Area.&quot;Upon this Air Marshal Sir II. Trenchard desires to point nut that such conflagrations in German cities formed one ox the great objects of the Independent Air Force command-ed by him, that throughout the whole period during which German towns were raided by the Royal Air Force, incendiary bombs were carried, and that, If called as a witness, he la prepared to give evidence to that effect at the trial of German prisoners for such proceedings.The Air Council entirely associate themselves with the views of the Chief of Staff in this matter.   Aviation was in Its infancy in 1914.   The Law of the Air in V.rar had not re-ceived, at the time of the outbreak of war, and for that matter has not yet received, authoritative definition.   Attempts at definition during the war varied between analogies from land, and sea, provisions as to bombardments - the last two somewhat differing between themselves - and a priori&apos; reasoning from general principles of warfare.   Counter-raids were carried out on German towns, with considerable dispute as to whether the justification really lay in the doctrine of reprisals or in that of 7Q ultimate military operations - complications absent from such cases as the sinking of the &quot;Lnsitania&quot;.   If the Committee1s recommendations were carried out German airmen might be tried and convicted for actions common to both sides
9 &quot;v nfrom which fate British -airmen would escape not -any rule of lsrr or principle of justice bu^ merely because they fought for the victorious side and their enemies for the vanquished.In face of these facts, the Air Council desire me to represent, in the strongest possible terms, that the.contemplated proceedings..against German air officers and &quot;-en for participating in bombing/over London are at onco unjust and inexpedient,, and to urge that-the whole question of alleged air offences should be closely examined by the T/ar Cabinet frorp the standpoint of. national policy before any German airmen whatever are put upon their trial,I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,.(Sgd) 1^3ftf$0K.The Secretary,War Cabinet Office, S.V.. 1,
