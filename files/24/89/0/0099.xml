Foreign Office.^^L- Finland /004.THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN FINLAND.1. TAe General Situation.IN view of the offer of peace to Finland by the Soviet Government and the approaching visit of General Mannerheim to England, it may be well to review the political situation in Finland since the defeat of General Mannerheim in the Presi-dential election on the 25th July.The two outstanding features of the situation in Finland are (1) class bitterness, (2) attitude towards Russia. It is on these two points that political parties have split, and around them a furious dispute has raged! General Mannerheim stood for a military dictatorship and an advance on Petrograd to overthrow the Bolsheviks; Stahlberg, the new President, and Holsti, the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, stand for reconciliation at home and no military action against the Russian Bolsheviks.There is much to be said for each point of view. General Mannerheim is undoubtedly a strong man, but not a politician. He has not troubled himself with the violent party and class animosities roused by his irreconcilable attitude in home politics, viewing matters from the military point of view and considering Finland&apos;s security to be very precarious so long as the Bolsheviks remain at Petrograd, but a . few miles from the Finnish frontier. The Conservative attitude, in so far as it is not merely reactionary, is &quot; security first, reforms afterwards &quot;; that of the opposing side, represented by the new Government, is &quot;security by means of reforms.&quot; In most countries of Europe a sharp difference of opinion has arisen as to what is the best method of overthrowing Bolshevism: by social reforms at home or by force directed against the centre from which Bolshevism springs. In Finland this question has been all the more acute owing to the already existing class bitterness and the close proximity of the Bolshevik forces. Thus the political situation in Finland really revolves round the question of the attitude to be adopted towards Bolshevism in Fin-land and towards the Bolshevik Government on the other side of the Finnish frontier.It was on the 25th July that Mannerheim was defeated and Stahlberg was elected President by 143 votes to 50. Stahlberg&apos;s election was undoubtedly popular in the country. In the first place he was a Finn and was known to be a man of Liberal and rather Radical sympathies. His general attitude very closely resembles that of Holsti, who is the most important member of the new Government!. But Stahlberg&apos;s task is an exceedingly difficult one, and, according to private reports, he fully realises it. The main point in the new programme was reconciliation with the Left and the abandonment of the advance on Petrograd which Mannerheim had decided upon in the event of his success at the election.Holsti has played the most prominent part in the new Government, so that it may be well to define his attitude towards Finland&apos;s internal and external situation. At the time of Mannerheinfs defeat Holsti was very optimistic and was enthusiastic at the prospect of a reconciliation with the Left. Holsti was absent from Finland not only during the civil war, but during the Mannerheim regime that followed it. By conviction a Radical, he was much impressed by the rapid growth of democracy during his stay in England and France, and returned to Finland filled with the idea of introducing the same spirit of compromise and conciliation into Finnish class differences that he had admired in England. In Finland, however, class differences are very much more acute, as a result, first of the Red Terror and secondly of the no less violent White Terror. Holsti has consequently brought down on his head the violent animosity of most of the bourgeois parties, who fear to make too many con-cessions to their own Socialists so long as the Bolsheviks remain next door. The Red danger, they argue, can always be used by the Socialists to extort further concessions when once the Government begins to yield.Towards the Russian Bolsheviks Holsti has endeavoured to maintain an abso-lutely firm attitude. He is opposed to. the conclusion of peace with them, just as he has been opposed to an advance on Petrograd, but unfortunately for his home policy it is on this vital point of foreign policy that he differs from the Finnish Socialists, who desire to make peace with the Bolshevik Government.   His difficulties in this
connection have been steadily increasing. The first blow was the acceptance by the Esthonian Government of the peace negotiations offered by Lenin. On the 9th September, when the news reached Helsingfors, the Finnish Government telegraphed to the Esthonian as follows : &quot; The Finnish Government does not look favourably upon an Esthonian-Bolshevik peace, and is ready in co-operation with the Entente Powers to discuss in what way the situation in Esthonia may be improved.&quot; This message was followed by the visit of Vennola, the Minister of State, and Holsti to Reval, where the situation was discussed with the Esthonian Government. On his return Holsti. declared that the policy of the Finnish Government would have to be either the conclusion of peace with the Bolsheviks, a course which he himself did not favour, or the maintenance of the status quo. The latter policy, however, was not an alluring one, owing to the fear lest the Bolsheviks might, after the conclusion of peace with the Baltic States, concentrate large forces against Finland. Moreover, during the winter the British fleet would no longer remain in Finnish waters. The Finns, like the Esthonians, state that what they desire is a strong lead from the Allies as to the best policy for them to pursue.2. The Protective Guards and the Jaegers.There are two organisations which are the support of the bourgeoisie against another Red rising. The older of these two bodies is the Jaegers, which sprang out of the Finnish Corps formed in Germany in 1916 to fight Russia. In 191.7, after the Russian Revolution, they were sent back to Finland, and they were the backbone of the pro-German party during and after the suppression of the Reds. It was only after the Armistice of the 11th November, 1918, that they lost their influence. With the return of Mannerheim to power they found themselves ignored, but, though they retired into the background, their organisation has never broken up, and they still remain the nucleus of the pro-German party in.Finland, and it is with them and through them that German agents are working most actively.The Skyddskorps or Protective Guards were formed on the 14th February, 1919, their purpose being to protect legal order. Their duties were those of a civic guard, their members being chiefly drawn from the bourgeoisie and from peasant pro-proprietors. Later, however, attempts were made to use them for political purposes, and the impression got about that Mannerheim intended to use them for his advance on Petrograd. This has made them very much distrusted by the Socialists, who extorted a promise from Stahlberg on his election that he would disband them. So far, however, nothing has been done, as Stahlberg fears the hostility of the bour-yeoisie. Not only do the men themselves refuse to he disarmed, but the bourgeoisie generally look upon them as the only reliable military force in the country, and will certainly not throw away what they consider their only real protection against a new Red danger.3. The Socialists.There has recently been a considerable growth of Communism amongst the Fin-nish Socialists, though they do not appear as open Communists, using instead the labels of &quot;Independent Socialists&quot; or &quot;Left Socialists.&quot; The anti-Socialist papers have for some time past pointed out the growth of these elements, in spite of indig-nant denials from the official organ of the Socialist party; but the latter is now beonn-ning to take fright, and there is talk of an open breach between the Right and Left wings of the Socialist party. The official party organ, &quot; Sotsialdemokraati,&quot; fears that at the approaching party congress, the Left will make a bid for authority. ^ At recent Socialist meetings some of the speakers have even dared to speak openly against Parliamentary methods and to advocate the Soviet system. The Minister of State, Vennola, in his opening speech when he assumed office, declared that he would take strong measures to put down all those who disturbed social order in the country and would prevent the spread of the Bolshevik movement. The Government, however, seems to have confined itself to putting down open Bolshevism, and has not been strong enough to check the secret spread of Communism. There appears to be a constant stream of Bolshevik propaganda from the Russian side of the frontier, and it is significant that on the 2nd September Trotski, writing in the &quot; Pravda,&quot; con-si dered that the moment had come to renew his threats against Finland.4. General Mannerheim and the Government.Mannerheim has refused all offers made him by the new Government, as they would not accept his conditions, which were (1) introduction of martial law, (2) the capture of Petrograd, (3) freedom to choose his own staff.
In spite of the way he is hated by the Left, Mannerheim still has many sup-porters and admirers in Finland. Those who fear the Reds in Finland and do noft belittle the danger of Bolshevism in Russia look upon him as the only strong man and the only one who can inspire the Reds with fear. He has now left Finland and is said to be going to the South of France for a rest, passing through England on his way. It. will depend very much on the course of events in the negotiations with the Bol-sheviks whether Mannerheim will be summoned back to his country. The present Radical Government, good as its motives have been, is not in a strong position, and, if it fails to maintain a firm attitude during the next few weeks, there may be a fresh demand for the return of Mannerheim. The Germans are certainly anxious to win him over, to their side, as he is one of the few Conservative leaders who has been pro-Ally. His visit to England might form a good opportunity for a full discussion of the situation with him.September 27, 1919.
