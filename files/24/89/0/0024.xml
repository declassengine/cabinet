This document is the property oi His Britannic Majesty s iGovemmentSECRET.   . &quot;idyj. WAR CABINET.FINAL CONTRIBUTION TO GENERAL DENIKIN.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR. I make the following proposals to the Cabinet: 1. The supplies now required by General Denikin may be divided into three classes. The first class is the supplies of arms and munitions which are surplus to British military requirements and are of a non-marketable character. A proportion of these are in Egypt or at Salonika. The cost of bringing them home and breaking them up would probably exceed any resultant scrap value. On the other hand, if they are sent to General Denikin they figure as a debit to Great Britain by Russia, and if Russia is restored they will rank at their full value with the rest of her accepted liabilities. If it were thought desirable, I think it very likely that General Denikins administration, with the assent of other Russian authorities, would accept the condition that charges for supplies provided during the war of liberation should take precedence over all other debts. In any case no appreciable loss or expense is caused to us by these assignments of surplus non-marketable supplies, although for repayment purposes they figure at the large amount of 11 millions. In fact it may be accepted that their storage here would involve needless expense since their retention for Army purposes would be unnecessary.2. The second class consists of certain military stores, principally clothing, equip-merits, certain vehicles, and boots, which although surplus to British military requirements, and to some extent part worn, have a marketable jralue. Some of these are, however, indispensable to any coherent scheme of aid. They involve no new charge to the Exchequer, but their assignment deprives us of an appropriation-in-aid which would amount certainly to a considerable proportion of the nominal value. It is proposed, therefore, to limit supplies of surplus marketable stores to 2^ million pounds.3. The third class of aid consists of supplies which have to be purchased or replaced, and in the cost of shipment of all the above. Both these items involve new charges on the Exchequer. It is proposed to limit the &quot;supply of non-surplus stores, i.e., those which have to be purchased, to a maximum of 200,000?., and to limit the trans-portation expenses on all the above to a maximum of 550,000?. In this connection it might be possible to tranship from North Russia to South Russia some 60 locomotives of Russian origin and gauge, involving no cost save that of the sea journey.The composition of three categories of stores detailed above is shown 4in Appendix A.4. In addition to the above the following aviation supplies are proposed, viz.: .   ;     &apos;    &apos;Surplus, non-marketable     ...      ...    449,000Surplus, marketable ...      ...      ...     166,000as detailed in Memorandum by the Chief of the Air Staff (Appendix B.).5. This final contribution, therefore, involves (a.) New indebtedness incurred by Russia, 14J millions.(6.) Cost to Britain by loss of Appropriations in Aid, say, If millions.(c.) Cost to Britain by new expense, say, three-quarters of a million.Total cost to Britain, 1\ millions.5. It is not proposed to send out all these stores at once, but rather to treat them as a fund of supplies, within the limits of which the War Office may continue to meet the needs of the Russian Armies as they may define themselves. It is proposed to notify General Denikin of the limits of this final contribution and to let him draw within those limits, subject to the approval of our Military Mission, as and when necessity arises. Thus the limits of the expense would be known and definitely fixed, and that would he the, end of it; the aid would be given in the least wasteful.and(B19/433)  70  9/19  H&amp;S  7522wo
most helpful manner, and a continued hold and influence over General Denikin will be maintained during a period when his power may be rapidly increasing, and when it may be of great consequence to us to guide him in a non-reaotionary direction.6. Discretionary power is asked to divert, with the approval of the Foreign Office, a proportion of the above total limit of supplies (not provided from Eastern sources), not exceeding one-fifth, to the support, if necessary, of the North-West Russian Force or the Baltic Governments.7. In addition to the above expense, there, will be charges of the British Mission with Denikin. It is proposed to notify General Denikin that by the 31st March of next year we consider it reasonable to expect that his technical troops will have received the necessary instruction at the hands of our tank and aviation and &quot;other technical personnel, and that any administrative personnel which he may desire to retain on the railways or in the dep6ts must from that date be paid for by him from local funds and will be seconded temporarily from the British Army. The expense of maintaining the Mission, which at present numbers slightly over 2,000, for 6 months more will amount to approximately 300,000/.8. The total expense for winding up our obligations in Russia, will not, therefore, in the future exceed 3 million pounds, however calculated, and will, not be, as is sometimes feared, in the neighbourhood of hundreds of millions. And in return for this expenditure,-the means will be provided of influencing Russian policy in a wise direction and in a direction friendly to Great Britain, to say nothing of the possibility of the repayment of our whole great Russian debt when Russia is again restored.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.*25th September, 1919.

In addition we have handed over to General Denikin the surplus and obsolete material held by units in the Caspian and Mudros, of an estimated value of 313,000?. This latter item in my opinion would not be worth the expense of keeping the men to bring it home for sale.   With regard to the first item the following are marketable stores : .    -                     - &apos;   -           -         &apos;    ,.    &apos;  Petrol and oil     ............... 118,000Packing cases     ......             ...      ... 12,000Mechanical transport     ...      ...      ...      ... 31,000Machine tools     ...      ......... 5,000Total 166,500*I would point out with regard to these that without petrol and oil, the machines could not work, without packing cases we could not send them out. Some of the mechanical transport that was in the Caspian has already been handed over &apos; and machine tools have been dealt with similarly.The only stores we should have to spend money on to replace would be petrol, oil and packing cases.This total sum comes to approximately 928,000/.   Do you approve ?2ith September, 1919.H. Trenchard,Chief of the Air Staff.* It is estimated that if these stores were sold they would together realize approximately 1,750,000J.
