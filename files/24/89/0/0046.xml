LEIPZIG NATIONAL FA IE, SEPTEMBEE, 1919.Eeport by H. B. Fergusson, Chief Technical Adviser to British Military Governor, Cologne, and A. G. Hill, Bepresenting The Federation of British Industries.It was felt that the .German National Industrial Fair held this year in Leipzig would afford a good opportunity of studying the present conditions in the principal German Industries, and also the ability of the Germans to re-establish their export trade on which not only the solvency of the country depends, but also Germanys ability to purchase commodities from the United Kingdom, and pay some portion of the indemnity to which she is committed.Cologne was left on the afternoon of Wednesday, 3rd September, 1919, and Leipzig was reached on Thursday morning at an early hour.This afforded two full days to study the exhibits and collect information, as on Saturday the exhibitors were busily engaged in packing up. As it was found that by conversing with the &apos; exhibitors themselves, first-hand information could be obtained on the conditions prevalent in every branch of industry, it is regretted that all the week could not have been spent at the Fair, when the whole field could have been covered in more detail.Unfortunately, the exhibits are not centralized in one or more Exhibition Buildings, but scattered in office buildings in the centre of the city, often the second, third or fourth floor of an office building being entirely or partly devoted to exhibits, and one class of industry may thus be represented in several different building.-:. As generally visitors are interested in only one particular industry, this system presents little difficulty, but to those endeavouring to study the Exhibition as a whole, the lack of suitable centralized accommodation causes confusion and delay. Undoubtedly, the merchants in Leipzig find that this system of holding the Exhibition in the centre of the city pays, both from the point of view of the high rental obtained for floor space for one week in the year, and the volume of purchases made in the. Leipzig shops on the ground floors by the streams of visitors passing to and fro.There was a record attendance of about 118,000 people at the Fair, about 20 per cent, more than in any previous year, and hotel accommodation was taxed to the limit.Some 10,000 firms exhibited, mostly German, although there were the following exhibitors from outside the German Empire : Austrian, Bohemian and Czecho-Slovak ...      ...   300/ \&apos;Swiss......&apos;    ............-      ...     40-&apos; ;English (Messrs. Gibson and Son of Burslem Pottery      1ware.) HollandDenmark     ...      ...Norway Sweden Belgium3 1 1-1 1The secretary of the Fair stated that there were some 7,000 foreign buyers present.    -The general impression gathered from conversation with representative exhibitors was that nearly all branches of German industry are on the verge of bankruptcy, due principally to the shortage of coal, and secondly to the loss of export trade which carries with it the inability to purchase much needed foreign raw materials. In order to assist in forcing a wedge into foreign markets, the German manufacturer has concentrated on new mechanical devices and novelties, which were much in evidence at the Fair.Most of the German representatives inclined to the opinion that they would recover their export trade through American and neutral buyers, and that much as they would prefer to re-establish their pre-war trading connection with England,, they felt that at present, due to the hostility of the English towards them, they had better concentrate on America and the neutral nations surrounding Germany. Strange to say, nowhere did we find the least hostility towards the British, and all were most
anxious to resume trading relations with England, and as Englishmen, we were treated with the greatest courtesy wherever we went.In several instances German manufacturers stated that they had no desire to trade with France, nor would they allow their foreign export trade to pass through French hands.In nearly all branches of industry, their terms of sale were spot cash on receipt of invoice, with a reduction of 25 per cent, and more for foreign buyers.Technical Section.From the point of view of the German export, probably the most important exhibits were those of the technical section including all types of new machine tools; mechanical and electrical devices and novelties. In this industry, the Germans were in a position to fill orders quickly, and in many cases had considerable stocks oh hand, due to the fact that, firstly, they had not been short of iron ore and coal during the war to the same extent as industries relying on foreign raw materials, and secondly, there was little home demand to be met. The mechanical engineering industry depends upon foreign trade for its stability, and is concentrating as much as possible on fine mechanical precision machinery and articles in which the raw material and coal uspd bears as small a percentage as possible to the value of the finished article.The accuracy of the work done by the machinery exhibited, and the finish of the machines themselves, left nothing to be desired except, that every effort was made to avoid the use of brass. For instance, in lieu of expensive brass grease cups or cheap cast-iron ones, the Germans were iising a finely finished pressed steel article, which we have never seen elsewhere.The following points summarize the general impressions conveyed by this section : (a.) Delivery from stock can in most cases be obtained for machine tools. In this connection the representative of a large Dresden firm told us that they had actually in stock 25-40 of each type, from the largest to the smallest machine.(b.) The prices are approximately 200-400 per cent, up on the pre-war basis.(c.) The German firm arranges all the necessary export regulations and shipping, leaving the import side to the importer. Cash must be deposited in the German bank on the receipt of invoice that the goods are ready to be despatched, or, in some cases, that they have already been forwarded.(d.) International banking regulations with England have not yet been re-established in the unoccupied area, although for the last six months a considerable amount of business has been transacted with Holland, Norway, Sweden, Spain, and North arid South America.(e.) A very high proportion of the goods sold during the last six months has been for export.(/.) The chief factor limiting output is coal.(g.) Patents. Much specialised new machinery was seen, and in many cases the German firms are only too willing to sell the covering patents to foreign manufacturers.This appears to be one of the most important facts brought to light during the whole Fair, and if expert technical men had been present representing British firms in the various industries, they would have found much of vital interest to them in this respect. In this connection notice is called to the fact that the &quot; Frankfurt Fair&quot; is being held at Frankfurt-am-Main from lst-15th. October,, when there will be represented a large proportion of the engineering firms referred to above,, and thus another opportunity is afforded for British manufacturers to benefit by the careful study of exhibits, .... ,Attached hereto^ are copies of the printed matter relating to such machines and appliances as appeared to be hew and recently patented. It is felt that the information contained therein if circulated to interested British manufacturers will alone have warranted this visit. Inasmuch as these catalogues and printed matter are well illustrated, it is thought unnecessary to describe their advantages in this report. Where possible prices have been marked on the catalogue.Toys:. Second only to the engineering exhibits were those of the toy.trade. There was a larger and more representative exhibit of toys than in any other year.9 Sent uuder seperate cover direct to Director of Transport. (7531) a 2
It was stated on all sides that tho factories were at a standstill, and the greatest efforts were about to be made to re-establish the German toy exports by offering to foreign buyers the best made articles at the lowest possible prices.In the doll trade it appears there had been comparatively few actual sales made at the Fair, although many foreign buyers displayed gre^t interest, and it is thought that possibly purchases will be effected later.The dolls in most cases were poorly clothed aud made of cheap material. Better class dolls were four or five times pre-war prices, the reason being of course the shortage of raw materials (cotton, wool and linen), which the German must purchase at the present unfavourable rate of exchange. It would appear for this reason that they are in no position to export the better class of doll.Toys made of wood were much in evidence. In this case, due to the abundance of wood in Germany, the prices were very low, and it was stated that considerable s-ales had been made to neutrals, particularly to Holland.Stuffed animals were very expensive compared with pre-war prices. Here, again, this is due to shortage of raw materials such as felt and cotton. Few sales were made, but foreign buyers were interested on account of the novelty of design, and if there is a further drop in the value of the mark probably outsiders will purchase such stocks of these as exist for next Christmas trade.Tb,e exhibition of mechanical toys was excellent and, it is stated, surpassed that of any previous year both in novelty of design and workmanship. Here, unlike the doll trade which depends to no small extent on foreign fabric, the mechanical toys were good and find a ready market with neutrals. They can be exported at less than pre-war prices, due to the rate of exchange.Paper and Paper Manufactures.There was very little variety in the goods displayed in this Section; in fact, the only articles available to any useful extent were I. Art prints of every conceivable description, comprising all types of pictures, framed and unframed, calendars, post cards, blotting pads, and numerous styles of decorative printing. Excellent colour-work was the chief feature in this connection.2. Writing stationery. This, of course, was all the u.-,ual German quality of flat paper.   No manilla paper whatsoever was exhibited.During the last six months, certain German paper manufacturers have approached English firms with a view to importing the paper itself for manufacture into various kinds of stationery. Very little, if any, business was forthcoming, however, on account of the prohibitive prices and the present rate of exchange. In one instance a large manufacturer of Coblenz said he could not possibly buy at more than 5l) per cent, under the English price quoted.Many of the factories are closed owing to the lack of raw materials, and the larger concerns, who are keeping on the majority of their employees, are working at about one-third of their maximum output.The situation summarized then amounts to this, that, owing to lack of raw materials, the better grades of paper and stationery cannot be produced and the export and home orders combined for lower grades only amount to about 33 per cent, of the possible output.A great part of this low grade material has gone to South America. From the above it appears that the British manufacturer has little to fear from the German as far as the paper industry is concerned.Porcelain and Crockery.This industry was well represented, and on all sides it was stated that they had sufficient orders, particularly from America, to keep them going for months, but that the bulk of their factories were closed down due to shortage of coal, which they see little hope of obtaining.In the luxury trade there was very good business done, both German and foreign buyers purchasing the most expensive Meisen-class of porcelain, particularly coloured and enamelled ware, figures, &amp;c, the home demand probably being due to the desire of every German to transfer his marks into jewels, or any such permanent articles of value as fine porcelain. Possibly the foreign sales were also due to somewhat the same cause, as it is known that some fifteen milliard marks are held outside Germany.
There was a heavy demand for table and kitchen crockery of both the cheap and better class, which the trade was hopelessly unable to meet, due again to coal shortage.Aluminium Ware.One rather fine exhibition of aluminium kitchen utensils, cigarette cases, &amp;c, was seen. The head of this firm stated that, due to the coal shortage in Germany, there was now not more than 400 tons per month of raw aluminium blocks produced out of a possible total output of 4,000 tons. He further stated he had booked up orders at the Fair to keep his factory in Hamburg going for six months, and that many more orders could have been accepted if the raw aluminium could have been obtained. Most of his contracts were with German, American and4 Dutch buyers. At the present rate of exchange (100 marks to the pound sterling), German aluminium utensils could be sold in England at one-third the present price of the English article.This exhibitor further stated that although he was keen enough to sell in England when he first came to the Fair, now he had found a market elsewhere he was not going to worry about selling to or through British traders in the future.Building Trade (Construction Material).The exhibits here were of interest as showing the efforts being made to offer the German public materials which require less coal for their manufacture than those used in the past. Many machines used in the manufacture of substitute materials from various factory waste products were in evidence. Various clay and natural cement substitutes were offered in lieu of Portland cement, which requires about half its weight in coal for its manufacture. Much artificial marble (from Gypsum) was also seen. On all sides were offered gaudy substitutes in lieu of the genuine article.Textiles.Textile exhibits were poor, mostly made of shoddy, and there was also a great display of paper carpets, rugs, tablecloths, &amp;c. The prices of these paper textiles were high ; for instance, paper rugs, which at the distance looked like the genuine article, cost about double the pre-war price of the genuine article.A large hosiery manufacturer of Chemnitz stated that only five per cent, of their workers generally employed in the great hosiery trade there were working, the factories either being closed down or operating at a tenth of their former capacity. The trouble in this case also was due to shortage of raw materials and coal. His opinion was that even if the factories could re-start at full output it would be months before they would seek export trade as the German home demand was so great, owing to the shortage of textiles in the country.The price of foreign textiles for re-selling in Germany is prohibitive, as in this case the exchange affects both the price of the raw materials and the labour of manufacturing.Musical Instruments.It was stated that large sales had been made in musical instruments, especially pianos, in spite of the high prices prevailing.Jewellery.Heavy purchases were made, by both Germans and foreigners, of expensive silverware and jewellery. Here again the buyers were probably purchasing in order to transfer their paper money into something more tangible.One of the most striking features of the Fair was the large number of foreign purchasers, mostly Dutch, Scandinavian and Swuss, although there were a considerable number of Americans present. These foreigners had not come for merely sightseeing purposes, but were there to buy German goods, and on all sides one heard from the Germans that in most cases it was only the lack of coal or raw materials which prevented much greater sales.Only one Englishman was met. He arrived late on Friday and said he had sold a consignment of British glue in exchange for German toys. He regretted he had not arrived earlier.
It appears that at present labour is being paid from two hundred to three hundred per cent, more than pre-war rates for an eight-hour day (at present) as against generally a ten-hour day in the past, in return for which labour does about two-thirds as much work.   Lack of food, and the high percentage of war cripples contribute in, part to the drop in output per man.Conclusions. The whole Fair reflected the &quot; soul &quot; of the German nation, and its desire to work and recover itself, but in looking through the veneer the soul seemed to - lack a body. Everywhere one was struck with the hopeless dependency of Germany on foreign raw materials and increased coal output. In fact with the German glass, pottery, textile, leather, toy and many other industries closed down, or operating at 5 per cent, or 10 per cent, of their normal output, due to inability to purchase raw materials at the present value of the mark, the Fair gave direct evidence of Germany being at present virtually a bankrupt nation.
