Week ended 22nd December.NAVAL OPERATIONS.During the night of 22nd December an Eastbound convoy of four ships, escorted by North Sea. the flotilla leaders &quot; Valkyrie &quot; and &quot; Nimrod,&quot;&apos; and the destroyers &quot; Surprise,&quot; &quot; Tornado,&quot; &quot;Radiant,&quot; &quot;Torrent,&quot; &quot;Tempest,&quot; &quot;Skilful,&quot; &quot;Sylph,&quot; and &quot; Torrid,&quot; crossed to the Hook of Holland   It was intended that the escort should bring back a Westbound convoy of 12 ships, sailing at 1.30 a.m. on the 23rd.At 11.15 p. m. a report was received that the &quot;Valkyrie&quot; had been mined 5\ miles West of the Maas light buoy. Her crew were taken off, and when she had drifted clear of the mines she was taken in tow, and was subsequently brought in safely. Between 3.20 and 3.40 a.m. the &quot; Torrent,&quot; &apos;&quot; Surprise,&quot; and &quot;Tornado&quot; were also mined near the Maas light buoy, and at 5.3 a.m. it was reported that all three ships had sunk. The total casualties sustained in the four vessels are 13 officers and 198 men killed or missing, and 2 officers and 32 men injured.The sailing of the Westbound convoy was countermanded by the Admiralty, as the Consul-General Rotterdam reported that a dense fog prevailed.The laying of a deep minefield off the East Coast of England has been completed.The monitor &quot;Erebus&quot; fired 10 rounds at Ostende on December 19th, but was Flanders prevented from further firing by a very thick smoke screen which the enemy put up. area. The results of the firing are difficult to judge, as apparently our observers, who were spotting in aeroplanes, were misled by dummy flashes to imitate shell bursting.. A destroyer patrol was fired at by an enemy battery on the Belgian coast on December 22nd ; the range was good but the direction faulty.R.N.A.S. machines from Dunkirk have bombed Engel, VTissegheni, St. Denis Westrem, Mariakerke and Oostacker aerodromes, the Brugeoise works at Bruges, and a dump and railway sidings at Engel. Direct hits were observed in each case and a large fire was started at the Bruges works. Over 11 tons of bombs were dropped at St. Denis Westrem, Mariakerke, Oostacker and Bruges. The weight of bombs dropped at Engel and VTisseghem has not been reported.In aerial fighting Dunkirk machines have destroyed 3 enemy machines&apos; and driven down 3 out of control.  One of ours is missing.A squadron operating on the coast of Palestine surprised and shelled an enemy camp Mediter-at daylight on December 22nd, and afterwards shelled targets as requested by the military ranean. during their advance.(0 865)   55   12/17   h&amp;s
Casualties. The sloop &quot;Arbutus &quot; was torpedoed by an enemy submarine at 4 p.m. on December 15th, about 15 miles N.W. of the Smalls Lighthouse. At 1.25 a.m. on the 16th, when in tow of two tugs in a heavy sea, an explosion occurred on board and she sank. Two officers, who had remained on board, lost their lives.iThe armed trawler &quot; Ocean Scout&quot; has sunk as the result of a collision with the &apos; armed trawler &quot; Lord Heneage,&quot; 7 a.m., 21st December, about 4 miles south of Arran Is. The crew were saved.The armed drifter &quot; Annie &quot; grounded on the Turkish coast during the night of December 19th-20th, and had to be abandoned. There were no casualties. Everything of value was destroyed and the ship scuttled.The airship S.S.Z, 10 has been destroyed by fire as the result of a collision in fog and darkness with S.S.Z. 7 when the latter was making a forced landing at Jevington. One officer was killed and 1 officer and 2 mechanics seriously injured.The airship S.S.P. 4 has been wrecked at Rapness, Westra)?&quot;, Orkneys, apparently through engine trouble.   No information has been received as to the fate of the crew.The airship C. 20 ran out of petrol on December 22nd, and was taken in tow by a destroyer but subsequently fell into the sea and sank off the Farn Islands. The crew were picked up.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.Submarines      During the week 16 to 19 large enemy submarines have been located, 11 or 12 of operating.   wnich have been operating to the westward of the. British Isles, the principal areas of activity having been the western part of the English Channel and the- Irish Sea.   One submarine of the &quot; cruiser &quot; type has been working to the southward of Madeira and the Canaries.Actions The following Table shows the number of actions with enemy sab marines in Homewith enemy Waters during recent weeks, and the nature of the craft which have been engaged, and submarines. ajg0 ^ mim]jer 0f submarines destroyed: 	Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		December 1st.

The percentage as regards all traffic to and from the United Kingdom is &apos;85 as against 1 &apos;08 last week, although the total tonnage afloat each week was practically the same.vessels lost.The table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all British Merchant Vessels Areas in sunk, damaged or molested, and of all Allied and Neutral Merchant Vessels sunk in the wiucl1 last two weeks by enemy craft and by mine classified according to areas.It will be observed that the losses this week have again been almost entirely confined to Home Waters.ENEMY MINES.The week under review has been exceptionally quiet as regards enemy minelaying, Minelaying. slight activity having been experienced in the Harwich, Dover, and Bristol Channel areas only.The following table shows the number of enemy mines destroyed and British Vessels Casualties sunk by mine in Home Waters in recent weeks : Week Ended.

DEFENCE AGAINST SUBMARINE AND MINE.Convoy, , During the week 636 ships have been convoyed as compared with. 711 last week. Of the former number, 271 were engaged in the French Coal Trade, 183 on the Scandinavia-Lerwick-Humber route and the remaining 182 in overseas trade, 67 inward and 115 outward. There have been three losses in convoy this week, one in the inward convoy from Sierra Leone, one on the Scandinavia-Lerwick-Humber route and one engaged in the French Coal Trade. The considerable reduction in the number of convoyed ships is mainly due to two homeward convoys having dispersed owing to stress of weather before entering the home danger zone.Defensive During the week 30 merchant vessels have been fitted to take primary armament,armament, and 28 to take supplementary armament, the number of Merchant Vessels at present fitted for defensive armament being 3,719.The total number of Howitzers and Bomb Throwers delivered to date is 467.Mine pro. At present 1,046 Merchant Vessels are fitted with Otter equipment, and the numbertectiongear. of Warships now fitted with Paravanes is 348.MOVEMENTS OF ENEMY SHIPS.   ,Merchant- Nine enemy merchant ships have this week arrived at and six have sailed frommen. - Norwegian ports outside the Cattegat. None have entered or left Rotterdam, but the number of enemy vessels arriving at and leaving Delfzyl is increasing. They usually bring timber to Delfzyl and take away enemy coal for Swedish ports.FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. France.The sinking of the cruiser &quot; Chateaurenault &quot; does not constitute a serious loss to the Naval Forces of the Allies. She was launched in 1890, and was being used as a Troop Transport.Russia.The armistice officially commenced at noon on December 17th, the line of demarca-tion for the Black Sea being drawn from St. George&apos;s Channel, at the mouth of the Danube, to Cape Ieros, west of Trebizond, and that for the Baltic being drawn from the West Coast of Wormso Island to Bogscar Island and Svenska Hogarne, off the Swedish Coast near Stockholm.No shipping will be allowed across these lines of demarcation.The line of demarcation in the Baltic agreed upon does not necessitate the disclosure or removal of any Russian minefields. Germany retains all the Islands of the northern end of the Gulf of Riga, but is cut off from the Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland.On December 19th, the Central Committee of the Black Sea Fleet demanded that the Bolsheviks should immediately cease Civil War and their attacks on the Ukraine, and also that they should release all the members of the Constituent Assembly which they had arrested. This is important in view of the attitude this Committee took up last week when aid was given by the Black Sea Fleet against the Cossacks, and ships at Odessa threatened to bombard the town in support of the Bolsheviks.NAVAL STAFF,21th December, 1917.[Appendices.
