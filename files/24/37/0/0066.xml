SECRET. intelligence Bureau,Department, of Information.C a     13 .MEMORANDUM ON SITUATION IN FINLAND. Recent Course of Events.In the third week of November the Socialists, influenced by the Lenin coup d&apos;etat in Petrograd, took complete possession of the Government offices in Helsingfors with the aid of the Russian Bolshevik soldiers, who supplied them with arms and ammunition. Great numbers of citizens belonging to the bourgeois parties or associated with the &quot;White&quot;   Guards were arrested and imprisoned. A similar plan was followed in all the larger towns of Finland, communication between which had been paralysed.   By the defection of the Agrarian Party the Socialists wore able to command a majority in the Diet, and immediately reverted to the political position from which they had boon ousted as the result of the recent election.   Thus, they have hurriedly passed laws dealing with the Constitution, an eight hours&apos; day; and communal administration.   The Governor-^General, whose office had been immediately abolished, happened to be in Petrograd in connection with the arrangements that were being worked out between the new Diet and the Provisional Government and did not return.   The Vice-Governor immediately resigned and handed over his duties to the Admiral commanding the Baltic Fleet.     There has, therefore, been no representative of the Russian civil authority in Finland since the middle of November.   On.the other hand, the Executive Ommittee of the Soviet for the Army, Navy and Workmen in Finland informed the Senate by letter that they had appointed two &quot;Comrades&quot;, a soldier and a sailor, to be Commissaries in place of the Governor-General,   &apos;\The Council also issued a declaration
JL*to the effect that a state of war existed in Finland (this, of course, has been the case since July 30, 1914), that it was known that the bourgeoisie were armed to support the Germans when they were going to land and also to annihilate the proletariat in the country and the Russian Revolutionary Army, and that the Council was going to put down mercilessly all resistance etc.     Later, the Petrograd Council was requested to hand over the conduct of all Finnish affairs to them, as they were prepared to wage a fight with the bourgeoisie locally along with the Russian democracy.Already by December 4 the growing strength of Bolshevism in Finland encouraged the Socialist Government to ask for recognition of their declaration of Finland as a free, Independent republic by other Governments.     Particularly have the local Swedes and elements sympathetic with Germany been urging the Swedish andGerman Governments to make the desired acknowledgment.     On December 9 the following telegram was forwarded to the British Prime Minister from the President of the Finnish Cabinet&quot;According to the constitution of Finland    the Diet on November 15 decided to assume the supreme State power.   Accordingly on December 4 I laid before tho Diet a proposal for the reconstruction of the constitution of Finland as an independent republic.   Referring to the promises of the belligerents with regard to the rights of self-determination of small nations and adding that the Finnish&apos; nation under the circumstances has both tho right and (group undecipherable) to settle its fate by the foreign powers&apos; recognition of its independence, the speaker of the Diet (? more especially) mentioned tho rights of the country and the wishes of the country.      The latest Russian Cabinet has not been recognised at home or abroad. No representative of the Russian Government has been in Finland since October, while Russian troops terrorise a peaceful population, creating revolutionary excitement among the lower elements.
Besides this, a serious scarcity of the necessaries of life is prevalent;   last summer5 s harvest is very poor;   the punflcjased Russian grain is not forthcoming;   while the anticipated American supply has not yet been received.&quot;Increasing numbers are seeking a refuge in Finland from the Russian anarchyj these and the troops are now entirely dependent on the scanty Finnish supplies.&quot;The foreign powers do not recognise any Russian Government now.   Therefore, Finland must have independence in order to get into touch directly with foreign countries so as to obtain supplies. In accordance with the sentiments of your speech at Queen&apos;s Hall on December 19,-1914, I request humbly that Finland may be recognised as an Independent republic by His Majesty&apos;s Government and, If possible, that your Consul at Helsingfors may he authorised temporarily to represent His Majesty&apos;s Government diplomatically, as also that Finnish delegates may be permitted to proceed to London to finally discuss matters.&quot;Signed &quot;President of Finnish Cabinet&quot;,&quot;THUVUD&quot;.To this communication a reply was sent on December 10 to the effect that when the Russian Constitutional Assembly had sanctioned the independence of Finland, the British Government would be ready to recognise it.Political Notes.The comparative success of a temporary Nationalist Party at the recent elections put new life into the bloc composed principally of the Old Finns and the New Finns, who subsequently took over its programme in a more active and intense spirit and were evidently
prepared to fight the Socialists with vigour in the Diet and in the country.     At the same time, they clearly recognised that that fight could only be successful if order were re-established and the supremacy and continuity of the lavs maintained, with the immediate introduction of new legislation dealing with land reform, local self-government, labour questions, old age pensions, workmen&apos;s insurance etc.   Under the influence of the restlessness produced by the course of events in Russia, however, and the aggravated lawlessness of the soldiery, it soon became apparent that the moderate elements could not succeed.   Forebodings of the coming Socialist coup were not infreduent in the bourgeois press, and, indeed, the Socialists were directly warned that if they made an attempt by force to assume the reins of Government and convene the dissolved Diet*to pass their Power Law of July 18, which gave the supreme legislative and executive power in Finland to the Diet, together with their peculiar party programme, such a victory would be pyrrhic.   The people would protest against any such proceeding and when the present abnormal circumstances had passed the Socialists weuld be called to account for their actions.On the other hand, there has also been a very general strengthening of opinion everywhere as to the necessity of securing complete&apos; independence.   It is felt that there is no promise of any stability of Government in Russia for a very long time to come, and that promises made by one Government might not be respected by its successors.      Accordingly, the desire has grown to make the Finnish question an international one or, at the worst, to have Finnish relations with Russia referred to the Hague Tribunal.The action of the Agrarian Party in going over temporarily to the Socialists after the coup d&apos;etat, so giving them a majority in the present Diet, was the logical development of their recent
behaviour, for a ter acting together with the Swedish, Young Finnish and Old Finnish parties in an endeavour to bring about an understanding between the Diet and the Provisional Government with regard to the present conduct of affairs in Finland, they &quot;backed out of the agreement at the last moment.   The agreement consequently could not be brought into existence, as there was now not a majority of the Diet behind it.   The agreement was to the following effect:-   All legislative matters and those dealing with the internal Government of Finland were to be left to purely Finnish State organs;   there was to be a maintenance of the status quo In relation to questions mutually concerning Russia and Finland until they should be definitely settled;   the final settlement was to be made on the basis, of the continuity of the rights of both Russia and Finland.   It was understood that the Provisional Government were prepared to assent to the above arrangements.   The downfall of the Provisional Government, however, only completed what had already been undone as the result of the action of the Agrarian Party,   The latest information shows that in view of the crime and lawlessness which formed so great a part of the activities of the Socialists during, and as a result of, the great strike, the Agrarian Party have withdrawn from further active co-operation with the Socialists;   but as they hold the balance and do not actively assist the Bourgeois bloc, administrative procedure is at a stand-still for the present.      The only points on which the various Finnish parties are now agreed are the necessity for complete independence and the vesting of the supreme power in the Diet as the legal representatives of the people. How this power is to be used and arranged at once leads to more divergence of opinion.
Economic Conditifns,,Feeling is still hostile to the U.S.A. on the strength of its     ohibition of the export of grain to Finland for fear that it should fall into German hands.   &quot;So far there is not a single German in Finland,-   but how could the Western Powers help Belgium and Poland, which were already occupied by the Germans, and yet they cannot help us, who are not in such a condition?&quot;    The suggestion is made that grain could be unloaded in some port (Narvik) in Northern Norway, s tored in the North of Finland and distributed by American Commissioners.   But bitterness of feeling is aggravated by the fact that Helsingfors is already starving in the literal sense of that word.     It appears that during the night of July 18 the thermometer fell to 5 degrees below zero throughout Sourthern Finland, and more than one hundred million kilograms of rye, were destroyed.   The potato crop was also ruined through rain.      The latest information seems to indicate, however, that the American Government will agree to some such arrangement as that outlined above.Foreign Relations.The Finnish papers continue to be exercised over the very evident desire of the Right wing in Swedish politics to make use of the present situation to advance olaims to the Aland Islands as a necessary element in Swedish defencex.       This proposal is, however, moderate compared with that emanating from the Left party and set out in a recent pamphlet.     They recommend the occupation of the whole of Finland until the Finnish question can be definitely settled after the war.     This step is urged, as a result of thex   A delegation from these Islands recently proposed that Sweden should take them over permanently.
pigrowing dominance of Germany in the Baltic.   Sweden, it is. urged, cannot look on unmoved at further German penetration to the North, nor can she afford to see Finland go under.   Finland, if left in any relationship to Russia, will now he in reality merely a dependency of a Germany which will stretch from Kiel to Ternea, and would be ever so much more dangerous to her than the Russia of the past.   Other States will also suffer from such a German Baltic power.   In particular, for France it would he very dangerous and it would be In the interests of France to look for the support of another power on the Baltic after Russia has crumbled in pieces: that other power should be Sweden.     The writer, therefore, suggests an agreement now between Russia, France and Sweden under which the Russian troops would be withdrawn from Finland, and Sweden would occupy Finland until peace is concluded, being responsible meanwhile for the preservation of order and the solution of the economic question, while Finland would govern herself according to her own laws.   For Russia this would mean greater security and the renewed possibility to defend her Soutb-Vestera frontier;   for France it would be important to have another power in operation in the Baltic other than Germany,   The writer believes that there would be no great resistance to this plan in Germany except from the Pan-Germans, as It would shorten the German front.   &quot;The. powerful resistance would come from England and the U.S.A. ,which have not the same conception of the Baltic Power question as France and which decided long ago to take care of the Russian succession of events for their own account through a peaceful penetration&quot;.     But the rapid advance of the Germans in the Baltic will force them to take steps to prevent the Russian Baltic possessions from completely falling into the hands of Germany.   Then, after the conclusion of peace, Finland would form, in conformity with its traditions and
interests, an independent State in intimate rapprochement with Sweden.The refusal of the Russian Government to allow Finland to appoint a commercial agent in Scandinavia is only one of the many little things that have gone to strengthen the desire for complete independence.1.1.18.
