!MaORAM)lM FOR THE TO CABINET.I circulate a memorandum prepared some time ago at my request by Sir George Fiddes, in reference to the German Colonies,   I sent a copy of it to Lord Curzon, who was good enough to embody seme parts of it in his wider memorandum, but it is necessary that the views of the Colonial Office should be on record.    I fully appreciate the reasons which make it impossible &quot;for the Government to make any announcement at this stage of the war, but, conversant as I.am with the views, not only Of the Governments, but of the peoples of our great Dominions, I am satisfied that the effect of the return of these Colonies to Germany would be disastrous to the future of the Empire.    I am carefully examining two or three different proposals which seem to offer a way out of thedifficulty.J/.H.L.COLONIALOFFICE,2nd January, 1918,
Printed for the use of the Colonial Office.   November 1917.CONFIDENTIAL.THE FUTURE GF THE GERMAN COLONIES.WHEN peace and peace negotiations are in sight we may anticipate a mobilisation of all the forces in this country and abroad which favour the return to Germany of her conquered colonies. German agents, pro-Germans, pacifists, and partisans of &quot; peace without annexations,&apos;.&apos; the sentimentalists who call for &quot;magnanimity in the hour of. victory,&quot; the moderates, who in all.circumstances favour. compromise, and who will invite us to beware of humiliating Germany by stripping her of her cherished possessions all these will form a combination whose strength it would be unwise to ignore. Even should the. war end in a crushing victory for our arms and a prostrate Germany, they would still and perhaps on that very acconnt-be able to create a certain amount of what passes as public opinion, which might not be Avithout its effect on those who had not sufficiently studied the probable effects of leaving all or any of the German colonies in German hands. And if the war does not end in such conclusive fashion-if the Germans at its close retain any of what they refer to as their &quot;pawns&quot; the influence of this combination would be greatly increased. We shall therefore do well to examine. the situation carefully, and to make up our minds in advance as to what we can afford to surrender without undue risk, and what we must at any cost keep unless we are prepared to face certain disaster.The subject has alreadv formed part of the investigations of a &quot;Territorial Changes Committee,&quot; presided over by Sir. L. Mallet, who have had before them copious memoranda bearing on the question. I do not propose to repeat their arguments or conclusions, but to state the case from a somewhat different point of view as it &quot;presents itself to me. I would observe in passing that since that Committee was appointed Ave have been gaining day by day a clearer view both of German intentions and of future possibilities/and we should by now be in a position to take a decision with reasonable conlidence in the accuracy of the forecast on which we base it.Before coming to the&apos;general considerations applicable to the question as a whole, we may usefully review the special considerations affecting each of the German colonies.I. Kiao-Chao.. This lias been captured by the -Japanese (with some slight assistance from British troops, which for present purposes is negligible), and is held by them. Apart from the strategic value of Tsingtau, the conquest has a sentimental value for -Japan, as wiping out the affront put npon her. by Germany&quot; not so many years ago. Her navy and army are intact, her financial position improved by the war, and she is not likely to be amenable to any pressure that can be brought to bear by Germany or the Allies-to make her relinquish her prize. Great Britain, at any rate, is in no position to exert such pressure, as she is pledged (for value received) to support the Japanese claim.II. The Idands in the Pacific.As Avith Kiao-Chao, so with the islands north of the Line. Japan holds these, and holds also the promise of Great Britain to support her claim to permanent possession. There are clear indications that Germans regard both Kiao-Chao and these islands as past praying for, and her inspired press has throAvn out hints that Germany would concede the Japanese claim if thereby Japan could be brought into the German orbit. Both Australia and New Zealand, in spite of their deep and instinctive distrust of the Japanese, have acquiesced in the action of His Majesty&apos;s Government in view of the call on the Japanese navy, in the early stages of the war, for assistance in protecting Australasian convoys and in hunting down German raiders.As regards the other German possessions in the Pacific, the Australian and New Zealand Governments were invited by His Majesty&apos;s Government to send expeditions.. [1193] &apos; B
for their conquest, though the formal condition was attached that no act of annexation was to be made, and that the territories were to be held at the disposal of His Majesty at the end of the war. The invitations and the conditions were accepted; the expeditions were despatched, and accomplished their purpose with more or less resistance from the enemy, and the territories are administered by the respective-Australasian Governments. Should we go to a Peace Conference as the result of an inconclusive war-which for us would be an immeasurable defeat these Governments would doubtless give a sombre acquiescence to any concessions which His Majesty&apos;s Government felt compelled to make, if and only if they were fully consulted beforehand, and the overpowering necessity for the surrender were made apparent to them. Bnt in the absence of proved necessity they would never forgive this country for a surrender which was even suspected of being a weak-kneed surrender to sentimentalists. The reference (made after consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government and with the approval of the War Cabinet) in the speech with which the Governor-General opened the last session of the New Zealand Parliament, as well as the guarded utterances of Mr. Hughes in the Australian Parliament, sufficiently indicate this.* Their experience - of the German in peace and war justifies them in regarding his presence in their neighbourhood as a very grave menace to their future safety, and the views of both Premiers on the point must be well known to the War Cabinet.III. South-West Africa.This was conquered by the Union forces under General Botha as the result of an invitation somewhat similar to those addressed by His Maiesty&apos;s Government to Australasia. The same formal condition was. attached, but while it was formally accepted by the Union Government, it is significant that the railway system was at ouce linked up with the Cape railways and handed over to the &quot;Open Lines&quot; department of the Union railway administration. It is unthinkable that this province should be handed back to Germany, save in conditions that imply the early break-up of the British Empire. The weakness and procrastination of the British Government in the early eighties that impelled Bismarck to the annexation of this territory have never been forgotten in South Africa. The extent to which the Cape Government were in reality responsible for the result is probably still unknown to the average student; and up to the opening of the war South Africans, even if . they failed to realise the menace to their safety which the possession of this territory, by Germany involved, had lost nothing of their bitter feeling with regard to the transaction. The war opened their eyes to the risks that they had run. They found that the territory had become a storehouse of munitions and men intended for use against themselves ; that the intrigues of Germans at their door had lit the flames of civil war; and that they were in the hateful position of having to turn xheir arms against their own kindred before they could proceed, against the foreign foe. They have a legitimate pride in the victory gained by their burghers over the forces of man and nature alike. The fact that they could never have succeeded without the assistance and protection of the&apos;British navy is immaterial, for it is perhaps the quaintest feature of South African politics that everyone, from enthusiastic loyalist to declared rebel, regards the protection of the navy as a matter that goes without saying at all times and in all circumstances.To South Africans the return of this territory to Germany would mean the frustration of their efforts, the revival, of the menace on their border a tremendous stimulus to what is called Hertzogism or the forces that make for disruption. It is not too much to say that there is no act imaginable within the sphere of practical politics which would more surely tend to unite all classes in South Africa in hatred of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and more surely pave the way to the speedy destruction of British influence from Cape Town to the Zambesi.There remain  IV. German East Africa, andV. The Gameroons and Togoland in West Africa.It is round these, and especially the last two, that the battle of compromise-if battle there be--will rage. The Dominions have not the same direct interest in them that they have in the territories at their doors and captured by their forces. This statement, indeed, requires qualification, to an undetermined extent, as regards East* I append extracts from the speech and from the proceedings in the House of Representatives on the occasion when Mr. Massey and Sir Joseph Ward gave an account of their mission i,o Europe.
Africa. The Union has made important contributions in men, material, and money to the three years&apos; struggle for its possession, and Union statesmen are fully alive to the menace for the future if it remains in German hands. But if it came to compromise there can be no doubt, as between German East and German South-West Africa, which they would wish to retain. Given then that compromise and concessions are to be debated; given that the full weight of Australasian (possibly also of American) opinion -is thrown into the scale against concession in the Pacific ; and given that Union opinion will be similarly pronounced as. regards South-West Africa, it necessarily follows that the advocates of compromise will seek it in East and West Africa. The Germans, for reasons to be stated presently, will certainly concentrate their efforts on this. Can we afford to surrender any or all of these three colonies ?In no country of the world, save our own, would the question be put in this way. It would not be &quot;Why not ? &quot; but &quot; Why ? &quot; In any other country the opponent would be left to find an answer to &quot; Why ? &quot; It would be left to the enemy to explain why  when we have conquered these territories at a very large cost in life and treasure we should treat these as negligible and hand him back his territories as a beau geste. But the effect of our traditional attitude of apology for our existence is such that, when we are asked &quot; Why not ? &quot; we are constrained to feel that we are put on our defence, and that uuless we can furnish a conclusive answer the verdict will go in favour of the enemy forthwith.. Let us attempt to answer in this spirit. To do so, it is necessary to make certain assumptions derived from our experience during the war: 1. To a German a treaty is a chiffon de papier, binding on others but to be torn up when it suits his convenience. J\To treaty that we make with Germany will be worth the paper it is written on as affecting our security.2. Nothing could be more dangerous than to assume that, for war purposes, the German Government does not represent the German people. When the war goes definitely against them, they will doubtless denounce war and its authors. But so long as the war promised aggrandisement and loot, they were solid and enthusiastic for war  and would be again.3. The day after peace is declared, Germany, if she still exists as a nation, will begin to prepare for the next war. As the present war gives less and less promise of fulfilling -her desires, so more and more her writers in the press and elsewhere dwell on the next war and the requisites for its successful prosecution. And the ideas which they put forward are by no means chimerical. The book of the day, which is said to have the greatest success and to be the most widely-read, has as its thesis the necessity of making preparation proportionate to endeavour wuth reference to the next war. &quot; It is for policy to work with the object of securing to Germany greater freedom for violent and decisive blows in one direction.&quot;* Time will, of course, be required to repair the waste of war and to provide the necessary resources, but I hazard the.prophecy that unless we look to it the rapidity of Germany&apos;s economic recovery will startle the world. Ludendorff is reported to have declared that the next war will come in ten years&apos; time.4. In the matter of &quot; Schrecklichkeit &quot; (commonly, but badly, rendered &quot; fright-fulness&quot;), the German will begin the next war at the point where he ended on this occasion. This is unsupported prophecy, and everyone must judge for himself as to its probability.   But it is important to the argument.5. The development of the submarine and of wireless telegraphy has profoundly affected, and complicated, the pioblem of Imperial Defence. The most disquieting-feature about them is the enormous advantage which they confer on an aggressor, especially when he has as little regard for the ordinary dictates of humanity as for conventions and treaties.The experience of the war has compelled us wholly to revise our estimate of the value of the coloured soldier. Formerly we regarded him as a negligible quantity in European warfare or against European troops armed with all the resources of civilisation. Likewise we held to the comfortable belief that only British officers were capable of getting full value out of native troops. We can now discard both beliefs. The French have extensively employed their Senegalese on the Western front with results that, having regard to previous anticipations, were surprisingly good.   Our* &quot;Deductions from the World War,&quot; by.General von Freytag-Loringhoven, Deputy Chief of the General Staff [cf. reviews in the &quot; Times&quot; of the 24th September and 7th November, 1917).
Nigerian troops in assaulting difficult positions on the Cameroons border behaved in a way that would have been commendable in the. case, of British . infantry, r. The Congolese, under Belgian officers, have done good service in German East Africa. And in the same district the coloured German troops have put tip a three years&apos; fight, which compels our admiration, against all the forces that we could bring against them, and-have shown in depressing circumstances a staunchness and a loyalty to their leaders that should give us furiously to think.Given a sufficiently large recruiting ground, time to train her troops, time and means to accumulate sufficient warlike stores, and the next war. should see Germany in possession of a native army which would make itself felt from Kordofan to the Zambesi-if not beyond. The only hope for us would be to adopt similar counter-measures, and to suggest the possibility of our doing this would be an absiirdity. Even if we did, we should have inflicted on Africa the curse of militarism, from which she would have been exempt but for our desire for a beau geste. Nor would our position with the natives at the outbreak of war be what it is now. Propaganda would have done its work. The natives would have found one, and only one, construction to put on our retrocession of their territory. When the Germans were leaving the Cameroons they told the natives : &quot;We are leaving now, but we shall return soon,&quot; and the natives would see that they had spoken the truth. No amount of explanation would make a native understand the lofty (or other) motives that had inspired our action; with them it is the vanquished and not the victor that disgorges. Many months ago the &quot; Frankfurter Naebrichtung &quot; summed up the situation in one sentence to which there can be nothing to add : &quot; The maintenance of our colonies will be the manifestation to the natives that we have won the war.&quot;The Germans are keenly alive to the possibilities in Africa which I have indicated. Their press abounds with references to the subject, and it can hardly be doubted that these utterances reflect the views of the men of action who think but do not talk. Merely by way of illustration and taken haphazard, I give a few recent instances. The first does not come from the press, but is from the report by one of our diplomatists of what he had gathered from a certain informant as to German war aims : &quot;Egypt is still considered of value in connection with Central African colonies scheme.&quot;   The second is from the &quot; Deutsche Kurier &quot; : &quot; England must be relegatedto the place where she belongs in the world that lies outside Europe.....Germanmight and influence must be led far beyond the fortress of Europe.....As the alliesof the Turks, we shall have a share in the Red Sea .... Turkish sovereignty in the Persian Gulf, a German Central African Empire from Dar-es-Salaam (German East Africa) to Duala [Cameroons) will flank the Indian world-sea and will bring our frontiers-to the southern part of the Atlantic. Fleet bases in New Guinea and Samoa, on the Moroccan coast and in the Azores will complete our influence on the high sea road that girdles the earth.&quot; The Kolnische Zeitungy&apos; which is less bombastic but more definite, has recently stated : -&quot;There were about 15,000 native troops with, perhaps, 3,000 Europeans, all badly armed with insufficient artillery and supplies. Yet this small army has kept the Entente army of about ^00,00&apos;) men busy. In view of this latter fact, it is a great pity that Germany had not a colonial army about five times as&apos; big. Had this been the case, the Entente would not have been able to bring such vast numbers of colonial troops to the European theatre of war. At present there, is nothing to prevent England and France from continuing to employ vast hitherto untapped resources in the way of coloured man-power. Experience of this war has shown that the East African native, if sufficiently trained and led by Europeans, makes an efficient soldier, while the South-West African is an even better soldier, given similar circumstances. In future, in order to prevent her colonies from being overrun by other peoples, Germany must utilise to the full these resources of man-power. Such of these natives, as have hitherto not been subject to Germany must come under her rule, while all foreign colonies which have made war against German colonies must become. German property. A colonial army must be created fur colonial needs and must not be used in Europe. A big colonial army based upon long service and retention of time-expired soldiers in reserve would be excellent for the economic development of Germanys old and new colonies, as discharged soldiers can be made into useful labourers.&quot; Germany must have a strong colonial army to strengthen her position and at the same time weaken that of her enemies, who must never again be allowed to bring coloured troops to their aid in Europe.&quot;
M   v ... Ill   5    -.:      .Herr Franz Kolbe,* in the &quot; Deutsche Politik &quot; (February 1917), sketches the new &quot; German Africa &quot; (to consist of at least the old German colonies, the whole of the Belgian Congo, the whole of French Equatorial Africa and Angola) and states : &quot; The whole coast of West- Africa from the mouth of the Cross River to the mouth of the Orange River would be in German possession. When one only remembers what immense achievements were performed by the &apos; Emden &apos; in the Indian Ocean and by the &apos; Karlsruhe &apos; in the Atlantic, without any naval base, without any possibility of replenishing in port their supplies of munitions, food, &amp;c, it will be realised what the fortification of half the West Coast of xAfrica would signify for Germany and for England ! As soon as, in a new war, the Suez Canal is closed against England by the Turks, all traffic between England and India, Australia, and South Africa must go round the Cape of Good Hope. But then all the shipping must pass the coast of German Central Africa ! It would be impossible for England any longer to concentrate her whole fleet in the North Sea and to menace Germany.&apos; She would be compelled to station a considerable fleet in South Africa for the protection of her trade, and that would mean a not inconsiderable weakening of her forces in European waters.&quot;The well-known Emil Zimmermann, the latest leader^ of the &quot;Central Africa&quot; school, says in the &quot; Europaische Staats- und Wirtschafts-Zeitung &quot; of the 23rd June, 1917 :-&quot; If the Great War makes Central Africa German, fifty years hence 500,000 and more Germans can be living there by the side of 50,000,000 blacks. Then there may be an army^of 1,000,000 men in German Africa, and the colony will have its own war navy like Brazil.&quot; An England that is strong in Africa dominates the situation in Southern Europe, and does not need us. But from Central Africa we shall dominate the English connections with South Africa, India, and Australia, and we shall force English policy to reckon with us.&quot;tTo this part of the subject belongs the question: How far are we justified in handing back to German rule the natives that we have freed from it P I. only refer to it in passing, as I wish to confine this memorandum to considerations of a different order. It&apos;is, however, the fact that the Germans have behaved with much barbarity to their natives ; that these natives on the West Coast have exposed their thankful-ness at escaping from their oppressors, Eind have even pressed on us thank-offerings for their deliverance; and that they are marked men if ever the Germans return. Mr. Theo Schreiner (a senator of the Union Parliament and brother of the High Commissioner) recently sent a long letter to the &quot; Cape Times &quot; developing the &quot; proposition that it would be an unthinkable crime against humanity to hand over the remnants of the native and Hottentot tribes and the Bastard community of the South-West Protectorate to Germany.&quot; The argument, however, even if out of place here, has importance in the eyes of influential circles both in this country and in America, and if it were desired to enlist their sympathy in a policy of retaining these colonies it might be elaborated with advantage. AVe have recently published blue books! on this subject which-it is worth remembering affects, some 13,000,000 of human beings in the three colonies alone.Apart from the grandiose scheme of a Central African Empire, let us consider what are the possibilities as to the part which the existing German colonies would play in the next war if left in German hands.   There can be no doubt that one of the worst blunders made by Germany in her war preparations was the neglect to make adequate use of her advantages in this direction ; it is equally certain that the blunder will not be repeated.  W7hile I am writing, the interesting news comes to hand that the Germans have established a large school at Davos (SAvitzerland), where their interned colonists are being trained for future colonial activity.    In a message to them, Herr Solf, the German Colonial Secretary, says Peace will give usback our colonies in a new conformation.   The Fatherland expects the old Africans and men from the Pacific . ... . . . immediately to offer themselves again for colonialwork.&quot;   Naturally the military side wilLbe receiving equal attention.German East Africa is twice the size of Germany. It has a population of about 7,500,0.00, including some of the best, fighting material in Africa.   To the north it* Cf. &quot;Times,&quot; April 12, 1917. f &quot;Times,&quot; November 9, 1917.t 0d.* 887.1: 1916 (South-West Africa) ; and Cd. 8689 : 1917 (East Africa).[1193] C
threatens our East Africa Protectorate, whose vital nerve, the Uganda Railway, runs for a great part of. its length not far from the German border. .On the west it is covered by Lake Tanganyika, and with&apos;command of the lake it. is a menace to the Belgian Congo. To the south it threatens alike bur protectorates of Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia and the neighbouring Portuguese possessions. &apos; Its greatest strategic importance lies in its eastern frontier, a line of nearly 500 miles of coast facing the Indian Ocean. &apos; In Tanga and Dar-es-Salaam it possesses good and defensible harbours, and the possibilities of the Rufigi delta as a lurking place for marauders were demonstrated by the &quot; Konigsberg &quot; episode. With the diversion of shipping from the Suez Canal, round the Cape of Good Hope, which has taken place during this war, and would assuredly be necessary again, it lies on the very flank of our Indian and Far Eastern trade routes.The Cameroons are half as large again as Germany; they have a population of 4,500,000, again of fair to good fighting quality. Protected by difficult country on most of the western border, they are a proved menace to Nigeria. With another year of preparation, the principal harbour Duala could have been made impregnable, and the nature of the country is such that any offensive operations against the colony must almost necessarily begin with the reduction&apos; of Duala. The capacity of the harbour is illustrated by the fact that when we captured Duala we found there some score of ocean-going craft that had taken refuge in it. The strategic importance of the colony is that it, like Togoland, is posted on the flank of our Cape, and is within striking distance of our West African, trade route.Togoland is much smaller-say a quarter the size of Germany but still with a population of 1,000,000. Roughly speaking, it is a narrow parallelogram with its shorLer side on the sea, and stretching far inland. In Lome it has a useful port. But its importance in the present conflict was, or might have been, that it possessed a very powerful wireless installation, placed well in the interior, which could talk to Berlin and scatter its messages far and wide over the Atlantic. The audacious advance of the British forces brought about its destruction in three weeks from the opening of the war, but this speedy success would hardly be repeated.The Admiralty have recently warned the Wax Cabinet of the danger to which this country would be. exposed if peace leaves Germany in possession of a formidable fleet of submarines. We already have ample experience of what the submarine can do even when its recognised bases are confined to ports on the German and Flanders coast. Based on securely defended portsi in East and West Africa, its efforts co-ordinated and controlled by wireless installations in touch with the German Admiralty in Berlin, its potentialities for mischief will be almost limitless We may safely assume that the next declaration of war will be, if not preceded by, at least simultaneous with a &quot;ruthless&quot; surprise attack on all our shipping, naval or mercantile, within reach ; and that the movement of troops, munitions, and civil supplies will be rendered difficult to the verge of impossibility. On the outbreak of the present war one of the first concerns of the navy was to root out the naval bases of the enemy, to round up his scattered raiders, and to protect the Australasian and South African transports. It did not prove an easy task. When these African ports - are defended by guns, by minefields, and by submarine squadrons, it is more than doubtful if the navy would prove equal to the task of reducing them, while also containing the German High Fleet. - If the picture is not overdrawn, to invite us to return these colonies to Germany is to invite us to commit suicide.If this be accepted, it is well worth considering Avhether we should not take steps to strengthen our position in relation to our Allies before peace negotiations are in sight, and to make it clear that no solution will be accepted by us which involves the rendition of the German colonies, and that while we are willing to fight on until our often-declared objects have been attained, we are not willing to accept a peace which promises our future destruction. If we fail to make this clear in advance we may find many adverse influences co-operating against us. We may have to reckon with the latent jealousy of territorial acquisitions by Great Britain. France provisionally holds half of Togoland (not including Lome), and though our contribution to the conquest of the Cameroons was at least equal to hers, we acquiesced in her provisional adminis-tration of about seven-eighths of the colony, including Duala. Influential as her Colonial party is, she might well be led to ignore the ultimate danger to herself, wmich is not less great than to us, and in consideration of some immediate advantage to press for the return of the colonies or at any rate of her share. Others of the Allies are less directly and immediately concerned, and it is not improbable that they would be
APPENDIX.Extract from the Speech ivith which the Governor-General of New Zealand openedParliament on June 28, 1917.THE administration of the occupied Samoan Islands has been efficiently carried out, and there is every reason to believe that the native population is happy under British control, and has no desire to revert to the conditions which prevailed prior to the occupation by New Zealand troops.I have recently informed my Ministers that the Secretary of State for the Colonies has assured me that the Imperial Government fully realise the vital importance to this Dominion of the destiny of the German colonies in thePacific, and that when the time comes for decision the fullest consideration will be given to the wishes of the New Zealand Government.[1193]Dwell content to see. Great Britain pay for the broken crockery. On the other hand, Japan, owing to her understanding with ns, to which I have already alluded, might well be required to give a reciprocal undertaking to support our position. Most important of all, the United States, as in &quot;actual &quot;conflict they gain personal experience of what war with Germany really means, should more and more be drawn to our view. They should already be keenly alive to the menace to their interests in the Pacific, which would be real enough, though the matter might not be vital to them as it is to ns. Two recent facts go to suggest that with a little intelligent effort on our part the States may be ranged solidly on our side in this matter.According to a statement in the press, an American War Society has been formed, one of the planks in whose platform is the non-return of the German colonies. It would be interesting to have some information as to this society and its influence.The &quot;New York Tribune&quot; of the 7th October, 1917, has a page article by Mr. F. H. Simonds, which reviews the position of these colonies and the German colonial aims. It is illustrated by a map showing the territory which Germany hoped to acquire from Asiatic Turkey to Cape Town. He writes with much insight into the position, and the whole article would repay perusal. I quote his concluding-paragraphs :  &quot; In this collapse of Germany&apos;s overseas empire may be found one more incentive to German activity in Central Europe, in the Balkans, and in Asiatic Turkey. Since sea-power had demonstrated the helplessness of Germany beyond the mainland ; since her colonial establishments.had disappeared, it was patent that, if Germany were to have her place upon the map, a place commensurate with her real greatness, it must be sought where her armies could march and where British sea-power could not reach, and this led inevitably to the great pan-German dream, to Mitteleuropa with its Asiatic extensions ; and now, when Mitteleuropa. is endangered, Germany is turning again to Mittelafrika.&quot; I have tried to indicate why any German proposal to evacuate Belgium in return for a restoration of her colonies will be rejected by the Allies. Americans will find their best parallel for this situation in their own history in the pre-Revolutionary era. After a long series of wars, during which time New England and Northern New York were ravaged by Indian bands led by French officers,..Quebec was finally conquered by the British with.the aid of large colonial contingents. Had the British proposed to return Quebec to France, the Revolution would have come earlier than it did. The American colonies were resolved to make an end of border warfare and to abolish an enemy frontier. The people of South Africa and of Australia are now of exactly the same mind as American colonists in the middle of the eighteenth century. Their purpose is bound to prevail, and aside from possible Central African arrangements, which are unlikely in the extreme, there is no chance of a restoration of German colonies, not because of British, but because of colonial, sentiment.&quot;G.

8Extracts from the Proceedings in the New Zealand House of Representatives. Q wThe Right Honourable Mr. Massey, July 3, 1917 : ?  ,    .... -I mentioned, I think, when speaking of the Imperial War Conference as well as of the Imperial War Cabinet, that 1 would not deal with the subjects or with the opinions expressed on them which have not been made public.    It is probable that these matters will not be made public for some little time to come.   One&apos; of these aubjects was, of course, what will be done with the German colonies when the war comes to an end.   I cannot deal with that subject as a whole nor quote the decision at which the War Conference arrived; but as this is a matter of intense interest to the Anglo-Saxon -people in the South Pacific, I intend to express my own opinions, irrespective of anything that was done or said at the Conference or Cabinet, and doing that I am not breaking any confidence.   Members know perfectly well to what I allude: that there is a difference of opinion with regard to the German colonies, though not in Australia or in New Zealand.   We know the opinion in this country.   There is practically no difference of opinion.   But some people in other parts of the Empire - seem to imagine that we people of New Zealand and the people of Australia, as the case may be, or taking them both together, that the people of these dominions think of these German colonies on account of their value, on account of their fertility, or on account of the possibility of their supporting a considerable population in years to come.    That may be all right;  but there are far  more important -points to consider, and this is the point of view from Avhich I look at them, and f am quite sure that this will be the point of view of the Finance Minister, who was with me.   We know perfectly well if these German colonies in the South Pacific and I want members to understand that I am speaking only of the South Pacific in the meantime ; I am not speaking of the islands on the other side of the Line, if these islands are allowed to become what may be called pawns in the political game, and are given back at the end of the war, and I do not think there is a chance of that now, but if they happened to be given back at the end of the war, what it would mean will be this : they will be occupied by our present enemy, by citizens of the German Empire; but in addition to that these islands if they are given beck to Germany would mean that naval bases would be established in the Pacific ; that wireless stations will be erected; that they will become the headquarters for submarines, and probably the headquarters of airships in some form.   I think that is an absolute certainty.   And that is what we have got to look forward to.   We have got to think of what the position was when the war broke out, when a number of strong, fast, powerful German warships were in the Pacific.   We can remember the time when every British settlement in the Pacific looked forward to the possibility of being bombarded by the warships of Germany that were &quot;in these waters at the time.   I can remember the anxiety that was felt in New Zealand when we found it necessary to put our coastal -lights out, and when our ships travelled along the coast, as they are now doing in the North Atlantic, without lights.    We can remember perfectly well that Papeete, a French settlement a little farther north in the Pacific, was bombarded by one of the enemy&apos;s warships.   These things are impressed upon our memories and can ^tiever be forgotten.The Right Honourable Sir J. G. Ward, July 3, 1917 : - I stated in England, and I repeat it now, that it would be a crime against the people of the oversea dominions in the Pacific if these islands were ever allowed to revert either to Germany or to any other foreign country, and.this fight we have been waging in conjunction with the Old Land in order to break the power of a barbaric enemy for all time will be minimised tremendously, as far as the people in the southern seas are concerned, if by any means thevs were the possibility of the islands reverting back to the enemy. In connection with the future, development in the air and under the sea must necessarily play a great part, apart from any changes which may take place in the structural nature of naval vessels which in the future will make up the navies in the world: If the Pacific Islands reverted back to Germany that country would then, when in a position to start again on her path of destruction, have a great advantage in the Pacific. It may be only a question of time before we would have to go through this horrible barb.iric fight again. Who knows what the future may have in store? Germany might again be a menace to these southern, seas, ready with a . watch-dog leap to v_o.in.ce upon us and to put her fangs into us probably at a time when we could not readily stand up or shake them off.   As far as what is necessary for this
country is concerned, there is no mistaken idea in the minds of the men who are responsible in the Old Land-as to- what our views are. And there is no misunder-standing on the part of the people in this dominion as to what our views are on the future of the islands in the Pacific- I believe that if you &quot;were to poll this country from one end to the other upon that very great question, and if the people were told that by^now giving them up we might have to fight for it over again, rather than give up the islands of the Pacific they would prefer to carry on the conflict until such an awful possibility were eliminated.Mr- E. Newman, July 4, 1917 :-For us to have a German base in the Pacific-Samoa, or any other island would be like living on the edge of a volcano. We would never have any security. We have only one means of getting security, and that is by absolutely preventing the Germans from having any base in the Pacific. There is not only New Zealand interested: there are British Columbia, Australia, and other parts of the Empire.Mr. Isitt, July 4, 1917 :-. I have listened with a great deal of sympathy to what has been.said about the absolute necessity of barring for ever Germany&apos;s possession of Samoa or any other centre in the Pacific. God knows that we have poured out blood and treasure in this war, and for what&apos;? For our own present peace and content ? Is it for that merely that cur boys have died ? They have made.the sacrifice they have made for the future of the race and for&apos;the future of New Zealand, and to allow Germany on any plea whatever to establish once more a centre in the Pacific, where her implacable hatred may be free to scheme, and for the next century or half-century prepare for revenge, Avould be an error so great as to be criminal. Believing this, I was delighted to hear the strong testimony given us here by the Prime Minister and by Sir Joseph Ward that nothing of the kind would be for one moment entertained.- The Right Honourable Mr. Massey, July 27, 1917 : The Imperial authorities are fully impressed with the importance of these islands, not only to New Zealand and Australia, but to the Avhole Empire; and I am certain the Finance Minister will join with me in the opinion I am going to express, that unless something approaching defeat comes to the Empire and that is impossible -these islands will not be given back. I am thinking, of course, not only of Samoa, with Avhich we are more intimately concerned, but of German New Guinea. I am not going to refer to any islands north of the Equator, because they are being dealt with in a different manner, which I am not going to discuss at present; but I am thinking, amongst others, of Ocean Island and Nauru Island islands of immense value to New Zealand and Australia.o
