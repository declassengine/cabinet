Report by Colonel 0. A. Lamb, Military Attache^ Rome, on causes that contributed to the recent disaster to the Italian Army on the Isonzo, and on certain incidents connected with the subsequent retreat to the Tagliamento.1. The sudden and unexpected collapse of the Italian defences on the Isonzo in the sector held by the 2nd Italian Army and the subsequent disintegration of that army may be said to be chiefly due to the following causes : (a.) A general feeling of dissatisfaction that pervaded the whole army as the war dragged on, aggravated by injudicious handling of the men, who were kept for too long a time in the trenches and were overworked during their so-called intervals of rest; to which may be added a kind of fixed idea which existed among the men that the war would end in the autumn.(6.) Socialist, neutralist and clerical anti-war propaganda.(c.) The example of events in the Russian Army.(d.) Inadequate separation allowance for the families of men called up and retained under arms (the-highest rate is 85 centimes for wife, 45 centimes for each . child, daily).2. Italian Army Headquarters and the General Staff are said to have been out of touch with the army and their duties too much restricted, to office work. It is probable that there is some truth in this, as owing to the Italian General Staff being a closed corps there has always been a lack of sympathy between this branch and the rest of the army. Frequent changes in the higher commands, alleged in many cases to have been made for causes other than purely military reasons, are reported to have given rise to a feeling of insecurity which gradually affected all ranks of officers. I have been told by one of them that senior officers were actually afraid to bring to notice the growing discontent and want of discipline among the troops for fear that this would lead to theirremoval from their commands.3. During the past summer indications were not wanting that all was not well; there were a number of cases of collective insubordination among the troops on the Isonzo front, and on the occasion of my rare visits to the front I have myself observed a growing slackness among the rank and file and a tendency to dispute orders given by officers.Naturally with the progress of the war the class of junior officers has deteriorated as the original stock of subalterns disappeared and were replaced by hurriedly trained young men. Education in Italy is cheap and easily obtainable and numbers of youths obtain university degrees qualifying for admittance to the various professions out of all proportion to the chances of lucrative employment, the result being a constant increase in the number of disappointed young professional men. It is precisely from this class that the junior officers of the new Italian infantry formations have been drawn, and as in other countries it is a class that furnishes numerous recruits to the ranks of socialism.4. The average educated Italian has no taste for country life and prefers to live in a town, the consequences being that public opinion among the peasantry is usually influenced by the parish priest or by the local political agitator, who is generally a socialist. The official socialists, many of the aristocracjr and the majority of the clergy, opposed the war from the beginning and professed to accept the German version of its original cause. An active anti-war propaganda was carried on directed more particularly against Great Britain, which was represented as a rapacious nation of traders that had provoked and were prolonging the war for selfish reasons, who had from the first exploited Italy by lending her money at usury, and had profited by her deficiency of mineral wealth to charge her exorbitant prices, for coal and war material. These misrepresentations have been largely accepted as truth by the ignorant and easily prejudiced of all ranks of society.(B17/751)  25  1/18  H&amp;3  54i2wo
2The war was never really popular, except with the intelligent middle class, and the bulk of the population entertain only a vague sentimental interest in the question of the redemption of the Trentino and Triest. When, instead of a short campaign, it was found that the country was committed to a lengthy struggle, entailing hardship and loss on nearly all classes, it soon became absolutely unpopular. To the aristocracy, who have perhaps suffered least of all, their relatives mostly serving in the cavalry, which until recent events has played only a minor part in the war, it was a nuisance, and it was identified by them with the aims of democracy and the abolition of privilege. To the peasantry and to the large class that live by the tourist traffic it was a disaster brought about by intervention in a war in which they considered the interests of Italy to be only vaguely involved.Men home on leave from the front imbibed these ideas and disseminated them among their comrades on their return, and a feeling that the war was unnecessary and was being prolonged in the interests of Great Britain made considerable progress in the army. The example of events in the Russian Army had a very deleterious effect, and the idea that if the men refused to fight the war would end automatically seems to have established itself among the troops, especially those of the 2nd Italian Army located in the neighbourhood, of Caporetto, where no serious fighting had taken place for some months past, and where the Italians are reported to have to some extent fraternised with the enemy and thus come under the influence of the same methods of peace propaganda that are said to have done so much harm in. the Russian Army.5. Meanwhile Italy generally was overrun by thousands of deserters and absentees from the army, who in some cases appear to have organized themselves into regular communities for defence against the authorities, especially in the south of Italy and Sicily.It is hard to suppose that the Supreme Command were altogether unaware of the mischief that was brewing; but be that as it may, no steps seem to have been taken to check it, neither did the Central Government make any but the most feeble efforts to combat the work of those who were engaged in &quot; sabotage &quot; against the war throughout Italy. There was, in fact, a general policy of letting things slide, for which the country has had to pay very dearly.6. From persons who were present I have ascertained several interesting details regarding the retreat. In the trenches before Goritzia the news of a general retirement seems to have been known among the rank and file before the officers had received any information of the disaster further north, and a number of the former left the trenches, saying that the war was over, and betook themselves without arms to the town. As soon as the order for retirement became known, the officers and men quartered in the villages in rear of the Italian positions commenced to loot the villas and houses in which they had been billetted and packed the contents on ox carts and any vehicle they could lay hands on, which they loaded with quantities of useless rubbish of all kinds, the result being that early in the retreat the roads became blocked with slow-moving vehicles which, joined by the flying civilian population driving their cattle and with their belongings loaded on handcarts and barrows, caused the roads to become congested by a disorganized mass of carts, cattle, women and children, swelled by the retreating and disbanded soldiery from the mountain positions who, having thrown away their arms and equipment, were making for their homes, crying that the war was over. Naturally the roads were impassable for the swifter-moving army transport wagons, motor transport and guns.As the distance covered increased the congestion was further augmented by the thousands of fugitives from Udine and the other larger towns. My informants all agree that there was no organized attempt to regulate the traffic, although here and there feeble efforts were made to do so, also that the presence of a few mounted police would have prevented much of the confusion that prevailed, and would, to a considerable extent, have modified the enormous loss of material of all kinds that took place.To give an idea of the congestion on the roads leading to the Tagliamento, motor vehicles that left the lower Isonzo district on the evening of the 27th October took upwards of 48 hours to reach the neighbourhood of the river a distance of roughly 2-5 miles. As time wore on many motor vehicles ran out of petrol and had to be abandoned, and for the whole distance the ditches on each side of the roads were full of abandoned material of all kinds.At Latisana Bridge a panic took place. A sauve qui peut rush for the bridge ensued and many persons of both sexes were killed. In the middle of this confusion the bridge was blown up with the result that a large number of guns and men that were left on the eastern bank of the river fell mto the hands of the enemy.
The following extract from the report of a British Bed Cross motor lorry driver gives an interesting account of the condition of affairs at Latisana on 30th October : Saturday, 27th October. Started about 10 a.m. for S. Giorgio leading convoy. Fires seemed to break out in the surrounding villages as we got on the way. On the road opposite Cervignano Station we were held up^ for several hours until 2 p.m. the following afternoon.During this time fires were blazing in several parts of the town, petrol stores, barracks, &amp;c, one of which carried sparks, burning material, and smoke, across the road on which we were waiting. The station was abandoned and soldiers were looting the refreshment room, stores, &amp;c, and a great many were drunk.Arrived at Torre-di-Zuino about 6 p.m. thence to S. Giorgio where we parked the cars, the last one arriving about 4 a.m.Monday, 29th October. Left S. Giorgio about 8 a.m., the roads packed with cattle, motor, and every other kind of conveyance, and disorderly soldiers who had been looting S. Giorgio. From S. Giorgio onwards the ditches on each side of the road were lined with abandoned vehicles and dead mules, and the rifles the soldiers had thrown away. Overhead were German aeroplanes flying so low that one could distinguish their machine guns and see the bombs leave the plane. These followed us to Latisana, dropping bombs and firing their machine, guns. In Muzzano a bomb fell quite close to the vehicle I was driving, momentarily blinding me and covering the machine with debris. We were held up several hours outside Latisana finally reaching it about 6 a.m. the following morning, and arrived in sight of the Tagliamento about 8.30 a.m. on the 30th October. While we were held up there a train approached to within about three or four hundred yards of the bridge, soldiers descended from it on to the railway and began firing on us, and we heard the rattle of machine guns. This created an absolute panic,- and soldiers began to run yelling that the Austrians were on them and that they were betrayed. The lorry drivers raced their machines down the road and then abandoned them. My lorry was in the middle of an impenetrable jamb, deserted lorries and mule carts touching it on all sides, a dead mule between the radiator and another lorry, while a woman who had climbed on the back was lying dead, shot through the head.I told the mechanic who was with me that he had better try to escape across the river on foot, and after coming to the conclusion that I could do nothing further with the lorry I decided to follow his example. In the middle of the bridge a woman was calling out &quot; mia madre, mia madre,&quot; and I found that her mother had fallen over an abandoned bicycle and was being trampled under foot by the flying rabble. By the time I had got her cleared she was quite dead and unrecognizable. About half-an-hour after we crossed the bridge we heard two big explosions which the Italians told us were the road and railway bridges blowing up.7. This great disaster has taught the country a lesson which will be hard to forget, but it is still doubtful if the mass of the people regard the war from a really serious and patriotic point of view. The anti-war and particularly the anti-British propaganda is if anything more virulent than ever, and the Government appear to be as little inclined to tackle this question as before. General Cadorna&apos;s proclamation threatening the death penalty to. all deserters who did not surrender by a given date has resulted in large numbers rejoining the colours, however, many thousands are said to be still at large. It is noteworthy as an illustration of public feeling that there is an inclination to regard those men who have given themselves up to the military authorities as popular heroes, and at least in one case a party of some 400 surrendered deserters in a southern town paraded the streets headed by the local band.CHARLES A. LAMB, Colonel,Military Attache.Rome,8th December, 1917.
