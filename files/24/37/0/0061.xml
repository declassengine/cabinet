7 ?his britannic majesty&apos;s government) ^jggjjf this document is the property ofIntelligence Bureau,WEEKLY   REPORT   ON   HOLLAND. V.(Dec. 31st, 1917)Department of Information.GHW/005.172The early days of December were 3ignalised by Cabinet dissensions owing to a difference of opinion between Mr. Posthuma, the Minister of Agriculture, and Dr. Treub, the Minister of finance.   The immediate cause of friction was the permission given by the former for the re-sumption of the expert of cheeses to Germany and an order sent by lit,. Treub to stop the cheeses at the frontier.     Indirectly the quarrel was thejputcome of the institution by Kr. Treub of &quot;Nederlansche Uitvoer Maatsehappij&quot; or Central Export Association of the organisa-tion and functions of which Mr. Posthuma disapproved.   One of the primary objects of the founders of this Government Association was that the producerjshould be made to take a share in the risks at-taching to the .sale of Dutch products to foreign countries on the system of credits.     Mr. Treub has always supported the scheme and it v/as only on this unders^andl ng that he consented to the economic agreement with Germany in October last under which the producers become guarantees for a share cf the credits open with Germany for the purchase of Dutch products.     Under the agreement 3000 Tons of cheese should have been exported to Germany before the third week in October.     The export was stopped when only 1900 Tons had been expor- -ted, and by the 1st of December some 6000 Tons of cheese due to Germany were outstanding.     The reason of the stoppage was that the Dutch Union of Cheese Producers insisted on cash payment.   The Ministerliof Finance compelled the Union to accept the bonds of the Exportgave the Union permission to export which meant that the producers would be&quot; paid in cash.- Mr. Treub retaliated by instructing theCentral in payment.In defiance of the prohibition.?*r. Posthuma
Customs House Authorities to stop the cheeses at the frontier.    It will he seen that a very unedifying state of affairs was thus reached.The Ministers of War and Marine who feared that the coal from Germany would he stopped in consequence of the non-export of cheese, supported Mr. Posthuma who placed his resignation in the hands of the Queen.   Her Majesty requested him to withdraw it, which he did. Thereupon Mr. Treub resigned and was also persuaded to continue in office.     The quarrel has &quot;been at least temporarily patched up, but the Press seems to consider that further trouble in imminent,     Meann-while Mr. Treub has withdrawn his instructions stopping the expert of cheese.It is worth noting that although Mr. Treub is generally considered to have had the worst of the encounter, he is the only pro-Ally in the Dutch Cabinet.     His disappearance fron office would mean not only a victory for Mr. Posthuma, but would probably lead to a con-siderable change in the method of carrying out the Export Central and the return to cower of the pro-German financial and industrial Magnate Mr. Kroeller,If Mr. Treub is eventually forced to resign, it is thought possible by competent authorities that he will place himself at the head of a Liberal Commercial Party in the interests of which he will work steadily until the Elections of June 1918.     These elections will be held upon a wider suffrage than has bee&apos;h the case hitherto, about a million voted having been added to the Electoral Lists.   It is daid that the present Cabinet do not anticipate that they will remain in office after the elections.     There are indications that the Liberals are not satisfied with the Government, but it would seem improbable that the present somewhat apathetic Legislature will force the Govern-; ment from Power.   Although the present Cabinet has no following in the country they have   kept Holland out of the war for nearly      years.
In Holland there is at present a longing for peace second only to that in the territories of the Central powers.     The Netherlander is above all things a person who loves a quiet prosperous life.   He loves his money-bags and his regular humdrum existence.   Provided Holland is not obliged to join in the war he cares little for the merits of the struggle, quite forgetting that if Germany proved victorious his own Shrift would probably be remarkably short.   The letter recently pub-lished by Lord Lansdowne in the Daily Telegraph was taken by many of the Dutch newspapers as a herald of peace and, as in Germany, gave special delight to that party in Holland which holds Great Britain and America in detestation.     It is not too much to say that the whole Germanophile Press in the Netherlands received the letter with jubila-tion and even the Neutral Press Icoked upon It as the first sign of returning sense on the Allied side.MeanwMle the Sand and Gravel dispute continues spasmodioally to form the subject cf articles in the Press.     Little progress seems to have been made to the solution of the problem and the Dutch Commercial telegrams, with some exceptions, are still held up.     Mr. J. Louden has, in a speech in the Chamber, expressed the willingness of the  * Netherlands Government to refer the dispute to arbitration on eon-dition that the British Government first shall withdraw the embargo on Cables.     It is hardly necessary to say that each day that this state of affairs continues renders our propaganda work in Holland more difficult.   Since the cables were stopped it is noticeable that the Press almost universally has shown a certain 1 Schadenfreude1 in regard to the collapse of   Russia, the disaster on the Isonzo front and the set-back which the British troops experienced near Canbrai. Some of the better class Dutch newspapers seem to gloat over the possibility that the entrance of America into the war has come too late to be of material advantage to the Entente, and the pro-German
1,1175Press are already speculating on the chances of the proclamation ofia German peace from Paris.Generally speaking the Dutch press up to the 10th inst. appears to contain little of interest.     There is one exception.     In the Telegraaf of the 4th inst. Professor Niermeyer calls attention to the really appalling condition of things in Belgium.     He suggests that all the Neutral States should collectively draw the attention of Germany to the matter and propose the establishment of an Intdr-national Neutral Commission of Enquiry.     In an article in the organ of the Leqgue of Neutral Countries M. Troelstra, the well-known Socialist, also discusses the sufferings which Belgium has endured from the Germans who, he states, have murdered 5000 civilians and burnt some 2600 houses.
