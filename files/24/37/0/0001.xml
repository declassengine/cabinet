SECRET.Tiflis. 19th December, 1917.No, 9.   Your instrocrtlona have beejr reoeiv*d from General Shore  , Please inform -General jd Jeoandjplft- at j?etrograd that I leave for &quot; Rostow to-day and will await his instructions there.    Ifter further consideration of the position here I am more confirmed in my opinion that it will not &quot;be possible to rely on the transport capacity of the Caucasus railways until some definite military authority, preferably foreign, is established along the whole railway.More than one third traffic from North of the Caucasus consists of returning soldiers, who remain in Baku Tiflis and intermediate towns where they are fed and clothed by Army Authorities.     I an to-day informed by the General Manager that during the last few days the movement of soldiers from the front has greatly increased and sufficient waggons are not available for their removal.     Engine drivers refuse lo take service until wages due are paid and money is not now available from the new Caucasus Government for railway purposes.     There will be complete, stoppage of traffic weat of Baku if money does not arrive shortly.     Construction on all the light railways which lead towards the front has now been stopped because of the shortage of money and the disorganization among workmen,      he two feet six gauge line which runs from Sarikamish f$ to jjjraerum has been prolonged to (l group undecipherable)xx W l% fifsy fix kilometres West.     The three feet six line from Chtachti xx running along the North of Lake Van has been completed for a length of two hundred and five kilometres to Karakillissa    the branch from this line to armies on Lake Va&amp;n takes off from Bavuk xx and has only forty five kilometres completed of the total length of one hundred and fifty-nine.     Owing to the occupation by Turks of Zcba xx to the South the two feet six gauge from Haiderabad on Lake Urumiyah for 45 kilometres is now being lifted. When I lately visited Batum and Poti * I found the transport situation on the Black Sea more disorganized than that of the railways.The Commandant of the Port of Batum was removed ftn the day of my visit by Sailors&apos; Committee.     Steamers only travel by night to avoid Submarines and they take about a fortnight to get from ifavorossisk to Batum which is actually a 24 hours voyage.    x. online: and off loading operations are leisurely done by soldiers,&quot;    The general opinion is that no improvement will be possible until the Black Sea Pleei is controlled by some foreign authority.     Certainly sea transport c?annov be oounted on under existing conditions if it should be required for the transfer of the Roumanian Army.     I have to-day handed to the local management proposals for improving the working conditions on the railway, a copy of which I am forwarding to you.    The..... mostfk Brigadier General De Candoile. ordered South byNo.2489 ef 15th December,^/-&quot;: o. r&amp;/.)f K^rakillissa. About 7Q miles East of Lake Van.

most serious problem is the (9) traotion situation.     105 out of a total of 600 (t) tractors are (two groups omitted) repair and the percentage increases monthly on account of accidents and small output.It is now as difficult for the management to control the railway workmen as it is for the officers to control the soldiers.1Until conditions change considerably no improvement can be expected.
