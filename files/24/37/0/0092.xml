Colonel Jones(Tills Document isjhe Property of His Britannic.IV^ajo.?ty&apos;.-:- Government)/yEBCRUITING- OF LABOUR FBOM THE DOMINIONS AND COLONIES.      f f^ Zyx 283MQX)^f\ Noto by the Controller af Timber Supplies T&apos;J: lc.. &quot;With reference tc paper C-*T0 2380, I feel that the pro-pesal that the Ministry of Labour should be the sole authority as regards such recruiting is quite acceptable, but that that Depart-ment should net necessarily become the sole recruiters provided -that all recruiting arrangements, receive their concurrence.2.   It should also be made clear that military units like the Canadian forestry Corps and the Newfoundland larestry Corps are excluded.3.   With regard to recruiting for timber work, it is very necessary that the concurrence of the Timber Department should be obtained in any scheme the Ministry of Labour may carry out. If the matter is dealt with by the Ministry without full cc-opera-tr q with this Department it is, I am afraid, inevitable that arrangements will he made which will not adequately.meet our needs.  Difficulties of this kind have already arisen in connec-tion with the recruiting of some 4,000 Portuguese for timber work in this country. It has recently been suggested by the Ministry of Labour that this Department should provide a representative to be attached to the recruiting organisation in Portugal.It is important that the men selected should be specially allotted to this Department before embarkation so that weknow er-set.lv what men era coming in time to make arrangements   at this end instead of having some thousands of men, it may be, handed to us on arrival.   With regard to pay it would be of assistance if the men were under a contract to leave a proportion cf their wages in the hands of the Department to be paid out subject to satisfactory conduct for a specified time.4.   The suggestion in the 3rd para, of the Second Memorandum that the men from abroad should work for the British rate of
: wages-current in any district would not be possible of fulfil -ment in the.^case-af- e^ert&apos;^imber^oTrker^, ^whose rates of wag^ at home would be most probably higher than any-ohia jmng.in&apos; this country.5.    Any arrangement of the kind suggested by the iiinistry of Labour should not be such as to debar this Department from making independent arrangements, provided -m keep-the^Hinistry^yf. Labour advised and obtain their concurrence.    An important example is that of the 10 New England Sawmill Units for which : arrangements were made direct.    At tha time this Department was under the war Office, Colonel Wylie, of that department, en-quired whether. American Lumbermen could not be recruited and the idea was taken up enthusiastically in the New ijngland States and the Massachusetts Committee of Public Safety not only raised the men to the number of 350 required for 10 Sawmill Units, but provided the entire equipment of mills, horses, etc, as .a voluntary offering for the benefit of the Allied cause,    The men are under individual contracts with H.M.Government.    Tho^ 10 Units have now been at work about 4 months and are doing splendid work, their output of timber being remarkably high. We should on no account be debarred from making such a satisfactory arrangement in another quarter if the opportunity should arise.6.     In para. 5 of the 1st memorandum reference is made to. the importation by the Timber Supplies Department of labour from Canada,     It is assumed that this has reference to a small number, about 70, of civilian Canadians recruited by Captain Midford under authority given before I assumed control of the Department.     Since the matter was brought to my notice I cancelled this arrangement and it should be made clear that no recruiting of this, character is.now permitted.J, B.
