THIS- DQOIMIT IS TH3 PROPERTY OF HIS BKITAIII3JC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYgHlJIIHlIIT)f1 SB C g B T c GuTc-3198W Am g___G A B I II 3 T;,CAMBRAI IJjQuTHY.. Memorandum by General Smuts(Circulated with reference to War Cabinet 309Minute 8).I have gone through the papers with some care in order to find out If anybody, and if so who, was to blame for the disaster on our right on 30th November which resulted in the sudden capture of Gonnelieu, Vilers-Guislain and Gouzeaucourt. I proceed to note down my impressions for the information cf the.&quot;War Cabinet.The general disposition of our troops on that day was quite sound, as appears from the fact that the two principal attacks of the enemy at Bourlon ..&apos;ood and near Masnieroe were both beaton back with great slaughter, and in the third and smaller attack to the right, in which the enemy had such remarkable success, the attacking fend defending forces wera fairly equally matched, two of our Divisions (the 12th and 55th) being opposed to two enemy Divisions with elements of a third.       That under such conditions of virtual equality in numbers the attack should have succeeded is most surprising, not only on general grounds, but because all our experience in this war points to the great advantage of the defensive.The. evidence is fairly clear as to what really happened, and the only difficulty arises as to the explanation of these facts, which does not appear clearly from tho evidence collected in the inquiry.     The extreme rapidity with which the attack progressed and the short *.time taken to reach Gouzeauc :urt proves that there was some very serious breakdown and that the opposition met with could not have boon serious,  -This is. corroborated by th&amp;
-     *statements of the German&quot;prisoners.who declare that they met with very little resistance, that the barbed wire entanglements gave them no trouble and that, with the exception of desultory machine-gun fire in some places, practically no fighting was put up by the defence, i.it,&apos;.i any serious resistance our advanced troops could easily have held the enemy back until the supports, which were rightly placed, could have arrived,,   As it was, the front p rts were overpowered without any resistance after a very short artillery preps ration by the enemy, and the supports unexpectedly found the enemy on them before they knew what had happened in front of them.   This was not due to any surpriseV   As an attack had bean expected as early as the 28th November the villages had boon specially strengthened with mschine-guns, and special orders had been issued to the troops to bo on the alert, and these orders were repeated for the night of the E9-30th November,In spite of fell, however, what happened was that a short and intense bombardment destroyed the wire entangle-monts,that the enemy then poured without resistance into two ravines which led behind our lines, that as soon as our troops found the enemy behind as well as in front of them they either surrendered or retire? without resistance, and that.the machine gunners, who should have held thoir positions (as the German machine gunners do on these ocea-sions) to the bitter end, retired with the retreating infantry.     The guns which for topographical reasons     .-wore plaoed very far forward were easily captured, and could, not be used to stem the tide, and the situation got com-pletely out of control until the enemy had penetrated in a very short time as far as Gouzeaucourt.
.hat is the explanation of all this?     It is clear from the foregoing that the dispositions of the Higher Command, Army or Corps Command wore not to blame., and that everything had been done to meet such an attack as actually occufree       The breakdown may be duo to either of two causes,    first,  that the subordinate local commanders actually in command on the scene of action lost their heads, allowed the situation to degenerate into confusion, which then spread to the roar end the neighbouring units; or second, that the trouble was still lower down with the junior officerc, 11.0,0s.., *?nd men.On the first possible cause no evidence has been collected, and it is therefore impossible to come to a decision...    hut after reading through the papers with some care I am not at all convinced that tho brigade and   . regimental commands are free of blame in the matter, as it is difficult to conceive that with due alertness and activity on their part the situation oould have got so completely out of hand.     However, I hesitate to express an opinion in the absence of evidence, and hope the Commander-in-Chief will himself taxe up the matter as a subject of more detailed inquiry.The second explanation is that which is suggested in the records of the inquiry.     It is pointed out that the 55th Division, for instance, which had hitherto borne a&quot;. very high reputation, had some two months bolero lost about 7,000 officers and men in the fighting further  forth j and that the Division hod been filled up with fresh drafts. The suggestion is that in regard to the younger officers JKCoOSv, and men and especially in regard to the machine gunners the standard of training had not been such, &amp;a to qualify them for the sort of situation which arose with the German onslaught on 30th November, .
If this explanation is correct, ^nd it is the only-one su ??ested on the oaoers and evidence collected, the position is a very serious and disquieting one.     The King of Italy explained to us at Pescheira that the Italian-debacle on the Julian front was due to the inexperience and inadequate training of the junior officers, ft.OaQs. , and men which fitted them to hold trenches and make a simple advance but did not fit them to manoeuvre or conduct a proper retreat after a reverse, with the result that after the break through of the enemy at one point the Italian retreat scon degenerated into a rout,     If the Gambrai reverse is, as appears from these papers9 a similar ease on a much smaller scale, it cannot but raise anxiety now that we shall probably be bn the defensive for a good while on the Western front, and the enemy may have been encouraged to expect a repetition on a larger scale of what has happened at Gambrai.     The lesson to draw is that we must devote more time and attention to the training of our trcops and especially of our junior officers and IkCcOs,(Initialled.)     JaC0Sc.
Memorandum by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff,2.p. 4/19. 1-. 1.18.Secretary of St at jtXoJLJfiE.&apos; :I forward the Report of the Enquiry into the events $t the Battle of Cambr&amp;I, which 1 have received from   Field-Marshal Sir DouglaeL Haig.   It has been carefully considered by. myself, the Director of Military Operations, and Major.-General Callwell, with the following resultl..No report has been received from LieutGeneral Sir W. Pulteney,-who commanded one of the two Corps which:.were engaged in the operations,.and therefore we desire it to be understood that we may have further observations to make on receipt of his report, which has been called for..2-i The chief podutu which appear to require consideration are:-(i)     V/as Sir Douglas Haig justified in undertaking the attack on November 20th with the forces then at his disposal? - (ii)   Was Sir Douglas Haig- justified in. continuing his offensive operations beyond the 48 hours originally fixed as the limit-if the success gained in that period did not appear to-promise large results?(iii) What were the causes of the failure to defeat that portion of. the enemy.5 s attack of the 30 th of November which fell,upon the right of the line,  and to whom, . if to anyone,, does blame attach?3.: As regards (i). we are of opinion that&apos;, the attack on November 20th was justifiable in vi ew of the information, in Sir Douglas liaig-s possession of the enemy* s strength, at the point of attack,  and that the operations were well planned and executed,.
4. As regards (ii), we are opinion that the success gained in the first 48 hours warranted the continuance of the operations. From the information in Sir Douglas Eaig&apos;o possession he was justified in considering that he would he able to secure and hold the high ground about Eourlon Wood.    If this high ground had been left in the enemy&apos;s; posses sion at this stage of thebattle,  our troops would have been badly placed for defensive purposes, and some withdrawal from the ground won wouldprobably have been necessary-; , The extent of the success gainedin the-first 48 hours, therefore appears to us to justify SirDouglas Haig-s decision to continue the battle with the objectof gaining complete possession of this high ground,  and thefact that the enemyfs main, attack on the 30th November    vasdelivered against this&apos;sector of the front-and was successfully .repulsed shows, in our opinion, that this decision was   correct,.5/     - As regards (iii), . the reports of the variops commandersforwarded by Sir Douglas llaig indicate that an attack by thex? nenemy: on or about the 30th November was not/-expected,  and; they show that steps had been taken by those commanders to meet the eventuality,    The local commanders in the portion of the front where the serious break-through occurred appear to have been vigilant and to&apos; have personally examined the situation alorg the fronts- for which they were responsible,  shortly before the enemy, delivered his assault,.   LieutGeneral&apos; Sir. T. Snow,  commanding the army-corps which was holding that portion of our original line which the enemy, penetrated,.- states that he is satisfied that the defences were adequate, considering their extent and the strength of the garrison holding them.. As stated above, no report is forwarded from Lieut\-General Sir V/. Lulteney, commanding-the. army-corps alongside of General SnoWs, -of which the front was alsc penetrated but we have considered-the&apos;reports- of his--
Divisional Generals.   This Corps had gained a considerable amount of ground during the offensive of ten    iays earlier, hut the Divisional Commanders seem to have been satisfied that they could hold their&quot; new positions if attacked, and these positions had already been placed in a state of defence.6.   The enemy7 s successful attack fell upon the 55th Division holding the old line on the left of General Snow&apos;a corps, and upon the ISth Division holding the new lino on the right of General Pulteney&apos;s corps, and. it moreover fell main3.y upon the left Of the 55th Division end the right of the 12th Division, i.e; about the locality where -      old and new line met and where the two Corps met.   This could not fail to have been an- advantage to the enemy and a corresponding disadvantage to us in the subsequent fighting.   The 20th and 29th Divisions on the left of the 12th Division may bo said to have fairly well held their ground,  although eventually obliged to fall back owing to what&quot;had occurred on their right.   It seems clear from the reports of the Divisional Commanders of the 55th and 12th Divis-ions end of their Brigadiers, as also from the reports of the prisoners who were captured from the 24th and 38th German divis-ions which attacked in this area, that our infantry and machine gunners did not at certain points offer so determined an opposition to the enemy&apos;s onset as the Generals commanding were entitled to expect,and that there was a certain lack of efficiency in subordinate leadership.,   To this is to be attributed the loss of a large number of guns as well as tho serious confusion that obviously supervened at the front in this parb of our line; owing to the lie of the-ground, the guns to be used effectively had to be in somewhat forward positions., but they do not seem to have been/-duly exposed.
7.   Although the attack of the 30th November did not come as a surprise at,the section of the line where the enemy broke through, it is clear that the local Commanders,  as also the troops in rear, were taken unawares during the opening stages of the combat owing to the extreme rapidity of the enemy1s advance.   rj:&apos;his rapidity of advance was the direct consequence of our troops in front line at certain points failing to offer so stubborn a resistsues as might reasonably have been expected. After local penetrations the enemy&apos; s detachments spread outwards taking our troops on either flank in rear and compelling these also to fall back or else to surrender. . Thus   there came about a break through on a front of several hundred yards which reacted again rjtill further to the flanks.   The reports of some of the German prisoners taken here are to the effect that their success Y/as easily gained at the outset and that the fighting was not of a determined character.    They mention that the wire gave them little trouble; but our. own experience in attack is that a well directed artillery or trench mortar bombardment will&quot; destroy the most elaborate wire entanglements8.   we can see no reason for thinking that;-everythingpossible had not been done to place the newly captured line in aseffective a state of defence as time had permitted.   As regardsthat portion of the old line, held by the 55th Division, whichwaspierced, it suggests itself to us that the concentration of ourresources upon offensive operations during the past year had re-suited in these defences heing less complete than would otherwisehave been the case.   This portion of the front lay- in territoryabandoned by the enemy; so that new systems-of defensive lines,new communications, and new accommodation   for the troops, had tobe constructed while great offensive battles were in progress onother parts of the front.    The 55th Division was holding 11,000yards
III -yards of front, which.is not-an excessive, length for a Divisionat normal strength occupying a carefully prepared defensive position.,     This particular Division had however &quot;been heavily engaged in Flanders in August and September and. had. suffered great losses during those two months;    it therefore necessarily contained an inordinate proportion of newly joined d?.*fts.    It furthermore was considerably below strength.9.     Wd attribute the failure to hold firmly the right of General&apos; Byng*s battle-line on the 30th November.mainly to the fact, that the units .involved were considerably-below.establish-nent,  to the fact that they had.not long previously been en-gaged in arduous offensive operations in Flanders and were very-tired, and to the fact that there had been no opportunity for training the new drafts and the subordinate Commanders &apos; adeq.uat ely.10,     The dispositions of the reserves appear to have been well-considered and suitable.     This is indeed proved by the rapidity with which they reached the point of danger and drove back the enemy from great part of the ground which he had gained. It is noteworthy that none of the local Commanders appear to have considered that they were too weak to meet an attack, and that none of them asked for reinforcements prior to the 30th of November.-  11.     A risk was taken by Sir Douglas.Haig in allotting a somewhat extensive front to troops in the condition described above.     But some risks must be taken by Commanders in defence, in order to be strong for attack, and we do not consider that, in this, case, and viewingtethe circumstances as they appeared at the time, the rink taken was undueV-AA:Aa;A ^
12,      The most important lesson taught by the events of the 30th of November is that It is of vital importance to afford our troops - and in particular our subordinate, commanders - the fullest-possible opportunities for training.(Signed)     Wi       R0B3KT30H.Forwarded as directed by Cabinet to General Smuts.(Initialled)        D43rd January, 1918.

(Appendix :D&apos;)*5.   After consideration of all the factors I find no reason to criticise adversely the dispositions made, which in my opinion were adequate to meet an attack.of the atfengiii anticipated and actually experienced.     I further consider that,, if there was m:i sealculation, it Was not of auoh a nature as to. reflect adversely on the competence of the Commanders concerned..     As a matter of fact, no specific request for more troops to meet the expected attack was made either by the Ariny. or by the Army Corps, Divisions, and Brigades concerned.6.   whether the break on our front was due to the :fighting value cf the troops at. that point being below the average or to the task assigned to them.being greater than they could reasonably be expected to carry out, are matters whffiah, in the nature of things it is impossible to determine. Risks have to be taken in.reducing force at some.points in order to be strong at others, and every superior Commander has to take these risks- on as close a calculation as he can make of the probable action of the eneiny*Our surprise attack of the 20th Was intended to take advantage of the enemy having weakened himself on the CAMBRAI front, and we succeeded in putting in a superiority of 9. to 5 Infantry Divisions on that   occasion, without counting our   Cavalry Divisions and the Tanks.On the 30th the enemy brought 13 divisions (8 in line and 5 in reserve] against my 10 (8 in line and 2 in reserve), exclusive of tanks *I consider that the risk taken was legitimate, and that. With this margin Of superiority the enemy should not have- succeeded in penetrating any part of our defences.7.,   Whatever view may be held on the foregoing, 1 feel,, after careful consideration, that all blame for the mishap of November 30th, must rest on my shoulders..     It was I who. decided on the 22.no that the BOURDON position should be attacked and occupied, in the belief that the enemy&apos;s forces in. the defensive sector- lying to the North-west as far as the SMSEE River would *fi.nd- their commu.ni.catIons cut and- so be forced to withdraw.   ; Tne ovroupation of this position at&apos; once increased our front and. threw extra work on our troops^    As
events on the 30th show, many of the. men were very tired and unable to resist the enemy1 s bl^w, as 1. belie ve they could have done had they been fresher,(Sd) D..

Appendix A.Report by Sir .&apos;D. Haig summafizing &quot;the operations between &quot;November 20th and December 7th,. 1917..1.    The general object of -the operations&quot;douth-west ofcomhination with a large nurnher of Tanks to pierce the HIHDSFBURG system between the CANAL de l&apos;ESCAUT and the CANAL du NORD, and thus compel the enemy to withdraw from the salient between the CANAL du NORD and the SCARPE.   With this in view,  arrangements were made for rapidly exploiting the initial success by Cavalry and a force of all arms so as to occupy the quadrilateral marked by the CANAL du NORD.  theSEN SEE River/ and CANAL de l&apos;ESCAUT. ... It was hoped that the town of .GAM3RAI might be surrounded ana isolated by the Cavalry before the enemy could bring reinforcements of any serious strength to the threatened position.   The capture of CAMBRAI would destroy the enemy&apos;s system of command throughout&apos; the CAMBRAI&apos;. Group sector^  while the cutting of the railways leading into CAMBRAI from south, east and north would render the- concentration of hie reserves both slow and precarious.    Considerable strategic results were therefore possible. If this part of the operation proved successful. The first main objective,., however, was the high ground at BOURDON. Wood,&apos; and careful arrangements were made for its early capture... With that position in our., hands the communications of the, ARRAS Group of divisions would be interrupted and all the enemyss defences between the CANAL du NORD and the SENSES-River; would be turned,.possible for forty-eight hours- which period was -calculated as&quot;the minimum&apos; necessary for.the arrival of fresh German reserves..   Failing adequate, success within forty-eight hours, it was intended to close down the/operations andCAMBRAI *r/a-s by means of a surprise attack acting inThe intention&apos; wasto operate as actively as
concentrate on establishing the best winter position on such ground as had been captured..2.     The actual course of events after the attack was launched showed *that the objects aimed at were well within the practical scope of the operation as planned.   It had., however, been calculated from the first that the equivalent of one or two Divisions would be available in the CAMBRAI area to reinforce at short notice the MASNIERES - BSAUR1V0IR line east of the CANAL de 1-ESCAdT,   As events turned out, a considerable part of the 107th Division, fresh from the Russian front, proved to be in CAMBRAI at the time of our attack.    Troops of this Division and resting battalions from divisions in the line were rapidly thrown into the last trench system south-west of CAMBRAI in time to prevent their capture by the 29th Division,    Some very gallant fighting for these trenches took place on the afternoon of the 20th and morning of the 21st, but the enemy&apos;s opposition proved too strong, and by the evening of the .21st it was clear that no possibility any longer existed of enveloping CAMBRAI from the south.,3.     The enemy&apos;s anxiety for CAMBRAI had led him, however,  to throw the greater part of the reserves first available into the defence of that town.   The British troops were therefore able, though prevented from advancing east of: the CANAL de l&apos;ESCAUT.,  to make good progress towards the BOURLON - FONTAINE Ridge with the result that at the end of forty-eight hours they held NOYELLES., CANTAING., FONTAINE and the- southern outskirts of BOURLON Wood.   Only one fresh German division had been Identified between the CANAL de l&apos;ESCAUT and the CANAL du NORD by the morning of the 22nd. At the same time reports received from the sectors south of the River: SCARPS&apos; showed signs that the enemy was considering withdrawal from his existing line, which had now become a
pronounced salient with- the main approaches thereto under the fire of our guns.. The.roads leading to the village of PELVES wore, for instance,, destroyedby mines, - and prisoners taken in the BULLECOURT - QJJEANT Sector reported that no food had reached them, for 36 hours.. Prisoners also reported that they had been standing to arms and ready to march for some hours in anticipation of orders to withdraw. The reason for the anxiety of the German Command regarding these sectors was palpable.   With BOURBON in our possession, we overlooked and should be able to deny to the enemy the use of the AUBIGFY-au-B A$ - CAMBHAI main line of railway and also the AUBIGNY -au-E AC - MARQUION main line.   We also overlooked the crossing at ARLEUX.   The whole of the field railway system of the Germans between the SCARPE and MOEUVRES depended upon these lines, and there did not appear to be any direct way by which they could deflect their field communl--cations to their moan railway system north of the SENSES *In these circumstances it. seemed likely that the prosecution of our advance in the BOUKLON Sector would compel the enemy to withdraw rapidly from the whole of his salient -between the Canal du NORB and the SCARPE.    I therefore &apos; decided after consultation with General.- Byng that the situation justified a continuance of the operations in this sector beyond the. 43 hours originally intended, - even though further progress&apos; north of BOUtLON would temporarily accentuate the salient created by our advance and increase the length of &quot; line to be held by our troops,4.     In the course- of the 22nd the enemy succeeded in  &apos; recapturing the village of FONTAINE, but an attack by fresh troops on the morning of the 23rd gave us possession- of the greater part of BOURLON Wood and part of BOURLON Village.
It proved impossible, however, tb press the attack suffice ly far to secure the .BOURLON&apos;FONTAINE Ridge,     The enemy was therefore still able to concentrate for attack beyond our observation north of the ridge, and from the 23rd onwards he threw Increasing numbers of troops into this sector to dispute our possession of BOURLON wood and hill.   Heavy fighting ensued, which gave him no advantage but showed him determined to regain control, if possible, of the whole of BOURLON Ridge and. thus avoid the dangerous situation in which he would be placed if the ridge re-mained entirely in cur &apos; hands.       In the course of this fighting an attack delivered by our troops on the morning of the 27th so far increased our hold upon the wood and ridge as ,to justify the belief that it would be possible tc hold these features agains&apos;t the strong attacks which would undoubtedly be made.The dispositions made to meet the expected attacks were based upon the fact that all indications pointed tothe FONTAINE - BOURLON ridge as the enemy&apos;s chief   object-tneive .     V/hlle comparatively quiet on both/&apos;flanks , his infantry and artillery showed increasing activity on the BOURLON front, and fresh troops were being concentrated there in increasing numbers. In view of these indications our own infantry at .&apos;. OURLON were reinforced pending relief by several regiments of dismounted.&apos;-cavalry, and by the 30th three fresh infantry divisions were put into the line between CANTAING and the Cabal du NOEL..   The re-serves were also disposed to defeat any progress Yfhich the enemy might succeed in making between CJuiiVECOEUK and the Canal du NOLI).    On the other hand,  the extreme right flank south.of TWENTY-TWO Ravine was not reinforced, because the troops in this sector v/ere holding our original trench system and were therefore in possession of., defences which had been organised againBt attack for several months.
andb.      These anticipations were completely borne out by events except in regard to the resistance expected from the defences on our extreme right flank.     The main weight of the enemy&apos;s attack - four divisions in front line and three divisions in support - was thrown against the BOURLGN Sector, and was heaten off with very heavy loss.   Another strong attack with two divisions in front line and one division in support against the right flank on the Canal de ..&apos;nSCAUT was also completely stopped.   Farther South, however, a weaker attack on a broader front with two divisions in front line and elements of one division in support succeeded in penetrating the strong positions held by us over the BANTEUX Ravine and south of TWENTY-TWO Ravine, where we held our original trench system as before the advance on the 20th.   Our counter-attacks recover-ed part of the lost ground during that day and the following morning, but the complete recovery of VILLERS G.UISLAIN, G0NN3LIEU and our old.front line would have involved losses which were not considered worth the results to be attained. It was therefore decided to rest content with the existing flank on WELSH and QtXENTIN ridges, and to avoid loss in the narrow salient thus created north of the line VILLERS PLOUICH -HAVRINCOURT by withdrawal from the BOURLON to the ELESGJJIEREE position.   This movement was successfully carried out between December 4th and 7th.6.      The final results of the operations may be summed up asfollows:-(l)      We havedemonstrated that the strongest possible defences made by the Germans may be completely pierced in a single day. given, careful and secret preparation.   The sr.e.rr.y&apos;s defences between the Canal de l&apos;ESCAUT and the Canal du Nerd consisted of two carefVAly sited and strongly fortified - systems,  the HINDENBURG front lire system and the &quot;HlhlililNBITRG support system., separated by a distance of about 3,000 yards0    Thsfiout. line system was covered by out post trenches almost as heavily wired as the KINESNBUEG Line itself, and the ground between the two. systems, front and support, was further defended by intermediate positions
and switch lines with diagonal belts of wire designed to bring any troops which might have penetrated the front system under intense flanking machine-gun fire.     The filNDENBUHG system at this point included four fortified villages - LA VACQ,USHIiii, KIEACOUAT, PLSSQUliPaHC;and HAVAINCOURT - and was covered by -artillery positions so sited and protected as to make their penetration and capture a task of especial, difficulty,   These defences suffered from none of. the disadvantages common to trench systems establish-ed in or close behind the line of battle; on the coh-trary, they were sited, dug and wired in complete tranquility before the -German withdrawal in the Spring.   No positions could, therefore, well have been more strongly prepared; but the whole of them wefce captured and cleared by 12 noon on the day of attack with the exception of the village of FIaSQUIEaES, which was not captured until 7 a.m. next day.(ii) - 12,000 yards of the HODaNEURG ayatem, front line and support, remain in our hands.   On all this front the enemy will be compelled to dig winter positions- in haste on very disadvantageous ground, particular-ly as regards, communications and artillery positions(iii) .In addition, we have&apos; inflicted on tne enemy a loss- of over 11,000 prisoners and&apos;13&apos;6 guns, including 40 heavy pieces.iv) The general effect of the above must be to engendera feeling of insecurity in the enemy&apos;s Higher Command regarding &quot;sectors of his front which he has hitherto regarded as secure.   Any sector may be attacked wihh jpqual suddenness.   He cannot in future thin out the infantry and artillery on any front,, however,  quiet without a risk which-he had never contemplated before . the 20th November.(v) On our side, on the other hand, we now have the advantage cf a new feeling of confidence in our tanks-, which runs all through the Army.   Before November 20th very few Commanders believed in &quot;tanks, and the troops took little account of them.   Their-value is hew so universally recognised that any future operations v/ith tanks, will be&apos; undertaken with a feeling of great confidence by all ranks-.(vi) The influence of the CAMBRIA battle upon operations in&apos;Italy.cannot be.estimated with precision,&apos; but that it did affect them-considerably&apos;seems probable.   On November 20th the Germans had 12 fresh divisions in reserve upon the Western front In addition to 32 divisions in reserve which had been engaged in battle within a period of two months. The battle of Cambria made large inroads into these reserves at a time when the Germans were still maintaining a large concentration in Flanders.   There is evidence of at&apos; least one division^ the 206th, which believed itself under orders for Italy being diverted to the CAMBRIA front, and it is reasonable to infer that the possibility of further concentration against Italy, which was certainly open to the German High Command before November 20th,was suspended for a period of t*0 weeks at the critical moment when the Italians were making their first real stand on the Piave- -line.      The moral effect of the successat   Cambria   upon   all   the   Allied
23rd December, 1917,Armies, in Italy as elsewhere, was also without . doubt considerable.(vii)       Against these gains we have to set a loss ofabout 5,000 yards of our own front line&apos; South cf LA VACQ,tXiRIE, about 6,000 prisoners, and 166 guns: (sd)    I). hAIO.
reproducedAppendix B.1&apos; -REPORT&apos; BY THIRD iRlIY CQMilAHDSR.Gt H o Q.&quot;In accordance with your instructions I forward herewithreports hy the Corps Commander of the VII Corps and of G.0s,C55th, 12th, 20th, and 29th Divisions on the action of the30th November, 1917.Ill Corps has been withdrawn from the line and theCorps Commander is at present on leave-     I have thereforenot been able tc obtain his remarks on the reports of the12th, 20th and 29th Divisions.The attack of the enemy on the morning of the 30th November was in no sense a surprise.       Intelligence reports for the two days previous to the attack had indicated -abnormal railway movement both in DOUAI - CAMBRAI - DETAIN areas and in the IE CATSAU - BUSIGUY - and BEAUREVOIR -VIILERS OUTREAUX - IS VERGISS area.     Considerable movement of troops had been observed for some days opposite the VII Corps front,     Reinforcements in the M0SUVR3S sector and and increase of artillery had heen noticed.     Four new wireless groups were also heard between 27th and 29th November t-o north of CAMBRAI, one in the WAL III COURT area and one in the BEAUREVOIR area - the preponderance of wireless activity being on ths front MASNIBRES - QUSANT,The Commanders Of the VII, III, and IV Corps had realised the probability of such an attack as was actually made.     Troops had been warned, and extra machine gun defence hatf been established in the villages of VIIIERS GUISLAIN and G0NN3LISU.
The break, through on the part of the enemy up the BANTEUX RAVINE and T SETY TWO RAVINE enabled the enemy to attack these two villages from the rear and flanks as well as the fr^ont, and their great superiority in numbers permitted the Germans to exploit their success in the direction of GAUCHE WOOD, GOUZEAUCOUET and LA VACQUERIS.Further to the Norths though the enemy gained possession of the BONAVIS SPUR and LATSAU V;OOD his attack was held up by the defence of LA VACQUERIS and WELCH RIDGE and all attempts at breaking the line by IM.SNIERES and RUMILLY were frustrated-.In anticipation of the enemy developing some such action as actually occurred, I ha^ arranged for the Divisions in immediate reserve to be disposed where I considered they would be best situated to assist at Whatever portion of the salient held, by the troops under ray command, might most require re-inforcement after the enemy attack had developed...     In making these dispositions, full consideration was given to the possibility cf an attack towards the line 3PEEY -.GOTJ3EAUCOURT, and. the speed With ?/hich the enemy brea^ through was localised and driven back shows that these dispositions.fulfilled the object for which they were made,- I regret the. loss of the guns, which could not be withdrawn owing to the speed of the enemy advance,.   The Heavy and Siege guns at   VILLERS GUISIAIN end GOHNEIIEU were closer to the front line than is normally the case.    I am, however, satisfied that the necessity of enfilading the BANTEUX VALLEY, combined with the local features.of the ground, did not permit of their being sited further back, and at the same time-obtaining the necessary range to protect adequately our front on the B0HA7IS RIDGE.
The enemy claim to have taken 9^000 prisoners, ofThe total numbor/missing since operations started on 20th November can be calculated in round figures as 300 officers and .10,000 other ranks.     Of these, 73 officers and 2,429 other ranks were reported missing before the action of 30th November and these figures are incomplete.   It is there-fore probable that not more than 220 officers and 7,250 other ranks were missing after the action of the 30th November. Of these many would bo killed, - at an estimate, say one in five or six.   I calculate that tho prisoners taken by the enemy on the 30th November amounted therefore to some 175 officers and 6.,000 to 7,000 other ranks, a portion of whom were non-combatants .Reasons .    I attribute the reason for the local success on the part of the enemy to one cause and one alone, namely - lack of training on the part of junior officers and N.co3   and men. As stated above I estimate that the number of prisoners captured by the enemy in the area of their success .amounted to about six or seven thousand, of whom some five hundred or moro were non-combatants (road makers, railway men etc.). This number of fighting men alone should have been sufficient to have at least delayed any thrust on the part of the enemy sufficiently to allow the reserved&apos; of infantry and cavalry to be brought up to the vital spot .Individual acts of gallantry and resource were plentiful and the old   -divisions of the Expeditionary Force stood tho test as well a3 heretofore - but the fact remains that some divisions were over-run and that their powers of defence were not fully realised.   In this respect the action of the machine gunners is conspicuous.- VILLERS GUISLAIN and GONNELIEU had heen-turned into strong defended localities with machine guns sweeping all the approaches but In the criticalmoment
(Sd..)    J, Byng.General,        ,  ... Commanding Third Army18th December ,1917 ,moment these run chine gunners&apos;were carried away by tJae-T-etdi^ment. of the infantry from the front trenches.With very few. exceptions the artillery remained fighting their guns to the last , but the machine gunner did not appear to have the same confidence in his weapon .. The cause is not far to seek.     The German machine gunners are the pick of the infantry and therefore a corps d1&quot; Elite.    Our machine gunners on the other hand are enlisted as such and are not brought up with the same esprit de corps that is found in a regiment .The gallantry of the young soldiers was conspicuous on November 20th when all was going well with them, but the amount of discipline they hod imbibed could not stand the ordeal of the heavy massed attacks.of the enemy in superior numbers on the 3Cth NovemberThe remedy seems to be a longer period of training and in this connection it is to be noted that in the Guards where the course is longer /there is no likelihood of any lack of staunch behaviour .

The rctual frontage held by the 55th, 12th, 20thand 29th Divisions on 29/30th November,, measured in the manner normally adopted was55th Division - 11..000 yards.12th Division - 4&apos;, 800 &quot; &quot;20th Division - 3,500    &quot;     ) on main line29th Division - 3,-500    tt     ) of resistance..2,  - It is difficult to give - a definite statement as to-the length of line normally assigned., to a division in similar&quot;cireumstrnccs, as so many factors bear on or eh case.. In order to release troops for offensive operations, reserve,, rest, training etc it is&quot;&apos;necessary to hold&quot; defensive fronts as lightly as isv cons.idor.cd compatible with security..  The decision as to the conditions demanded by this consideration,, will depend upon the strength,, condition and fighting qualities of the troops, the strength of the defences, the character cf the 5ground,, end tho comparative importance of the tactical features involved.   In this case, 55th Division,., concept for a minor operation against tho Knoll, carried out on 20th November in.conjunction With the main operations, had not been actively engaged since it came out of the line in . Flanders.   The front^they wore holding had been a quiet one; ana was also an organised lino with very fair wire.   The ether three- divisions, on the other hand, had&quot;all taken part in tho operations which started on 20th November, and had&quot;to consolivato tho ground which they had captured..   In connection with tads question of frontages, I may point out that 56thiithnearly captured&apos; line,1 consider that the fronteges held by those divisions wa.s not more than they could be justifiably  -expected to hold,, at any rate sufficiently to delay the enemy until tne reserve divisions could come into action&quot;.. 3* . I attach meps^ showing the defences hold by thei not      divisions -dproduced..       (a)      55th Division (Hap A.) was holding a line which h been in our possession since&quot;tho spring.   The front line on the extreme left had, howovcr^beoh swung up after the 20th November to join up with 12th Division and to shorten the line by eliminating tho&quot; existing re-entrant.   The &quot;ire and defences on this front wore good.   &quot;The front was held in posts * The normal methods of trench protection wore adopted..

Tho outpost lino consisted of short lengths of trench.   The Cemetery was fairly strongly wirod and organised for all round defence.The main line of resistance consisted of afront contij four many more.The divisional reserve consisted.of one brigade which was in R.19 rnd the pioneer battalion, two companies in C0UILL2T I00D valley, end two comprnies near GOUZaAUCOURT.(d) I regret that t hevo not been able to obtain in the&apos; time, a detailed description of the defences of 29th Division.   Tho line held by 29th Division is however shown on Mop C attached.   I saw General De Lisle pcrsonrlly one day previous to 30th ilov ember and he showed mo. his scheme of consolidation and told me that his defences woro &quot;progressing well.   As this di vi si on -practi cally hold its ground all dayI have no reason to believe thrt ils defences&apos;^ere otherwise then s rt i s f ac t or y.The position of the reserves of 29th Division is given in the report of that division forwarded to you under my G.S. 56/244 dated 13th Doc ember, 1017, which was the only copy in my possession.I attach a statement showing the strengths of the divisions on tho 30th November,&apos; end other details regarding
Fifth Army at the end of September, G.O.C. Fifth Army reported it as "a first rate division". It had, however had casualties of 305 Officers and 6,700 other ranks and had received reinforcements of 227 officers and 5430 other ranks in the two months previous to joining this Army.

5. After the unsuccessful attack on BOURLON and FONTAINE on 27th November I was obliged to relieve 62nd and Guards Divisions with the last two fresh divisions which I had immediately at hand, 47th and 59th Divisions. I had, however, previously made arrangements to bring up another fresh division by withdrawing 61st Division from the MONCHY front. On 29th November this division was concentrated in XVII Corps area and was to move to the BARASTRE area by tactical trains on 30th November. Pending its arrival I retained Guards and 62nd Divisions (which were relieved on the night 28/29th November) in immediate to the salient.

On the morning of 30th November, the reserves in Third Army area consisted of six divisions, of which five had been employed since 20th November, and 5 cavalry divisions of which four had been employed since 20th November. These reserves were disposed as follows :-

Guards Division - One brigade group at TRESCAULT.

One brigade group at METZ EN COUTURE.

One brigade group at BERTINC0URT.

62nd Division - One brigade group at K.21 central in close reserve to BOURLON position.

One brigade group at BEAUMETZ.

One brigade group at LEBUCQUIERE.

51st Division - BAISIEUX Area. ) resting and refitting.

40th Division - BASSEAU Area. )resting and reffiting.

36th Division - FOSSEUX Area. ) resting and refitting.

61st Division - Near ARRAS, under orders to move to BARASTRE area by train on 30th November.

2nd Cavalry Division - Bivouac just North of FINS.

4th Cavalry Division - ATHIES Area.

5th Cavalry Division - MONCHY LAGACHE Area.

1st Cavalry Division - BRAY Area.

3rd Cavalry Division - BERTANGLES - BEAUCOURT-SUR-L&apos;HALLUE-TALMAS Area.

6. In the absence of Lieut. General Sir W.Pulteney and Major General De Lisle I am not able to explain General De Lisle&apos;s statements that the attack came as a complete surprise. General De Lisle&apos;s Headquarters were in a quarry between G0UZEAUC0URT and VILLERS GUISLAIN and he told me personally that the enemy nearly reached his headquarters before he knew that anything had occurred. It is possible therefore that the explanation of his statement may be that no news had reached him of an enemy attack having actually started and pierced our line before the enemy was in close proximity to him.

Tho trenches in the alternative position wore o foot deep and fire-stepped.   loch picquot had a thick, belt of wire but tho wire was&apos;&quot;&apos;not continuous &quot;along the front. There wcro some deep dug-outs in both the front arid the support lines.   Tho support&quot; lino wa.s constructed behind the old Gorman wire which was&quot;in good condition.The&apos;line of the Left Brigade ran from L.17.b.55.20 to the CAMBRAI ROAD at G, 20,b. 60.20.&quot;&apos; The front line trench of this sector was in good order and continuous, but the wire botween the River 1ISCAUT and the Canal, Lu17.b.55,20 to L.17.b,35,00. was weak.   The front line wire from L.18.a.5.0*through G.13.d.00.70 &apos; G.14.C.00*00, to G*20.a.40,60, was continuous ana in good order. Ihis wire was in most places composed of two rows of trestles with concertina wire placed bctwocn the trestles.   Tho wire was weak in front of the. old front line from Go20,a,40.60 to the CAMBRAI ROAD at Gr.20.bc 60.20.   A now front line was being due; from a sap head at Go20.a.85,10,   This trench was sited behind a. belt of German wire which was in good condition.The Reserve Brigade was resting in billots and cellars in MARCOING./:   &quot; (Signed).
