Mr.I.B.Poland to the Prime Minister,Sir,In the early days of the Commission for Relief in  -Belgium, now nearly three years ago, the scope of the work the method of operation, and the safeguards in the.form of German undertakings surrounding the Ravitaillement.of the populations of the invaded territories, of Belgium&apos;and the -North of Prance were- carefully explained to you... ;We realised that your support of the work.was absolutely essential to its &apos; continuance.     You gave this support and have continued to give it, sometimes under adverse criticism.. A new and critical, situation in respect of this work has now arisen, due to the inaction of the British&apos; Government, which-failing action on the part of the officers - of the Poreign Office or the Treasury, we are - no v^f breed;to bring to you,During the early -months of the brutal submarine campaign it was impossible for us- toQ^port anything&apos;approaching the. proper ration for the .9,500/people for whose care we became the agents of&quot; the Governments and peoples of Belgium, France, Great Britain and the United. States.On the basis of restricted imports the limited sub-sidies at our disposal /sufficed for a number of months, although towards the end, frith a defioit of nearly  1,000,000 per month,In October-, owing to the enormous increase in prices and to the fact that we are at last able to iorward, something approaching an adequate ration, the cost-of the programme of imports,&apos;which after the most rigid inspection had  been approved by the British Foreign Office and the French Government as. absolutely necessary to-.Maintain national life, was&apos; found to,, reach the figure of  5,500,000 per month or $2 6 000,000,
On October  Oth, a memorandum was despatched, by the Commission to the Governments of Great Britain, Belgium end France, setting forth the -whole ,.situation as to food, ships and finance, and request was mate that adequate funds be immediately provided,.After numerous negotiations, the United States declared that it would provide in the form of loans $15,000,000 per month for expenditure in the United States, provided France and Great Britain would guarantee the European expenditures of the Relief, amounting to $11,000,000.-At a meeting on November 25th, the French Government agreedthe whole ^European cost of the Ravitaillement of the French population,? ofo&apos;ue half /the cost of the Ravitaillement of the Belgian population... provided;England would carry the other halfa   It was reqaested that the Belgian Government be allowed to allocate to the Relief the necessary funds out of the /joint loan of Frs.500,000,000. made by France &amp; Groat Britain to Belgium.In order to oversome the very difficult situa-tion regarding Guilder exchange and &quot;to &apos; furnish the Commission with the 5,000,000 guilders required for its monthly opera-tions in Holland, the French Government authorised the Director of the Commission to.effect a benevolent loan- in Holland to the amount of 60,000,000 guilders, for which it it agreed to deposit French Bons du Trasor and requested England to give a like authori-sation. and to agree to participate in the deposit of collateral, .This proposal was forwarded through the French Ambassador to the British. Government,Up to the present time, no answer has been received by the French Government, nor has the Commission for Relief been given any decision or any assistance by the British Government in the &apos; financing of this work.     We have presented to both the Foreign Off ice. and to the Treasury complete expositions of our financial situation and definite statements of what was required.to keep the work of. relief going,     &quot;&apos; &apos;Briefly,, the situation is as. follows:-.&apos;In Holland we require from 6,000,000 to 7,000,000 florins per month for- the. payment -of certain freights and insurances which cannot be paid elsewhere; for the urOoading and dispatch from Holland, to Belgium and Franoe of the cargoes imported; to pay for the purchases of from 5,000 to 10,000&apos; tons of native Dutch produce which otherwise would have to be purchased overseas.   Our funds in Holland will only carry 1kis work to the 1st of. February, afterto carry:-(a)(o)
which date the belief of the invaded territories must: abscOiitely^ cease, unless new credits are provided.&quot; In the United Kingdom we have been carrying on operations onlv through the courtesy of the Banque Beige in granting us and uns^cuSed overdraft, which overdraft must be repaid.on January the 1st.     This overdraft now amounts to approximately . 500,000- and. will..amount to  800,000 by December 31st.&quot;We have, requested of-the Foreign Offic^. the following; action by the British &quot;Government:--&apos; 1)   That there be deposited at once in Holland to the-credit of the Commission for Relief the sum of 6,000,000 florins.ElThat the BritMh&apos; Government deposit in sterling, in London,&quot; to the crecit of the Commission for Relief,  the sum of  2,500,000, to meet the overdraft at the Banque Beige ana to finance our- operations for the month of January.-   Failin.. such action being taken immediately the Relief must cease.&apos;I beg. to call your attention to what we believe to be facts in regard to the Relief,-that is,, that if ever the people of the invaded territories and likewise the people of France and the United States and to a certain -extent the people of England, come to know, that the Allies have abandoned&apos; to starvation, the 9,500,000 of their own people, the war will cease.   The .29 deputies of the north of France, the most influential in the French Assembly, are determined that thir populations shall be fed.     They are able to combine at any moment with the pacifist and Socialist elements in France and&apos; can, overnight, cause the downfall/of any French Ministry which fails to declare the pro-tection of the invaded regions part of their fundamental policy.Through its representatives, the polulation&apos; of Belgium can exert a powerful force in the same direction, not only in France, but on its own Army.    There is no doubt that the recent con-ditions of semi-starvation -which existed in the occupied terri-tories drove some hundreds of thousands of excellent workmen and workwomen into the employ of the Germans, either in Belgium, Northern France, or in Germany, and. this&apos; released, to the front -line trenches equivalent numbers Of German soldiers.     The correctness of this general estimate of the strategic and military aspect of the Relief is assented to and concurred.in unofficially by officers of the French Government.      ;&apos;e should like an opportunity of discussing it with you..-. :.   The present situation of the Relief is absolutely critical and unless the Britiah Government acts within the next few days this organisation will.be bankrupt -and discredited.&apos;not only in the commercial sense but as to the reputation of its Executive who, depending upon the action of the British Government, have guaranteed-to the Banque- Beige, protection of the. overdraft.-Having apparently failed in bringing- this situation, to&quot; the&apos; realisation of-any of. the. officials ofthe:British Government as a-last resort-wo are; appealing; to your sense of justice. -and humanity and military&apos;expediency, i,:. /which we have the.most    ;--absolute confidence.  &apos; I.desire greatly to be- acoorded-the privilege of an interview, in orxler to. present this situation briefly, and have.taken the liberty of - thus addressing you at the- suggestion of our Ambassador, Mr. Page..Yours faithfully,(Signed)   Wm. B.. &quot;POLAND.Director for Europe
