14- ! c     h PD/m/ 718V1 i CO81*9S8M&amp;BK *(This Documen-His Britannic j&apos;vfa]ei,ty&apos;&apos;s Government.)Deo,, .fcl -  7. 191?Colonel Jones I 2124She Danish Government object to the American proposals for a shipping agreement, on fee ground thst no adequate provi-sion is made in them jbr Danish requirements of tonnage.   But there are 430,000 tons deadweight of Danish shipping at present detained in American ports;   and a threat to requisition the whole of these vessels ought to produce a considerable effect at Copenhagen,   We ore prepared to accept the proposed arrangement, 4f 200,000 tons deadweight of Danish shipping are allowed to remain in the Anglo-French coal trade.The Panish i- Tern a at are plainly disinclined to insist that their dairy farmers shall sell gutter at reasonable prices, to the United Kingdom,    hough coal is scarce in Denmark the deliveries of German coal have been, during the last four months, slightly in excess of the agreed quantities.     The a or mans, it is true, intend to raise their prices by 21 kr. a ton aft r the lew Year, but the Panes have already raised the price of the agricultural exports which they give, in exchange, ond therefore will not be losers to eny great extent.   It is doubtful whether we should impress the Danish Government by threatening to raise the price of British coal; ond, unless the United States will apply pressure on our behalf, we shall probably be obliged to dispense idth Danish but 1 er .SwH&amp;KEj.   Our Legation at Stockholm hss taken steps to dasabuse the Swedish public of the idea that they are necessarily dependent upon German coal.    She Liberal party now learn, to $teir astonishment, that we-offered, os recently as lsst June, to supply Sweden with 200,000 to 250,000 tons of coal a month; and
that our coal could have&apos; *em delivered in Sweden more cheaply then German cpal, if the Swedish&apos; Government would have eon seated to Impose maximum freight rates and to use their power of requisitioning native tonnage.She Swedish delegates in London have nrovisionally accepted the heads of a temporary shipping agreement, under whl ch(a) the United States would have power to charter for four months the Swedish vessels now detained in their ports, and the vessels lying in the ports of the -European Allies would be similarly placed at the disposal of the Inter-Allled Chartering Exeeu-tive for three months:(a) Swedish ahipwoners would be at liberty to charier their vessels to the Belgian Belief Commission.efej Swedish vessels detained in Swedish ports mould be allowed to resume their sailings9 pending the con-elusion of a general agreement.(d)   Swedish vessels already engaged in Allied trades would be free from any interference on the part of the Swedish Government.She Swedish Government, however, are not prepared to coerce their shipowners; and no further steps can be takeft in the negotiations until it is ascertained whether the ship owners will accept these proposals..5. 5Jhe United States War Trade Board have new proposed tothe llomeglen Mission(a) that no foodstuffs except fish and fish products shall be exported to Grermany from JSorway.(b) that the exports of fish and fish products to Germany shall be limited, as from Bee. 24, to 4,000 tons a month.(cj that there shall be no further exports to Germany of cupreous ores, antimony, bismuth, manganese, mica, nickel, titanium, wolfram and chrome;   nor of any other articles which are ingredients in munitions or which are the subjects of agreements with Sreat Britain and France.(d) that articles which may not he exported to the enemy shall only he exported to neutrals under adequate guarantees that they will not he allowed to reach the enemy,
1263.On these conditions the United States and the Allies will promise to facilitate the importation of lor way&apos;s legitimate requirements of overseas goods, provided that these are purchased from apix oved sources.Although in certain respects these terms might advantage-ously be stiffened we shall on the whole be &amp;rtunate if they are accepted.     Sir M. Find lay stillthinks that the Norwegian Govern-ment are deliberately protracting the negotiations in the hone of an early peace.   They are informing the Norwegian public that the United States would in any case be prevented by their own military necessities, from supplying Norwegian requirements.RUSSIA.      The British, French and American Mission in Petrogrsd are considering how to prevent Germany from obtaining important sup--V:.:. (&apos;..:.plies of metals and foodstuffs from Bussian territory,   A Cen-tral Committee has been set up by the missions which will dndea-tfour to obtain control of the more important commodities, end to arrange for transporting them to a safe distance from the German lines,   This Committee will be assisted by local sub-committees of business men.     The Zionist federation is using its influence with the Russian Jews, and particularly with those of South Russia, to the same end.   Sir George Buchanan hopes that an Allied organisation, indepaadmt of Petrograd, may be formed to negotiate with the Cossacks and the Governments of the Ukraine and the Caucasus respecting the supplies which they control.&apos; SOUTH AMERICA.      H.M. Government have suggested at Washington that an expert should be appointed, on behalf of the Allies, to nego-tiate for the acquisition of all enemy shipping in the Argentine, Chile, Colombia and Perm! -The argentine Government have in principle accepted thf
War grade Intelligence Department. 29th December 1917.Franco-British proposals for the purchase of the Argentine grain suglus;   and themodifications which they desire to make in the details of the original scheme are not on the whole unsatisfactory.        The Treasury however regard it as essential that there should he a fixed rate of exchange, am between francs or sterling and the Argentine dollar, for the purposes of the agreement;     and this point has not yet been conceded to us.SUBMARINE LOSSES.        She Allowing is a summary of the losses to merchant shipping, due to enemy activity, which were reported in the period Dec.21 - 27 1917 inclusive.
