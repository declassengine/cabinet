S:&quot;E C R E TOFFICES OF THE WAR CABINET, 2 White nail Gardens j, ;;a;;   London. S*W8(l)   Can the&apos; General Staff foresee a victorious ending to the War?   If so. when and under what circumstances?(2)    Do the General Staff foresee such an improvement in the future military situation of the Allies as would induce the enemy- to assent to peace terms more favourable to the Allies than those offered? or likely to be obtained, at the present moment?&apos;   If the answer is in the affirmative3 will the improvement be on such a scale as to justify the sacri^ fice involved- in continuing the struggle?.(3) Can the General Staff suggest any means by which the enemy can be prevented from securing control of the resources of South Russia?(4) - Can the General Staff foresee, either in 1918 or in 1919. a reasonable&apos;probability of the infliction on the enemy of a defeat that would not leave the military domination of Prussia successful and intact?k   NOTE:-.The War Cabinet suggest that the following three conditions of victory should be assumed:-(a) That the Allies are able to hold fast in France in 1918: \b) That the Allies are able to hold fast in Italy in igiS0 * (c) That they have sufficient force to inflict a decisive military defeat on the enemy in 1918&apos;or 1919*
SB 0 ft S T. 0^1/142/405.Copy No. 1 1 3* It 18sSecretary,War Cabinet,The replies to the questions arising out of my Paper /141/404 of the 29th ultimo on the &quot;Present Military Situation&quot;which the War Cabinet have put to me are given below*   I will first deal with questions (1) (2) &amp; (4) collectively, and afterwards with (3) separately.1.   In considering the probable future developments of the war it is essential to look on both sides of the picture The Entente side, owing to&apos; the collapse of Russia, the defeat of Italy, shipping losses and consequent shortage of certain supplies/general war-weariness, and shrinkage of-man-power, especially in England and France, may look black, but there is no reason to suppose that the enemy&apos;s side Is wholly &quot;without difficulty.   If Germany foresaw a,speedy end to the war by a complete defeat of her enemies, no feelings of humanity&apos;would induce her to propose a peace which is certainly not the one she set out to obtain.   Hence it is fair to assume that the German Government do not see their way clear to victory, and that perhaps they may dread the Frankenstein monster they have created in Russia, and feel that if they do not speedily take steps to stop the war they may themselves be devoured by the forces of anarchy.   Another reason for the recent peace offer may be to screw up the morale of the German people for further efforts, as in the event of the offer &quot;being refused they will be told that the Entente are still bent upon aggression and the destruction of the German, Austrian, and Turkish Empires.2.   I therefore submit that it is essential to carrying on the war successfully that our answer to the recent peace proposals should be sc framed as to leave no loophole for any suggestion of this nature. *;e shouldmake it particularly clear in the answerthat
that we have no quarrel with the German people.   The latter will then know that it is not England - as they are told - or any of the Allies that stand in the way of peace, hut only the Junker Government.   Even if they are not yet prepared to throw over that Government it is possible that if we car, inflict further heavy lusses on the enemy on the West front this year and prevent him from gaining any marked success^ the result of this, coupled with economic pressure, may be to produce such disgust in the German mind as to cause the over-throw of Junkerdom.    If this happened there is no doubt that more favourable peace terms could be obtained than .at the present moment.    I consider, therefore, having regard to the intolerable position in which we should be placed if peace were made now, that the sacrifice involved in continuing the struggle would be justified, provided we can achieve the necessary military successes.    The question is can we hope to achieve them ?3*     The answer depends upon whether the Entente can or cannot hope .to become relatively stronger, either by a weakening of the enemy or by a strengthening of the Entente.    As to the first the prospects are too problematical to be accepted as a basis for our policyo   Austria has already said she will not make a separate peace, and I imagine she cannot&apos;, though perhaps she may take no important part in operations on the West front. Bulgaria may continue inactive as during the past year.   She has already got what she wants and will probably do no more fighting if she c avoid it.   Turkey might perhaps be bribed to assist us indirectly though it is doubtful if she could be entirely eliminated by thismethod
&quot;7U .method.     To attempt to eliminate her by force would, I still think, he militarily impossible, unless and until a strong military force is first reconstituted in the Caucasus.   I have chiefly in.mind our man-power, the shipping situation, the great distances to be covered, and the obvious truism that if it is to our advantage to get Turkey out of the war it is equally to Germany&apos;s advantage to keep her in - that is to give her such help as may be required.   Whether a com-bination of bribery and force would give us any better chance of success 1 hesitate to admit.4.   I think, therefore, that the only reliable prospect of the Entente becoming relatively stronger lies in the increase of their own strength.   Whether they can do this it is not possible for me to say.   In paragraph 4 of my Faper of the 29th ultimo I said &quot;the question of the Entente outlasting Germany to such an extent as to be able to dictate terms of peace to her is obviously affected by many political, social and economic conditions of the different Entente countries with which I am imperfectly acquainted, and regarding which, indeed, no-one can give an accurate forecast.   Of no less Importance are the naval and shipping situations, as to which also I can express no opinion.   It is therefore quite impossible for me to give a definite and comprehensive reply to the question.&quot;I wrote the&apos; above before I had seen the draft Report of the Cabinet Committee on Man-Power, but what I said as to the numerous factors other than military which must betaken
mtaken into consideration is confirmed by that Report, for in it the Committee give priority over military requirements to many other services, i,e,, Royal Navy, Air Service, shipbuild ing, aeroplanes and tanks, food production, timber felling, and the provision of food storage accommodation,In paragraphs 12 and 13 of my Paper I said, &quot;If we defeat the enemyl&apos;s offensive, as we may reasonably hope to do if we make suitable and adequate preparations and do not send our reserves off in wrong directions, how much nearer then should we be to getting a favourable peace ? This depends not only upon ourselves but also upon the extent to which the other members of the Entente keep in the field, and upon when America can enter in force.Jf    The two main essentials to enable us to endure are shipping and men. and to provide both in adequate quantities will call for much greater sacrifices than any we have yet made.       Without adequate ships.and without adequate men - that is, all the men who can possibly be made available - to fight on land I do not think that we can hope to obtain a favourable peace. Therefore, if these ships and men cannot be produced, I can only advise the War Cabinet that, militarily, there seems to be no alternative but to accept pep.ce on Germany!s terms, and these I fear would, sooner or later, be disastrous to the British Empire*&apos;*5.       I find it very difficult to say anything of a more definite nature, and I doubt if it is within the power of any one Department of State to give a definite reply either to questions (?l) or (&apos;4)0 I quite appreciatethe reasons which prompted the questions for it&apos;is only natural that, in present circumstances, the Far SifefeEGss should wish to be furnished with expert opinion as to whether we.can
can or cannot hope decisively to win this war. . If we were engaged in a war in which tho British Amy alone, was fighting a single belligerent, and in which considerations other than those of a purely military nature were of little or no account., the General Staff ought to be&apos;able to give an opinion with reasonable accuracy.   But nothing resembling these conditions obtains in the present stupendous struggle, which is not a war merely of armies but of some 20 or more nations, and draws into its vortex every branch of national life,   The chief factors about which I an necessarily ignorant, and which prevent me from being more explicit in my replies$ are the extent to which the Royal Navy expect to cope with the submarine menace and generally to secure our sea-conmunications the shipping position, the rate at which. American troops will be put into the field, the staying power of the Entente, and th number of men to be supplied to the British Army during 1918,6*   So far as the British Army is concerned it will, undoubtedly, become weaker month by month and not stronger, unless &quot;lore men are provided &quot;than those foreshadowed in the recent draft Report of the Cabinet Committee *   It is there recommended that additional divisions should be created by catting down the number of battalions in a division from 12 to 9. but- the Adjutant-General informs me that, quite apart from the difficulty of providing the requisite personnel for the additional artillery and other divisional units, it will not be possible to retain and keep at full strength throughout 1918* oven on tho 9 battalion establishment,more than 40 of the
British divisions now in France and Italy.     The Cabinet Committee think that the Adjutant-Generalfs estimate of wastage has been calculated at too high a figure, but even If that be so - and the A.G. still considers that it is not - the differ-enoe will not be such as to make it possible to maintain more than the existing 52 Divisions at the lower establishment, which in itself means a decrease of 2b% in Infantry strength as compared with 1917.,     Further, wastage depends upon the enemy :s action as well as upon our own, and although we may have decided to adopt a defensive policy it does not follow that we shall not be made to fight and to fight hard.     I have no doubt myself that we shalla       Whether America can make good our deficiency I cannot say^ as this depends largely upon shipping, regarding ?hhlch I can form no opinione7,     In connection with the provision of men for the Army I feel it necessary to repeat that although we must have shipping and also a Navy adequate to cur needs it is certain that we shall never get a satisfactory peace unless and until we exert such pressure on land against the enemyJs armies as will show to Germany that it is useless to continue the struggle.     Insufficient shipping and an inadequate Navy may cause us to lose the war, but neither shipping nor the Navy-can ever win it.   The question is, therefore, are we makingthe
Withtho host distribution of our resources as between the different services which are contributing to the prosecution of tho war, and arc we getting tho maximum value in return ? I cannot say as I do not know what calls are made upon our shipping or whether they could bo reduced, Nor do I know what personnel the Navy requires, what it has got,, how it is employed, what number or class of ships are needed, what are being constructed, what labour is required in the shipyards, and whether it could be further diluted.     Nor do I protend to know the possibilities of offensive and defensive naval action,, but it is a disappointment to find, especially as we now have American naval assistance, that the Admiralty regard it as not improbable that an invading force of 70.000 Gorman troops could be transported across the North Sea to our shores.I suggest j with every respect and deference., that the allotment and employment of our resources of all kinds merit further investigation.   When this has been made it will, I think, be possible for the War Cabinet to reach a safer and I clearer conclusion as to our prospects of winning the war than they are able to reach from tho restricted and indefinite replies I have been compelled to give.8,     Cn the whole question I feel, most strongly, that notwithstanding our difficulties and the many uncertainties with which we are faced,   .wc can van if we will but -determine to do so, and if we act accordingly. We cannot expect to win without making the greatest possible effort,   and enduring a far greater strain than any which we have yet felt..
7;ith the vast potential supply of men in America there should be no doubt of our winning.     Our task is to do our utmost to ensure holding our own till America arrives, and meanwhile make every.endeavour to expedite her arrival.9.     As regards question (3), I do not see at present that more can be clone than that of which the War Cabinet is aware, namely, to make the best use of the forces in South Russia which are more or less willing to co-operate with the Entente.   There is the Rumanian Army of 15 divisions which merely requires supplies, and perhaps these may be obtained, given the goodwill of the Ukrainian Government.     The latter is collecting Little Russian troops from different parts of the front, and has the support of two Czech and Slovak divisions now about Kiev, Its special need is money and organisation, and these will be furnished by the French.     In the Polish Army is a- force of over 32,000 rifles which may perhaps be Increased to seven or eight times that number, and&apos; which is now being supplied with money through C?ar,oral Nlosscl.   General Alexiev has a force consisting of Cossacks, the Knights of St. George, and other volunteers.   The French are supplying financial assistance, while we are taking steps to support the civil government and re-organize the railways.     There are also the various national groups In the Caucasus, the financial needs of which are being met as far as we can meet them at present, while their organization Is to be undertaken by British officers, some of whom are already ordered there.
3rd January 1918.(Sd.) W.R. Robertson, C *I .G .S .8.     There is no certainty as to whether these various elements can be made efficient and useful, but by continuing the above policy energetically it may be possible to erect a barrier between the Central Powers and the economic riches of Southern Russia and to bring such further pressure upon Turkey as may contribute to her collapse.   It would seem unlikely that Germany would for the present be prepared to expend the effort necessary to occupy the Ukraine and the Donetz Basin.     Last July, when the weather conditions were favourable and the Russian Army was retreating in disorder, Germany halted on the Ukrainian frontier, and except for a disastrous attack on the Roumanians made no effort to push on into Podolia or Bessarabia.     Since that date she has considerably reduced her forces on the Russo-Rumanian front both by withdrawing divisions and by combing out those which remain , and for the next four months will be faced by un-favourable conditions of weather and ground.     Later on, how-ever, it is conceivable that she may push out eastwards, but on the other hand any troops that she employed for this purpose would have to be deducted from those that would other wise have been available for the Western or Italian Fronts, where she may be expected to aim at a decision.
