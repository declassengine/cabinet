DETAILED REPORT ON BOM3 RAID CARRIED OUT 144DURING THE DAY - 24TH DEC 1917...................Two formations-of 6 De Havilland 4rs left between 10 and 10,15 a,m. to attack the railway station and munition works in and around Mannheim,     Of the 12 machines two were forced to return to their aerodrome owing to engine trouble, without having crossed the lines *     The remaining 10 machines crossed the lines at 9,000 ft, and proceeded up the line of the Vosges mountains to MannheimeOn passing Dagsburg an observation balloon was seen at between 3,000 and 4,000 ft5 and a second one in the neighbourhood of Zittersheim.&apos;    It is thought that these balloons are put up to give warning of the approach of hostile aircraft, as after passing them anti-aircraft fire started, and on arrival at the objective the anti-aircraft defences were ready for the raid,     On the return journey these balloons were not observed,- The two formations arrived over the objective almost simultaneously and dropped their bombs from an average of 13,500 ft, at about 12 noon.16 - 112 lb0 bombs and 2 - 230 lb. bombs were dropped in sill, the results of which appeared to be good.     Four bursts were observed in the main station, several in the Lanz Works, two in Ludwigshafen, and several in the factory between Mundenheim and Rheingonnheim,17 Photographs were taken over the objective, the results of which, considering atmospheric conditions, are good. Photograph of the last named factory shows an abnormal column of smoke which coincides with the reports of observers as towhere bombs fell,   .The station, and sidings immediately to the South-East of Mannheim were packed full of roiling stock, and very large dumps of materials were also observed.     Observers report that they have never seen any railway/station or siding so full ofrolling
In the Field,24th December, 1917.(Sgd) C,L.N. NewallLieuto Colonel Commanding 41st Wing, Royal Flying Corps.rolling stock:   photographs confirm this. Several bombs wereobserved to fall into the town and at least one fire was caused.Eleven enemy aircraft were seen, five following the formation from Speyer on the outward journey, and six more appear ing in the neighbourhood of the objective.       Only five enemy aircraft were able to reach the height of the bombing machines, and these did not attempt to attack at close range.Anti-aircraft defences around Mannheim were considerable in number and the shooting was accurate.One machine failed to return and was last seen descending under control in the neighbourhood of Speyer,     It is probable that this machine was hit in the engine by anti-aircraft fire* One other machine was considerably damaged in the barrage, but reached home safely. One observer received three fleshwounds in the arm.Weather conditions were very hazy, and it was only possible to observe directly downwards. The Rhine Valleyin particular was very misty, some towns being completely covered.
