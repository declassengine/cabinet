Tie have adopted this Report and now present it for the approval of the r;iar Cabinet.The amount of money involved in this scheme is about  200,000 per month,-or, say, 2i millions a year. It is understood that objections may be rrioed by the Treasury in this connection and a suggestion-has been made that if this sum were to be spent on fish, a corresponding amount might have to be deducted from the amount provided for the purchase of b&amp;ccii, hams., lard, or cheese.The Commit-too rash-to point out-, however, that the financial assistance in the case of the purchase of fish must not be given at the expense of any of those other commodities, having regard to their higher food value*(Signed).

FISH, jlPPLISS^(Nrr Cabinet 217, Linute 19) Report of Sub-Committee.The Sub-Committee appointed by the Committee !s minute dated August 23rd submits &quot;the following report1. -WTIV^ VALIIj OF FISH MD lilAD IMPORTS.Fish packs closer than meat and a cubic foot of fish contains a larger proportion of edible food than a cubic foot of meat wnen bone and offal rre token into consider-ation.     This is balanced by the hipiier food value of meat so that ton for ton the.value of a &quot;fish cargo as food is roughly equivalent to that of a meat cargo, though the cost of the latter is much higher.     It has been pointed out that the round trin from^Ccnada or Newfoundland can be com-joleted in about half the time occupied by the round trip rrom the Argentine and one quarter&apos;the time occupied by&quot; that from Australia.     This &quot;comparison is   however,, mislead-Ing as car/ ships thet. cm be spared from these runs could bemused for importing from North America meat and other articles of food thct require refrigerated space.     It  -should be noted that imported fish will not necessarily involve a corresponding&quot;&apos; saving in the importation of meat even.so far as the Army is concerned as the \7ar Office unless otherwise directed might make use of- the additional fish to increase.their reserve of meat.    From the scienti-fic point of view fish has only about one-fifth the crloric value of meat though this is largely compensated for by the high protein vrlue of fish.Tfith their present freezing and storing capacity it -appears that the Herd Newfoundland Company and the Anglo-Canadian Fish Corporation will be able to supply about 2,000 to 2,500 tons of frozen fish per month.    The .- &apos; Companies rre willing to increase their capacity,1 but it is considered unlikely that a large increase can be effect-ed in less then sis months,,The TTnr Office have been getting intermittent con-signments up to 400,000 lbs per week&quot;&apos;in refrigerated space on liners and general cargo boats,    One sioecial voyage has been made by the uDemostenestt and the &quot;AjanaV out the latter was compelled to take.in a quantity of meat, at Montreal as there was not enough fish to lift.    No wholly refrigerated ships have been,supplied for this purpose, but&quot; in any ease, wholly refrigerated ships would be unsuitable, on account of the very large; cubical capacity of their chambers, unless fish&quot;were&apos; combined witn meat cargo.   None would be available unless it were decided that ships should, be withdrawn from the meat trade.     Liners and general cargo boats with refrigerated spree crh load fish at Halifax, Nova Scotia end St. Johns, Newfoundland..
4. - GOLD -STORAGE/. There will be sufficient cold storage in this country, to accommodate oil the fish thr.t cm be Imported.c      A TV?. tv  Dr &apos;0&quot;TT-TV^ &apos;&quot;, &quot;fjicThe v7cr Office ore prencrcd to take any quantity up to 3,000,000 lbs per week.   The contract mode by the 13crra of Trade on their behalf with the Anglo-Canadian Fish Corporation expired at the end of August last, but supplies at the rates agreed upon in that contract have continued to arrive since.   The&apos;-.7ar Office are anxious to arrange at once for further supplies. &apos; Hitherto they have not obtained on the average more thru 400,000 lbs per week, though the contract provided for any quantity up to 1,500,000 lbs weekly.s. CIVILIAN CONSmPTIOH.No difficulty is anticipated in getting the civilian population to absorb any quantity of frozen fish thct can be&quot; placed on the market after the needs of the Army have been satisfied, but it is clear that for the next six months at ler.st the supplies rill be insufficient tc meet Army requirements clone.7. FINANCE.&quot;Satisfactory reports have been obtained as to the standing of the two Companies from the Colonial Office rnd from Lord Jlothermere. &apos; The Newfoundland Company is vouched for by the Prime Minister of that Colony.. It has teen suggested that the Companies would be willing to accept payment in sterling in this country instead of in dollars if a slightly increased price per pound were paid for the fish.   They would, however, require to remit the whole or bulk of the money to North America for payment of the working expenses.&apos; From the point of view of the exchange between the t&quot;rro countries, therefore, the payment in sterling would have no advantage over payment in dollars, and on this ground the Treasuryare understood to object equally to the transaction on these lines. Unless this objection can be removed it is clearly impracticable to proceed further at present in view of the financial Conditions now ruling, which are hindering the Ministry of Food in obtaining sufficient dollars to finance.the purchase in North America of essential food-stuffs such as meat,&quot; bacon end cheese.--The Sub-Committee desire to point out that an opportun-ity is now presented for making a&quot;contract on favourable terms^, in view of the steady &quot;universal rise in fish prices, and that a contract made now, by developing the great ooten-tial resources of these waters, would create within the nmpire a new source of supply of a food which would be relat-ively cheap rnd easily controlled.^ In these circumstances no effort should in the opinion of the Committee be spared to overcome the financial -obstacles:8V IM;GQMMIjNDATIQM OF SUB-COHnTTZiThThe Sub-Committee accordingly recommends that thoMinistnV
Linistry of rood should as soon as -prr.cticr.ble enter into negotiations with the /leid Ncwfoundlrnd Company, rnd with the Anglo ICrnadi ah Fish Corporation for the&apos;purchase of as much frozen fish for table use as they can supply, up to a maximum quantity of 12 million pounds per month,, at civf. price to be based on a price of 8 cents per pound for selected fish generally, f&apos;.xb* Halifax or St, Johns $ with the option to the Government to take any further qurntities which it may&apos;require rnd which tne -Companies can produce, up to a mrximum of 24 million pounds per montn on the same termsThe contract to run for the period of the war rnd for six months thereafter, and to cover both military and civilian requirements. &apos; No pen-altios for short delivery to be imposed, rnd the Food Controller to take no responsibility for providing tonnage though he will endeavour to assist the companies in obtaining it.   Inspection will be crrried out by the Ministry of Food, which will also bo responsible for the distribution of any supplies available for tho civilian population after the needs of the Army have been met, it being understood that the War Office rre to have tho rirst refusal of the fish reaching the United Kingdom.This Report has been rccepted by all the members of the Sub-Committee.    A Supplementary Note ^hich Kr,H,G0 Maurice of tho Borrd of Agriculture and Fisheries wishes to submit to the Committee is appended to the Report.SIGNED ON BNNALF OF THH SUB-COLO TTES.UFcmNTOtfcChairman.13th December,. 1917..
I hrve associated myself Tlth the Report of the Sub-Sommittoe to aift&amp;fy my agreement with its conclusions so far as they go, &quot;except that having regard to the Government control of tonnage,. I think it would bo more reasonable as well as more practicable to make a contract for purchase f.o.b. subject to whatever proviso may be thought necessary relieving tho Government of responsibility for lifting supplies of fish at any stated times,   I should-, however, -have preferred r more emphatic pronouncement in favour of the scheme which the Sub-Committee was instructed to examine, for I cannot believe that if the scheme is properly appre-ciated in all its bearings, financial arguments will be allowed to forbid its adoption,-Tho proposal cf the President of the Board of Agricul-ture end Fisheries aimed not merely et the relief of immediate necessities, but, rnd more particularly, at. the creation of new food resources in anticipation of a period of even grerter scarcity then tho present.   It is stated in the bub-Committee!s report that cny ships that can be spared from the Argentine end&apos;Australi en runs * could be used for importing from North America meat and other exticles that require refrigerated spree1&apos;.   On. this statement, the present eecuracy of which I do not dispute. I would offer two comments.   In the first place, the meat supplies of North America ere not inexhaustible; the fish resources of Canadian and Newfoundland waters are so for all precticel purposes, and it is nature un-rided by men that provides the increase.    Secondly the use of fish now in substitu-tion for moat is calculated to reduce the risk cf a meat frmine hereafter.But tho mrchinory for catching, preserving end distributing, the fish which rbound&quot;in these waters is at present inaaequatev   A contract on the linos.suggested by ivir. Prothoro would give the necessary incentive to persons in Cenede end Newfoundlend to invest their capital end their energy in the provision of the machinery needodo   Tho report does mot., I think, sufficiently emphasize the fact that by placing a contract now/ we mry expect to secure a clear addition to the fooct resources 01 the Nmpire.   Both the United Kin dom&apos;and the Colonies concerned would benefit, the former by hrving en additional food reserve at the end of the shortest extrr-European see route, and the latter by a great development of their natural resources and e, great increase of their export trade. ,-But if this new source of supply is to be fully available rt the time when it will be most noedod, prompt rction is necessary.-Of rnimal foods, I venture to say that fish is one of tho very few which cm bo regarded as adoqurte substitutes for meat, if meat in its turn be rogrxdod, as it should be, mainly as a source from which the necessary supplies of nitrogen to roplaoo tho wastage of the human fr&apos;mc cm bo derived.   Tho amount of nitrogen which the average men requires rnd con without detriment to his health, consume is limitod, and there is no form of food from which it cm be more economically derived than from fish.-   The body-building value of fish is little lower then that of butcher1^ moat, end in general it mry bo arid that, fish being more readily assimilable, there is less waste of nitrogen in the consumption of fish thru in thrt of butcherTs meat. &apos; .
Add to this the fact that there is every probability tnat r/ood fish can be obtained from Canada rnd iJowfomidland at approximately half the price of meat, rnd the importance of Mr. ProtheiVs proposal&quot; should be self-evident.Such a development of the fisheries as is contemplated &apos; would certainlv carry with it tho development of other valuable industries of which tho chief would be the pro-duction of fish oils (which can if necessary be converted into fats) and the production, from the waste offals, of fish meal and manure having a high value and at present a special importance, as a&quot; feeding stuff and a fertiliser, respectively.   Nor should it be forgotten that there is also the prospect of the creation of a fishing marine comparable to tnat of the United Kingdom, which has proved such an invaluable resource in time cf war.The adoption of Mr. Prothero&apos;s proposal need involve no risk whatever to tho Government beyond the risk of the loss of cargoes at sea.   Either the anticipated development will take place or it will no to   If ro takes place, tho food is, subject to tho provision of tonnage, secured; if it does not take place, wo shall at least be no: worse off than we are nova   No money will pass except in payment for fish which has been delivered and accepted as in all respects satisfactoryrI hold therefore, that a determined endeavour should be made to finance the scheme *   I suggest that if the special advantages which it offers to&apos;&quot;the Colonies be adequately represented tc the Canadian and Newfoundland Governments^ it should bo possible to persuade them to provide credits for financing this scheme as a separate measure quite apart from any of the questions of unrnce . &apos; which are at present under discussion between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Colonial Governments0   In the meantime. I suggest that the Companies with whom it is proposed that the contract should be made might be invited to accept payment in Treasury Bills, each of which would mature in six,months from tho date of payment, and that, in consideration of their accepting this form of payment, a slightly advanced price, should be offered for the fisho hhother such an offer would be accepted I cannot at present say, :but I think it is. probable that the Bank of Montreal, whichappears to be keenly, alive to the importance of ex-tending Canadian trade, would be prepared to give the necessary accommodation to the Companies to enable them to accept a contract on these torms*)Failing success in those directions, I think it still remains a matter for consideration whether, even at the expense of some further depreciation of tho exchange value of;the pound sterling, a scheme&apos;which cannot involve any appreciable risk end is calculated to develop so important a now source of food supply.and of-Imperial wealth and strength ought not to be promoted with energy end enthusiasm,&quot;(Signed.),.
