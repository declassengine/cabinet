I ii Gr 3 913 aMemorandum submitted to War- Cabinet by Mr. Ins ton Chamberlain17Submitted with reforonoe to Mr. Churchill&apos; s proposal to purchase additional steel.1.     The dollar credits asked by us for the month of January are 40 millions in excess of the sums hitherto allotted to us, but they arc insufficient tc cover the demands of the Departments..2.     Several Departments are nevertheless pressing additional demands upon us. -3.     Our figures do not &apos;include the Admiralty programme &quot;for heavy oil and shipbuilding.     -r/e have no information as to the extent of this programs, nor how it is covered.4.    &quot;Mr, Crosby insists that the IJ.S,i. Government cannot meet our demands is they stand and that we and the other Allies mu3t reduce thorn.5.     Doubtless some saving on the estimates will accrue from failure to. purchase- or to secure delivery, but sink savings cast a heavier demand forward on to succeeding months.6a     Mr, Churchill asks permission to purchase additional steel cn the chance that the shipping position may .so improve that1 it will be possible&apos; to . transport it.On this&apos; I have to observefi) that unless the U033A. Treasury increase our; .dollar credits, the additional steel must be purchased at tha expense of our food supplies.. .(h)&quot;        that the representative of the Ministry of Shipping regards the Milner Committee estimate - of tonnage losses as.being, if anything, too Iowv and that it is therefore unlikely that&apos; tonnage will be.  available except at the cost of food suppliers&apos;,&quot;(iii) that we understand that the directions of the,..      .    -Csbinst are that feed supplies should have precedence of munitions.(iv) that I am therefore unable to&apos; recommend compliance viith the request of the Ministry,of Munitions as I canaot :see; ; &apos; my way both to supply the minimum food requirements and to meet this increased demand for steel.(Signed)     Austen ChamberlainChairman, American Board. feiL Bp comber-, 1917 .

Ia view of the enormous increase of material which the oneay will he sble to bring against us on the &quot;estern Front next year the Minister of Munitions is confident that Their lordships will agree that the- first result of any improvement in the shipping position should be devoted to improving the situation of the British Army as regards munitions,. .If, however, no stops are tanen until it is known   hatthe tonnage position will bo in 1918,  it will then be too lateto go into the market and purchase- material for ai increased muai-tions programme .At the beginning of 1913 there   &quot;ill be about 400,000 tons of shell steel in stock or on order in the United States. But it should be assumed that some 150,000 tons will in the normal course be carried forward into 1919 leaving a nett 250,000 tons out of-existing orders available towards next ;;ear !s requirements,lllo&apos;-rin.K for 5% submarine losses (50.,000 tons out of the total programme), Mr, Churchill proposes to purchase 800,000 tons of shell steel for delivery during the year, and  I aim to ask that Their lordships -/ill give the &quot;necessary sanction for this to be    one.The estimated cost of this purchase is a bout 062,000)000, payable at regular monthly intervals from Merch onwards.I am,  Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sdlu    So lAilnREUTHSH,G.T. 3034.
