Reference Marling&apos;s telegrams 457 F.,. 20th De^Mfer,&apos; to 464 F., 22nd December.   German note coupled with armistice^fb^y----Jj^^^ons is obviously trap [to] put us in a dilemma with Persia-and we were&quot;^^fl^ili^dK^uied to recommend agreement to withdrawal subject to certain conditions, but policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government regarding Caucasus and Southern Russia indicated in Chief of imperial General Staffs recent telegrams apparently puts this out of the question. His Majesty&apos;s Government will remember Government of India have always regarded a policy which caused Great Britain to appear as unsympathetic to the Persian nationalists as unfortunate and have pressed for a change of policy.The retention of our forces for military purposes in the new circumstances will possibly be regarded as indicating a maintenance of existing policy, and therefore we hope it will be found possible to accompany necessary military measures with a conciliatie-ft policy in non-military matters. At the least we would press for conciliation of Bakhtiaris and support of present Ilkliani as essential to the safeguarding of our interests on that side, thus in a measure replacing barrier hitherto afforded by Baratoff s force.We can only recommend now as conciliatory a reply as possible to the note presented by the Persian Government to tide over present crisis and obviate immediate rupture of relations. . Such rupture might entail a considerable detachment from Mesopotamia. Apart from grave military objections to such a diversion, this measure might be interpreted as down-right and unprovoked aggression against an Islamic State, and as such have serious effect on already agitated Moslem feehng in India and Middle East.
