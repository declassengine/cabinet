Colonel Jones80The Cabinet CommitteMemorandumIMPORTS Of COTTON Pby the President si the Board of Trade.the Restriction of imports inyj,r, 1917, recommended that thekb. 1918.e ontheir Benort dated 1st December.imports of Cotton to be permitted in 191b should be increased by 50,000 tons over the imports in 1917.   This increase was necessary if the Cotton Industry were to be maintained on its present basis, that is to say with 60 per cent, of the machinery working.   Any further reduction of production would increase the already serious amount of unemployment.The War Cabinet decided on 5th December that Cotton imports during 1918 should not be increased; until the question of using cotton operatives and weaving sheds for aeroplane work had first been examined by the President of the Board of Trade in consultation with the other Departments concerned.In   accordance with this decision, a meeting was held at the Board of Trade on the 7th December, when representatives of the Ministry of Labour, Ministry of Munitions, Aeronautical Supplies Department and Ministry of National Service attended.A copy of the record of the meeting is annexed, and it will be seen that the Findings, we as follows:^(l) That the alternative work in sight for the displaced Cotton Operatives could not for several months absorb more than a fraction of those already out of work;(2) That while the utmost efforts should continue to be made- to find alternative employment for cotton Operatives, in order to mitigate the results of the present reduction of output, the prospects of finding such work do not at present afford any ground for reducing the proposed importation of cotton from 700,00.0 to650, 000 tons;
(3) That for the next six months a strong effort should be made to import cotton at the rate of not less than 700.000 tons per annum, and that the present Conference reassemble at the beginning of June to review the situation.In view of the foregoing result of the meeting ordered by the War Cabinet, I desire to submit for further consi-deraiion the question of the imports of cotton to be arranged for in 1918, and to recommend for the sanction of the War Cabinet that imports on the basis of an increase of 50,000 tons, as compared with 1917, should be allowed.A.E. STiiKEBT.26th December, 1917.
TEJ5 POSSIBILITIES OF FINDING WORE FOR THE UHSMPLOYBD IK LAICA3HIRE.A conference was held at the Board of Trade on December 7th, the following being present :-Sir H.

Aeronautical SuppliesDepartment.Mr.W.J.Hands     ))   Ministry of NationalMr.F,L. Joseph   ) Service.As regards new work for Lancashire, it was reportedas followsManufacturing of aeroplane parts would begin in a small way about tho middle of February and employ some 2,000 people.Other work in existing factories could not be ready till about May owing to the want of machinery, even if all necessary buildings were available.     By that time employment might be found for 10,000 people, which might gradually be increased to 15,000 at the outside.There were-, also the National. Factories to be taken into account.     One of these was at Liverpool and would be ready in a few.weeks for some 5,000 hands.     Siteo for four others had not yet been settled.     One or more of these might be located in Lancashire, but they would take some 15 weeks to get re &apos;.y after a start was made.     It was not possible to construct the larger aeroplanes in Lancashire mills and weaving shG&amp;c.
As regards work mainly outside Danoashire, it was mentioned&quot; that the RiiP.i.0. were ejected to &quot;be in need of come 40,000 women workers of various kinds eventually, but so far this expectation had not mat02ialisod into a precise demand to anything like that extent.   In connection with this^ it was pointed out tint largo numbers of the women working in the Lancashire Cotton industry wore young and unmarried, so that many of thorn would be in a position to take onploymoxTb outside Lancashire.On tho supply side it was reported that somo 40,000 ootton operatives were now out of work, and that the numbers unemployed in Laacashir* would probably be In the neighbourhood of 75,000 if cotton imports in 1918 wore reduced to 650,000 toni.After the wholo question had been discussed, it was the -&apos;unanimous opinion of tho confore-nce that (1)     the alternative work in sight for the displaced CottonOperatives could not for several months absorb more than a fraction of those already out of work;while tho utmost efforts should continue to &quot;be made to find alternative emx^ioyment far Cotton Operatives, in order to mitigate the results of tho present reduction of output, the prospects of finding such work do not at present afford any ground for reducing tho proposed importation of ootton from 700,000 to 650,000 tons;for the next six months a strong effort should be made to import cotton at tho rate of not less than 700,000 tons per annum, and that tho present Conference reassemble at the beginning of June to royjlew the situation.(2)
