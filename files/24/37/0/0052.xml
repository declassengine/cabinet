CADI II S T. 14MORAL  OF   ITALIAN . *^ Copy of ,lot^y. fopp. H.(VM.Trevelvan to Lord Saudirorst-.Stocks, Tringo25th December. 1917.Doar Lord Sandhurst,You havo asked me to write you my conclusions as to tho psychology of the Italian soldier in relation to the degree of resistance to be expected from him during the coming year, and the nature of measures that might be taken by the Allies to increase that power of resistance.The value of anything T may have to say lies in this, that I have soon more of the Italian soldier at tho front than, I believe, any other Snglishmon except colleagues of my own in the B0R&amp;CoS* out there with whom I have often dis-cussed the topics here treated.   For nearly two years and a half viz. since August 1915 I have been in command of an Ambulance&quot;Unit on tho middle Isouzo stationed first under Sabctino, then in Gorizia town, in Plave and finally on the Bainsizza plateau also.   I have witnessed a great deal of tho fighting, and have lived on intimate terms with many Italian officers, and have heard, directly or indirectly, much of the talk of tho Italian privates, as our Unit gradually obtained an established and oven favourod position in the eyes of the Italians for whom we worked so long.   I was also through the recent retreat and. have witnessed the rally on the Piavo front where our Unit is now working.,  I left Italy a week ago.   I have talked about these matters with a number of British officers now in Italy includingmembers
- 2 -members of General  lunar rs staff,I have no wish to say anything -as to tho chances of the enemy breaking through the- mountains- this winter, a military problem I cm Incompetent to discuss,    I am dealing with a more general question,- namely how long and under what conditions the Italian Army is likely to remain morally sound and capable of aiding the Allies in the defence cf Italy, supposing this &quot;-/inter is safely passed,   dy belief is that the present moral rally will prove only temporary and that second military disaster like that of October vvill take place next year, unless the conditions underwhich the Italian soldiers are now fighting ore fundamentally changed,    I sm indeed doubtful whether even wholesale reforms in the material conditions - vis&quot;, Increased pay? separation allowances, food,-comfort of all sorts In and behind the lines, and ccrrospond-ingly improved drill and^ disciplino - will enable the Italian Army to be counted on for another 12 or even 6 months of -resistance-. But I am sure that without these Changes being immediately brought about by the help and insistence of Italy:s Allies (the only aay to achieve the result) they will shortly have to take over the effective defence of the Italian line with their own armies at all the threatened points - or witness tho conquest of Italy,licit her the Italian army nor the country behind - it would rally a second time from another reverse like that from which they have just now partially recovered a&apos;:Haa&apos;; .  .     ; &apos;. vyIf this conclusion appears alarmist, it. is I believe the general conviction of most of- those who know Italy or tho Italian army intimately, and it is here expressed by a warm admirer of the efforts of Italy in the first 2-g- years of her warfare, who has witnessed tho valour of the Italian soldiers in their repeated conquests of fortified mountain positions from the Austrians, culminating in the  Teat offensive&apos; cf oigust-ooptember this year.     Unfortunately tho heroes atBalnea. s;z a /
Bainsizza and SB Gabriels in September became, in the last days of October, a mob devoid of all discipline and self-respect,   The occurrences on the retreat of the 2nd, Army which I witnessed were more disgraceful than has been hinted at in. the English papers, and the dismanagement and dereliction of duty more general then is generally KnownB   The Italian character, though it has fine qualities of valour and endurance, differs from the English in being a thing of variable moods and in going to pieces under any sudden disaster or unforseen emer; encyeJ/Ut apart from the secular unreliability of the Italian character, a character in many ways so admirable even in war, there are special causes of the rece-nt disaster which-will reproduce a similar..;result&apos;, unless they are removed or mitigated.     Those special causes nay be summed up as : -1*   Political, Material,,^u PoliJ^ical^ - :It is said that Italy in the &quot;days of May&quot; (1915) was brought into tho war by a popular movementiv This is true, -butit was a popular movement of the towns, only*     The vast majority of.&apos; Italian soldiers are not. townsmen but peasants in the strictest sense of the &quot;ord, viz; men with peasants&apos; ideas only, not men (as in England) living in the country but reading town newspapers and thinking town thoughts-;.&quot;    Th;se Italian peasant^soldiers are very uneducated - at least a quarter of them cannot read or write -and most of the others have a very rudimentary education and no habit of reading newspapers or discussing politics.   In intelli-genoe, education end patriotism they etend half wfiy between the English and French above and the Russian below.   They are un-intereoted in politics except where the agrarian socialist move-ment has affected them.   They are by no means devoid of patriotism towards Italy, as their conduct in the field for two years has shown, but as time drags on the thought of their families and -farms looms larger than the abstract Idea of their country. -The/   .
The Priest*&apos;en&apos;thc one hand:xor&quot;i;ha   cK;iiilist^en&quot;tha&quot;&apos;eth-er touches many of &quot;them more directly than the central&apos; patriotic tradition of the--Ri,sediment^, - the militant Liber lian. and patriotism v/hich In iphnh^wmh^^^ bought Italy into the present war. - -The ?j eorwjmmrbo party, -as I call thorn,&quot; partly idealistic and portly imperialist, are our friends and the enemies of the Central Izipires,   They largely constitute the governing class in Italy,- and are now paying for their long neglect of popular - education and their failure to got &quot;into political touch with the peasants whom they loft to the priests and socialists.   This&apos;political failure is reflected in the army by - the frequent want of touch between the officers and the men under their commandcSuch being the Italian peasant soldier, what are his present feelings ?   Ho finds himself separated from his farm and his family, where- his heart and interests lie for a period which lengthens out year after year.   Ho is told that England is prolonging the war,- and he resents it although, he .linos tho individual Lnglisimian when ho meets him at the front. He cares nothing about Dalmetia, very little about Trieste for which-he was told he was fighting.   Now thaw owing to the re-cent disaster he is defending the soil of tho country from in-vasion he sees-more motive for &quot;sacrifice - hence the temporary rallyo   But It, as the weeks roll by, he learns that the Central Impircs are ready, to c-vacurte Italv as the nricc of por.ee, T&quot;hilo Ingland and imorica insist on continuing the rar until victory, it is certain that, -whatever the attitude cf the. Italian Government end Press, the Italian nooplo and irmy will desire to put an immediate end to the her.   Tho soldiers will again bo for getting -back to:&apos;their homos.. &apos; It was this desire that led to tho deliberate betrayal of tho. positions above Tolmino in October by certain Regiments, and this phenomenon may ere long be repeated.Such
- 8 - 150. Such is the political aspect of the psychology of the Italian soldierV  How far, if at all, -it can he remedied politi-cally it is not my province to discuss, hut obviously assertations by England or America that we are going on for another two or three years will have a bad effect. . If such a policy has to be announced Italy;cannot be counted on. 2. Material.There remain the ma^erijil causes of danger. - These are more, easily defined and more capable of remedy/The food of the Italian soldier, whioh was not bad at an earlier stage of the war,  recently became more meagre,  and his disoontent proportionately increased.    It is imperative that the ration should be increased, not   only in theory hut in practice -whish are not always identical in Italian administration,    (I believe steps have been taken in this direction),The pay of the Italian conscript is a wretched pittance. The contrast with the pay of.the British troops who are now their comrades in the line is a .distinction that will be much felt and inevitably work mischief.The^separation allowance,- is utterly inadequate to the starvation prices existing in many parts of Italy.    The affection of the Italian for his family is a strong feature of the national character, and the knowledge that their wives ana children are   &quot; starving at home while they&apos; are in the trenches is one of the chief reasons why the&apos; soldiers desire immediate peace... Another&apos; cause of the recent disaster was the disgust of some renments at being left much too long periods in . the trenches before bein? sent into repose. -Another reason was the general absence of comfort, amuse-ment and attention even when&apos;they were resting behind the lines. The care given by the British Officers to the coipfort&quot; of their men has too little answering to it -in the Italian Army.   In spite cf some good efforts like the Cae% ; d e r sol da to and ;teatro^4el^o^6Jatg , there was very little in-the Italian soldiers life at the Eront answering to the countless institutions like canteens, Y.M.C.A. huts etc. that mitigate the British soldiers lot.   &apos;
I do not believe that--:-the. J&apos;t^ilJ^a-&apos;KilvlJi^c^ -mllSJ^rs1  authorities can either pay for or organise thc^ajrtpr^Tvements in the lot of&quot; th^Itraj^n-asoldixr-ne^e-eaary if&quot;the war is to be continued, many months longer.   The Allies must pay for the necessary improvements , and organise them so far as can be done without - offeeding -Itallaer &quot;pride v      heard, the .rumour- -that . the American Y.M.C.A. is going to run Its huts for all the French Army 6   Something of that sort whether by that or anotherbody is required Ini Italy, besides increased rations, pay and-- . . . -separation allowances-.; &apos;   &apos; : &apos;- , - A A-&apos;Another point which has already been-taken in handin some measure is the need for more drill . physical exercise&apos; - e:.-&apos;,&apos;&quot;-mi&apos;e7 A-7 -.:.. y-.-7-.A-7-   A&apos;- A&quot;-&apos;--and discipline.  -The ALtallaxa. soldier is too much a civilian In uniform.   An English soldier would say that-&apos;ho did not know his drill9 was not smart and was not !&apos;in training&quot;,   A Regiment &quot;la.-boa often not a well oiled and perfectly working machine , but a collection of individuals .   The Officers are little In touch with the men, and the men are hot accustomed to spring uncon-s clou sly to&apos; the word of commando   Hence, though the individual Italian is a hardy peasant-;, a good digger , and courageous in attack, the &apos;Regimental machine is easily deranged, as in the recent -retreat, snd then the individual soldier degenerates by contagion *It is obviously a question, though one on which I have not the grounds for forming an opinion, whether the present size of the Italian Army, should&apos;be maintained .   Many elements-in it after recent- events can hardly be made fit to. bo trusted again in the lino as fighting men,-    It would perhaps be bettor to concentrate money and effort on paying and training a smeller force that could be,trusted , If the necessary reforms cannot be applied- ^m. a larger scale .I love Italy and. have as much reason as any foreigner -in the world, to be grateful to her -   I hove written thus frankly about her present situation only because Italy and Europe with her-are om the edge of an abyss, which can only be
avoided if the danger is realised in iis nature-and extent, and remedied at once x    I trust that no Italian will ever bo allowed to know of my having written such a letter , which would cause deep offence.   On that one condition which precludes a fdriion^any form even of partial and anonymous publication, I entrust the letter to you without any further reserves upon the use you may think fit to make of it *Yours very truly,(Sd), F.K, TREVELYArJ ,
