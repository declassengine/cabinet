THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).

G.T.3164

WAR CABINET.

THE PALESTINE AND WEST ARABIAN SITUATION.

Memorandum by Sir Mark Sykes.

The Military situation in Palestine is in every way satisfactory.

The General and troops have evident confidence in one another, and the enemy has not shown up to the present any signs of superiority either in numbers, ability or initiatives. It would be safe to assume that the military situation will remain as described above for some three or four months to come.

The militrry situation in Hedjaz is also satisfactory from a purely material point of view, Medina is now isolated, the Arabs have a footing at the head of the Gulf of Akaba, and the Turks can make no headway against the Arabs south of Amman.

As against this the political situation is from nearly all points of view unsatisfactory.

We have groat assets both in Palestine and Hedjaz, and contingent resets in Syria; they are not being properly exploited nor developed, and more than this there is a distinct tendency to the growtn of difficulties, which, in time, may become formidable through want of handling.

The assets we have at our disposal should be enumerated, they are :-

1. Jerusalem and South Palestine, which gives us and the entente a strong hold on the international forces of Christendom.


(i) Orthodoxy and the Papacy in the holy places.(ii) Evangelical and Post lieforuiation Churches in the Bible lands.Palestine and our Zionist declaration combined gives us and the Entente as a whole a hold over the vital, vocaland sentimental forces of Jewry.Our success in Palestine should be a stimulant to. the Arab movement &quot;both in Syria and the South,Our success in Palestine and the loss of Jerusalem has undoubtedly&quot;lowered German and C.U.P. prestige in Turkey.These assets should, if developed, have a profound influence on the isruediate East-front war problems,  and a considerable effect on our moral influence in the world.   However,, instead of these assets being developed little or nothing is done to exploit    them while a whole crowd of weeds are growing around us, these are:-(1)   Arab unrest in regard to Zionism(2)   French jealousy in regard to our position.in Palestine.(3.)    Syrian-Hejaz friction among the Arabs, (4)   Pranco-Italian jealousy(5)   Zionisit anticipation undirected or controlled running to suspicion and chauvinism(6)    Cairo Pashoda spiritThe root causes of this may be attributed to the want of:-
A. In Lo.nd.6n,  an executive -capable of taki^pi-^^^ action,  guiding policy,  and dr*etrti-n&amp; and follow-ing events under the Secretary of -State for Foreign Affairs subject to the v-ar Cabinet.politicalB. A well organised centralised/machine in Palestine itself carrying out the London policy.As matters stand at present London policy is worked by a number of persons to whom the Middle East is part and not the whole of their task.In Palestine and Hejaz the authority is divided in avery unsatisfactory way..Sir a. Yingate is 7.U.C.. Hejaz and responsible for Hejaz negotiations.   General Allenby is sole authority inPalestine.General Clayton is Chief Political Offiaer to General Allenby and head of Arab Bureau under Sir R. Wingate.As a consequence there is a, sort of paralysis which pervades our politioal administration which is hard to describe in words.The French Commissioner &apos; . Picot has the whole of French policy in his hands as regards Hejaz,  Syria and Palestine, where-as our people, who have all the work to do are divided and scattered.further the Arab Bureau Staff is very small and sorne-what amateur in its personnel and not well organised being neither a real political nor a read military department.It is plain that General Clayton feels in a subordinateplace yet charged with executive responsibility,  a most invidiousposition to hold..     In order to overcome this bad state of affairs,which hampers our schemes and operations, I should suggest -1.        That some person should have charge of Hejaz and Palestine - and cognate problems here in London,  and be in a position to keep things together.2...        That a clean cut should be made between Egypt and Arabian and Palestinian policy,3.. That General Clayton should-&quot;be put in sole political chargeof the Hejaz and complete control of all political organisations.dealing -
Z&apos;iYMtchell Gardens, S-.Wa. 1st January, 1913,,dealing with Arabian and Palestinian affairs and further that ho should bo equipped with en adequate staff, and supplied iron London with a really first-rate office organiser.I am of opinion that this change of General . Clayton&apos;s position, should be marked, by a change of title, viz: Civil and Political Adviser to General Officer Commanding-in-ChiefsI am of opinion that this should be &quot;done at once.   If. it is dono we shall bo&apos;.able to . prevent quarrels arising, deal quickly and firmly with ovents.r and produce an easy moans of communica-.tion between London and tho Middle Eastern situationa If matters drift all our blessings will have a tendency to turn into curses, and to produce confused and un-controllable situations*(Signed).. M.SYES.
