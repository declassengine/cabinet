inspectors, and that the Land Inspectors employed by the Department might be utilised as the tribunal&apos;s Inspectors,  subject to the pro? that an Inspector should not re-inspect for the tribunal land with which he had already dealt in the course of his duties as one of the Department&apos;s Land Inspectors.

SUPPLIES OF ROOTS AND OTHER FEEDING STUFFS.

The shortage of roots due to the poor yield of the turnip crop, and the insufficient supplies of distillers&apos; offals and imported feeding stuffs, have caused a decrease in the production of milk and butter. It is feared that the same cause, may also lead to a decrease in the numbers of live stock in the country, and in the output of beef.

DRAINAGE OF AGRICULTURAL LAND.

Up to this, date notices requiring the cleansing of drains have been issued in 106 cases. It is intended to have a re-inspection made in some of these cases at an early date in order to ascertain whether the work specified in the notices has been satisfactorily carried out.

FLAX

The Ministry of Munitions (Department of Aeronautical Supplies) have now approved of the Scheme and estimate put forward by this Department for the cleansing and distribution of the flaxseed saved in accordance with the Flax Seed (Ireland) Order,  1917. This Scheme will be administered by this Department, and arrangements are new being made ? have it carried out.

Owing to the friction existing between flax growers and soutch mill owners regarding the charges for scutching flax and the dis?sal of the rug and tow? produced in the process, and in view of the ?trimental effect such friction would be likely to have on flax grewing ? the present circumstances, the Vice-President of the Department has appointed a Committee to inquire into those matters, and to make recommendations. The first public sitting of the Committee took place ? 2nd January, 1918.

TRANSIT OF FARMING REQUISITES.

During the period several representations were received by the Department in regard to the conveyance of Agricultural and milling ?nery and agricultural implements from places in Great Britain to ? Ports and Stations. The necessary action was taken in each case.


MAINTENANCE OF LIVE STOCK.

During the period from 18th to 31st December, inclusive, 1,357 applications for licences to slaughter or export animals under the Order relating to breeding sows were received, and 1,168 licences were issued. Under the Maintenance of Live Stock (Ireland) (Temporary) Order, 917, 200 applications for licences to export cows and 230 applications or licences to slaughter or export heifers, were received during the same period.
