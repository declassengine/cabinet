MBMCMNDUMBY THE SHIPPING GOmOLLEg&quot; ON Tag MllRE USg Q3J1 THE RUSSIAN STEAM MERCANTILE MARINE .The Shipping Controller desires the decision CfCo ii &apos;    &apos;J;hQ; War Cabinet- as to his position in regard to the future ;&apos;uss of the Russian Steam Mercantile Marine.Ud to the present under the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 5th May, 1916, these vessels (including those under Finnish ownership) have been directed by a Joint Committee representing the Ministry of Shipping and the Transportation Department of the Russian Government Committee-, on the principle of using them primarily for Russian services and secondarily for British services.   If used: for Allied services, it has been only in satisfaction ef British obligations to tho Allies,This arrangement has been continued up to tho present, even under the new conditions.The vessels shown at X on&apos; the enclosed lists have moreover been placed&apos; by the Russian Government Committee under the management ef this Ministry.The Russian Government Committee, however,- now feel in a difficulty since the. members of that Committee have been dismissed by the Bolshevik Government, and there is rot in this country any Russian official who has authority from petrograd to make any binding arrangement as to the use of the tonnage with this Ministry.This position might in their opinion soon become acute, since any of the Russian crews could at any time refuse to continue in their present service, in which case a situation might arise with which the Russian Government Committee did not feel themselves able to deal.   Such a position has indeed already arisen in connection with four large passenger ships which have been allocated with theconsent of the Russian Government Committee for transatlantictrooping.-Some
Some members of the crews of these vessels are suspected to be disaffected and it will be necessary to get rid of thorn before- the ships can sail.A Bolshevik agent has also been arrested by the Naval Authorities at Lerwick on the Gollier ?rBIIfUTAif as being dangerous to the ship, and the crew of this steamer are considered to &quot;be disaffected.The Committee are not unnaturally apprehensive that any action taken by them in agreement with the ministry of Shipping which would have the effect of extending British control over the steamers would be very seriously misrepre-sented in Russia.   At the same time they state that they do not desire to take any action in opposition to the wishes of the British Government with regard to the steamers, but have requested the whole matter be brought to the notice of the highest Allied authorities.A statement showing the steamers in question is attached.   The statement also shows the present position of British steamers now in Russian hands.Ministry of Shipping, December,1917,
