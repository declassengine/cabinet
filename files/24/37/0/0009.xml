SECRET *Intelligence Bureau.Department of Information. BPW/022.Weekly Report on Poland.   XXII. (24th December, 191?.)1.     Th  Polish Cabinet.On November 26 the Regency Council formally notified M. Jan do Kucharzewski of his appointment as Prime Minister, and by December 9 he completed the formation of his Cabinet.     Its con-position is as follows:Minister of the Interior. Jan Stecki. Justice, s. Bukowieoki. Finance, J.K. Steczkowski. Education, A. Ponikowski. Labour and Public Welfare, 3. Staniszewski. ?ood Controller, 8. Przanowski. Agriculture, J. Miiulowski-Pomorski. Trade, J. Zagleniczny.M. de Kucharzev/ski retains himself the direction of the Department for   Political Affairs; Count W. RostWorowski, who has hitherto been in charge of it, will probably be r etained as his assistant.    No appointment has hitherto been made to the War   Department.The raost salient fact about this Cabinet is the exclusion from it of professional politicians.    Pro-Germans such as Count Ronikier (until 1916 a National Democrat), prince Drucki-Dubecki or the notorious Lempicki-find themselves without the places for which they have striven with more zeal than dignity.    The new Cabinet represents the best type of small country gentry and intelligentsia, men with a real idea of duty and public service. Most of them have some political experience * e.g. Stecki and Zagleniczny have been members of the Duma, Bukowiecki and Mikulewski-Pomorski of the late Provisional Council of State -
; - .. . .....w- - .r.i. -   .- 2 -but past party connections are not likely to lead any of them into party feuds and vendettas.    During the first half of 1917 the politicians in and round the late Council of State hoped to create for themselves a monopoly of office; ever nines July the same type of men from the Inter-Party Union wae clamouring for the political proscription of all members of the Council   of State - none of them were to be allowed to hold office in the new government, they were to be hounded out of politics.    The party hacks Of both sides are confronted with the fact that Stecki, hitherto the chief leader of the National Democrats in the Austrian sphere of occupation, and Zagleniczny and Przanowski, also leading members of the Inter-Party Union, take office side by *ide with Mikulowski-Pomorski, vice-, chairman of the late Council of State, and Bukowiecki, who was one of its most prominent members.    Polish public opinion, however, dead-tired as it is of the noisy, sterile quarrels and intrigues of its politicians, seemn to have given the new Cabinet a very good reception.2.    Eaoh of the minister&quot; in a real expert on the matters with which he will have to deal.    Bukowiocki, the Minister of Justice, if? one of the leading membern of the Warsaw Bar, and as a member of the late Provioional Council of State he organised the new Polish Law Courts.    Steczkowski, the Minister of Finance, is one of the ablest Polish financiers, and, as Chief Director of the Provincial Bank of Galicia, he ha^ done moat excellent work for the country - among other things he succeeded in acquiring for Galicia the coal districts near Cracow, which having been previous-ly gobbled up by competing German firms &amp;ad been purposely neglected by them.    ponitaroki and Przanowski, the Minister of Education and the Food Controller, have stood at the head of the correspond-ing sections of the original Citizens Committee.    Mikulowski-Pomoreki is one of the most distinguished Polish authorities on agriculture and was before the war-Director of the Polish
Agricultural Academy in Galicia.    Theoe men are certain to do well in their own departmetn and to organise them efficiently in eo far a? it in at all possible to do so under the present conditions of Austrian and German occupation.3.     It remains to be seen whether the Polish Government as a whole will prove competent in dealing with the big problems of general policy.     $he two most prominent figures of Polish political life are not in the Government.    The German veto has for the time being excluded from all employment Count Adam Tarnowoki, the future leader of the Conservative aristocracy and bourgeois elements; and General pilsudski, the leader of the moderate Left, remains im-prisoned at Magdeburg.     Of those who are likely to go beyond him to the Left - of the Polish Bolsheviks - the leaders are as yet un-known.     They, as well as a fair proportion of the rank and file, are probably as yet undergoing a preliminary training in Russia.4.    In home affairs the new Government stands for conciliation all round, for effective co-operation in the building-up of the Polish State and the Polish administration, and for a concentration of power and authority in the Polish Government in Warsaw.     uVe&apos; &apos; &apos;        .shall counter every attempt to form a Government or army abroad,&quot; said M. de Kucharzewski in an intervievf with the Frankfurter Zeitung (November 23, 1917).     &quot;There is no longer any room for a policy of emigres, now that we have the possibility of organising our national affairs at home, and I shall give the lees room for the known attempts in that direction, the freer and more efficiently our national organisation is able to develop at home.&quot; , Unless they commit some very serious blundero, the Regency Council and theiCabinet will probably be able to make themselves the undisputed authority for the Polish nation.     Their, authority does not depend exclusively on the scope conceded to them by the Germans, but also on the way in which they fight, the Germans for an enlargement of their powers.     Of the men now in power none can be alleged to have
hunted fcr office or to have wormed himself into office &quot;by subservi-ence to the occupying Powers,    When men suoh as Prince 2*Lubomirski, Mgr. Chelmicki,. Count-Ostrowski or M. de Stecki crossover to the aide which desires to see the supreme Polish authorityestablished at Warsaw, this is not the action of individuals flittingover by stealth, and it would require considerable naivete to believethat their change of attitude does not represent a real change inpolitios and mark a movement of public opinion.    The position isolear.     Opinion in Poland is hardening on the point that whatever thefurther development of the war may bring, the essential work for thefuture of Poland can be done only from within*   Any possibility ofseparate peace between Germany and Russia fixes with even greaterweight the centre of gravity In Warsaw.    Moreover Poland is the lastcountry which is likely to let itself be led by emftgres.       Its ex-perienoe of emigre   &quot;Governments&quot;, &quot;Committees&quot; and &quot;Party Directoratesis too long and too painful.    They have had them ever since 1795.At different times Paris, London, and Geneva were the centres ofPolish political activity.     These external centres have left behinda sad memory of failure and ill-repute, although in the past theyfrequently included the true intellectual leaders of the nation.5, ;   The main difficulties of the Polish Government are certain todiscreetarise in connection with foreign affairs (which now go by the/name&apos; of &quot;political affairs&quot;) and in connection with afcmy questions.     The Germans are certain to do all they can to prevent the Polish Govern-ment from entering into touch with any of the Western Powers.    As regards the Polish Army, unless the position in the East undergoes a most radical transformation, the Germans will certainly try to pre-vent or delay the formation of such an army.    Obviously they do not any longer need Polish help against Russia.6.     Kucharzewski has repeatedly emphasised that he considers the
- mformation of o Polish army to be the first and most important task of the Government.     He is determined to raise it by conscription, and speaks of calling up three or four years classes, which are expected to yield about 100.000 recruits.   The legions are to be the cadres of that army.Until a few months age the question of forming a Polish army caused the most fundamental differences between the Polish parties.     The raising of a Polish army implied a definite attitude with regard to foreign politics - it does not now when there seems no danger of its ever being employed in the War.    Yet one can hardly expect even now conscription to prove a popular measure.     The adoption of such a measure by a Government which has not got the sanction of a Diet might seem al-most suicidal.     If nevertheless cautious men such as prince iubomirski, Archbishop Kakowski, Kucharzewski and Stecki have desided to steke everything on that attempt, one is led to assume that there must be cogent reasons for their doing so, and credit must be giften to them for a reasonable explanation.   This seems to be as follows;   Peace is likely to be concluded with Russia long before anarchy disappears in Russia, and it is equally certain that with the conclusion of peace Poland will become the seane of most violent social upheaval.   Almost two million Polish peasants and workmen now in Russia will come back and add very considerably to the inflammatory material which throughout the war has been gathering in that country, in the nearest proximity of Russia.     Unless therefore a Polish army is already in existence at the conclusion of peaoe there will be no force in Poland capable of protecting the Polish frontiers against the inroads of Russian marauding bands, or of coping with Internal disturbances.     If no such army is in existence, the Germans and Austrians will have a very good plea for eon-tinuing their occupation of- the country, and as a matter of fact, anyone who has anything at stake in Poland will beg them not to withdraw their armies too early.     The conclusion of peace is the most suitable moment
bothe1 ct which to demand a complete withdrawal of all foreign military forces, less this is done at the conclusion of peace, it may be found much re difficult to obtain it at a later date.    These we suppose, are . reasons which make the present Polish Government so keen on raising Polish army, and these are also the reasons which may prevail with a on3iderable part of educated Polish opinion.   But nevertheless an attempt to raise a Polish army will giye the opponents of the present polish Government a splendid opportuunity for attacking it and render-tag it unpopular in the country.On the other hand one cannot deny altogether the danger implied in the existence of a Polish army - conditions may change, and the exis-tence of a Polish army might yet change Poland into a belligerent state. 7,    Much time must however pass before that army i* formed - innumer-able obstacles have to be removed which the disruption of the original Polish Legions has put In the way of a Polish army.   Nothing can be done until those Legions are reconstituted, the men interned by the Germans in the, different concentration camps or prisons released, General Pilsudski liberated, the Legisnasies who had been transferred to the Austrian army rnd sent to different fronts returned, etc   Al-though eagerness is now shown by Jill Polish parties (which matter) to he;.l up the breach of last summer and to obliterate Its traces, yet such t veritable morass of party feuds, personal invective and embit-tered quarrels has grown up round the question of the Polish Legions that, even if the utmost tact and conciliation are exercised, it seems doubtful whether any one can settle the matter within a reasonable time. Moreover, practically every step will require the consent or even the co-operation of the Germans, and therefore, if the Germans are not in-clined to let the Poles form an army, they will easily be able to pre-vent it.   But the very same reason which with the Poles speaks in fav-vour of an army - the wish to terminate the German military occupation of Poland at the nearest possible date - is likely to move the Germans in the opposite direction.
