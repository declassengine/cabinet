SECRET.,ot-*&apos;.j oCIopy No..0 l/138/3&apos;95&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;        . wnrnrrtpht iSicFUTURE  OPERATIONS  IN  PALESTINE.1. The War Cabinet at their meeting on the 13th instant directed the General Staff to consider a project for carrying out the following alternative policies : : ---- (a.) Complete the conquest of the whole of Palestine, and hold the country for the remainder of the war. (b.) Continue the advance through Palestine and Syria, to the vicinity of Aleppor so as permanently to interrupt railway communication with Mesopotamia.For the purposes of (a) Palestine to be considered as embracing the whole country between Beersheba and Dan.2. General Allenby now has on the front Jaffa Jerusalem a total combatant force of 112,000 men, consisting of seven divisions and three cavalry divisions, and it will be seen in the attached telegram from him, dated 20th instant, that he calculates he may be able by June or July next to place a force of his present strength north of the Nazareth  Haifa line if the enemy does not oppose him with more than about 60,000 combatants, and provided there are no special difficulties met with in railway construction. He does not say how far north of the line Nazareth Haifa he expects to be able to go (Dan is some 40 miles north of it), but I shall assume that he contemplates being able to go sufficiently far to complete practically the conquest of Palestine.So far as this policy is concerned, therefore, the questions for considerationare: (a.) Is the enemy likely to oppose us with more than 60,000 men before Palestine is conquered ?(6.) Will General Allenby require further reinforcements to ensure holding the whole of Palestine for an indefinite period, assuming that he succeeds in occupying it ?As to these two points he says nothing, but the omission is probably intentional, as he would naturally consider that a question of this nature would best be considered by the Imperial General Staff, who alone are in possession of complete information regarding other fronts.3. The total combatant strength of the Turkish armies, including the German and Austrian troops now attached to them, is estimated at about 300,000 men. With Russia out of the war, Turkey can concentrate her efforts against us, and as she knows that the difficulties of our communications in Mesopotamia, which are already 500 miles long, prevent us from undertaking any serious advance up either the Tigris 6r the Euphrates, she need not keep any large force there. She must, however, keep some troops in the vicinity of Constantinople and on the coast of Syria, but after deducting the forces necessary for this purpose and for Mesopotamia, it is probable that the enemy could set free 180,000 combatants for a campaign in Northern Syria. The Director of Military Intelligence does not think that there are any appreciable number of Turkish reserves, and if he is right the only reserves will consist of such additional men as can be drawn from the remaining men of the 300,000 combatants and such further German reinforce-ments as may be sent to support the Turks.4. The Turks now have on the Jaffa Jerusalem front a combatant force of about 39,000 men, consisting of 11 divisions. It is probable that one other enemy division, which may be either a German or Turkish division, is by this time in the neighbourhood of Nablus, and possible that both of these divisions, the Turkish and the German, may be south of Damascus. Further, the Turks have begun to withdraw some of their troops from the Hedjaz, and therefore, in the near future, General Allenby may be opposed by a combatant force of about 60,000 men, of whom(B17/742)  50  12/17  H&amp;S  5390wo
some 11,000 may be German. A large part of this force has been badly defeated, its morale as a whole is low, it has lost large quantities of ammunition and stores which will be difficult to replace quickly, and it is said to be short of transport. If we could -continue forthwith to strike this force hard and to follow it up good results might be -obtained, but unfortunately, for the reasons given below, we cannot do this, and therefore the force will have an opportunity of recovering so far as it is capable of doing so.In addition to the two divisions mentioned above, now believed to be south fof Damascus, three more (one of which is German) are about Aleppo, one division can be withdrawn from the Hedjaz, one from Constantinople, one from Smyrna, and as the Russians and Roumanians have agreed to an armistice the two Turkish divisions on the Roumanian front can also be called upon (in fact one has already left the Roumanian front), and at least four be taken from the Caucasus. The enemy will, therefore, be in a position to replace. gradually the 11 worn divisions now on the Jaffa-Jerusalem line by 14 fresh divisions, and to withdraw and reconstitute his worn divisions and use them for the relief of divisions at the front. On the other hand, owing to deficiency of transport, 100.000 combatants are believed to be as many as the enemy can maintain between Jerusalem and Damascus, and the number may not exceed 80,000.5. The reason General Allenby does not expect to be able to get north of the line Nazareth Haifa before June or July is because time is required to bring the railway forward to Jaffa, to carry out preliminary operations against the Hedjaz railway, and to extend&apos; his railway as he advances.  His first object, vide his telegram of 14th instant, is to secure a line covering Jaffa and Jerusalem about 10 miles north of the latter place, with his right flank on the Jordan north of Jericho, and his left on the Mediterranean north of Jaffa.   Afterwards, when his right will be within 40 miles of the Hedjaz railway, he proposes to operate against the railway with the object of cutting off the Turks in the Hedjaz.    He considers this plan offers the best prospect of exploiting the recent successes he has already gained.    The Turks are still in Medina and have there  and  along  the  Hedjaz  railway a force  of some   15,000 to 20,000 men. General Allenby&apos;s proposed action, if successful, will bring him for the first time into direct touch with the Arabs, and this should have an encouraging effect upon them. He may, though this is not certain, be able to force the Turks to evacuate Medina and the effect of this in the Mahomedan world, coupled with the loss of Mecca, Baghdad, and Jerusalem will not be small.   Should we be fortunate, it is possible that we may succeed in cutting off a considerable part of the Turkish forces in the Hedjaz, but the Turks are known to be alive to this danger and our prospects of success depend much on the uncertain factor of Arab activity against the railway.Apart from these advantages General Allenby considers it a military necessity to clear away the Turks on the Hedjaz railway before advancing further north, and in this I agree with him. He could not otherwise go forward without having to leave such a large detachment to protect his right flank as would jeopardise the success of his main plans His railway will not be into Jaffa before the end ot January, and he has then to bring his right forward through some 20 miles of difficult country. It would therefore be optimistic to expect that he will be completely established on the line indicated above before the middle of February, when he should be able to deal with the Turks on the Hedjaz railway. How long this will take it is impossible to say, but when it is accomplished he can commence his main advance.6. By the middle of February the Turkish force of 60,000 combatants mentioned in paragraph 4 may have grown to 80,000, and from then on the enemy&apos;s forces may increase up to a maximum of 100.000 combatants. How many of these may be German will of course depend upon the assistance Germany may give.General Allenby apparently excludes in his telegram the division which is coming from Mesopotamia, but with this division, and if he is kept fully supplied with drafts, his strength will amount to about 145,000 combatants. With this force it is possible that he may be able to complete the conquest of Palestine, even though he may be opposed by more than 60,000 Turks. If and when completed, we shall obtain the political advantages of the occupation of additional enemy territory, will be astride the Hedjaz railway and thus secure Arabia, our successful progress should bring in the Druses on -our side, and we shall have in our immediate rear the fertile district of the Hauran which will be a serious loss to the enemy and a corresponding gain to us.7. As to the price which we may have to pay for these gains, the advance from Gaza-Beersheba to Jaffa Jerusalem cost us J 9,000 casualties.   In the next advance
it may no. longer be a question of pursuing a beaten enemy, but of fighting one who will have had time to recover, and who will have a stiffening Of German troops, as well as some reserves in rear whose number we cannot calculate. The distance from our present line to Dan is 100 miles, and recent experience has shown that with every possible prepara-tion and the most complete military success we cannot advance more than about 35 miles at a.time without waiting for the railway. Therefore, after dealing with the Turks on the Hedj-az railway, General Allenby will have to make three such advances, and there seems no reason to suppose that any one of these would cost us iess than the advance to Jerusalem. &apos; The enemy would incur, we may hope, at, least equal losses, and the extent to which he could replace them would depend upon the conditions mentioned at the end of paragraph 3. What these conditions may be is uncertain, but we cannot wisely base our plans on the assumption that the Germans will not support the Turk, or that the Turks will, seeing us definitely committed to an overland campaign, fail to draw upon their reserve units on the Syrian coast and in other parts of the country. If this is admitted, we must also admit the necessity of keeping our own force up to full strength.This means that we must budget for 57,000 battle casualties, a present deficiency of 17,000 men and, say, 20,000 for sick wastage, or a total of about 90,000 drafts in order to take the force to Dan. It must also be remembered that all our divisions will probably have been frequently engaged during a period of some 3 or 4 months, and that although the fighting may be less severe than in France the conditions are in other respects more arduous. No troops can be expected to go through a hot weather in these circumstances without a rest, and General Allenby may accordingly require two or three more divisions for relief purposes and to ensure his holding the country for the duration of the war. If the War Cabinet decide to proceed with the campaign, it will be necessary to consult him on this point as his telegram is somewhat vague.&apos; 8. The Director-General of Military Railways has calculated that the additional railway material required for the maintenance of a force of eight divisions and three cavalry divisions on the northern frontier of Palestine is 220 miles of track, -3-5 locomotives and 1,000 wagons and 1,000 additional railway personnel.9. I have consulted the Admiralty with regard to the port of Haifa, and am informed that ships cannot come alongside the quay, and are exposed to north-westerly and northerly winds when lying off the harbour; that unloading has to take place by lighter, and is liable to frequent interruption by the weather; and that the present capacity of the port is reported to be 300 tons per day. Little relief will therefore be obtained from the port, although its capacity could no doubt be improved upon.10. To sum up, if it is decided to undertake the conquest of the whole of Palestine and hold that country, we must budget for drafts to the extent of 90,000 men during the next 4. months, and reinforcements amounting to two or three divisions (subject to what General Allenby may say). Further, we cannot exclude the probability of having to keep the force in the country for an indefinite period, even if we are not compelled by the enemy to strengthen it, for if it is to our interest to get Turkey out of the war it is equally to Germany&apos;s interest to keep her in.We shall require a large increase in railway material, and a corresponding provisi of shipping (see also paragragh 14). Orders for 40 locomotives were placed in America earl)&apos;- in the year with a view to possible developments in Palestine. If the campaign is not proceeded with we shall be able to send these locomotives to Italy, where they are urgently needed at the present moment, and to divert at once over 600 wagons to the Western front, where they are not less required. The demands made by the Italian situation upon French rolling stock have seriously impaired our own and the French power of transferring troops rapidly in France, and the present situation n the Western front and in Italy makes it a matter of importance that this state ^f affairs should be remedied at the earliest possible moment.11. Having regard to all the above, to the present state of our man-power, to the general military situation, and to the naval and shipping position, it is for serious con-sideration whether the advantages to be gained by an advance to Dan are worth the cost and risk involved. The answer depends to some extent, though by no means entirely, upon whether the conquest of Palestine would put Turkey out of the war. As to this there is a scarcity of foodstuffs, but even if peace were made with us, we would be unable to do anything to relieve the food scarcity, though doubtless the distribution(6390) &apos;   A 2
of, th;e fopd actually in, the) country would; be; facilitated by the cessation of military traffic on the railways. ; ((^ U -   -   1  &apos;i       &apos; &apos; ; ;-.:\:      * 1fOQ-yi; do not claim any; special qualification to speak on the political aspect, but it-would seem to be very difficult for Turkey to shake off the German grip-even if glie wished to do so. The Turkish General Staff and War Office are largely in the-ibands of Germans; Turkish armies and minor units are commanded by German officers:; German machine-gun units and artillery are to be found in all Turkish theatres ; Germany is the source of Turkish munition supplies; and several thousand German and Austrian troops are in Constantinople, which is&apos;at the mercy of German warships, the &quot; Goben &quot; and the &quot; Breslau,&quot; anchored in the Golden Horn.1 &apos;12i As to the general military situation I can say little more to help the War Cabj.net than I have said in my memorandum of the 19th ultimo. The opinion of the General Staff is that we should incur a grave risk by increasing our liabilities in secondary theatres in the present critical circumstances, and that we ought to cut down our commitments in those theatres to a defensive minimum and concentrate all other resources in the West. General Allenby should be able to exploit his success in the direction of the Hedjaz railway, and generally to make the Turk very uncomfortable, with a less force than he will have when the division arrives from Mesopotamia.The vital point to remember is that the conquest of Palestine requires men and material which can be provided only at the expense of the.Western front; and I would submit that the War Cabinet should, before deciding to undertake the Palestine campaign, consider closely the probability of the enemy attempting to force a decision on the Western front, including Italy, early in 1918, and the possibility of his succeeding in doing so if we do not concentrate our resources there.Whichever course the War Cabinet may decide to adopt it is essential that the decision should be reached at once. If General Allenby is to continue his advance, the necessary arrangements should be commenced immediately, more especially as regards the provision of railway material, in order that advantage may be taken of the cool season. If, on the other hand, troops are to be withdrawn to the West, it is important they should arrive there early in the Spring, and as the War Cabinet know transport of troops by sea is at present a very slow process.13. With regard to the policy of continuing the advance to Aleppo, some 250 miles north of Dan, it will be observed that for this undertaking General Allenby asks for 8 or 10 more divisions. It is, however, impossible accurately to say now what force inay be required next July in order to advance beyond Palestine, and therefore I hope that the War Cabinet will agree to the examination of this further project being postponed for the present. I may add that the possibility of undertaking combined naval and military operations on the Syrian coast has been repeatedly examined by the General Staff and the Admiralty War Staff in combination. The feasibility of a landing at Ayas Bay was last considered at a joint conference on September 23rd last,, and the question of providing shipping in connection with a proposal received from General Foch was examined by the First Sea Lord on 12th October; in neither case did the Admiralty War Staff consider the operation to be feasible in present circumstances.14. The Prime Minister has asked me to give an estimate of the number of troops and the amount of shipping which could be released from other theatres of war as the result of the successful occupation by British troops of&quot; the Aleppo railway junction. I am afraid I can give no very useful answer because it is impossible to say how many troops we should require to maintain at Aleppo after seizing the railway junction. This would depend mainly on the amount of assistance Germany gave Turkey, and this cannot, be foreseen some 9 to 12 months hence, the earliest date at which we could hope to be at Aleppo.As we advance northwards through Palestine the danger to Mesopotamia would become less, as the enemy would not dare to make an attack in force in that theatre while we threatened his communications. Consequently the Mesopotamia force might gradually be reduced by about one-half, namely, to three divisions and a cavalry division. Further than this we could probably not go, owing to the large extent of territory to be occupied and the turbulent population of a great part of the country.This reduction in Mesopotamia would not, however, mean a reduction in Asiatic Turkey, but an increase until such time as the campaign is finished and it becomes possible greatly to reduce the force sent to Aleppo. This is so because, on the assumption
(Signed)c.i.g;s.General Staff,War Office.,26th December, 1917.ihat a minimum reinforcement of -eight-divisions-is given to General Allenby, the thifee divisions saved from Mesopotamia would be needed for Aleppo, plus five divisions frbfla ; France, I have asked the Shipping Controller what would be the resultant effect on tonnage, and he informs me that it would mean a largely increased strain because the maintenance of five divisions in Syria is a much more onerous shipping proposition than the maintenance of a similar number in France, while as the Indian divisions how in Mesopotamia are supplied from India, their transference to Syria would result in a longer line of sea communication.
APPENDIX I. to 0. 1/138/395.Secret.[Operations.1From War Office to General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, General Headquarters, Egypt.(No. 47761, cipher.) . 12th December, 1017, 5.20 p.m.i In view of the change in position created by your recent victory over Turks, and by revised information as to enemy strength and breakdown in his transport, War Cabinet would like to have your opinion by telegram as soon as possible as to manner in which, and extent to which, it is possible to exploit your success in Palestine with forces now under your Command, plus the division under orders from Mesopotamia.APPENDIX II. to 0. 1/138/395.Secret.[Operations.]From General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Egypt, to Chief of the Imperial General Staff, War Office. &apos;14th December, 1917.(No. E.A. 598.) (Despatched 6.20 p.m., received 11.25 p.m.)Your No. 47761, cipher, 12th December.I consider it essential, at present season, &quot;with rains imminent, and after recent experience of effect of comparatively small rainfall, that any advance northward during next 2 months can only be made step by step; owing to badness of roads I must depend on the progress of my railway. After January, weather will keep on improving and in this part of Palestine summer weather is more suitable for campaigning than winter. I accordingly propose first, as essential, to advance to the line of the Wadi - Auja flowing east, and the Wadi El Jib Wadi Abu Lejja--Nahr Auja flowing west, and to consolidate on that line. Secondly, I hope to operate against Hedjaz railway during wet season, and while waiting for my railway to overtake me, as there are still 20,000 Turks south of Amman. If found practicable, this seems to offer best prospect of exploiting success already gained. Thirdly, if circumstances are favour-able, I may gradually push forward my left towards Tul Keram, covering railway construction and perfecting preparations for offensive with Naval co-operation. Either as a reinforcement on this front, or in the improbable event of trouble arising in Western Desert, the Division from Mesopotamia will be very valuable.APPENDIX III. to O. 1/138/395.Secret.[Operations.]From Chief of the Imperial General Staff, War Office, to General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, GeneralHeadquarters, Egypt.(No. 48236, cipher.) &apos; 18th December, 1917, 8.15 p.m.I have been asked by the War Cabinet, who attach great importance to eliminating Turkey, to submit a project for carrying out following alternative policies: (a.) To complete the conquest of the whole of Palestine and hold the country for the remainder of the war.(b.) To continue the advance through Palestine and Syria to the vicinity of Aleppo so as to cause permanent interruption of railway communication with Mesopotamia.For the purposes of (a) Palestine is to be considered as embracing the whole country between Dan and Beersheba.Please send me your views as soon as possible as to the execution of these policies, with your estimate as to how long you will take for each operation.
APPENDIX IV. to 0. 1/138/395.Secret.[Operations.] ^From General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Egypt, to Chief of the Imperial General Staff, War Office.20th December, 1917.(No. E.A. 657.) (Handed in 2.40 a.m., received 9.15 a.m.)19th. Your No. 48236, cipher, 18th. (a.) Understanding Dan to be about Banias, i.e., half way between Nazareth and Damascus, I calculate I might be able by June or July to place force of my present strength north of Nazareth Haifa line, assuming enemy cannot oppose me with more than about 60,000 fighting strength and provided there are no special difficulties met with in railway construction.(b.) To advance further towards Aleppo would mean to move against Damascus and Beirut. On that front enemy is served by broad-gauge railway with good lateral communications and apparently ideal ground for defence. Broad-gauge railway would put him on level with me as regards numbers that could be maintained. 1 should require 16 or 18 divisions besides my mounted corps to ensure success against Damascus-Beirut line if strongly held, but this is probably more than my railway could support even when doubled and when allowance is made for sea transport. My estimate is made on the supposition enemy will make use of his broad-gauge railway to its full capacity. I would point out that Aleppo is 350 miles distant and my single line of railway advances about half mile a day. Railhead of my double line is at Bir el Mazar, but the doubling of railway has had to be stopped during my present advance. For my immediate plans see my telegram No. E. A. 598, 14th December, and I think it advisable before advancing much further north to -.&apos;dear Turkish forces on Medina railway.
