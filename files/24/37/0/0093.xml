$he great event of the early part of the month of December in Norway .was the trial cf German spies at Bergen.     The chief object of these spies has evidently been to come in contact, by bribery or otherwise, with persons In Bergen who oould furnish them with information as to the conditions in Great Britain and the North Sea. There are altogether five groups of spies.     It is not necessary to give the details of the various esses here, but the trial would furnish interesting reading to those naive persons who still, after &amp;$ years of war, imagine that the tales of German espionage are exaggerated and fanciful.    The result shows that a number of the accused were in correspondence with England, by means of letters written on the borders of newspapers in invisible ink or otherwise, and that the German agents were iJinformed of the departure of Norwegian vessels which were in due course torpedoed by the tf-boots. No doubt can be left in the mind of any reasonable man that Norway has been and is honeycombed with German agents acting under every kind of disguise.     It is equally clear that there are correspondingiagents in this country.     A number of the assused were found guilty and were sentenced to short terms of imprisonment,   The trial of the persons implicated in the great Boab Plet will take place during this month.An instance of the insidious thoroughness of the German espionage was furnished during the trial at Bergen.     The forged British pass-port furnished to Gramatski (one of the accused) was dated from a town in, India;   but this, some tiiae ago was totally destroyed by an earthquake.
Since the defection of Russia the Norwegian Press has in general adopted a pessimistic tone as to the prospects of the Entente.   Even such strongly pro-Ally papers as the &apos;Tidens Tegn&apos; join in the chorus.     The United States are evidently considered the determining factor r &quot;Now that Russia has collapsed and is perhaps destined to become a vast German hinterland&apos;, can the support furnished by America reach Prance in time to cope with the reserves drawn by Germany and Austria-Hungnry from the Eastern front?&quot;   Meanwhile President Wilson&apos;s message to Congress insisting that the war must be carried to a victorious conclusion has had a sobering effect, as has htd the fret that the German Colonial Empire has ceased to exist.Apart from the Young-Socialists who have sent a message of sym-apthy to their comrades the Bolsheviks, the recent performances of the present regime in Russia have not met with approval.     It is, however, admitted that an accurate knowledge of conditions in Russia is not at present available and there is, as in Sweden, a tendency to adopt a waiting attitude to events in that country.     Up to the present the Norwegian Government has not recognised the Bolshevik Government.There has been considerable interest in Norway in regard to the strained relations between Denmark and her dependency Iseland.     The question in dispute is whether the Icelandic flag, the use of which is legal in Iceland and her territorial waters, may be flown by Icelandic merchant vessels on the high seas.     The Prime Minister of Iceland, Mr. Ion Magnasson, has recently been in Copenhagen but found that the Danish Government would not agree to the claim except in connection with a general revision of the whole of the question of relations between Denmark and Iceland.     The real fact is that Icelend wishes to cut adrift from Denmark, retaining only a common Soverign.    It is not impossible that Norway may be called upon to assume the role of . mediator in the same way as Denmark at the time of the separation of the aual-Eingdom in 1906.    It is unlikely that there will be any
attempt to retain Iceland against her will, the only real question being whether that island can exist as an independent State.   There is no talk of any re-union with the ancient mother-country (Norway), and the sympathy shows, for Iceland at Christiania is merely that of a spectator.As is not unnatural, the submarine warfare forms a chronic source of annoyance to the Norwegians.     It also acts as a counter-irritant to the blockade.   The statistics for November of the losses of the Norwegian merchant fleet are not without interest.. At the end of October there were 3273 vessels availible representing about 2,100,000 Tons.     In the course of November 26 ships were lost and 36 were built, but the balance of the ten shows a decrease in tonnage of 85,000 Tons.The Conference of the Scandinavian Friends of Peace concluded in Christiania early in December.     The final meeting terminated any-thing but peacefully, as the Mayor of StookhQlm, one of the Swedish delegates, fcoved a resolution of sympathy with and adherence to the peace offer of the Russian Bolsheviks.   The majority of the peace apostles present showed remarkably little symoathy with the doings of their Russian brethren and the resolution, after an acrimonious dis-oussion found only 6 supporters.     Among other remarkable suggestions put forward in the Mayorfs resolution was that a petition should be presented to the German Government praying them to allow South Jutland to revert to Denmark.England has cancelled most of the clauses of the Fishery Agree-ment with Norway;   but it is considered highly necessary by a strong party in the country that the Norwegian Government should come to an agreement both with Great Britain and America before the great fisheries begin.
There has been no event of political importance recently beyond the appointment of Mr. Stuevold-Hansen as Minister of Supply in the place of Mr. Yik, who resigned owing to repealed attacks in Parliament.     The office of food-controller is an unenviable one in any country just at present, and there is not   much liklihood that Mr, Eansen will fare better than his predecessor.
