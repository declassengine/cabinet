&quot;Mils Document is thfe Property of / /His Britannic r-.?jes?y&apos;G Government,9 0&apos;NMAL ASPECT OP RUSSQ-GEEKA1I ARMISTICE. u^0tfAmo^Amf01? War Cabinet by First Lord of the Admiralty.The following remarks are offered on tho off cot on Naval matters of the published terms of the Russo-German Armistice (set out as an appendix to this Memorandum):-1*    Article,, 5r is the only one which directly concerns the future naval conduct of the war.2.    Paragraphs 1 and 2, although not very clear, indicate that in practice the Amtiftfrioe extends to Arctic Russi,^, except for some points yet to be a,greod upon*    As a result of-this we may be asked to withdraw our men-of-war stationed in these waters; but the protection of any supplies, if sent, might be a reason for us to ask to keep them there,for we may have to send some necessities by this route.3.  js qux ghj-Pft Imv to leave Itoanslu it will he impossible to afford any protection from submarine attack in these seas, owing to the distance therefrom of our nearest base in the Shetlands,    Should supplies have to be sent under such conditions * it should only be done in Russian Ships, and it is suggested that in such an eventuality only the bare amount of Russian tonnage necessary should be so employed.4.   Any other Russlah tonnage should be requisitioned or evon transferred to the British Flag.    The latter proposal might cause trouble^ but since there are dtill some British ships in the Baltic this fact could be used as an argument that tho Russian ships are taken over in exchange for those shut up in the Baltic,feth December,1917.
5.  . Tfrft demarcation line in thaAltJ^ outs across theSouthern approach to tho Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland(Svenska Hogarne is a Swedish Island), and the free movementof war vessels is only to bo allowed on their own respectivesides of the, line of demarcation.The Russians have given a guarantee that oursubmarines will not cross this lino.    They are thus debarred-.&apos; - .from entering waters whore German vessels may be met, and,&apos;   therefore, from any operations against them.6.   QpM\WV%al navtefttarQH is permitted, so that thei,enemy will be able to import by sea iron ore from Sweden, copper etc, from Russia, as soon as ever the ice conditions in the Baltic permit,7* As. soon as p-CaoQ is .siffiofl, all our men-of-war willy  have to leave Russian waters.    It is, therefore, roost desirable that we should endeavour to /rot all refugees out of the country boforo this eventuality.     It is suggested that I as many as possible should bo sent to Dalny, via the Siberian11 Railway; whilst any who could not leave till the last moment should be sent to Murmansk, or home via Sweden and Bergen.8.   Thoro are 3 &quot;C&quot; Class and 4 &quot;12&quot; Class British ^frlWlaOfi JJl the Baltic..      It is not possible to get them out of the Baltic, and tho question of their destruction to prevent them falling into the hands of the Germans has been considered.    It has been approved to send home the majority of the crows, leaving a small care and maintenance party to look after the vessels.    Orders have been given that in the event of there being any danger of the submarines falling into the hands of the Germans they shall be destroyed by the care and maintenance party.
9.    There are about 35 Russian armed trawlers and some yaehts in Arctic Russia which were used for t*e patrol of these waters in conjunction with the British vessels.    Many of the trawlers were built in England and are good serviceable vessels. They would bo a welcome increase to our auxiliary patrol forces and it is suggested that negotiations for the purchase of as many as possible should be commenced immediately^.The following H.M. Ships and Allied Merchant Ships areat Northern Russian Ports:-H.M.S. &quot;Glory0 H.H.S. &quot;lehigenia&quot; A.B.S. &quot;Tithonus&quot; 4 Drifters 8 Trawlers H.M.S. &quot;Andes&quot; forratings fromSubmarines etc.desirability of acquiring Russian trawlers in the White was mentioned in Admiralty andum of 15.12,17 (War not 295 Minute 17 (b)J iditions which the British issador at Petrograd should instructed to press for in Terms of Peace made between Bolsheviks and Germany&quot;Merchant Ships, etc. In Archangel.5 Russians (1 damaged and not expected to get but:1 slightly damaged and expectedto &quot;get out: 3 unloading and will take cargoesand get out). 1 British.

Can be towed away and again made into a ship).
In order to bring away the Ambassador and members of Embassy Staff and various Missions, it will be necessary to send the s.s. "Porto", capable of accommodating 2,000 refugees. She will, however, not be able to leave England until the end of January. The Foreign Office has been informed of this.

Archangel has been evacuated.

The S.N.O., Murmansk, has orders to be ready to evacuate that place.
