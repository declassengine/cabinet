WAR CABIBET.W A&apos; R     AIMS.(Draft Statement by General Smuts.)The Russian peace negotiations with the representatives of the Central Powers at Brest Litovsk form an important event which can-not hut have far-reaching consequences, and calls for an examination and definition of our attitude to the important issues raised. This is all the more so because the present Russian Government heve through the Press invited the attention of the Powers not represented at the negotiations to the principles of a general peace as discuss-ed at Breast.   While not taking.part in these negotiations, the res-ponsibility for and consequences of which,must rest with the Russian Government and people, we consider it advisable, to define our atti-tude to the principal issues raised at these negotiations, and to. state our war aims as clearly as possible.There is no ambiguity or obscurity in regard to British war.aims. They have been stated and restated many times by the responsible&apos; leaders of the British peoples during, thescourse of this war.- Appar-ent and superficial differences of opinion there hove been, .and they were only to be expected where issues so important and far-reaching 1 in their scope were at stake and were being discussed by different people on public platforms.   But beneath all &quot;the?.superficial differ-ences of expression there has been constant continuous underlying unity of aim and intention.   Our war aims can never be stated too often or too clearly and simply,, not only in view. of-.;the magnitude of the issues involved,., but,also of the. confusing effect, of the enemy propaganda.When -men by the million are.being called upon to suffer and-.Jdie and vast populations are being subjected to-the sufferings,/.
and privations of war on a scale unprecedented in the history of the world, they arc-, entitled to know for what cause or causes they are &quot;being sacrificed..-   It is only the clearest;, greatest and justest of causes that can justify the continuances-even for one day of this unspeakable agony of tho nationsv . And wo ought to &quot;be able to state&quot; clearly and definitely not only the principles for which wo are fighting but also their definite and concrete applications to the war map of the world0&quot;7e may begin by clearing away some misunderstandings and stating what we are not fighting for.    7e are not fighting a war of aggression against the German people.   Their leaders have persuaded them that they are fighting a war. of self-defence against a league of rival nations bent on the destruction of Germany.    That is not so.    The destruction or disruption of Germany&apos;or the German people has never been a war aim.with us from the first day of this war to this &apos; day.   Most reluctantly and indeed quite unprepared for the dreadful ordeal we were forced to join in this war in self defence, in   defence of the violated public law of Europe, and in vindica-tion of the ::ost solemn treaty obligations on which the public system of Europe rested, and on which Germany had ruthlessly trampled in her invasion of Belgium.   &apos;7e had to join in the struggle or stand aside and see Europe go under and brute force triumph over public right, and international :!njustice.    It was only the realisation, of that dreadful alternative that forced, the British people into the war.   And from that ori6inal attitude they have never, swerved,    However deeply they have been shocked by,the barbarous warfare and the savagery of the German armies.they have never- aimed at the break up of the German peoples crthdi s integration
dis-ln-tegratljm of their state or country * * Germany hasoccupied a great, position in the world to which, the geniusand energy and other greet-qualities of her people fullyentitle her..   It is not our wish or- intention to questionor destroy that position for the future &quot;but rather to turnher aside from hopes and schemes of military domination andto see her devote all her strength to the great beneficenttasks of the world and the development of those peacefuldemocratic- ideals on which the future security and prosperityof mankind rests..Nor would we continue this war merely to alter ordestroy the Imperial constitution   of Germany, much as weconsider that military autocratic constitution a dangerousanachronism in the 20th century.     The adoption of a reallydemocratic constitution by Germany, would be the most convincingevidence that in her the old spirit of military dominationhad indeed died in this war, and would make it much easierfor us to conclude a bread democratic peace with her3 Butafter all that is a question only for the German people, todecide.       They would be easier and better neighbours underreal parliamentary institutions and would require less carefuland anxious watching by the other peoples.   But we have nointention of interfering in their domestic affairs which mustbe left to them to settle.What then are we fighting for ?.Our one primary and dominating war aim is to secure a goodand lasting democratic peace - a peace which will notregard the interests of any particular country or power somuch as the lasting good of Europe and the world as a whole.For such a peace .two conditions are essential : in the  ..first place that the military menace of Central Europeshall
shall not in future continue to dominate the International situation; and in the second;   that in the territorial readjustments which will follow this war special regard shall he hac to the principle of nationality or the self-determina-tion of nations, as it is called in the Russian phrase.   Ho war aim should he permissible which does not satisfy either or both of these conditions.For the purpose of obtaining a good and lasting peace these two conditions are interdependent and bound up with each other and no real peace is obtainable which fails to satisfy both of these conditions.   The fatal mistake which has been made by the present rulers of the Russian people is to assume that the principle of National Self-determination can be vindicated apart from the overthrow of tk^NRussian Military domination,   They forget that no small people is safe in the enjoyment of its freedom so long as it lives in the neighbour-hood and as. it were under the shadow of any great ambitious military autocracyt   In their negotiations for a separate peace with Germany before whose forces thoir Armies are rapidly melting away they have deserted the National principle and have deserted those small Slav peopleswho rightly looked to them for protection against German domination.   Under these circumstances they might also find that the break-up of Russia,  to which they have so light heartedly agreed, may be the prelude, not to the freedom of Its National Groups, but to their common economic&apos; if net political enslavment.to Germany.The former Allies of Russia yhorn she has left after breaking the most solemn pledges of common action - can only   look on her fate with the deepest disappointment and regret, as her action has placed it beyond their po* er to intervene effectively on her behalf.   They certainly will not take any part in peace negotiations which mean the humiliation anddownfall
no. e[downfall of Russia, and would, if they joined he ,s moan dishonour to the rsiiory o: our 6ellr.nt d- ad and despair of tho future of the world,.   In ite of the defection -of Russia we moan to persevere with our other Hies in the struggle until we have achieved victory* that is to say til -ee are in a position by the combined pressure of will itsry moral e&amp;ohomio -forces, to compel Germany to adeept siidh fair and just terms of peace as will constitute proper reparation for the pact and affordcessary and adequate guarantees for the future peace and security of the world-.It appears from so much of the peace negotiations-as the Russian md German Governments have seen fit to publish that the principal basis aid doto by the Russian delegates was the self-determination of the Rations or national groups involved in this war, and this principle waseclarod to cover the early evacuation -of the occupied territories, thet&quot; -       -      inestoration to independence of the nations who wore/dependent beforehe war, and the decision by subordinate national groups, of their owniiture by.way of/general referendum to bo held as soon as the occupiedterritories should have been evacuated-.theIt is unnecessary to point out that/Central. Powers-, while in-brm agreeing to the Russian formula,&apos; have in substance ma.de such eservetions as really to negative It&apos;,     They do not agree Jtneqivoeally to evacuate the occupied countries but evidently -ntend to remain&apos; in military occupation Of important centres;   they bsqlutely decline to agree to the self-determination - of - subordinate tional groups ouch ys Poland and Armenia;   and in reference to the Restoration of formerly independent nations such as Belgium and erbia they purposely resort to vague and ambiguous phraseology hieh might hereafter be capable of any convenient &quot;interpretation.. *ssis having elected to negotiate with the enemy afuer having &apos;/&quot;-pt her Allies, and destroyed her own military or.-vni ;ation
* ft * . 241and power   is in no position to insist on substantial compliance witb her high principles and can only accept the vague illusory and unreliable German substitutes presented to her.     Germany while ostentatiously disclaiming annexations and doing lip service to the Prussian formula of National self-determination, is in reality doing her best to:emasculate it and to use it as a convenient means for securing the peaceful penetration, ... by so-called popular referenda, of neighbouring territories such as C our land, I, i tire am a and others.Ana thus, with the connivance of the Bolshevik Government, the formula of the revolution will be used to undo the revolution and to promote the cause of Autocracy.On us rests the plain duty to stand by the great causes of Domorcaey and Nationality, whatever happens and whatever-emerges from the Peace negotiations of the Russian Hovolution-arieswith the German Autocrats.      V7e shall not put our faith in Ruesian formulas, or in Gorman interpretations of them.   Tc as the vindication of the t*-tional principle means not vague formulas but certain very plain and unmistakeable propositions which go to the root of all the issues involved in this world conflict.     If the national principle is to be maintained and the public law of Europe&apos;which protects great and small alike is to be vindicated certain definite war aims will have to beachieved.     So far as we are concerned they are tike  alluring;--fl)     The evacuation of Belgium and her restoration tofull pre-war independence as well as reparation for all damage done.(2)     Ths evacuation and restoration of&quot;Serbia,. Montenegro and Soumania to their full status as independent States. If in accordance with national principles it be deemed necessary to provide for the re-adjustment of boundaries in the case of some of these countries, adequate territorial 00m-pensation shall be given in such cases, while the prospect of a more comprehensive settlement of Balkan questions should, not be excluded. -(3) The
(.3)     The evacuation and restoration of the occupied Departments of- France as well as the satisfaction on National principles of the legitimate claims of France to Alsace-Lorraine . ,(4).     A similar satisfaction of the legitimate claims of the Italians for union with those of her own race and tongue .(5)     We desire the maintenenance of the Turkish Empire in th homelands of the Turkish race with its Capital at Constan-tinople , while the exits of the Mediterranean to the Black Sea are internationalised and neutralised.   Of the outlying portions of the Turkish Empire , Arabia to receive full independence: while in the cases of Armenia, Mesopotamia, Palestine and Syria,.the local national groups should be consulted and in case they desire separation from Turkey those consenting shall become autonomous States under the protection of one or more of the European Powers . ; The Turkish public debt to be Readjusted in consequence..,.(6)       The &quot;restoration of the former. Polish Kingdom or State.(7)       With regard to the German Colonies the British Prime Minister has repeatedly declared that they are held, at the dis-posal of a Conference whose decision must have primary regard to the wishes an&apos;d interests of the native Inhabitants of such Colonies .,  The natives Ir&amp;e in their various tribal organlza-tions under Chiefs- and Councils who are competent to consult en speak for their tribes and members end thus to represent their wishes end interests in regard to their disposal..   The general principle of National self-determination is therefore as applic able in their cases as in those of occupied European population The German declaration , that the natives of the German Colon:as have , through their military fidelity in the war , shown their attachment and&apos; resolve under all circumstances to remain with Germany,, is applicable not to. the German Colonies generally, bi A^^MP: only  &apos;
only to one of -them and in that case (German Bast Africa) the German authorities secured the attachment not of the native population as a whole..&apos; Which is aAd remains profoundly Anti-German, hut only of a Small warlike class from whom their . . Askaris or soldiers were selected.     Thedo they attached to themselves hy conferring on them a highly privileged position over against the hulk of tho native population, which enabled these Askaris to assume a lordly and oppressive superiority over the rest of - the natives.     By this and other means they.secured the attachment of a very small and insignificant minority whose Interests wore directly opposed to those of the rest of tho population and for whom they have no right to speak,   $he Gorman treatment of their Aativo populations in tho ir Colonies has boor, such as amply to justify their fear of submittihg the future of those Colonies to the wishes of tho&apos;;.ativcs themselves.   -There remains-most important but most difficult of all-tho group of war Aims ; which are directed to the pcov^iTtion of future Wars and the settlement on International differences by pacific means.   The measureless&quot; suffofiiiganfi losses of this war have opened the oyos o: mankind %6 the dai-ger of self-destruction which threatens tho /future of civilisation aAC every wise expedient should, bo adopted to prove At a recur re ncc cf war in future.   To that end we consider it essential that the peace treaty shall include general provisions which shall bine the Governments coi.cori.ed to the abolition of Military conscription and the limitation of Armaments and the means and-scale Of future warfare/to tho compulsory submission of future International disputes -to-arbitratioi., and to the :institution of a regular Conference or &quot;--itagUo- of Nations which, shall coAtrol the execution of thuso general provisions and  aviso adequate machinery for-the purposo.These arc our specific :\i&amp;r Aims ohthe attainment of which wo are prepared - to - jOin in a general peace.    There are besides many&apos; other desirable objects which wo should like to achieve but which do not in our view justify a prolongation of the horrows and evon growing-losses and-dagger of this war.. The liberation or autonomy of the oppressed nationalities of Aurope and the spread of the widest democratic. . . ... .........
freedom ?mong all peoples capable of political self-government are indeed worthy of every endeavour. But above all Europe, bleeding to death from her wounds, needs peace at the earliest date consistent with the attainment of the essential needs above set out. To the growth of a stronger public opinion among the peoples, and the  awakening of the ethical conscience of mankind, must be left the completion of the great tasks of Liberty and Democracy to which this War has given an irresistible impetus. Before that impetus the dark malignant forces of military autocratic Imperialism will be finally scattered.

In widely published appeals the present Bolsheviks leaders of Russia have referred to the so-called annoxationist or imperialistic aims of the British Empire. The charge is sufficiently refuted by the foregoing recital of our War Aims.

The peoples of the British Empire have gone to War not for gain of territory, but for the maintenance of public law; the prevention of the military dictatorship of Germany and the terrorisation of the rest of the world by her. They have no military aims or ambitions; their tasks are the tasks of  peace; their greatest interest and aim is peace.

The outlying Nations of the British Empire joined voluntarily in the War for the above purposes, and besides performing deeds of deathless valour on most of the battle fields of Europe they have prevented the spread of German Militerism by the conquest of the German Colonial system. And they will not consent to any peace which means the restoration of the dangers they have overcome and the extension of militarism to the young and rising communities who are developing the waste places of the earth. They are a league of Free Nations, a great landmark in political history, and a beacon light to the peoples of the world in their gropings towards peaceful International Government. So far from entertaining Annoxationist or imperialistic ambitions it is their dearest wish that the nations of the world may be guided by their precedent and example to the attainment of the peaceful international system of the future.
