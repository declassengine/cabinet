secret.Intelligence Bureau,Department of Informaticn. CRw/034.WEEKLY   REPORT   ON   RUSSIA. XXXIV. (1 January, 1918).A clear distinction must tie made between the external and the internal policy of the Bolshevik Government;   in the former case they have proclaimed a peace programme based on democratic principles, in the latter they have thrown to the wind every principle of democracy by the imprisonment of the Cadets and by the refusal to allow the Constituent Assembly ta meet.(1) Foreign Policy.*The Russian proposals for a general peace were summed up in six clauses, of which the most important was the following:-&quot;Nationalities not hitherto in the enjoyment of political independence are to be allowed the right to decide by means of a referendum whether they elect to be united to other nations or te acquire independence&quot;, and that &quot;the referendum shall be so arranged as to assure complete freedom of voting&quot;.The reply of the Central Powers was handed in to the Russians on December 26.     while agreeing to the restoration of the independence of conquered territories, the Central Powers refused to apply the Russian principle of self-determination to peoples within the frontiers of existing States.   Such questions are to be solved &quot;by every State with its peoples independently in a constitutional manner&quot;.   This is, of course, intended to overcome the difficulties of self-determination in Austria-Hungary, as the Germans know very well that any arrangement made by the Austro-Hungarian Government with the subject nationalities will be of a purely fictitious character.
toAfter announcing the Bolsheviks&apos; peace terms, Trotski decided suspend the negotiations between the Russians and Germans fcr ten days in the hope that during that period Russia&apos;s Allies *ould declare themselves on the subject.   The period of grace expires on January 4.   Meanwhile the Russians and the Germans are making separate arrangements with regard to questions that merely concern themselves.    With regard to territorial arrangements between Russia and Germany the Bolsheviks have announced their adherence to the principle of self-determination in the cases of Ccurland, Esthonia, Poland and Lithuania.   The German reply shows no readiness to agree to the Russian principle, but in it an attempt is made to see whether? the Bolsheviks can be induced to agree to a purely artificial application of their principle.   The German reply runs as follows:-   &quot;The Russian Government having, in accordance with its principles, proclaimed for all peoples, without exception, living within the Russian Empire the right of self-determination, including complete separation, takes cognisance of the decisions expressing the will of the people demanding full State independence and separation from the Russian Empire for Poland, Lithuania, Courland and portions of Esthonia and Livonia. The Russian Government recognises that in the present circumstances these manifestations must be regarded as the expression of the will of the people and is ready to draw conclusions therefrom&quot;. During the last few weeks the Germans have been hurrying on the elections to so-called Constituent Assemblies in Lithuania and Courland, which will meet under the supervision of the German military authorities and can be relied upon not to pe ss any resolutions which are not favoured by the Germans,   The Bolsheviks must know that such Assemblies cannot bo relied upon to express the wishes of the people conceded, and it remains to be seen whether they will stand by their peace conditions to Germany and demand that
the German armies shall he withdrawn from the occupied territories &quot;before the will of the peoples concerned is ascertained.     It will he of special interest to observe whether the Bolsheviks knuckle under to the Germans on this point, which is a vital one of principle, or whether they hold out firmly.(2) Internal Policy.The Bolshevik Government still continues its reign of terror, though there are signs that Lenin and Trotski have begun to realise certain mistakes they have committed In their internal policy.(a) They are beginning to go back on their decision not to allow the Constituent Assembly to meet and are attempting to compromise with the other Socialist parties on the basis that they will allow the Constituent Assembly to meet provided that it endorses the recent legislation of the Sovyets,(b) Trotski seems to realise that any prolongation of the reign cf terror will be just as unpopular as any prolongation of the war. His reference to the possibility of introducing the guillotine ina recent speech created such a bad Impression that he had immediately to withdraw it.In spite 5f certain mistakes committed by the Bolsheviks, there is as.yet no sign that their position is seriously threatened or will be threatened until peace negotiations have been concluded. Even if the Bolsheviks were overthrown by^the vote of the Constituent Assembly it appears most likely that no change would be made by the latter as regards peace negotiations, that the majority in the Constituent Assembly would be just as determined upon peace as the Bolshevik minority now ruling Russia.     It is possible that there are a large number of timid Socialists who realise that the only cure for Russia1s miseries is an early peace, but would prefer that the whole weight of responsibility for
-----1 . i -ii,   ,. 4.At   Vforcing peace should rest upon the shoulders of the Bolsheviks. Ukraine.There is no information as yet of any fighting on a large scale between Ukrainian and Bolshevik troops, nor is there likely to be anything more than Isolated encounters between the two. Neither side has any real desire to fight, and it is not unlikely that they may soen come to terms, the Ukrainian Government being given permission to manage its own affairs without molestation. The opposition of the Ukraine to the Bolsheviks has nothing to do with the peace negotiations of the latter, for the Ukrainians have already sent delegates to Brest Litcvsk,  and realise very well that in a separate peace between Germany and Russia they ^ould inevitably be involved.The position of the Rada in the Ukraine is not as strong as it is painted by its own leaders.     Ukrainian nationalism is a very doubtful force and Is confined to Intellectuals.    It would never of itself be a sufficiently strong force to Inspire the peasantry. It may be that by a wise policy the Rada may keep out the wave of Bolshevism that is spreading over Russia, but so long as it is threatened on the north by such a wave of anarchy there Is little inducement to concentrate on a war against Germany or Austria.1.1.18.
