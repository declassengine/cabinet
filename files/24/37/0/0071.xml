Note by Sir E- Carson .I think my colleagues should sec the annexed secret note which Is a translation of a document handed by M. Clemenceau to Lord Milner when in Paris.     I understand that M. Clemenceau without endorsing the views of the writer , explained that it came from a responsible source \ In the cour-se of conversation      Clemenceau said that he understood thet we were spending large sums of money on Propaganda in Spain, and the French Government wore also doing so.   He wondered whether it might not be possible for the French and English to combine, or at any rate work more closely together in this matter .(Signed)    EDWARD CARSON .2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., 2nd Janusry , 1918 .
