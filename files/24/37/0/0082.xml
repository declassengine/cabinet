The Russian peace negotiations with representatives of the Centra]  owersat Brest Litovsk arc an event which cannot fall to have far-reaching consequences.   While having no part in these negotiations,  the responsibility for whose consequences must rest with those who initiated them, the. War Cabinet consider it advisable to define their attitude to the principle issues raised, and to state the British war aims as definitely and clearly as possible.This war war; not sought or prepared for by the peoples of the British Empire.   It began because the governments of Germany and Austria-Hungary,  after expanding their armaments for many years for war, refused to admit the right of a conference of European Powers to endeavour to arrange a just settlement of the dispute between Serbia and the Austro-Hungarian Governments, and set out vit 46 hours notice,  to obliterate the independence of a small nation by the sword.   And when both Russia and France refused, to permit the existence of a small Glav nation and the public law of Kurope to be brutally destroyed,  this first.act of aggros-sion was followed without the slightest provocation, by the invasion of Belgium, despite a treaty which not only compelled the Belgian people to defend their neutrality in arms, but which oouna&quot; the German Government to respect ana defend it. also.   In such circumstances the British people had no option but- to intervene in trie war in defence of notional liberty and public right.From this original purpose they have never swerved *   The British Government does not seek to deprive any of the enemy peoples of the position and power in the world to which they are rightly entitled.   Hor do they seek to impose any change in the oonstitution of Germany or Austria-Hungary,  though they
2^5w y u&amp;re convinced that the main -cause of the war has &quot;been the system whereby the supreme power in the state was vested in governments not responsible to the governed;, for in their judgment it does not fall within- the province of any nation to dictate the internal policy of their neighbours.   Their sole purpose in continuing the war is to ensure that mili-tarism shall not make a profit out of the war, that liberty and justice shall be completely vindicated, and that the settlement shall in itself be a security for enduring peace.The Russians have proposed that the formula &quot;no annexa-tlons, no indemnities and the self-determination  of. all peoples&apos;&apos; should be accepted as the basis of a general peace *     with the general spirit of this proposal the British    Government are in agreement.   In particular they are convinced that the territorial re&amp;djustmentewhich are embodied in the settle-men t must recognise to the full the rights of nationalities. hut there is another condition which is indispensable to lasting peace j.   that the peoples of Central Europe should no  eager menace the freedom of their neighbours with their military power.     This need has been ignored in the proposals of the Commissionero of the people of Eeirograd.   They have mace the fatal mistake of assuming that national self-detormina-tion or even national independence is a posainllity apart from the overthrow of Prussian militarism.   In these circumstances they may yet find that the negotiations upon which they have entered, may be tae cloak under which large masses of their own people may be again reduced to economic and political servitude, and that the great Alliance of free democracies which they have deserted is the only bulwark which the world now posseses against the universal domination of the Prussian militarist power.For these reasons the British Government must refuse to participate in the nebulous discussions which nave taken place
at hrest Litovsk.   But it thinks it desirable certain plain and muniatakeable propositions, which go is the root of ths issues involved in the war, and which in their -judgment are essential conditions of peace.   sAs for as they are concerned the essential conditions are as follows.-(l)   the&apos; evacuation of Belgium and her restoration to full&apos; pre-war independence %n well i*.a reparation for all da^n done-(2)   The evacuation and -restoration of Serbia, Aonteneg and Houmania to their full status ai, independent States,   if in accordance, with the distriiatioh of nationalities it is defied necessary to re-adjust boundaries in the cess of thes countries to their detriment, adequate territorial ccapen in accordance with the principles? of nationality must be elsewhere.-   A comprehensive settlement of the Bali-can peni will be very welcome it. British opinion,(3)   The evacuation and restoration of the occupied departments of France as well as the aailsfaction &apos;0u a-atio: principles of the legitimate claims of France   to Als&amp;se Lorraine.(4) A similar satisfaction of the legitimate claims the Italians for a union with those of their own -race and iom-ue. -(ft)   The restoration of the forWr Polish Kah/;-;:doa o;(6) -3o far as the Turkish Jfeei.ro is concerned British Government considers that- on the principle allty the territory of the Turkish frtate must-be co ;&apos;sia-/*inor with donsiantinople as itu onfital, and passage between the Mediterranean t*(S the Black ties neutralised and placed.under international control, territories released from Turkish rule, it consider Arabia should /theif ihedtiiit
4257receive complete independence, while Armenia, Syria,  eso-potamie aact Palestine should become autonomous communitiesunder the protection of one or more of the greet lowers.The Turkish public debt to be adjusted accordingly.(7)     Xn the case of the German Colonies the British  rime Minister has repeatedly declared that they sro holdat the disposal of a Conference of the Powerss   Horn of theseterritories are inhabited by Europeans *     The governingconsideration , therefore, in all these eases must bf that theinhabitants, who ere not yet fit for mX -govemmmt, shouldbe placed under the control of an administration, acceptableto themselves, whose sole purpose is their education andadvancement and not their exploitation for the benefit ofEuropean capitalists of governments *   The tribal system underwhich the nations live Is such that there are Chiefs andCouncils which are competent to speak for their peoples andto represent their wishes and interests as regards their dls-posal*   The British Government notes that In- the Germandeclaration it Is stated that the natives of the German colonlehave, through their military fidelity-In the war shown theirattachment and resolve under all circumstances to remain withGermany,    This statement Is applicable only to one colony,and in that ease (German East Africa) the German authoritiessecured the attachment not of the native population as a whole,which was and is? profoundly hostile to German rule, but onlyof si small warlike class from aihlch their Askaris or soldierswere selected *   cn these they conferred a privileged positionas againat the bulk of the population which enabled thorn toassume an arrogant and militarist superiority over the restof tho natives *  By this and other moons they secured theattachment of a small minority, whose intftreefw were opposedto the rest of the population and. for whom they have no right
to speak. (The exploitation of their subjects by the German rulers.in their colonies has been such as to warrant them in not wishing tc submit the future of these colonies to thewishes of the nations themselves/!(8) There should be no indemnification cf war costs by one belligerent to another, but ell belligerents must pay for the damage they have inflicted by acts done in contraventioninternational law.(9)     There remains, most important but most difficult ofall, the group of war aims which are devoted - to the prevention of future war, and the settlement of i?itarnational differences by pacific means,     The measureless sufferings an^ losses of this war have given rise tc the deep conviction among all enlightened nations that by some means the recurrence of war must be prevented in the future if civilisation is to survive. In the opinion of the British Government no international machinery or treaties can in themselves achieve this end, The chief securities on which they rely are the development a*aong all nations of constitutional governments, and the growth in an ever increasing proportion in the human race of the determination that liberty shall be respected and justice enforced in the relations of state with state.   la particular they believe that the great association of free peoples which has come to-gather, not to dominate tho vrorld or tc seek aggrandisement for themselves, but to protect the weak among nations, and to ensure that right and not the will of the strongest shall be the governing principle in International affairs, can become in itself the strongest guarantee that such a conflict such as this can never occur again.   From that Alliance no nation is excluded which accepts the free principles which bind it together,   In association therefore, with its Allies, they are willing and anxious to enter into arrangements with all nations
7mmfor the abolition of military conscription, the limitation of armaments, the regulation of equal economic opportunity, tho reference of international disputes to the consideration of conferences of the Powers, or ths decision of arbitration, and the constitution of a regular conference or League of Nations to watch over larger affairs of mankind, which may prove to be consistent with the effective maintenance, of liberty for all.3rd January, 1918,
