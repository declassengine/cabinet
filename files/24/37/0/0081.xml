Oolonel Jones245(xHIS, DOCIMM IBJ^i^O^^Oj..^^ BRITAMIC MAJESTY^ s&quot; OOTEmm^3CES IWAR   CAJIOT,5181WAR   Aims.It is now more than a year since the President of &apos;VheUnited States, then neutral, addressed to the belligerents a suggestion that each side should state clearly the aims for which10 January 1917, and&apos;, though circumstances   have necessarily modified some of the particular proposals there made, as, for instance, the exclusion of Turkish rule from Constantinople, which is no longer one of our war aims, yet the general doctrine that any peace settlement, to he perms-ment, must he &quot;based on some principle of natural justice and not on the mere convenience, still less on the ambitions, of the warring nations, guides cur policy, now as then.and, in spite of many adjurations both from their opponents and from neutrals, they have till lately maintained a complete silence as to the objects for which they are fighting.     Enen on so crucial a matter as their intentions with regard to Belgium, they have declined till lately to give any trustworthy indication.ing on behalf of Austria-Hungary and her Allies, did nake a pronouncement of a kind*   It ie indeed deplorably vague.     We are to Hi that &quot;it is not the intention&quot;of the Central PowO-rs &quot;to appropriate forcibly&quot; any occupied territories or &quot;to rob of its independence&quot; an/ nation which has lost its &quot;political independence&quot; duting the war. It is obvious that almost any scheme cf conquest and annexation could be perpetrated within the literal terms of such a pledge. A Poland, for instancep ruled by a Hohenzollern and included as one of the States of the German Smpire, provided its territories were not/they were fightingWe and our Allies responded by the Note ofTo the President&apos;s appeal the Central Empires made replyOn thehowever, &quot;Count- Czernin, speak-
aotually occupied by German forces, would comply with tlii8-nindextaJc,liig* Or, again, so long as any similacram of &quot;political&quot; independence were left to Belgium,  she might be bound commejrcially hana and foot, she might be deprived of&apos; all moan:) of military defence.,:, and precluded fro., seeking in foreign alliances those national safeguards which she would be prevented from providing for herself.Nor must it be forgotten that these professions,; unsatisfactory as they..,are in themselves;-, are rendered still more so by being avowedly mere expressions of intention, an intention which may be changed from day to. day.The rest of the so-called &quot;offer&quot; of Count Czernin is almost entirely a refusal of all concessions.   All suggestions about the autonomy of subject nationalities are ruled out of the peace terms altogether,-   The question-whether any form of self-government is to-be given to Armenians or Syrians is declared to be entirely a matter for&apos; the Sublime Ports, - A pious wish for the protection of minorities &quot;in so far as it Is practically realisable&quot;&apos; is the nearest approach to liberty which the Central Statesmen venture to make,.. On one. point only, are they perfectly clear-and definite.. Under ,no circumstances will the &quot;German-demand&quot;- for the restoration af the whole of Germany&apos;s- Colonies&apos; be departed from,   AH p-rincipies-of self-determination o&apos;r, \as our earlier phrase goes.,, government by-consent Of the governed, here;vanish.into thin-air.   mie.rev.er the Prussian jack-boot has onetrodden, freedom can-never be permitted to grow. ,, It is iapdsslble to--believe that any edifice of permanent peace could be erected on.such a foundation as this.   . ere lip service-
to the formula of no annexations and no indemnities or the right of self-determination is useless.   Before any negotiations can even he begun, the Central towers must realise the essential factsof the situation,Poremost of all they must understand that their lawless invasion of Belgium is not forgotten.   This outrage was not only a terrible injury to the peopoe immediately concerned.   Par more disastrous to Europe and the World even than the horrors inflictea on the Belgians was the blow thus struck at the very foundation on which/peace rests; the sar^ity of international obligations. Unless Treaties be upheld, unless every nation is prepared at whatever sacrifice to honour the national signature, it is obvious that no Treaty of Peace can be worth the papor on which it is written.The first requirement, therefore, always put forward by the British Government and their Allied has been the complete restoration, political, territorial and commercial, of the indep-cndence of Belgium,  and such reparation as can he made for the devastation of its towns end provinces.   This is no demand for war indemnity,  such as /that imposed on Prance by Germany in 1871, It is not fin attempt to shift the cost of warlike&apos;operations from one belligerent to another, which may or may not be defensible. It is no more and no less than an insistence that, before there can be any hope for a stable peace., this great breach of the public law of Europe must be repudiated, and so, far as possible r eioaired.Next in order   of importance comes the restoration of Serbia and the occupied parts of Prance and Roumenia.   Eere, it is true, was no clear and definite disregard of Treaties.   But the attacks on these two countries were utterly gratuitous, and it -is clear that /
r 4 -that from every point of view the complete withdrawal of the alien ermies and the reparation for injuries done is a fundamental condition of permanent peace.The same thing applies in principle to the rmssien territories now occupies by the Central powers. But here different considerations arise as well.It is not for the aritish Government to say what is desirable from a Russian point of view.     All that we are concerned with in these territories is to secure some settle-ment which will not lead to future wars     The days of the Treaty cf Vienna are long past,     V?e can no linger submit the future of European civilisation to the arbitrary decisions of a few negotiators striving to secure by chicanery or persuasion the interests of this or that dynasty or nation-     The settlement of the new Europe must be based on such grounds of reason end justice-as will give some promise of stability.   Therefore it is that we accept whole-heartedly the   rinciple of self-determination, which is indeed the principle upon which our own Empire is based.But it must be applied genuinely and fairly;   and we should not willingly acquiesce in the establishment of a Lithuania or a Courland nominally dependent, but in reality subservient to the German Autocracy.So to with the larger question of .?oland.-   We believe that an independent j?oland, comprising all those genuinely Polish elements who desire to form part of it, is an urgent necessity for the statality of Eastern Europe; and we shall be deeply disappointed if the Treaty of-peace does not provide for the creation of such a State.-
Sinilafly, though we agree   with President Wilson that the break-up of Austria-Hungary is no part of our war aims, yet we feel that a unless some measure of self-government is granted to those Austro-Hungarian nationalities who have long desired it, it is impossible to hope for the removal of those causes of unrest in that part of Europe which have so long threatened its general peace.On the same gxoim&amp;z, but with far greater emphasis., do we press for the satisfaction of the legitimate claims of Prance in regard to Alsace-Lorraine, and of the Italians and Roumanians for union with those of their own race and tongue.Much has been said about our Secret Treaties on these subjects.     We can only repeat, as we said in our Uote to the Russian Government of May last, that those Treaties were designed to carry out the principles which we have been here discussing;    and, if it be true that in some respects they went beyond those principlesi we are perfectly ready to discuss them with our Allies with a view to their modification if that should prove to he the case..   Outside Europe, we believe that the same principles should be applied.     Armenia, Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine, and Arabia are in our judgment entitled to a recognition of their separate national consciousness.What the exact form of that recognition should be need not here be discussed, beyond stating our own confident opinion that it would be impossible to restore to their ancient&apos; sovereignty those territories which are now definitely liberated from it.As
An for the German Colonies, we do not desire to with-draw their future from discussion at the peace Conference; hut we think it useful here to record our profound conviction that any retrocession of these regions to German rule would he regarded by their inhabitants with absolute consternation.It has been suggested some times that we are not ready to apply these principles to our own Empire; and in particular India, Egypt, and Ireland arementioned as countries which we keep under our rule against their will. Apart from the fact that none   of them have come in question during the present war, we reply that, as far as Egypt is concerned, one of cur first acts after the war broke out was to place her under an Egyptian Sultan with Egyptian Ministers, advised no doubt by British counsellors. That advice has now been given to Egypt for a generationr to the enormous and admitted advantage of her population. Hot a farthing of Egyptian revenues has ever reached the British Treasury:    on the contrary, large sums of money have been spent by the British taxpayers for the benefit of Egypt.     She has been governed solely with a view to her own advantage, with.the result that at no stage in the present war has there been even a ripple of discon-tent among her people, and the constant and insidious attempts cf enemy propagandists to stir up any feeling of the kind have been absolutely thrown away.Of India, almost the same may be said.     Prom all. parts of that vast Dominion voluntary contributions, both of men and money, have flown in to assist the British cause, and it has been impossible to say whether the Native Princes or their subjects have been the more anxious to give their assistance.

for India is nowjthat country, enquiring on behalf of theBritish GoVernm best be made.ent in what direction those changes mightAs for Ireland, the c-.se is clearer still.     A Convention,.admittedly as representative as it was possible to obtain, has now been sitting some mfiivths in Dublin, charged.with the duty of framing such changes in the Government of Ireland as will.be acceptable to thewhole Irish, peopleIf difficulties have arisen in this- - -task,&apos; they do. not- come from any reluctance on the part of the British Government to conform to-Irish wishes in this respect, but rather from the unfortunate -fact that the Irish themselves are not agreed on what they desire. ...Ono.omission we notice in Count Czernin&apos;s proposals which seems to us especially regrettahle&apos;.     It is desirable, and indeed essential, that the settlement after this war&quot; shall be one which does not in itself bear the seed of future wars.     But that is not enough.     However wisely and well we may make territorial: and other arrangements, there will still be many subjects of international controversy.     Some indeed are inevitable..The economic conditions at the end of the war will bo in the highest degree difficult-.&apos;     Owing to the diversion of human effort to warlike pursuits, there must follow a world-shyrtage cf raw materials, which- will increase the longer the war lasts-, and it is inevitable that those countries which, have control of the raw materials will desire to help themselves and. their friends   first.Then
Then there are questions about the free   passage through narrow seas;   and, though we hope that the Dardanelles and the Boaphonia may be raade,definitely free, there are other Straits and passages which it may be impossible to deal with in the Treaty of Peace.Finally, whatover settlement is made will be suitable only for the circumstances under which it is made, and, B3 those circumstances change, changes in the settlement will be called fcr.So long as the possibility of dispute between nations continues, that is to say so long as men and women are human beings and war is the only means of settling a dispute, all nations must live under the burden not only of having from tine to time to engage in it, but of being compelled to prepare for its possible outbreak.     The crushing weight of modernarmaments, tho increasing evil of compulsory military service, the vast waste of wealth and effort involvedin warlike preparation, these ere blots on our civili-sation of which every thinking individual must beashamed,Por these and other similar reasons, we are confident that a great attempt must be made toestablish by some international organisation an alterna-tive to war as a means of settling internationaldisputesB After all, war is a relic of barbarism, and, just as law has succeeded violence as the means ofsettling disputes between individuals, so wo believethat it is destined ultimately to take the place of war in the settlement of controversies between nationse-   If then we are asjiced what we are fighting for we reply as -e have often replied - Wo ere fighting. for Peace - and we believe that before permanent peacecan be hoped for three conditions must bo fulfilled.
Firstly, the&quot; sanctity of treaties must be re-established; secondly, a territorial settlement must be secured based, on the right of solf-dotermination or the consent of the governed, and, lastly wo must seek by the creation of come international organisation to limit the burden of armaments and diminish the probability of war.d January, 1918
