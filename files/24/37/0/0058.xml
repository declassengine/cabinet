Colonel htm)OCU\62?   /^^u*SES OF     &quot;AQttfTANIA11     AND     &quot;MAUSSCAMIA1&apos; * /FOR   COJTOYANCE   OP   AMERICAN   TROOPS.Memorandum.for War Cabinet by First Lord of the Adx&amp;ralty.The American Government have asked for the loan of the &apos;Aquitaniau and &quot;Mauretania&quot; for tho conveyance of American Troops to Europe.The BAquitauia&quot;, with a speed of 84 knots, is now fitted as a Hospital Ship and oould accommodate troops to the number of 4.000 if the Hospital fittings remained intact and 5.000 if they were dismantled.The &quot;Mauretania&quot;, with a speed of 25 knots, has accommodationfor 3.700 troops.It would not be practicable for these ships to run to Liverpool, as the only available accommodation for this size of ship at that port is required for the &quot;Olympic11 and HVaterland8.      It is necessary, therefore, that the port of disembarkation should be Brest, but as the maximum- coal endurance of these ships at economical speed is 12 days, they could not dp the round trip without coaling on this side, for which purpose they would also have to proceed to Southampton.      The additional requirement for escort would, therefore include escort up and down Channel.It would be necessary to notify the Enemy Powers that the aAquitania* had ceased to be used as a Hospital Ship,Owing to the urgency of the matter, preparations have been put in hand for enabling these ships to be used as troopships, but in view of their size and value and the risk involved in bringing them to Southampton to coal, the approval of the War Cabinet to the course adopted is desired.(Signed)   ERIC GEDDES.31st December, 1917.
