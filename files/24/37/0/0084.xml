ColonelsTaok rieturne from $Tovoclierkask on the 29th December and telegraphed you. - .    A- -A-; AA.&apos;-&apos;: Iseparately an account of his interviews so skilfully conducted there.] Lieutenant Colonel Boyle is reported to he in Roumania.     Your telegram 48043 of December 15th to General Shore of which Jack brought copy has indicated for the first time that the second object of my journey may have been totally different from the matter of food transport that from your telegram received through Embassy Petrograd I had understood it to be.     I heard nothing about the withdrawal of the Roumanian Army in Kiev; on the contrary everything pointed to the abandonment - of the idea, but I have tclcrraphed enquiries to both Jassy? and Kiev, beoauso the transport of such a withdrawal would have to be handled not from ETovocharkask but from Jassy, Odessa and Aiev..    I will add I do not believe in the present state of BUosia the withdrawal of any large number of Roumanian troops to Ekaterinoslav could be carried out in practice.
From: Lieutenant Colonel Jack. To:     C.I.G.S.Rostow on Don. 31st December, 1917,N.R. 12.        I had interviews at SFovocherkask on 28th December with Generals Alexief Kaledin and Kislimyt...of, the last who was formerly head of sub-Ministry of Communications at Stafka was arrested with Kornilof:   he is now organizing a bureau hore with similar powers with the object of controlling transport by rail and water and the production and supply of petroleum and coal in the S.E. federation.    He is gathering about him some of the best railway experts in Russia, in expectation of the scope of their operations being enlarged in tho near future.     Kaledin impressed me as being worn out and much depressed by the recent murder of Karaoulof head of Terek Cossacks.     He appeared to be concerned only for the seourity of his own Don territority, and stated that his Cossacks needed rest and were tired of tho war; that all their efforts would be required for the protection of their own land, and that no men were available for the policing of the railway to the Transcaucasus, which should be done by tho Kuban and Terek Cossacks in his opinion;   that no food was available for export to Transcaucasus or Roumania from the Don Government; that the question of the retirement of Roumanian Army to Ekaterinoslav, government of which is (?) subject,to Ukrainian was a matter for an arrangement between Rsumania and the Ukraine that at present no union exists between tho south east Federation and the Ukraine but simply a mutual understanding in combating their common enemy the ICaximalist,     Alexioff informed me he was organizing a volunteer force from officers, military cadets and 7/ell disposed troops, exclusive of Cossaoksj that he expected to have ready.by middle of April 12 regiments of infantry totalling 40,000 men, 21 batteries of light artillery and 4 technical battalions;   (?)has the artillery but required 40,000 rifles, with ammunition which he hoped to obtain from Roumanian and Caucasus fronts, that in equipping even this small force great difficulties were being encountered, that although credit had been provided very little ready money was available in this district, that his primary aim was always to establish a solid government in the S.E. territorities, that later en he h*ped to join up with the Ukraine forces from which he expected to draw additional Infantry, that at present his movement had no political significance, but that this would follow later, that he had previously had the pleasure of communicating with (?)your officers daily, but now he was in reality cut off and his present effort was necessarily a very small affair.    He concluded by asking me to convey to you his personal greetings.A Fronch Mission consisting of Colonel Hucher and 4 officers and an American Consular Agent Mr. Pools are in touch with both Kaledin and Alexieff, they impressed on me the necessity of the presence of a British officer which was Alexieff*e special request.    The French Mission attach great importance to tho Alexieff movement.j    They informed mo they were placing at the disposal of Kaledin 500,000 francs and had obtained from the French Government credit of 100 million roubles for Alexieff tobe
be expended under their control;   this sum is estimated to cover 4 months expenses.     Mr. Poole has asked for roubles to be sent from Moscow to the equivalent of half million dollars gold.     I am informed that Mr, Pederoff, a leading Moscow iSanker is gathering about him the nucleus *f a provisional government, but he was absent in (?)Rostov and I could not see him.Prom my visit I formed the following impressions (l) that importance should not at present be attached to the Novochercask movement, (2) that its strength is insignificant and in the immediate future no great addition can be looked for, (3) that the Cossack forces in the expressed opinion cf their leaders cannot be relied on at present, (4) that their (?) attention will be entirely taken up with the protection of their own territory against the internal enemy in front and rear, for which task alone their numbers will hardly suffice, (5) that unless a ?local paper issue is guaranteed by the Allies the monetary difficulty will be insuperable, (6) that no facilities for equipping the forces exist within their own territory, (7) that the supply of arris and ammunition from existing fronts will not be possible till connecting railways are policed by dependable troops, (8) that the only way to create any force here that will again combat our enemies is to establish a line of communication with the exterior, (9) that the Trans-Siberian railway must be effectively policed by either American or Japanese for this purpose so as to permit of the free transport and supply of munitions and cf a limited number of troops
from Lieutenant Colonel Pike To     D.M.I.Tiflis, 1st January, 1018,192,Reference your telegram- 48879 December 28th.There are 2 objects in view ....1,    To get rid of present army.2.    To create new army, consisting of following1 Georgian Corps, 2 Armenian Corps, 1 Russian Corps of Volunteers, 1 Assyrian Division, 1 Greek Division.     It is proposed to create this army by April 1918 by which time the old army will be absolutely liquidated and replaced by new army. Money is necessary for both above objects.     2Tew army increase every day.     It is essential in order to maintain the front for new army to preserve existing conditions of L.of C., that is, roads, railways, all technical structures, posts on L. of C*, food, forage, equipment depots etc.     The actual army require less than half the expenditure:   the greater part is required by L.of C.     This latter item applies to railways and roads betweon Vladykavkas, Tiflisy Baku, Erzerum, Maku etc., which form part of line of supply of army in the field.     500 million roubles is the sum required for formation of now army and liquidation of old by April, 1918, inclusive of L. of C, items mentioned above;   of this sum 150 million roubles are required by first January (old style) for following purposes;   (a)Ho get rid of existing army which is at present destroying, burning and selling stores etc., at depots which are required for new army;   (b) for preliminary formation of new army,&apos; recruiting, propaganda work, uniform, food etc.It is estimated that existing army at present is causing loss at the rate of 1 to 2 millions per diem alone. The sooner the existing army is evacuated the better;   they cannot be paid off and dispersed without money, as thoy refuse to give up their arms.     The remaining 350 millions are required in equal parts at the beginning of each month from January to to April 1918, i.e., 11? million monthly for months of January, February and iiaroh.     20 millions are necessary in addition to this for organization and formation in Turkish conquered territory of a militia which will later on become regular troops;   of this 20 millions 1 million is required urgently.The formation of above mentioned unit is progressing satisfactorily at present;   2 regiments have already occupied positions evacuated by Russian troops and others are holding railways and I. of C.    Everything will collapse unless money is forthcoming.    I cannot urge too strongly that the sums asksd for should be placed at our disposal.    Proposed 500 million -roubles means monthly cost approximately 17 poundo per manner Mensem both to pay off and (?) disperse old troops and formaintenance
maintenance and up-keep of all L.of c. munitions, equipment, food, etc, new army.    This does not appear excessive.     It would appear that the French estimate quoted in your 40809 applies only to actual maintenance of men at the front.    Present estimate applies to L. of C. as a whole in all its branches.Continuation is following.
