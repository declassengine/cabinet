His BritafColonel Jons?PiBPOBT BI THIS BOARD OF TRLDi ON IiiPORTS IN RELATION TO SHIPPING.miDecember 21st, 1917. 3\VO )w)) The report is divided into two parts dealing respect--^t^mj with the general   situation, and with events that have taken place in November.rt 1 1.. Total Imports into the United Kingdom have been ande General .tuation.   are estimated to be as follows:-1913 .......... 54,500,000 tons.1916 .......... 46,000,000    &quot;1917 .......... 38,000,000    &quot;1918 .......... 32,000,000    HTims, during 1918 our Importing capacity is likely to be loss by some 6 million tons than it was in 1917.    With the cuts-proposed by Lord luilnerf-s -Committeo to meet tho deficit, the limit cf the practicable is being approached and-it is. shown further that the position in 1919 is not likely to be much better than in 1913, and it may be worse in view of the need of tonnage in connection with the movement and mainten-ance of the American Army.2. Tho decline of restricted goods (net all of which, of course, is due to the restrictions) in 1917 on 1913 is 73fo whereas that of mires trie ted. goods is 10$,3. In view of the facts.(a) that we are near the limit of saving on imports.(b) that the war. claims on tonnage may in-crease (c) that the losses may &quot;be greater than are new anticin ated, and (d) that a large ,American Army has to be moved and maintained, the present ship-building programmes of this country and the United States (so far as they are known) appear to be inadequate.    To remove all fear of our being seriously handicapped by shortage of ships, it is estimated by competent authorities that the United Kingdom and the United States jointly should work up to a ship-building rate of 9,000,000 gross tons par annum by next autumn.    llesiiwhil^ it is worth considering whether, in order to ensure the earlv movement of the American Army, an arrangement might not be
made&apos;under which British shipping might he lent to the united States for this purpose in the early   art of 1918, to be repaid by then- in the latter part of that year.4. Stocks of non-munition materials were consider-ably reduced in 1917 and some aro now down to a &quot;bare work-in.? margin.   The stocks of imported soft-wood (other than pit-props) are now equivalent to something less than 8 months&apos; supply.   In the cotton industry shortage of raw material has forced spindles at work in mills still active in the American section to be cut down to 60$, with the result that there is a large amount of unemployment.    stocks of raw Cotton are now a bare working margin.      The stocks of wool are equivalent to about 6 months1 supply:   motor spirit about 8 weeks&apos; supply, Kerosene rather lesa than one month14 supply;   and vegetable oils and fats nearly 6 months&apos; supply.5. By November 30th 1917 the gross loss of British Merchant Shipping through enemy action had amounted sinco the beginning of the war to 5,750,000 gross tens.    &quot;Then marine losses are added to this, and replacements by building, captures, purchases etc. subtracted., the net loss is about 2,700,000 gross tons, but in this figure no account is taken of the number of war-damaged vessels under repair or awaiting repair.   It is estimated that tho net loss to add to this next year will bo 650,000 gross tons.   The grand total of steam merchant vessels of 500 gross tons and over left to us on November 30th 1917 was about 15,850,000 gross tons.   This figure, however, includes about one million tons repairing or completing.6.   Of the total of about 14,850,000 gross tons: available for service, about 3,750,000 tons are used by the Army and Navy, 1,600,000 by the Allies, and 700,000 by the Colonies; while nearly 1,300,000 are permanently abroad,
and.1,000,000* ere oilers.     This leaves less than 6,5005000 gross tons for the ordinary trade of the United Kingdom including the importation ef munition materials.7.   Great efforts have been made to employ the.reduced tonnage available for British imports in a more economical and efficient manner.     As a result, whereas compared with Octoher 1916, the tonnage available for British trade has fallen abcut 17$, British entrances v/ere only down about half this amount on the average of Augusty September and October, though in November the position was worse.,8*     The position -of the Allied and Neutral Mercantile Marines must also be taken into consideration.     They have each lost about l,900,000 gross tons, which added to our e*wn, gives a total loss of 9*600,GOO tons.    Allowance being made for marine loss and for ships detained by the enemy or repair-ing war1 damage, or awaiting repair of such damage, ths total loss becomes about 12y700.C00 tons.    Against this new con-struction amounts to about 5^100*000 tons and prises and detained vessels t* 1,900,000 tons,     The total not loss therefore, is 5,700,000 gross tons (or about 1,000,090 less apart from war damaged vessels repairing and awaiting repair) out of an original total of about 36,000,000 tons.art II.&quot;ition inember 1917.     9.     In November total imports into the United Kingdem amounted to 2,944?0G0 tons - a decrease of 17$ on November 1916 and of 32$ cn November 1913,     As against 1916 this is the smallest percentage decrease in any month since May, 10.    British entrances with cargo - (other than re-quisitioned vessels) amounted, to 1,448., 000 tons - 22$ less than in November 1916;   and British clearances (other than requisitioned vessels) to 1,024,000 tons - 26$ less than in November 1916.     Both these percentage decreases are larger than any shown in previous months-of 1917.
Foreign entrances amounted to 323.000 tons, or 547  less than in November 1916; and foreign clearances to 674,000 tons, 47$ less than in November 1916.11. In November, the aggregate British losses of vessels over 500 tons gross burden amounted to 206,000 tons of Which 173,000 tons vere due to war risk.   This is con-siderably better than tho October figuro of total losses (288,000 tons) and only slightly worse than the good September figure (200,000 tons).       Over the same period the gains from New British ships built and brought into service were 134,000 tons and from all sources 186,000 tons. Of tho gains from sources other than new building, however, some 33,000 tons were obtained from Norway, pn condition of being replaced by other ships, and are therefore not additional tonnage available for service.    The effectives gains in November thus amount to 153,000 tons against losses of 206,000 tons.    The net reduction of available tonnage was thorofore 53,000 tons as against a net reduction in October ef 154,000 tons.   The tonnage of Allies other than Great Britain lost through enemy action in November was 72,000 tons, and that of neutrals 30,000.      The total world lass from enemy action was 273,000 tons, which is consider-ably less than in any previous month of 1917,Betwoen September 30th and October 31st, British tonnage in the service of the Allies was reduced by 282,000 tons of which 171,000 tons came from Russian sendee.    As a result of this, in spite of tho loss of shipping that occurred^in October, the shipping available for British trade at the end&apos; of the month was over 200,000 tons greater than it had been at the beginning.13. (The total tonnage under construction in British yards in the week ending December 6th was 1,696,000 tons. This is some 30,000 tons less than was reported for the week ending November 1st..
