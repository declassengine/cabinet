SECRET. N.S.R.25,RESTRICTION OF NON-ESSENTIAL INDUSTRIES. ;Memorandum by the Minister of National Service.I have already submitted to the &quot;far Cabinet proposals whereby in suitable cases the drift of labour from non-! essential industries should be stimulated to essential indus-tries by limiting by licence manufacture in and for such non-essential industries;    and these proposals have been, recommended by the War Cabinet on Man-Power (G.185, para. 61(Hi) &apos;).&apos;&quot;&apos;&apos;&quot;As I stated to the Yvar Cabinet in submitting thisproposal, it is obvious that great care must be exercised in using such a power, and that it should only be used where labour cannot be made available without such action, and where it is reasonably certain that the labour displaced would be absorbed in essential industries.Before dealing with any such trade I should feel It my duty to consult with the Board of Trade as representing the general Trade interest of the Country, with,, the Home Office in view of their direct connection with Factory Inspection, with the Ministry of   Labour, and with the Ministry of Munitions or other supply Department interested In securing the labour which would be made available.I have submitted to the Defence of the Realm Regulation Committee a Regulation which is designed where desirable&apos; to secure the above restriction of manufacture and also, to limit
the opening of n4w businesses.Tho Regulation which I dosire to obtain is in the attached form.The provision dealing with the licensing of new businesses and branches is Intended to serve a double purpose.   In the first place,- it is desirod to conserve and divert to more useful channels man-power which y/ould bo absorbed in the unnecessary 6xtension of luxury Trades.:It Is hardly necessary to state that there is no -intention of restricting ..any necessary oxtension of essential industries;;    and no application which was supported by one of the Departments of State would be refused without the fullest consultation with that Departmont.In the second place the Regulation is designed to safeguard the businesses of men who are serving In His Majesty&apos;s Forces.    In conjunction with the President of the Local Government Board I have.been at great pains to safeguard the businesses of these men by promoting co-operative action in different localities, whereby their businesses may be maintained by the assistance of their fellow tradesmen who are either over military- age or whoso services, by reason of their low medical categories, are not so urgently required for service in the &apos;Army.    I find, however, that these efforts are constantly impeded or frustrated, by the action of more selfish individuals who open new businesses of a similar&apos; character In close proximity to the shop of the man who has gone to servo in the&quot; Army. &apos;   Thore is at present no power to-stop action of this kind, which causes great injustice and hardship to many-most deserving men.Tho Defence of the Realm Regulation Committee,
-3-while expressing their entire approval of the policy upon which the proposed Regulation was founded, felt that it oould not be passed without the policy being sanctionod by the War Cabinot.    I therefore submit the draft Regulation for the formal approval of the War Cabinet.A. C, Geddes.31.12.17.
