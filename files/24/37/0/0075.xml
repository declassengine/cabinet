SECRET.21WEEKLY   REPORTOH   SWEDEN. IV.(Jan. 2nd, 1918)Sweden, Finland and the Aland Islands:The attitude of Sweden in regard te the new state of affairs in Russia may be said to be one of waiting.     The Swedish Minister at petrograd has not rectgnised the Bolshevik Government but has merely returned a formal answer to Trofcektf&apos; s appeal to neutrals to work fejr peace.   The collapse of the old regime was hailed with 8 sense of relief, most Swedes having held that the Imperial Government oherished designs on their territory, as if the already excessive size of Russia had not of late years been one of the most difficult problems the late- Government was compelled to faoe.     The problems now before the Swedish Government are :-1.   The obvious conversion of the Baltic into a German Lake.2.   The future of Finland and its considerable Swedish population. (There are over 20 Swedish members of the Met).3.   The sovereignity of the Uand Islands.It may, in fact, be said that one incubus has replaced another, except that in the present circumstances the German danger is real, while the Bussian bogey was almost certainly imaginary.     The German peril is complicated by the fact that in Sweden there is a small but powerful clique headed by the Court and Bureaucracy, who seize every opportunity to prostrate themselves before their powerful Southern neighbour .     Should Germany come out of the war with her wings mere-ly singed, in all probability Sweden will become a dependency of Germany in fact if not in name.     The peaceful penetration by Germany of the Scandinavian countries, not excluding Norway, is proceeding apace, and something not unlike a revival of the ,old Hanseatic League will shortly appear in the Baltic.
In Finland cflaos end starvation reign and it is impossible to foresee what may happen in that country.     The Activists in Sweden would like to see a Swedish occupation with the consent o$ the rival &quot;belligerents.     It is not likely that the Finns would consent to receive a Swedish force.   It is highly improbable that while the present Liberal-Socialist Cabinet is in power that the Swedish   ^. Government will lend itself to an adventurous policy in the Balfcaaae. Meanwhile It is officially denied in the Swedish Press that troops have been moved t* the Finnish frontier.     As regards the Aland Islands they are undoubtedly a menace to Sweden so long as they con-tinue in the hands of a Great Power,      hey seem more properly to belong to Finland;   and if that country becomes a separate state as a result of the Russian Revolution it is not improbable that that might be the most satisfactory solution of a delicate question of long standing.    A deputation of Aland Islanders recently visited Stockholm and was received by Baron Ramel, the Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but nothing seems to have transpired as to what massed.It is certain that the present Swedish Government is in a difficult position as regards these Islands, and some action will have before long to be taken,,     It is equally certain that the Activists are doing all they can to force a solution.     Not long ago o former Cabinet Minister, Professtr \7estman (Hammarskjold Government, pro-German), in a lecture, expressed doubts as to the wisdom of insisting on the necessity of maintaining neutrality in regard to these Islands, and contended that Sweden should insist on the immediate withdrawal of the Russian garrison.     No doubt there is a section of Swedes who think like him, but the presence of men like Mr. Branting in the Cabinet seems to offer a guarantee against any offensive policy.
internal Polities.In Sweden the curious phenomenon is to &quot;be seen of a section ef the Socialist -iarty deliberately joining with the pro-Germans to embarrass the Government in power, which contains 4 Socialist Ministers.     It is well-known that the Bolshevist Government in Russia has recently published a number of more or less authentic confidential documents which passed between the former Bussian Government and the Entente Powers.     They, not long ago, printed in the Russian Hews-paper, &quot;pravda&quot; a telegram which purports to have been sent by the Russian Minister at Stookholm to his Government regarding an inters view with Mr. Branting, the Socialist Minister of ?inanoe in the Swedish Cabinet,     The former stated in this telegram that Mr. Branting was, at first, disturbed by the refusal of the Russian Provisional Government of passes to the Socialist Conference at Stockholm, but said that if Mr. Kerensk  considered that the meeting should be de-fersed p  the Dutch-Scandinavian Committee ought to yield to his wishes.     The Russian Minister publicly denied having had an inter-view at that time with Mr. Branting and states that he was merely ex-pressing his own views.     The &quot;Pravda&quot; subsequently published a futther telegram in which the Russian Charge- d&apos;Affaires at Madrid is alleged to have suggested the opening of the Swedish official bag as by mistake, a course which his colleague at Stockholm deprecated as likely to give offence to the new Swedish Cabinet which was favour-able to Russia.    The Russian Minister announced that this telegram was a forgery.     In any case the publication of these dubious docu-ments has furnished the Young-Socialists and pro German Aotivists with an opportunity for a violent attack on Branting whose pro-Entente sympathies are well known.Ho fresh facts have come out regarding the meeting of the
Scandinavian Kings at Christiania.     An official conmunique announc-ing the result of the Conference stated that the Governments of the 3 countries were determined to maintain their existing friendly re-lations whatever       course the war ml&amp;ht take:,, that each would ob-serve neutrality as against all the belligerents, that it was desir-able to promote and increase the free exchange of the products of the Scandinavian countries and that a Commission would be at once appoin-ted with a view to giving practical effect to this policy.     The question of assimilating the laws applicable to the treatment of foreigners had been discussed at the meeting, while the preparation of means designed to nroteot nettral interests after the war was in progress.Probably the most satisfactory result of the visit of King Gustaf to Christiania has been the burying of the war-hatchet.     It is said that the very bitter feeling prevailing in &quot;both Norway and Sweden during the Union has notTin general passed away.     It is at least certain that the Swedish King had an enthusiastic reception.     When the late King Oscar II entered Christiania to celebrate his 25th Jubilee in 1898 a more dismal welcome can hardly be conceived. Public Opinion.As in all other neutral and enemy countries the Lansdowne Letterwas received in pro-German circles in Sweden with a chorus oftriumph.     It was supposed even by Liberal^ papers to have been a?eace kite and to have been published with the connivance of theBritish Government.     The Swedish Press with some exceptions has beengenerally a barometer of the war.    When Germany was successful most newsof the/papers, often led by pro-German Professors, heaped every insult on England, who alone is supposed to be the author and main-tainer of the war and apparently actuated by some occult commercial design.     When the Allies could record a substantial success the Swedish Press to some extent became more moderate.     Lately there has
*a. 2203i . i &apos;*. ^ . ^ 2-./,:.- 5 -been a curious change.     The oro-German Press has for the momentceased to trnmpet the recent German successes in Italy: and else-where and have adopted the more insidious method of dilating on thehorrors of war and the folly and wickedness of the Entente inhaving rejected the peace offer of Bethraann-Hollweg in 1916.England is of course held up as the author of all mischief.     Theaccusations against her become more and more extraordinary.     It waslately asserted by the Aftonblad that 3ngland deliberately causedthe Russian Revolution under the impression that Nicholas II wasnegotiating with Germany for a separate oeace.   Great Britain isreproached with having been ready to sacrifice Finland and Polandto Tsarism, and she is now punished by the spectacle of her enemyestablishing autonomies in these lands.Scheidemann, the German Majority Socialist, has lately been inStockholm incognito.     According to hi3 own statement he went thereto see how peace prospects stood.   All that seems definitely knownis that during his visit he had several interviews with vorovsky,ativethe represent/of the Bolsheviks in Sweden.It is of some interest to note that more than one Oriental Ag&amp;tator is at present in Sweden prenohing the liberation of Egypt, Indif- etc.I!r. Branting has quite recently publicly stated that he considers that the Austro-German peace offer is a more significant step towards peace than anything which has as yet taken ola.ce.    ge considers that it is out of the question that the Allies should reject the offer outright.     He thinks that the Allied Governments have, during the laat year, given too much rein to Imperialistic influences.   The ; Entente statesmen have neglected that revision of war-aims whicty he thinks, ought to have been a self-evident duty after the pub-lication of the Secret Treaties by..the Bolsheviks.     The Entente
cv 4m* mwill be regarded as having committed an act of criminal folly if they cold-shoulder the offer of Count Czernin.    Mr. Branting is of opinion that once discussions have begun the whole world should demand that they shall be followed up and that all that oppose a democratic peace shall be swept away.
