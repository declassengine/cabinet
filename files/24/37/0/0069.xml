Ay// ____yThe following extract from a private letter from GeneralSir Herbert Plumer to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff,dated 28th December, 1917, is forwarded for circulation tothe War Cabinet&quot;To-day it really seems as if the snow had come at last, &quot;it snowed pretty heavily last night and again this morning and I &quot;hear there is a metre of snow on the Asiago Flateau,&quot;That is what we went..  Two months to give the Italians &quot;time to really pull themselves together,,&quot;I think,they are gradually absorbing some of our doctrines, e have Staff Officers every day round some portion of their front &quot;line who are told to drop hints only, but they have begun to ask &quot;us for copies of anything that Staff Officers report - that is &quot;just - what we wan ted.&quot;Diaz has issued a great manifesto about putting too many &quot;men in the front line, and they are paying attention to defence &quot;in depth,, siting of machine-guns etc, and are certainly improving. &quot;We are helping them with all the heavy artillery we have got, and &quot;so are the French,&quot;I hope we shall have our schools, musketry range, etc &quot;started in about a fortnight.    They will be useful I am sure,&quot;I had a very long talk with Diaz yesterday about precautions &quot;against gas. . They had not gone into it half closely enough, but &quot;I think they will really take it up properlyc&quot;One of the questions that is going to trouble us if we &quot;are here in the summer is the unsanitary condition of the whole &quot;country.    It is a most difficult matter to cope with as the whole &quot;population from the highest downwards have no idea of sanitation &quot;at all and the whole country is a latrine! &quot;General Staff, War Office,(Signed)    Fe MAURICE.D,.M.O.2nd January, 1918a
