I have condensated my proposals in a fow lines at the ond of this letter;-yOu can read them at once and consider the other parts of my letter at your easeoYou must put these clear questions before you *Is Italy an essential element for the Entente?To win this war is or is not necessary that Italy should resist until the last day of the war?If a as&apos; 1 believe - you answer by tho affirmative, you and the United States must fsce the problem of Italy:   what must be done to give Italy a greater force of resistanceii repeat what I told you in Parisunar is, for Italy not only a moral duty that everybody, throughout the country fools, but also- a necessity,,As things are nowadays Italy cannot lit&amp; without keeping on with the war6- V.hen this war&quot;- Is fever Italy Will not be able to renew herself and heal her wounds without tho-friendly and cordial help of England&apos; and the United States^I am far from believing that *ill the struggles will be Over with the war:,   other1 fiercer fights will follow.   And we must keep united even after tho war.But one- problem is above everything now:    the situation of ItalyaI shall never be tired to proclaim (such is my.personal opinion and. I exposed it to you), that Italy is the. only Country of the Entente which is in grave end immediate danger..Don*t be preoccupied of our little dissensions- of domestic- politics;    you also have thorn,   ^ny Government in. Italy will go on with the war;    the only question is to&quot;have Governmentr
that will make it well and energetically.    Italy is now the greater reason of hatred of the Central Empires,   tie have drawn our fate?far must tee made with the ends of the war and with the methods of the %-r*   No matter that the cause of justice and freedom is on our^side.

Even if it could toke f &quot;glac^e;   the^contribution in men of the United States cCull liever&apos;&apos; be superior to the one of Italy.It is necessary then to put Italy in condition - to make a greater effortTand give her such contri-b&apos;utlSnvO&apos;f n!en, financial means, and abovo. sll -coai%and -folpd as4 to make it possible to her to live and fightsEabh provision that is deemed necessary is alsourgent.DoiiH do to-morrow what you can do to-day.   Time is never our friend.     Italy is really in danger.,jka I told Von I cannot yet explain to myself the disaster&apos;of the second&apos; Army*     ao many causes have concurrod-to that,     I and -my&quot;colleagues are trying to discover them and we must find them.But now our soldiers fight splendidly.     Inferior to the enemy in number, with, artillery inferior both in power and number^ Sith nourishment that is often far from being good our soldiers are making real wonders these days.   Will they be able to ao them for a- longer time if left to themselves or. even supported only by such- help of the Allies as it is this da^?Italy entered the war on the basis of an efficient co-operation of Russia.     Now Russia failed.    Itely is a country of 37 millions of inhabitants.   Austria-Hungary has 50 and now with the Austrians there are against us Germans, Bulgarians and Turks..
In the territories invaded by the enemy at Udino, Cividalo end so forth there are, to our greater sorrow, besides the Germans, Bulgarians and Turks, who have no respect for anything, who exterminate and kill and violate. This is the truth.

Our great poet Petrares? used to speak of "todosea? rabbian" (German rage): it is now more than ever against Italy. What will you do?

The military men of the Entente? have their own ideas: but their ideas are not always right. Are they persuaded of the imminent danger of Italy ? Are they disposed to send men and materials in a sufficient proportion?

If you allow me, I shall entertain you on each single question :

(1) Military situation. Italy has been able, until this day to check tne strokes of the enemy on the line of Piave, on the mountains between Piavo and Brenta and on the Asiago plateau. The Germans have now several aims: the chief one is to reach Milano: the definitive one is to reach Genoa, and to have then at their hands all the wealth of Italy. We are resisting. Shall we be able to go on with our resistance, if left by ourselves ? The Piavo front is threatened by the over-increasing pressure that the enemy can exert from the advantageous positions which they hold on the wings of the same front. Such a pressure would grow extremely grave in case the enemy succeeded in forcing an opening through the last barrier that on the mountainous part of the front separates them from the Vicenza plains. To have even more reasons to keep our attention constantly directed towards other parts of our front, that is on those lines, such Vak d&apos;Astico, Vallarsa, Val Lagarina and the valley of Giudicaria, where the enemy will exert strenuous afforts as soon as the season makes it possible. We cannot even exclude a threatening from Valcamonica and Valtellina.

Taking into consideration the tremendous gravity of the situation in case our front was broken on any of the invasion lines, and the greater length of the other fluvial lines, which are behind, it is our strict duty to oppose a strong resistence to the attempt of the enemy, and check at once their eventual initial success by making as strong as possible the line we hold at present, and above all, by gathering adequate reserves and masses? of manoeuvre.

Under the impulse of the sad events of last October, and even to a greater extent during the actual period of beautiful gallant but hard battles, Italy has made the most of anything she could get out of the reserves she still had at her disposal.

But if all that made it possible for us to validly resist the enemy pressure, Italy couldn&apos;t possibly face, other offensives made with over-flowing forces in other directions. Besides, it is now clear that it is not with units organised in a few days and, above all, with officers and non-commissicncd officers made in a hurry, without any experience and almost without any selection, that one can keep in full efficiency an army that must face those large masses of well trained men fully supplied with ponderous? means, that the enemy can throw against us.
Do you really want to know what is our situation ?I shall expose it to you with a few figures.Italy to live and make the war needs no less than 600 to 700 thousand tons of coal a month.   This is a small figure.   If you only think of your consumption, it is a trifling.   Prance has less inhabitants than Italy and she has secured a monthly consumption of 3,600,000 tons. One half of such figure she gets^S&amp;of her own collieries and the other half she-receives from England,It Is, therefore, absolutely necessary that the Allies should send to Italy as soon as possible more help in men--have read what the Austrian and German Ministers have said.   They feel sure to be^t. Italy because they have five guns against one and a larger quantity of men too.Yqu must send the greatest quantity of men and mater-ials .   One must not act by impulse, but study the situation and send entire great units .The strict minimum is now -NINE more divisions.   You must send them as soon as possible.Be side s It is necessary to make a great effort for the artillery/   We shall, build some if we have coal &quot;and sWelT&quot;^uT&quot;we&quot; expect the Allies to supply Us wivi a sufficient quantity, as it was stated in our last require-ments to the British Government .   Is it or is it not true what Count Czernin- stated ?   And if the Austrian and German artilleries are so much superior to the Italian is it poSgWtele not to start getting ready at once ?You know what the Italian Government has asked.It is little , because the war will reach its climax in Italy . -But it is necessary - let me say it again - to send at once as much artillery as possible .However, if you send steel and coal we shall build guns , arms and munitions , even if they will not prove enough.For the aviation we have a programme that will prove very efficacious and which I trust very much.   But shall we have the materials ?Very much depend on you and the United States of America .(11) Situation of &apos; the, factories^ of munitions . Lack ofl^&amp;Xjtjfcjr&amp;QiT&amp;j&apos;s ancf&quot;War &quot;factories.  -This is a point !&amp;&amp;at I instantly beg you to consider , If only you could come to Italy as a private traveller you would see how great are the sufferings of the people .   In no country the people suffer as much asin Italy.   Yet it doeon&apos;t matter what we suffer; one only thing is really necessary, and that is to win the war.Now: if Italy is left to herself, as she is now, she will not be able to stand the war much longer-   I beg you to look at the truth as it is .
Italy is , therefore, in an awful position.   Eer reserves of coal are exhausted by now , so Italy lives from day to day on the arrivals which, on account of the submarine war. become each day more difficult .   We have come to such a point that we rely,.for December, on arrivals of only 500/000 tons , and for January we cannot&apos; get more than 350 thousand .   We had to make limitations that the other countries are far from knowing.   The trains for travellers had to be reduced on all our Railways to one third of what they were before the war.   As for the railway transports of goods they are reduced to the food,,wood end materials for &quot;the army.   The gas - which is necessary for the by-products required for the munitions - has been suppressed almost everywhere: It has been left to only 6 cities and it was abolished lstely. in 130 cities.We have asked Prance to send us at once some coal, that England would refund to her later on.- But&apos;the coal doesn&apos;t arrive.. France, who has huge stocks, doesnft give us any.   England keeps us waiting. - How can we make the war: ?At Paris we proclaimed the equality of sacrifices . I don&apos;t think it is necessary,   I only ask you: do you want&apos;, to let us make the war ?   Let us put aside the principles which- we talked too much about and let us get busy for the war, which we talk little of .At&apos;Paris, Italy asked a minimum of 690,000 tons of coal a month too be employed for the following ends:200,000 tons for arms and munitions.   It is necessary to buildmuch artillery as soon as possible, and our factories cannot work. .70,000 tons for gas lights and power.   We cannot povsibly reduce this Item without Immediate danger for the explosives, above all for the benzol.60,000 tons, for the Navy., In a very imprudent way, but compelled by necessity, the Navy had to give a large shale of their reserves to the factories or arms and munitions .240,000 tons for the State Railways.   This item is reduced tothe minimum and such quantity of coal is required to a very large extent for the military transports.120,000 tons for the steamship companies, the State factories, the trades that supply food, and materials for the war for,the other railways and tramways.   No belligerent country can give an example, of consumptions reduced to such low figures .690,000 as a total Is strictly necessarItaly, whose imports of coal before the war were getting near a million tons a month, has seen her necessity for consumption increase - and the stocks at her disposal diminish.      Imports have gradually diminished and during the four months ..- July - October 1917 they have reached a monthly average of 508,000 tons and we only expect to get 300,0.00 during December .Please remark that we have no more heating in public &apos; and private buildings and not even hospitals can be heatedv -Only in a few instances they can heat with wood and lignite.We are disposed not to have baths, to suffer from cold weather and be uncomfortable v. That matters nothing, but shall we or shall we not continue the war- ?
Why our French friends, with a population inferior to ours, have requirements ten times larger ?   Canft you make any sacrifice ?This is the problem of coal, that must be solved . The solution exists and you can find it immediately,Believe me, the Italian population are very obedient, in spite of their appearance of unruliness .Organise things as best you can, but let us arrive soon to the result of giving Italy from 60^.^0 700,000 tons of coal a month.   Think that we only ask/tenth of what Prance has 1Is it so hard to make our voice heard, and get the means to work ?   Germans find their strength in rapidity and organis-ation,shall we find our weakness once more in delays and dis-organisation ?(Ill) Gravity of the crisis of the food.During the grain year 1917-18 , during the quarter September-November , Italy should have received 750,000 tons of cereals for human nourishment and she only got 370,000 tons.   Because of the sad military events she lost over 400,000 tons of cereals while the population of the invaded territory escaped behind our lines .     All that has been the c/use of a situation that is more than pre-occupying:   it is absolutely grave . There is lack of bread everywhere In Italy, even in the larger cities and in the bigger -centres of workmen, in spite of the fact that the Government takes greater care to supp;3^^opd to those centres.   Large gatherings of low class people/at ine door of food shops constitute permanert danger of breach of peace ;It is necessary to make provisions to that effect at once to avoid grave dangers and perhaps irreparable damages. Every measure of Limitation has been adopted.   Every superfluous thing has been abolished.   There are rations for all the more essential foods. &apos; But there are limits that cannot be surpassed *(IV)   Means- of maritjme transport .     This has always been the hardest question and we fully realise its difficulties .   To avoid the lack of bread we were compelled to displace for the transport of wheat many steamers that had to transport coal ,&apos;You know cur situation.England hss given to Italy almost each month a help in tonnage for the cereals in an insufficient quantity, and never above 10,000 tons.   Italy could transport 105,000 tons of cereals a month with the steamers (requisitioned, sequestered and freighted), that were permanently at her disposal up to the 1st of October.As Italy needs at least 325,000 tons of cereals a month, it is then necessary that England should supply Italy steamers for 220*300 tons a month, up to the 30th of June 1918,,, whereas until now she only promised 110,000 tons.   If she gives 520,000 tons a month, Italy shall be able to give back to the transport of coal and metals (that Is to things necessary to the war) those steamers that were displaced last October to provide.for the
transport of wheat.   At present almost all the steamers have been displaced, to the wheat transport to such ah, extent that by the end of Febsrenry , when such displacement is fully completed, we can rely only on monthly imports of 31,000 tons of metals from America and89,000 tons of coal from England.   Because of the displacement that we are king we are threatened to reserve less than 300,000 ns a month of coal, whereas we need at least 600,000.ma tonsYou must, if you want to give efficiency to the Italian army,.help us about two things: you must prevent that the quantities of coal and wheat that is strictly necessary to the resistance should lack.Otherwise any good disposition will prove of no use(V)   Financial question of Italy.It is the less grave thin/r and with a little good disposition we can face it at once .   You remember what I told you in Paris, Italy is a good debtor and will keep her engagements , but don&apos;t deprive her of what is indis-pens&amp;ble to her IIn our military disaster of last October we lost a large quantity of war materials; very large stocks of wheat, cloth, cotton, shoes and so forth.   It is necessary to make all that good, as far as possible, and everything must work well to the ends of the war .   I am disposed to all provisions and we shall inquire about sll the difficulties .  But it Is necessary that means don&apos;t lack us now .In Paris, we. have asked that up to the end of June 1918 the United States should open a credit for one milliard dollars and Great Britain for 102 millions sterling.   I beg you to use your influence with the American Government as far as you can to that effect.   I myself have interested my American&apos;&apos;friends to that .You know the situation of the exchange in Italy .   I have been and I shall be as strict as possible In limiting all the consumptions; no country suffers as much as Italy yet she will have to suffer even more .But think of this? whereas only a few years ago the Italian oaper money;- was dealt at a premium, now we are reduced to exchange rates that have gone higher than the high figures of 2001&apos;I have introduced the monopoly of the exchanges, it is a new and extremely strict prevision.     But after that what else ocn I do if you do not w-^nt to help us ?I know that there exist difficulties even for you, but it is a very little in comparison to the immense ones we have to deal with. ,    .Great Britain has taken&quot; engagements up to June 1918 for 66 millions sterling .   We need at least one ^hundred millions (I figured out 102 millions)?; that Is 81 for expenses and payments and 21 for the sale of exchanges.   Free exchanges for 4 or at least .3 millions sterling a month are necessary.Your Treasury must be.persuaded of that.   Bo you want to grant us a greater friendly benevolence ?That Italy could be useful and efficacious element in the war, I believe it is necessary:-&apos;
(I) That in view of the greater danger, in the shorter possible time nine or ten more divisions should be sent to Italy to hold the actual lines and make them stronger, and, above all, that the greater possible quantity of artillery should&quot;be sent.   Italy is the more seriously threatened $8 ail the &quot;countries of the Entente.   You must provide at once if you want her to reconstitute herself rapidly .(II) That you should consider the coal questionas an essential question for the war.   Even munition factories are being closed in Italy and the trains are reduced to a very low figure.   If you want - that Germany should not attain her ends, Italy must get at least 6 or 700,000 tons a month.   We need coal at once and it must be found a way to supply us with it .(III) That Italy should have the tonnage required to secure the tonnage required to secure the minimum quantity of wheat necessary to live; that is from 300,000 to 350,000 tons a month.(IV) That a fairer distribution of tonnage should be made so as to supply Italy at least of what is strictly necessary to life, and above all of coal, metals and supplies-for the army.   I make reference for that to the figures that our delegates and I myself have given.(V) That the financial help to the end of June 1918 should be of at least 100 millions sterling from Great Britain, with-20 million of free exchanges, and one milliard dollars from the United States.   Not only must we make good the heaviest losses we suffered, but we must face tht; new situation.I wanted to write you all this very sincerely. -As I told you and Lord Bering, I shall come to see you as soon as possible .   I hope soon after the first days of the New Year.I beg you to fully trust my words.   I have the feeling of war above anything else.  What I have written you I have written in the interest both of Italy and of the war.   If you realise the spirit of my proposals you will accept them at once, because you will consider them as one of the ways to give more efficsep: to the war.I fully trust you and your great energy. .With all best wishes that the New year bring, us peace and. victory, believe me, yours sincerely
