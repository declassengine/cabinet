Prom:-   Military Attache. To:-    ;-Director Military Intelligence,Petrograd,29th December.1017,No, 1593,     An officer who was sent to try to obtain a reply to my letter regarding&apos; the terms and armistice was told by Trot.sky yesterday that the clause regarding transfers of troops from Russian front will only remain in force until 14ch January, and though in a new armistice he will ask that this clause should be included, he cannot guarantee that it will be, and he aaded that it will be just as well on that account for allies to come into peace negotiations^lie said he did not know why the prohibition of transfers from Caucasus front had been omitted and thought it was oversight of delegate.   The General Staff are to-day lodging a formal protest-against the infraction of the armistice &quot;by continued transfers, and they are asking that the Caucasus front should be included in the prohibition clause.   However little hope can be placed on such representation.The framing of detailed instructions regarding the Control Commissions.was left by the peace delegation to the Stavka who apparently left the matter in turn to the staffs of the fronts.   It is impossible to ascertain what, if anything, has been done, but that there is no adequate control is certain.
