N.W, Barnard!ston.Maior-Oeneral.The British Military Mission,Lisbon. 11th December, 1917.
Report on a visit to bivouaos and trenches in King Edward VII1s Park, Lisbon, after the Revolutionary Movement of 5th-8th December, 1917.Major Casauiero, an officer of the Portuguese Expeditionary porce on leave from Prance, whero he holds the position of Commandant of the Portuguese Base at Brest, having invited me, my Staff and family to visit the positions occupied by the Revolutionary Forces during the fighting of the 5th, 6th and 7th instant, I took the opportunity of doing so yesterday morning.On arriving at the Barracks of the 1st Artillery, I learned that Major Sidonio Paes, the leader of the Revol-ution, was thoro.     I was not previously aware of this fact. We were introduced to him by Major Casquiero and also to Captain Machado Santos and Captain Felitfiano Costa, the members of the Revolutionary Committee.I explained that I had only t*ome on the invitation of Major Casquiero and that ny visit was in no sense an official one.     Major Sidonio Paes said that notwithstanding that he was greatly pleased and thanked me for coning.     Ho then invited us to accompany him round the defences, where we found many of the troops still in position.     We examined the trenches, gun positions, etc., and Major Sidonio Paes explained the measures taken,At the hour arranged for the outbreak of the Revolution (6 p.n. 5th December) he was certain of the support of only about 250 soldiers, including a battery of four 75 rim. guns.     He was joined very shortly by about  50 of the Cadets of the War School, and portions of other units. By degrees during the night of the 5th-6th other parties of men joined but I believe that at no timo were there more than about 1,000 troops under his command.     2hore ware also a
number of civilians.   His plan was to entrench himself on the high ground on the west side of King Edward VII&apos;s Park, which commands practically the whole of the central part of the city including the business quarter, the Government buildings, the Headquarters of the Republican Guard, and several Barracks.   One battery of field Artillery was posted here and other guns on the ground south of the Penitentiary to command the whole of the broad Avenida da Liberdade.   It was these which did so much damage to the Avenida Palace Hotel, which had at least 15 direct hits from shrapnel and was partly wrecked.   The Revolutionaries did not, at first, fire on the Fleet, as Major Paes hoped that they might declare themselves on his side.Efforts were made all along to induce other units or portions of them to join the Revolutionaries, and these efforts appear to have been fairly successful.   Towards the end of the operations, detachments began tn arrive from out-stations.    The garrison of the entrenched camp, or land defences of Lisbon, declared their sympathy with the Revolutionary party but do not appear to have taken an active part in the fighting, remaining at their posts in the various forts round the city.The action began by shelling the points of the city mentioned above, where it was expected the members of the Government or the Headquarters of Military Organization would be found.   Fire was also directed down the Avenida da Liberdade to prevent an attack from this direction.   At the same time patrols were sent out in various directions, who penetrated as far as the Rccio to the south-east, the Praca do Bresil a short distance to the south, and the Cainpo Pequeno to the east.     At the latter place there \:ms a slight skirmish with a small body of Government troops who soon retired.
When the Fleet began to fire against the Revolut-ionary Forces their fire was returned, but I gathered that Major Paes was not desirous of doing them more harm than he could help as he still hoped they would declare for him. The fire of the Fleet did very little damage.     The only serious attempt to close with the Revolutionaries and drive them from King Edward VIl&apos;s Park was made on their right flank, by tv/o columns of Republican Guards, and the Havy, which got as far as the neighbourhood of Praca do Bresil, and near the high water reservoir at the Praca das Amoreiras, about 800 yards from the main position of the Revolutionaries, from, which however owing to houses, etc, it could not be seen.This attack which took place in the afternoon cf the 7th instant appears to have been the final effort of the Government, and it being unsuccessful an armistice was arranged, and the Government, apparently realizing the uselessness of further fighting, resigned.The object of the Revolution was thus attained. During my walk round the defences with Major Sidonio Paes, he talked a good deal and was most emphatic in his denial of the assertion that the Revolution was monarchical or pro-German in its inception or its designs.   He declared that it was a purely Republican movement, having as its sole object the removal of an Inefficient, despotic and detested regime which had become insupportable,     The Revolutionary Committee, and the Government which he hoped would be formed very shortly were, he said, absolutely pro-Ally in every way; and most anxious to fulfil all the engagements already entered into with their old Ally Great Britain.     He did not allude to the despatch of reinforcements.     He asked me what was the feeling in England with regard to the Revolution, but ftold him I had no information on the subiect.
Conversations with some of the other officers elicited a decided contradiction of what has been alleged to be one of the causes of the Revolution, viz., that the troops were unwilling to go to France.     We were told that on the contrary they were ready and desirous- to do so.   My own personal opinion on this matter is that there has never been any enthusiasm in Portugal for the war, but the men in general are ready enough to go as part of their duty. There are of course a certain number of shirkers and discipline is not sufficiently strong to prevent their evading it-.   It is quite possible that the prospect of sending no more troops to France, if held out to the men, might have influenced them in favour of the Revolution, but I believe that their sense of duty will cause them to go without murmuring&apos; if called upon to do so.I give these as my impressions gathered from personal conversations both with the leaders of the Revolu-tionary movement since its success, and with other officers and men during a long period.Whether all the statements made to me were in good faith or not,I cannot say.   They had every appearance of being sincere, but only their actions will prove whether their statements are to be trusted.     The attitude which they take up with regard to the action which we have requested them to take in East Africa, and whether or not the early despatch of reinforcements to France takes place should determine this.Major Sidonio Paes also mentioned the intention of the new Government to pursue a conciliatory policy towards the Monarchists, in the hope of obtaining perhaps the co-oper-atlon of the best elements of that party with the Republican Government in assuring the well-fare of the country.The losses on the Revolutionary side appear to
nave been very slight, amounting to less than half-a-dozen casualties.I believe the Government forces had a good many in attacking the Fraca do Bresil.The total losses among troops and civilians during the Revolution amounted, according to the Press, to about 100 killed and rather over 500 wounded.(Sd.)
