ggMOEAIiDUM FOR WAR CABINET .I circulate these telsgrans.    There is ho doubt great difficulty in dealing satisfactorily with the case but after prolonged discussion with War Office and ministry of Shipping I think nothing more can usefully be done at present.     If the trouble in South Africa cannot be allayed, the Wool must be abandoned;   it is impossible to persist in the proposal without causing Botha grave trouble, but of course thin reason cannot be given publicly. No blame attaches to any Department of His Hajesty&apos;s Government.(Intd) fl.p.L.COLONIAL OFFICE,30th December, 1917.

In the matter of wool a most difficult position has arisen here.    As only about one third of clip was offered to His Majesty1 s Government a larvae amount is available for outside buyers, who are all Americans and Japanese.    They have bought and continue to buy enough wool to keep prices up and its removal seems to present little difficulty to them. 26,000 lbs scoured and 2,000,000 lbs in grease were exported to Japan m October and to America nearly 3,000,000 lbs scoured and over 9,000,000 lbs in grease.     Consequence is that farmers who did not sell to His Majesty&apos;s Government are obtaining much better prices than those who did.     If this continues it will still more discredit the Government of South Africa which has lost much ground through this wool question and will appear to confirm the Nationalist allegations that His Majesty&apos;s Government was attempting to cut prices.    There is the further consideration that unless those farmers who stood out of the official scheme this year are seen as a whole to be the losersyprospect of carrying through any official scheme in the future will be small.Can anything be done by His majesty1s Government to restrict outside purchasers here or to influence prices.    I infer from previous telegrams that nothing can be done as regards Japan but some arrangement with Americans who have become principal buyers may be possible.I shall be glad to have views of His Majesty&apos;s Government on this question.     It is of course essential to keep secret anything which may be done.BUXT0H.

The Governor General of the Union of South Africa to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. (Received Colonial Office, 10 p.m. 33nd December,1917)With reference to your telegram Personal and Secret December 20th. From discussions with, my Ministers I am confident that my telegram of December 14th represents their views-as well as my own. I have j refrained however from asking them to communicate with me on the subject officially since it is clear that if j anything is done it must be done not at the Ministers request but in the ordinary course carrying out thearrangements between His Majesty1 s Government and the Allies for the (control) of wool supplies.   It is essential moreover that it should not be known here that there has been any interference on the part either of His Majesty1s Government or of (Government of South Africa or of) myself.   My Ministers if interrogated in Parliament would have to disclaim kno?/ledge.   We are not in a position here to know whether His Majesty&apos;s Government could take any action which would satisfy these conditions and my telegram of December 14th intended to suggest consideration whether any action could be taken.Since my telegram of December 14th the position has if anything become worse and some persons who sold under the Government scheme now threaten to repudiate their agreement..

(Received Colonial Office, 12.10 p.m., 25th December, 1917).Urgent.    Private and personal.I have received a letter from General Botha ?who is? at his farm in which he takes an extremely serious view of situation caused by wool deal(ings).   According to his information while the value for Government wool is thirteen to thirteen and a half pence for a standard grade buyers in open market are giving seventeen pence for a similar grade and proportionately for other grades and very large quantities of wool are changing hands weekly and going to Canada America and Japan.Practically the whole of the wool bought by His Majesty!s Government was offered by the loyal section under pressure from the Government and from fselings of loyalty to;IGeneraL Botha and with idea as understood from ?His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s? telegram that there would be no open market or no freight available for individual purchasers. *General Botha states that his loyal section are deeply upset and even contemplate breaking their agreement and selling their wool in the open market;   a Dutchman&apos;s pocket is his very tenderest spGt. The nationalists are jubilant.He foresees very serious trouble and he asserts that the position of his Government and particularly his own is made next to impossible and he indicates the possibility of having to resign if. as he anticipates may be the case he loses the support of this section of his followers.    No threat is I am sure intended;   it is a genuine expression of opinion.General Botha was not aware that I had telegraphed to you.I have just received your telegram announcing the withdrawal ofthe
the steamers trading between South Africa and Canada.   Possibly tonnage available for United States may similarly diminish but it is doubtful whether this would be in time to save the situation here as regards wool.I await your answer to the previous telegram;   but it looks as if it might become necessity to consider whether in the unfortunate circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government could offer to release from their bargain those who so desire.BUTTON.
&amp; &apos; :; w,?w   .(this telegram is the property of his britannic majesty^ government and should be returned to the offices of the war cabinet for transmission to the colonial office when done with unless required for official use.)170PARAPHRASE mEQKJH: he-Governor-General of the Union of South Africa to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Received,Colonial Office,11.30 p.m., 28th December,-    191?.).With reference to my telegram December 24th, private and personal.   General Botha is so much perturbed about the wool position that he came over to-day from his farm to see me. He emphasised ail that he had said in his letter. I shewed him my telegram to you of 24th December and he endorses -it entirely.BUXfOM.
Personal and Secret.I have been much disturbed by your telegrams about wool and am very anxious to help General Botha, whose difficulties I fully appreciate by all means in my power.   The need for avoiding publicity, which rules out any representations to United States of America or Japan is the great obstacle to any effective action.With regard to Shipping, I have made some confidential enquiries and understand that withdrawal of tonnage so far as British Shipping to America is concerned is likely to go on steadily for next few months until no British ships are left in the service and it is not likely that neutral tonnage will take their place.    As regards tonnage controlled by United States of America I cannot speak with certainty but I am assured that United States of America is likely to fetch/ her wool from Australia by preference.    We cannot of course control Japanese liners, and route to North America is attractive to sailing ships, but no substantial addition to&quot; tonnage from these sources seems likely.    With regard to shipment to United Kingdom tendency will be for tonnage to increase in consequence of great demand for wool here which it is most desirable to satisfy from nearest source of supply in view of difficulties as regards shipping.   From this point of view we should regret any substantial diminution of amount expected from South Africa but if situation is such as to necessitate release of farmers from thier contracts, I will take matter up at once iaeam hearing from you to that effect. You will no doubt in that event supply me with some com-munication on which I could initiate official action.LONG-(This Telegram is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government and should be returned to the Offices of the War Cabinet for transmission to the Colonial Office when done with unless required for official use.)P ARAPHRASE TELEGRAM from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor General of the Union of South Africa (Sent 3 p.m. 31st December, 1917)
