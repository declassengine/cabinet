%  TWfl&amp;ument is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government]Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 19 IS.G.T.-3I96.THE LABOUR SITUATION.Report  mm the Ministry of Labour fo? the Week ending&quot; the 2nd January, 1918..&apos; Summary.Part I: General Remarks.Forces at work to disrupt national union between classes are examined and discussed.Part II: Press Opinions.A summary of the Labour Press is given with special reference to War Aims and Peace Terms, Shop Stewards, and Food.Part III: District Reports.The situation has become more disquieting chiefly in Yorkshire and on the Clyde.   The 12^ per cent, award continues to cause trouble.Part IV: Disputes.(a.) Involving Stoppages. There are a number of strikes in progress, those at Sheffield, on the Clyde, and at Belfast being serious.(b.) Not Involving Stoppages. A large number of disputes exist, chiefly connected with the 12^ per cent, advance and other wages demands.I. General Remarks. Attempts to destroy National Unity.Although no trace of its working has yet been discovered, some people find it difficult to believe that although. German propaganda has been active in Russia, France, and Italy, it should have entirely neglected this country, which is the principal enemy of Germany. The object of German activities in other countries has been consistently directed to breaking the &quot;union sacree&quot; and turning the different classes against each other; to producing revolution and anarchy if possible, or, failing this, discord on the subject of war aims. It may therefore be presumed that any German efforts in this country would be on the same lines.It is beyond question that a great deal of propaganda on these lines has actually taken place. Whether it is due to German inspiration, or whether it is only the development of the ordinary class-war propaganda is immaterial, as it serves the enemy&apos;s end equally well in either case. By dint of harping on &quot; profiteering,&quot; &quot;the inequality of sacrifice,&quot; and &quot;the capitalists&apos; war,&quot; a great deal has been done to destroy the spirit of unity which permeated the country in the early stages of the war, and unless this spirit is restored to a large measure the outlook for the critical months ahead is rather precarious.In certain popular organs of the Labour Press, and on the part of the pro-fessional and occasional agitators, the war is denounced as a capitalist war; it is alleged that the propertied classes initiated and continue it with the object of financial gain, and that the sacrifice of life and the toll of suffering are borne, if [1100-10] B
not entirely, at least in disproportionate measure, by the working classes. These allegations are accepted with avidity, and repeated as a true statement of the position, by the discontented and revolutionary sections of the workers. No attempt has been made on any adequate scale to refute these doctrines, and there are many who are led to believe them simply by their constant repetition and the silence with which they are met. The report recently received from Woolwich, to which reference is made in Section III of this report, that belief in the statements as to capitalist interest in prolongation of the war is current among the older and more sober of the workmen, affords support to this view.Recent experiences of the food shortage have unfortunately fortified the argu-ments of those whose aim it is to wage class-warfare. Great stress has been laid, even by the more reputable papers, on the inequality of sacrifice in the matter of food. Strong contrasts have been depicted between the wife of the working man, who is compelled to stand for hours in a queue in the hope of obtaining a meagre supply of inferior margarine, and the propertied lady who sits at home and awaits delivery of her butter. The &quot; Herald &quot; has made a good deal of capital out of this theme with its slogan &quot; How they starve at the Ritz.&quot;The purport of all is to emphasise the inequality of sacrifice, and incidentally, though possibly not with malicious intention, to expose the well-to-do to the envious odium of the poor.Many other instances of the same tendency to bring the &quot; governing classes &quot; into contempt by exposing &quot; muddles &quot; and sowing distrust of generals and admirals could be adduced. This line was first started by the Northcliffe Press, but it is now being exploited with considerable energy by the &quot;Herald&quot; and the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; for whom it is obviously good business.It is clear that disruptive tendencies of this kind are a serious feature of the situation, and that a determined effort is necessary to establish in this country the &quot; union sacree &quot; of the early days of the war. Successful steps to this end are as essential to a satisfactory prosecution of the war as further man-power. The steps to be taken appear to fall into three heads: &apos;(1.) In the first place it is necessary to remove any ground that may remain for the charge of &quot;profiteering &quot; and the capitalists interest in prolonging the war. An even more drastic application of the Excess Profits Tax, though late, would demonstrate the resolve of the Government to place every possible obstacle in the way of the &quot;profiteers.&quot;(2.) Compulsory rationing, whether under the authority of Local Food Com-mittees or by Governmental agency, would do much to destroy the charge of inequality of sacrifice in regard to food.(3.) The third step is to dispose of the fable that the propertied classes stand to gain by the war, and that they have not made the same sacrifices on the battlefield as the working classes. The argument in favour of &quot; conscription of wealth &quot; is that the poor man offers his life, but the rich man will not offer his money. The fact that the rich have offered their lives or those of their sons even more freely than the working classes is usually left out of account. The knowledge that this was so did much to cement the feeling of solidarity among all classes at the begin-ning of the war, but it has become largely obscured by the fog of misrepresentation which has been spread by the I.L.P. and others. It would be easy to show from the casualty lists that the losses among officers are far higher than among the rank and file, and if it were put to him, the working man would see that the &quot; capitalist,&quot; whose sons are at the front, has as much to lose by the continuance of the war as he has. It may be humiliating that such a propaganda should be necessary, but the activities of the pacifists and others have unfortunately made it so. It is a matter to which the War Aims Committee might usefully pay very close attention, and if thev are to succeed their refutation of the current misrepresentation must be as widespread and continuous as the charges themselves.II. Press Opinions.War Aim,s and Peace Terms.The pronouncement of the Central Empires on the subject of peace terms was received too late to allow of comment&apos; from the Labour press, but meanwhile the statement of war aims made by the Labour Party and Trade Union Congress has
afforded scope for widespread comment. Generally that statement is accepted as adequate, but the &quot; British Citizen and Empire Worker &quot; treats the proposals with contumely, while on the other hand the &quot;Call&quot; and the &quot;Herald&quot; combine to demand an immediate conference jof the International as a preliminary to the formation of definite and final terms. The &quot; Herald &quot; points out that Labour is in a peculiarly strong position for negotiation with the Government on the subject of peace terms. It advocates refusal to agree to any further supply of man-power from industry unless the Government is prepared to agree to make peace on the terms laid down by Labour. In connection with peace movements, Lord Lansdowne&apos;s letter still receives attention, the &quot; Woolwich Pioneer &quot; claiming that by the letter he has publicly announced his adherence to the principles of the I.L.P. The paper comments with enthusiasm on the blow which the letter has administered to the &quot; Never-enders.&quot;Man-power.The announcement that industry will be called upon to provide more men for the Army has been received generally with more moderation than might have been expected. Complaints on the score of &quot; broken pledges&quot; are comparatively rare. Opposition is most evident in the &quot;Herald,&quot; and even in that journal is of a modified description. The advice offered to Labour is that agreement to a comb-out should be contingent on a statement of the position and of the intentions of the Government, which should satisfy Labour of the necessity of the case. The oppor-tunity for a bargain is evidently considered unique. In connection with this question the &quot; Plerald &quot; prints in extenso Commander Wedgwood&apos;s speech in the House of Commons on the subject of the Passchendaele and Cambrai offensives, and suggests that before, the comb-out is accepted there should be a guarantee of economical and efficient use of the man-power provided. It also warns the Govern-ment of the futility of agreement with Trade Union officials &quot; behind the backs of the rank and file.&quot;The Strike Leaflet.Several papers have followed the lead of the &quot; Nation &quot; and have published the &quot; Kamerad &quot; leaflet, printed during the engineers&apos; strike of May last for the Ministry of Munitions. Caustic comment on the incident is provided by the &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; which alleges that the printer was authoritatively indemnified against proceedings in the event of discovery.Shov Stewards.The agreement between the employers and a number of unions on the recognition of shop stewards and their functions is welcomed in the Labour press as a pro-gressive step, the &quot; Herald&quot; alone commenting adversely on suggested discourteous treatment of the A.S.E., who, it understands, were not even invited to the conference at which the agreement was signed.A Labour Government.The &quot; Herald &quot; continues its campaign against tne existing Government, and this week publishes an article by Mr. Pringle, M.P. &quot; LI. G. must Go &quot;- and a leader, covering two pages, on the same subject, demanding that the reins should be handed over to a Labour Government.Food.Every Labour paper deals at length with the food problem. Most agree that the Food Controller is doing his best, though &quot;Justice &quot; sees in his recent orders an attempt to pass his responsibility on to the Local Eood Committees, In several quarters demands are made for general compulsory rationing, and there can be little doubt that this measure would be on the whole welcomed as ensuring equality of sacrifice. Allegations that the, rich are able to obtain whatever they desire while the poor are permitted to starve are common, and the &quot;Herald &quot; lends its weight to this view m an article &quot;Still Starving at the Eitz,&quot; which reproduces with.
appropriate comment a facsimile of the dinner menu, of the 17th December. The shortage of meat has received much? attention, the blame for that shortage being placed at the door of the wholesalers and producers.III. District Eeports.London.Although this district continues to remain quiet, the impending &quot;comb-out&quot; is causing considerable agitation among Woolwich workers.It is reported that the Governments proposals are viewed with suspicion, and a political move to weaken the A.S.E. is feared. It would be advisable to make it quite clear that the Government is working with and through the unions.The question of opening negotiations for peace is the subject of much discussion at Woolwich, and capitalists are said to be prolonging the war longer than is necessary. It is interesting to note that this opinion is held by the older and more experienced men who are not liable for military service.There is still much dissatisfaction owing to the alleged shortage of food, and the inhabitants of Woolwich complain that the food queue is by no means a thing of the past.It is reported that the decision to give all grades the 12-1 per cent, increase at Messrs. Cubitts has given very great satisfaction.South-Western.Railway operatives at Eastleigh are restless owing to the inability of the authorities to come to terms with. them. The recent award to the men of 6s. per week has apparently failed to bring about an amicable settlement of the trouble with certain sections of employees, chiefly men of the crafts unions. They are now con-tending that in addition they should receive the 12-1 per cent, bonus, as awarded to munition workers. At a recent conference the carriage workers were offered an advance of 2s. per week, and the men in the locomotive department were offered Is. per week. The offers were in both cases declined. The men are of opinion that they will not get satisfaction, and as an alternative a small percentage of the men are leaving weekly.West Blidlands.Although the situation in this area is satisfactory, considerable outcry amongst Birmingham workers is reported on account of meagre rations allotted to each individual under the scheme which has just been set on foot by the local Food Control Committee.Operatives doing hard manual work complain that the ration will be insufficient. It is reported that furnace and gas men who formerly drank beer during their duty hours now drink tea. Discontent is stated to exist at Coventry owing to the post-ponement of the payment of the 12^ per cent, bonus, while there is acute unrest at Wednesbury over the application of the same advance.As in most industrial centres, the proposed comb-out is the subject of much adverse comment. The proptosals of the Government are not being well received by the workers. It is thought that a more definite announcement as to the country&apos;s needs, and the steps which are being taken in connection with the trade unions, would have an excellent effect./Yorkshire and East Midlands.The situation in this area regarding the 12^ per cent, advance has rapidly come to a head during the past few days.Strikes occurred last week at some of the smaller works and on the 26th . December, after the Governments decision not to sanction the employers&apos; offer to granlt the advance, bad been made known, a mass meeting of workpeople was held and decided not to resume work after the holidays until a definite settlement bad been effected.
Further meetings of textile workers and of unskilled workers on munitions were held on the 31st December, and it is now reported that between 12,000 and 13,000 men employed on steel and iron work have come out on strike. Mass meetings were held yesterday, but the men determined not to return to work until their demands are granted.In Leeds the workers are on the whole cheerful, and there is very little grumbling, even on the subject of food. It is feared in some quarters that a very critical period for the woollen trade is approaching.North-Western.In Liverpool and Manchester the proposed &quot;comb-out&quot; is causing much agitation, and in the latter city workers in the engineering trades are greatly opposed to the suggested scheme. It is said that the men will refuse to go until all the semi-skilled and unskilled workers who have entered the works since August 1914 have been taken.Manchester shop stewards have now started a movement with a view to obtaining the same rate of pay for machine workers as for fitters and turners, basing their demand upon the fact that in the sftops in the South of England there is no distinction between these grades, and that this should also apply to the North.The position as regards the extension of the 12-^ per cent, advance to men other than those employed on munition work is regarded by the local officer of the Ministry of Munitions as &quot;precarious.&quot; He thinks that a general strike in the Manchester district is by no means impossible.The situation at Barrow is quiet. The short and irregular hours during wjiich the public-houses remain open for the sale of beer continue to be an important local cause of unrest.North-Eastern.There is still great unrest amongst the moulders in this district over the 12^ per cent, advance, and it is reported that the movement among them to cease working piece-work is becoming general. Piece-work has never been popular in this district, and it is not impossible that there will be a serious cessation of work if the men&apos;s demands are not conceded.South Wales.The position throughout this district is far from satisfactory. During the last week eighty extreme Socialists met at Cardiff ostensibly to discuss the affairs of the Unofficial Reform Committee of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation. It is reported that the real object of this meeting which was strictly private was as follows: (1.) To consider the question of income tax for miners, and to agitate for a strike.(2.) To devise ways and means to counteract the Governments action in combing out the mines.(3.) To consider names submitted of men who will find money for their propaganda.The South Wales Miners&apos; Federation held a Conference on the 31st December at Cardiff. They expressed their determination to press for an abatement of the inicome tax on wages, and decided to enlist the support of the Triple Alliance for the purpose of enforcing their demands.An important resolution demanding the fuller control of food supplies by tjie Government was also passed.The shopmen on the South Wales railways are very discontented at the recent agreement reached by the N.U.R. with the Railway Executive, and again threaten to strike.Scotland.Owing to the commencement of the Scottish holidays the actual position in this district is quieter, though the prospect for the future is not promising.  Delavs over the 12^ per cent, advance are causing much irritation, whioh is increased by [1100-10] c
the attempts of some firms to put time-workers on to piece-work, thus depriving them of the advance. This is thought to be strengthening the opposition to constitu-tional trade unionism. j: Pacifism is reported to be still rife, and the recent peace demonstration at Glasgow attracted between four and five thousand people. The suggestion that the War Aims Committee should devote particular attention to the district does not yet appear to have been acted on.The Clyde Workers&apos; Committee is displaying considerable activity and is in touch with the Manchester shop stewards with regard to the recent man-power proposals. .. ,Ireland.Much unrest is reported to exist throughout this area, and there appears to be a general demand for increase of wages in most industries.IV. Disputes.(a.) Involving a stoppage of work.The V2\ per cent, bonus is still the cause of increasing unrest; this is chiefly manifest among piece-workers who have not yet received the award.A serious strike at Sheffield over this question is referred to hi Section III.At Birkenhead the riveters employed by Messrs. Cammell, Laird, did not return to work after the Christmas holidays. The cause of this strike, which involved over a thousand men, is the exclusion of these men from the 12^ per cent, advance. .As has been reported previously, Newcastle moulders, -working on piece rates, are threatening to cease work, and in Scotland the Central Emergency Committee of the Ironmoulders have recently held meetings, and resolutions have been passed calling upon the authorities to extend the 12J per cent, award to these workers, failing which they will down tools on the 14th of January.The Shipyard Labour Department reports that four strikes have occurred in the Clyde district during the past week.The most serious of these, which involves over 3,000 boilermakers employed on piece-work at Messrs. Beardmore&apos;s, Armstrong Whitworth, and other firms, arose out of the 12\ per cent, advance. As a result of this, work has been practically suspended in eight important shipyards.Meetings of the men and a conference of the Boilermakers&apos; Executive with the Ship-yard Labour Department have been held, but it is not yet known whether the men will return to work when the holidays, which began three days after the stoppage took place, come to an end.On the 25th December, 800 men employed by Messrs. Denny Bros, took the best part of the day off to hold a meeting on the subject of the 12^ per cent. .A serious-strike which arose, out of the same point began at Belfast on the 20th of December, and still continues. It will be remembered that on the 14th November between 4,000 and 5,000 engineers and others employed at the Belfast yards ceased work. On the 26th November the men were induced to return pending a decision on the payment of the Yl\ per cent, advance&apos;to piece-workers. As regards Messrs. Harland and Wolff, Ltd., and Messrs. Workman, Clark, &amp; Co., the Committee on Production issued a provisional award, viz. : That from the beginning of the first full pay day in December the percentage advance now payable upon the list prices should be increased to the extent of a further 5 p?r cent.On the 20th ultimo about 1,900 men, riveters, platers, drillers and others of the above-mentioned firms, ceased work owing to- dissatisfaction with the award. At a meeting of the representatives of the men and employers it was agreed that work shall be resumed on the 6th instant. The men&apos;s representatives have put forward a condition that if work is resumed the arbitration proceedings shall be reheard on the 3rd instant. It is expected that the majority of the men will resume work after their holidays.The Ministry of Munitions reports that strikes are proceeding at Birmingham, Darlaston, Bilston, and other places in the Black Country, on the question of the 12i per cent, bonus. This trouble was also the cause of a strike of 300 labourers at Messrs. Beardmore&apos;s, Parkhead, on the 25th December.In addition to several other stoppages over the 12J per cent, award, a somewhat serious strike, affecting 200 woodworkers, employed on time .rates by Messrs. Bleriot, Ltd. (Addlestone), occurred on the 24th December. The woodworkers ceased work as a protest against an individual piece-work system which is being worked by a number of other employees of the&apos; firm.
The serious strike of munition workers at Messrs. Beardmore&apos;s, at Paisley, described in-this Beport of the 19th December, came virtually to a close on the 21st December, when most of the strikers returned to work.   The remainder resumed during the succeeding week.The riveters at Messrs. Fairfields, Govan, and at Messrs-. Simons, Eenfrew, who had struck as a protest against the Committee on Production^ action with regard to riveting rates, are now back at work.The War Office Contracts Department reports serious unrest among iron and steel moulders in the Cleveland district. It is stated that piece-workers are on strike on account of the decision of the War Cabinet not to extend to them the 12^ per cent, increase granted to time-workers.Six new cases of strike, two of which have been settled, are reported this weekby the Coal Controller.A strike directly  involving   350   miners  has   occurred   at  the  Mickley   Colliery (Northumberland) regarding the payment of the war wage.   The men are reported to be striking against the advice of their leaders, and the county officials of the union concerned &apos; are being urged to put an end to the stoppage.Strikes have occurred in the South Wales area, but are not serious.(b.) Not involving a stoppage of work.The Shipyard Labour Department reports fifteen new disputes not involving a stoppage of work.It is stated that in the Glasgow area a movement has arisen to create disturbances on somewhat similar lines to the recent trouble in Coventry. The Ironmoulders and the Clyde Workers Emergency Committee are at present principally concerned in this movement.The riveters have passed resolutions expressing dissatisfaction with the Committee on Production Awards of &quot;the 11th December, and announce that unless the whole of their demands, put forward at the arbitration, are granted they will stop work at the end of the first week after the holidays.There appears to be reason to fear that an organised movement is on foot to create a general stoppage in the district immediately after the holidays terminate.Disputes have occurred among men employed on riveting by Cardiff Dry Dock Company and Colby Bros., Lowestoft.Only four cases of dispute, not involving a stoppage, are reported by the Ministry of Munitions. The most serious of these originated in the electrical industry in South Wales out of a demand for the extension of the last 55. award of the 6th November, 1917. The question has been referred, by the Employers&apos; Associations and the Union Executive, to the Chief Industrial Commissioner.No new cases of dispute are reported by the War Office Contracts Department.Two new cases of dispute are reported by the Coal Controller.A ballot has taken place with a view to a strike at Park Colliery (Forest of Dean), but an insufficient majority was secured, and it is thought that the dispute may be regarded as settled.A dispute on the non-unionist question is reported to be in progress among the colliers at Ashington in Northumberland. The men have voted in favour of a &quot; down-tools &quot; policy which, if carried out would involve some 8,000 of them.The Chief Industrial Commissioners Department summarises the new differences as follows: For the week ending the 22nd December 109, for the week ending the 29th December (three effective working days), 49.Mention is made of the claim made to the Scottish Steel Makers&apos; Association by the Scottish Steel Trades Joint Committee in respect of holiday allowances; the matter is being referred to the Committee on Production.The Employers&apos; Association of the Port of Liverpool report a refusal of the members of the National Union of Dock Labourers and Eiverside Workers to work with non-union men, and in respect of an application for an eight hours day.The Department are in communication with the union on the matter.No report this week has been received from the Committee on Production.D. J. SHACKLETON.
