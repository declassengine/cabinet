In some Upland districts, especially in the south-west, the snowstorm was accompanied by serious drifting and many sheep were buried.   MoBt were brought out alive in the course of a day or two, but there has been a certain amount of loss.1. District Agricultural Committees.During the week a representatire of the Board had a meeting With the Perth Central Committee and also with a Committee of the Perth City Council, with reference to the cultivation of grass parks in the neighbourhood of Perth.    Outstanding questions with the occupiers of many of these park3 were satisfactorily settled.2.Grouse and Black Game (Scotland) Order. 1917 (Ho. 2).Under Regulation 2 R. of the Defenco of the Realm Regulations the Board have issued an Order authorising the killing and taking, the sale and purchase, and the possession of grouse and black game in Scotland, at any time between 20th December 1917 and 20th Janu-&amp;ry 1918, by any person who would be entitled to do any of these things between 12th August and 10th December in any year.Forestry.1&apos; Additional Forestry Officer in Scotland.The Board have appointed Mr C. P. Gordon, B.So.(Forestry), B.Sc.(Agriculture) of the Forestry staff of the Glasgow and West i of Scotland Agricultural College to the post of additional Forestry Officer in Scotland.2. Forestry Training for Discharged Soldiers and Sailors.vtj-th a view to making good the present dearth of working foresters in Scotland the Board have formulated a scheme for training discharged service men in forestry work, on the following lines(a) The Local Pensions Committees set up by the Ministry of Pensions will delect, with the Board&apos;s approval, men of a certain physical fitness for a course of instruction in,forestry.(b) The training will be mainly practical and will be carried out under the direct supervision of Head Foresters on woodland estates made available for the scheme by the proprietors.   Supple-r mentary leotures will be supplied by the Board where possible.The period of training will not exceed six months and the primary object of the scheme will be the fitting of the men to act as ordinary working foresters. . The majority of the landowners to whom the Board have appealed for assistance have undertaken to train a certain number of men as suggested and they have agreed in many oases to provide housing accommodation for them during the course.(c) The Board propose to select from the trainees under this elementary scheme suitable men for further instruction in the higher branches of forestry at a centra,! training school proposed to be set up in Scotland as described below.

Establishment of a School of Practical Forestry.The Board have also&apos;been impressed-by the necessity for providing for foremen foresters who would be in a position to supervise the work of replanting that is likely to be carried out on an extensive scale after the War.   They have accordingly framed a further scheme for the establishment of a central school of prac-tical forestry in a suitable district (preferably central Scotland) Where facilities could be obtained for training 20 or 30 men at a -time in practical and theoretical forestry.   The course uould extend over a period of twelve or&apos; eighteen months.    In the meantime the Boarj would of necessity confine.-the scheme mainly to discharged soldiers and sailors and a selection of the -more intelligent and able-men unde] the elementary training scheme summarised above would be made for thej purpose.   The Board have made, application to the Development Com-missioners for assistance in &quot;the scheme &quot;and it is hoped to set up the] school at an early date.IIIr Recruiting in Agriculture. &apos;- :       &apos;Military Service Acts 1916.(a) The number of certificates issued by the Board in connection with the scheme for vouching agricultural workers in terms of Army Council1 Instruction 1175 (i.e. cases remitted by Recruiting Officers) is as follows:- Areas.
