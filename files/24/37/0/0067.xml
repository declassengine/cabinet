emorandum on War Aims.The Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress and the Executive Committee of the Labour Party, taking into consideration the desirability of formulating a definite statement of War Aims and Peace Policy which shall express the general sense of the Labour Movement as a &apos; whole, submit the following draft, which they jointly recommend for general endorsement by all sections of the British Labour Movement.THE WAR.The British Labour Movement declares that whatever may have been the causes of the outbreak of war,, it is clear that the peoples of Europe, who are necessarily the chief sufferers from its horrors, had themselves no hand in it. Their common interest is now so to conduct the terrible struggle in which they find themselves engaged as to bring it, as soon as may be possible, to an issue in a secure and lasting Peace for the world.- The British Labour Movement sees no reason to depart from the declara-tion unanimously agreed to at the Conference of the. Socialist, and Labour Parties of the Allied Nations on February 14th, 1915, which is printed as an Appendix hereto. (- ;  ii.     - c.:  -MAKING THE/WORLD SAFE FOR DEMOCRACY.Whatever may have been the objects for which the War was begun, the fundamental purpose of the British Labour Movement in supporting the continuance of the struggle is that the world may henceforth be made safe for Democracy. ,Of all the War aims, none is so important to the peoples of the world as that there should be henceforth on earth no more war. Whoever triumphs the peoples will&apos; have lost, unless some effective method of preventing war can be found. As means to this end the British Labour Movement relies very largely upon the complete democratisation of all countries; on the frank abandonment of every form- of &quot; Imperialism &quot;; on the suppression of secret diplomacy and on the placing of foreign policy, just as much as home policy, under, the control of popularly elected Legislatures; on the absolute responsibility of the Foreign Minister of each -country to its Legis-lature; on such concerted action as may be possible for the universal abolition of compulsory military service in all countries, the common limitation of the costly armaments by which all the peoples are burdened, and the entire abolition of profit-making armament firms; whose pecuniary interest lies always in war scares and rivalry in preparation for war. But it demands, in addition, that it should be an essential part of the Treaty of Peace itself that there should be forthwith established a Super-National Authority, or League of Nations., which should not only be adhered to by all the present belligerents, but which every other independent sovereign State in the world should be pressed to join; the immediate establishment by such League of Nations not only of an International High Court for the settlement of all disputes between States that are of justiciable nature, but also of appropriate machinery for prompt and effective mediation between States in issues that are not justiciable; the formation of an International Legislature in which the representatives of every civilised State would have their allotted share; the gradualdevelop-ment, as far as may prove to be possible, of International Legislation, agreed to by and definitely binding upon the several States; and for a solemn agreement and pledge by all States that every issue between any two or more
of thertis shall be submitted for settlement as aforesaid, and that, wherever necessary common cause will be made against any State or States by the use of any and every means at their disposal to enforce adherence to the terms of the agreement and pledge.TEBBITORIAL ADJUSTMENTS.The British Labour Movement has no sympathy with the attempts made, now in this quarter and now in that, to convert this War into a War of Conquest whether what is sought to be acquired by force is territory or wealth; nor should the struggle be prolonged for a single day, once the conditions of a permanent Peace can be secured, merely for the sake of extending the boundaries of any State. But it is impossible to ignore the fact that, not only restitution and reparation, but also certain territorial readjustments are required, if a renewal of armaments and war is to be avoided. These readjustments must be such as can be arrived at by common agreement on the general principle of allowing all peoples to settle their own destinies, and for the purpose of removing any obvious cause of future international conflict.- (a) Belgium.The British Labour Movement emphatically, insists that a foremost condition of Peace must be the reparation by the German Government, under the direction of an International Commission, of the wrong admittedly done to Belgium; payment by that Government for all the damage that has resulted from this wrong; and the restoration of Belgium to complete and untrammelled independent sovereignty, leaving to the decision of the Belgian people the determination of their own future policy in all respects.(b) Alsace and Lorraine.The British Labour Movement reaffirms its reprobation of the crime against the peace of the world by which Alsace and Lorraine were forcibly torn from France in 1871, a political blunder the effects of which have con-tributed in no small degree to the continuance of unrest and the growth of militarism in Europe; and, profoundly sympathising with the unfortunate inhabitants of Alsace and Lorraine who have been subjected to so much repression, asks, in accordance with the declarations of the French Socialists, that they shall be allowed, under the protection of the Super-National Authority or League of Nations, freely to decide what shall be their future political position.(c) The Balkans.The British Labour Movement suggests that the whole problem of the reorganisation of the administration of the peoples of the Balkan peninsula might be dealt with by a Special Conference of their representatives, or by an authoritative International Commission, on the basis of (a) the complete freedom of these people to settle their own destinies, irrespective of Austrian, Turkish, or other foreign dominion; (b) the independent sovereignties of the several nationalities in those districts in which these are largely predominant; (c) the universal adoption of religious tolerance, the equal citizenship of all races, and local autonomy; (d) a Customs Union embracing the whole of the Balkan States; and (e) the entry of all the Balkan National States into a Federation for the concerted arrangement by mutual agreement among themselves of all matters of common concern.(d) Italy.The British Labour Movement declares its warmest sympathy with the people of Italian blood and speech who have been left outside the inconvenient and indefensible boundaries that have, as a result of the diplomatic agree-ments of the past, been assigned to the kingdom of Italy, and supports their
claim to be united with those, of their own race and tongue. It realises that arrangements may be necessary for securing the legitimate interests of the people of Italy in the adjacent seas, but it has no&apos;sympathy with the far-reaching aims of conquest of Italian Imperialism, and believes that all legitimate needs can be safeguarded, without precluding a like recognition of the needs of others or annexation of other people&apos;s territories..(c) Poland, Etc.With regard to the other cases in dispute, from Luxembourg, on the one hand, of which the independence has been temporarily destroyed, to the lands now under foreign domination inhabited by other races the outstanding example being, that of the Poles the British Labour Movement relies as the only way of achieving a lasting settlement on the application of the principle of allowing each people to settle its own destiny.\f) The Jews and Palestine.The British Labour Movement demands for the Jews in all countries the same elementary rights of tolerance, freedom of&quot;residence and trade, and equal citizenship that ought to be extended to all the inhabitants of every nation. It further expresses the opinion that Palestine should be set free from the harsh and oppressive government: of the Turk, in order that this country may form a Free State, under international guarantee, to which such of the Jewish people as desire to do so may return, and may work out their own salvation free from interference by those of alien race or religion.(g) The Problem of the Turkish Empire.The British Labour Movement condemns the handing back to the universally execrated rule of the Turkish Government any subject people. Thus, whatever may be proposed with regard to Armenia, Mesopotamia, and Arabia, they cannot be restored to the. tyranny of the Sultan and his Pashas. The British Labour Movement dis-claims all sympathy with the Imperialist aims of Governments and capitalists who would make of these and other territories now dominated by the Turkish hordes merely instruments either of exploitation or militarism, if in these territories it is impracticable to leave it to the peoples to settle their own destinies the British Labour Movement insists that, conformably with the policy of &quot; no annexations;,&quot; they should be placed for administra-tion in the hands of a Commission acting under the Super-National Authority or League of Nations. It is further suggested that the peace of the world requires that Constantinople should be made a free, port, permanently neutralised, and p*laced (together with both shores of the Dardanelles and possibly some or all of Asia Minor) under the same impartial administration.(h) The Colonies of Tropical Africa.With regard to the Colonies of the several belligerents in Tropical Africa, from seato sea whether including all North of the Zambesi River and South of the Sahara Desert, or only those lying between ISdeg. North and 15deg. South Latitude, which are already the subject of international control the British Labour Movement disclaims all sympathy with the Imperialist idea that these should form the booty of any nation, should be exploited for the v profit of the capitalist, or should be used for the promotion of the militarist aims of Governments. In view of the fact that it is impracticable here to leave the various peoples concerned to settle their own destinies, it is suggested that the interests of humanity would be best served by the full and frank abandonment by all the belligerents of any dreams of. an African Empire; the transfer of the present Colonies of the European Powers in Tropical Africa, however the limits of this area may be defined, to the proposed
Super-National Authority or League of Nations herein suggested; and their administration under the Legislative Council of that Authority as a single independent African State with its own trained staff, on the principles&apos; of (1) taking account, in each locality, of the wishes of the people, when these can be&apos; ascertained; (2) protection of the natives against exploitation and oppression and the preservation of their tribal interests; (8) all revenue raised to be expended for the welfare ^,nd development of the African State itself; and (4) the permanent neutralisation of this African State and its abstention from participation in international rivalries or any future wars.-    IV. &apos; - -  -      *   &quot; . 4ECONOMIC RELATIONS.The British Labour Movement declares against all the projects now being-prepared by Imperialists and capitalists, not in any one country only, but in most countries, for an Economic War, after Peace has been secured, either against one or other foreign nation or against all foreign nations, as such an Economic War, if begun by any country, would inevitably lead to reprisals, to which each nation in turn might in self-defence be driven. It realises that all such attempts at economic aggression, whether by Protective Tariffs or capitalist trusts or monopolies, inevitably result in the spoliation of the working classes of the several countries for the profit of the capitalists; and the British workmen see in the alliance between the Military Imperialists and the Fiscal Protectionists in any country whatsoever not only a serious danger to the prosperity of the masses of the people, but also a grave menace to Peace. On the other hand, the light of each nation to the defence of its own economic interests, and, in face of the world-shortage hereinafter mentioned, to the conservation for its own people of a sufficiency of its own supplies of foodstuffs and raw materials, cannot be denied. The British Labour Movement accordingly urges upon the Labour Parties of all countries the importance of insisting, in the attitude of the Government towards commercial enterprise, along with the necessary control of supplies for its own people, on the principle of the open door, on Customs Duties being limited strictly to revenue pur-poses, and on there being no hostile discrimination against foreign countries. But it urges equally the importance, not merely of conservation, but also of the utmost possible development by appropriate Government action of the resources of every country for the benefit not only of its own people, but also of the world, and the need for an international agreement for the enforcement in all countries of the legislation on factory conditions, hours of labour, and the prevention of &quot; sweating &quot; and unhealthy trades necessary to protect the workers against exploitation and oppression.V.THE PROBLEMS OF- PEACE.To make the world safe for Democracy involves much more than the prevention of war, either military or economic. It will be a device of the capitalist interests to pretend that the Treaty of Peace need concern itself only with the cessation of the struggles of the armed forces and with any necessary territorial readjustments. The British Labour Movement insists that, in view of the probable world-wide shortage, after the War, of export-able foodstuffs and raw materials, and of merchant shipping, it is imperative, in order to prevent the most serious hardships, and even possible famine, in One country or another, that systematic arrangements should be made on an international basis, for the allocation and conveyance of -the available exportable&apos; surpluses of these commodities to the different countries, in proportion, not to their purchasing powers, but to their several pressing
needs; and that, within each country, the Government must for some time maintain its control of the most indisponsable commodities, in order to secure their appropriation, not in a competitive market mainly to the richer classes in proportion to their means, but, systematically, to meet the most urgent needs of the whole community on the principle of &quot; no cake for anyone until all have bread.&quot;Moreover, it cannot but be anticipated that, . in all countries, the dislocation of industry attendant on Peace, the instant discharge of millions of munition makers and workers in War trades, and the demobilisation of millions of soldiers in face of the scarcity of industrial capital, the shortage of raw materials, and the insecurity of commercial enterprise- will, unless prompt and energetic action be taken by the several Governments, plunge a large part of the wage-earning population into all the miseries of unemploy-ment more or less prolonged. In view of the fact that widespread unemployment in any country, like a famine, is an injury not to that country alone, but impoverishes also the rest of the world, the British Labour Movement holds that it is the duty of every Government&apos; to take immediate, action, not merely to relieve the unemployed, when unemployment has set:in, but actually, so far as may be practicable, to prevent the occurrence of unemployment. It therefore urges upon the Labour Parties of every country the necessity of their pressing upon their Governments the preparation of plans for the execution of all the innumerable public works (such as the making and repairing of roads, railways, and water-ways, the erection of schools and public buildings, the provision of working-class dwellings, and the reclamation and afforestation of land) that will be required in the near future, not for the sake of finding measures of relief for the unemployed, but with a view to these works being undertaken at such a rate in each locality as will suffice, together- with the various capitalist enterprises .that may be in progress, to maintain at a fairly uniform level year by year, and throughout each year, the aggregate demand.for labour; and thus prevent there being any unemployed. It is now known that in this way it is quite possible for any Government to prevent, if it chooses, the occurrence of any widespread or prolonged involuntary unemployment; which if it is now in any country allowed to occur, is as much the result of Government neglect as is any epidemic disease..&apos; : .&apos;.    : S^ft^vfS   :    &apos;      - &apos;RESTORATION OE THE DEVASTATED AREAS AND REPARATION-   OE WRONGDOING.The British Labour Movement holds that one of the most imperative duties of all countries immediately Peace is declared will be the restoration, so far as may be possible, of the homes, farms, factories, public buildings, and means of communication wherever destroyed by war operations ; that tUe restoration should not be limited to compensation for public buildings, capitalist undertakings, and material property proved to be destroyed or damaged, but should be extended to setting up the wage -earners and peasants themselves in homes and employment; and that to ensure the full and impartial application of these principles the assessment and distribution of the compensation, so far as the cost is contributed by any International Fund, should be made under the direction of an International Commission.The. British Labour Movement will not be satisfied unless there is a full and free judicial investigation into the accusations made on all sides that particular Governments have ordered, and particular officers have exercised, acts of cruelty, oppression, violence, and theft against individual victims, for which no justification can be found in the ordinary usages of war.   It draws attention, in particular, to the loss of life and property of
merchant seamen and other non-combatants (including women and children) resulting from this inhuman and ruthless conduct. It should be part of the conditions of Peace that there should be forthwith set up a Court of Claims and Accusations, which should investigate all such allegations as may be brought before it, summon the accused persomor Government to answer the complaint, to pronounce judgment, and award compensation or damages, payable by the individual or Government condemned, to the persons who had suffered wrong, or to their dependents. The several Governments must be responsible, financially and otherwise, for the presentation of the cases of their respective nationals to such a Court of Claims and Accusations, and for the payment of the compensation awarded.APPENDIX.- Declaration unanimously agreed to at the Conference of the Socialist, and Labour Parties of Allied Nations on February 14th, 1915 :  &quot; This Conference cannot ignore the profound general causes of the European conflict, itself a monstrous product of the antagonisms which tear.asunder capitalist society and of the policy of Colonial dependencies and aggressive Imperialism, against which International Socialism has never ceased to fight, and&apos;in which every Government has its share of responsibility.&quot; The invasion of Belgium and France by the German armies threatens the very existence of independent nationalities, and strikes a blow at all faith in treaties. In these circumstances a victory for German Imperialism would be the defeat and the destruction of democracy and liberty in Europe. The Socialists of Great Britain, Belgium, France, and Bussia do not pursue the political and economic crushing of Germany ; they are not at war with the peoples of Germany and Austria, but only with the Governments of those countries by which they are oppressed. They demand that Belgium shall be liberated and com-pensated. They desire that the question of Poland shall be settled in accordance with the wishes of the Polish people, either in the sense of autonomy in.the midst of another State, or in that of complete inde-pendence. They wish that throughout all Europe, from Alsace-Lorraine to the Balkans, those populations that have been annexed by force shall receive the right freely to dispose of themselves.&quot; While inflexibly resolved to fight until victory is achieved to accomplish this task of liberation, the Socialists are none the less resolved to resist any attempt to transform this defensive war into a war of conquest, which would only prepare fresh conflicts, create new grievances, and subject various peoples more than ever to the double plague of armaments and war.Satisfied that they are remaining true to the principles of the International, the members of the Conference express the hope that the working classes of all the different countries will before long find them-selves united again in their struggle against militarism and capitalist Imperialism. &apos; The victory of the Allied Powers must be a victory for popular liberty, for unity, independence, and autonomy of the nations in the peaceful Federation of the United States of Europe and the world.&quot;Co-operative Printing Society Limi&apos;eel, Tudor Street, New Bridge Street-, London, E.C. 4..-50873.
