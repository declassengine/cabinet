cument is the Property of His-Britannic Majesty s Go^rmnen^Printed for the War Cabinet.  January 1918. 289CONFIDENTIAL.&quot; &apos; EXPENDITURE ON FOOD SINGE 1914.Memorandum by the Food Conteoller.MUCH misapprehension has arisen in respect of the increase in the cost of living, of an average working-class, family since the beginning of the war,I therefore think it desirable to submit to the War Cabinet the exact position. In an appendix a fuller account is given of the statistics on which this memorandum is based.The estimate of the Labour Statistics Department stating the average rise in the prices of articles consumed by the ordinary working-class family since July 1914 at 105 per cent, has, for various minor reasons, to be corrected to loO per cent. ; but even the latter estimate is entirely misleading, for it assumes that people are consuming the same foods in the same quantities at the present time as in July 1914. This is far from being the case. Several of the commodities then in use cannot now be obtained in the required amounts and substitutes are being used in their place. A comparison between the prices of food at different dates, without reference to changes in diet, is artificial and of little Or no Value for estimating the increased cost of living. The proper comparison is between the cost of the articles now actually consumed and the cost of the articles consumed in July 1914.This comparison shows a rise in price from 1st July, 1914, to 1st December, 1917, of 52 per cent.&apos; Since 1st July, 1917, prices have already declined nearly 10 per cent., and further decreases may be looked for in the near future.In answer to a possible objection that at the present time the dietary of the average working-class family is not as ample as that which was enjoyed in 1914, it may be pointed out that not only is there no evidence that the health of the people has suffered, but, on the contrary, vital statistics go to prove that the health of the country since the spring has been exceptional, and the Registrar-General&apos;s returns for the quarter ended September last show a lower death-rate than ever previously recorded in England and Wales.In the &quot; Labour Gazette &quot; of December last, issued by the Ministry of Labour, in the articles dealing with the rise in retail prices and cost of living from the beginning of the war up to the 1st December, it is pointed out that &quot;if eggs were omitted froni-the dietary, margarine substituted for butter, and the consumption, of sugar and fish reduced to one-half of that prevailing before the war, the general percentage increase since July 1914, instead of being 105, would be 59.&quot;It is very unfortunate that iri considering the effect of the increase in the cost of living during the war the estimated rise has been so widely assumed to be about 100 per cent. The result has been to encourage demands for higher wages than were justified, and in consequence a heavy burden has been thrown, unnecessarily, as I think, on the community.RHONDDA.Ministry of.

.  .   , APPENDIX.iiiSE in the: Cost of. Living singe July 1914.IN this appendix an account is given of the methods employed and available for calculating changes in the cost of living from July 1914 : 1. A careful distinction must be drawn between rises in price, rises in the cost of living, and rises in the expenditure on foods. Thus the calculation^ which has been most frequently employed, and shows an increase of 105 per cent, since July 1914, is really a calculation as to the increase in the price of certain foods which in July 1914 constituted the main dietary of the average family.2. In consequence, if owing to particular circumstances the dietary has undergone alteration, this method is liable to be misleading. As to the method itself, when rises in price, so far from being uniform are irregular and affect different commodities disproportionately, certain technical causes of error exist. These are comparatively unimportant except in one instance. The month on which the estimate is based, July 1914, is a summer month, and in the summer certain articles, such as eggs, enter into consumption in much larger quantities than is possible in the winter, and this invalidates the comparison with the winter months, as, for. instance, December 1917. Owing to this, as well as to other minor matters, the estimate of 105 per cent, is corrected to 100 per cent.But a similar error occurs when, owing to actual scarcity, changes occur in the availability of certain articles for consumption. In such cases the dietary necessarily changes, and a computation which assumes the continued existence of such articles in consumption in their normal quantities is unavoidably inaccurate. In other words, methods of computation of this kind whilst satisfactory for periods when changes are slight, uniform and gradual, are unsatisfactory when changes are great, irregular and abrupt.3. The employment of computations as to increases of cost in order to estimate what may be termed compensatory alterations in wages is a subject which cannot be dealt with satisfactorily in a few sentences. Two matters, however, must be noticed. The effect of such alterations in wages depends greatly on the cause underlying the increase in prices. If prices rise owing to a general cause such as inflation in money or credit, or in both taken together, a corresponding rise in wages is to be viewed as a normal part of the movement, which would take place automatically just as rises in price take place, were it not that wages are more fixed in character. On the other hand, where the rise in prices is mainly due to the actual scarcity of particular commodities the commodities are not present in the ordinary, required amounts, and the increase in wages intensifies the scramble for such limited supplies as exist.A further distinction has to be drawn between the effect of prices on supply in normal times and that in such times as the present. In normal times a rise in particular prices tends to increase the supply of the commodities thus affected. But in the present abnormal circumstances the supply is more rigidly limited and this result does not take place to the same extent.4. The data available for measuring the increase of retail food prices and the increase of expenditure on food are : (a.) Typical budgets of expenditure collected by the Labour Department before the -war.(b.) Average retail prices collected  monthly by the Department of Labour Statistics.(c.) Computations by the Ministry of Food of the general changes in consumption during the war.As the supplies of various foods have diminished their prices have risen, and there has been both substitution, upon a considerable scale, of foods which are more plentiful, for those which are scarcer, and some diminution in consumption. Thus margarine has been used instead of butter, less sugar has been consumed, British meat has been substituted for foreign meat, and eggs have nearly dropped out of the budget.5. The following table shows the quantities of the principal foods usually bought by a working class family.   It accounts for about 75 per cent, of the whole exoenditure
on food, the omitted expenditure including vegetables, fruit, jam, meat not sold by weight, and other articles whose price is not determinable.Estimated Weekly Consumption of the Principal Foods by an average Urban Working-class Family in the United Kingdom.Commodity.

On the other hand, if the quantities and kinds of food usually consumed in December 1917 had been bought in July 1914, the increase in the expenditure between July 1914 and December 1917 would have been 88 per cent.7. But, actually, we ought to take account of the change both in the articles constituting the standard of living and in the standard of living itself.The aggregate cost of the quantities shown in the table above for July 1914 was 17s. 7d. at that date. This may be taken as the average expenditure on this group of foods immediately before the war. The aggregate cost of the quantities shown in the table for December 1917, as typical of present consumption, is 26s. 9d. The expenditure on this group of foods has therefore increased from 17s. Id. to 26s. 9d. that is, 52 per cent.   In brief, expenditure on food has increased about 52 per cent.An estimate of the Labour Statistics Department made on a different basis places the increase at 59 per cent.Popular impression of the rise of prices has been unduly influenced by considerable rises in the price of particular articles which have been exceptionally scarce,-some of which have now practically disappeared from ordinary consumption.
