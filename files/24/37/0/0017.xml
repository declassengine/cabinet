o, 545/25.aSUldiiAHY   OF   INFORMATION FOR MOUTH OF NOVJMBJR.3ritish Front.On the night of the 9/10th November, by agreement with General Sarrail, my left &quot;brigade sector on the east bank of the River Vardar was taken over by the French in so far as infantry was concerned, and by the 28th instant the artillery had also been relieved.     The relief was carried out without incident, and the French arc now responsible for the protection of both banks of the River Vardar, my western boundary being the Selimli Sore.     This arrangement has enabled me to main-tain two battalions in Army Reserve..In addition to patrol actions, raids on the ftoiran front have beon undertaken with satisfactory results.     One was carried out on the night of the 4th November, after heavy preliminary bombardment, on Boyau Hill N.B. of Macukovo by a strong detachment of the 12th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. They were held up early in the proceedings by a strong enemy outpest line some 500 yards in front of the objective.     This, however, was overcome and the outposts were driven back into their trenches where thoy were caught in our artillery barrage. Following closely the party attacked the hostile front line trenches, finding them strongly occupied.     Severe fighting ensued in the trenches in which our troops remained for 25 minutes causing heavy Casualties to the enemy, and destroying three machine-guns before they withdrew.     Our casualties were 40 wounded, no killed or missing.On the morning of the 17th instant a wood south-west of Akindzali was raided by a party of the 7th y/iltshire Regiment, eight prisoners being taken, and thirteen enemy dead counted.Both these raids were well-planned and oarried out with praiseworthy dash,During the latter part of the month hostile artillery on this front has shown considerable increased activity and has inadG frequent use of gas shell.   Unusually determined efforts to obtain a footing in our trenches have been made, notably on the night df the 22/23rd November when, after an intense bombardment lasting for 15 minutes, a party of about 100 enemy attacked one of our small posts on Glengarry Hill S..E, of Dautll which they succeeded in entering.     They were, however, at once ejected by a local counter attack-Again on the night of the 23/24th instant they attacked two points known as P. 4-g- and the Mane Ion, N, and N.Y,r. of Do Id z cm On this occasion they reached our main protective wire but were unable to advance further and were driven off through our barrage leaving two prisoners and many dead on our wire.In the Struma valley patrol actions in which our. troops have maintained their superiority over those of the enemy have taken place almost daily.     On this front also and at Neohori enemy artillery has latterly been more active than usual.Aviation
Many successful local bombing raids have been carried out by our aeroplanes during the month and over 15 tons of H.B, have been dropped on various hostile dumps and encampments.     Drama Station was attacked during the night 24th instant, :direct hits being &quot;obtained on a train.     Air combats have also been frequent;    on two separate occasions a hostile aeroplane attacked and brought down one of our balloons near Orljak.     A third attempt by the same pilot met -with disaster, the hostile machine being brought down and the pilot killed.     He has been identified as Otoer-iiieutonant Von Eschwege, a noted airman.     Our aerodromes at iiahana and at Janes have each been raided once but no material damage has been caused.Other Forces,No operations of any importance have been undertaken by other allied forces.,      The enemy has been generally more active than usual, and a very noticeable increase in movement of troops, trains and transport of all descriptions is reported from all fronts.Administration,The rest camp at Itea referred to in the summary for the month of Ootober has now been opened.Arrangements were made to convey by the Itea - Bralo route small consignments of urgent stores for the Royal Flying Corps, but fell through owing to the closing of the Cherbourg - Taranto route.     For the same reason it has also been impossible to send leave parties.Health of Troops.The admission of all ranks to hospitals and Casualty Clearing Stations for siokness were 72.5 per 1,000 of strength against 68.8 in November 1916, and the deaths 0.12 against 0*4 per 1,000.The total (sick only) remaining in hospitals and Casualty Clearing Stations (exclusive of thoso in convales-cent camps) on 1st December 1917 was 30-8 per 1,001- of strength, against 45.1 per 1,000 on 1st December 1916;   but only 343 have been evacuated during November 1917, as against 3,989 in November 1916.Tlie disposal of the total sick (numbers remaining on 1st November and numbers admitted during the month) treated in hospitals and Casualty Clearing Stations,&apos; is compared with the results in 1916 in the following table:-Disposal,	1917.	1916.Recovered.

The number of admissions for malaria was 40.6 per 1,000 of strength, being a marked decrease on the admission rate (89.2 per 1,000). for the previous month (October 1917), but showing an equally marked excess over the rate (19.2 per 1,000) for the corresponding month (November 1916) last yearPer dysentry and diarrhoea the admission rate per 1,000 was 11-3 as compared with 7.7 in November 1916; and for enterica OolO against lc2c(Sd.)
