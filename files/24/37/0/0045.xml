EGRETCopy No.   I0.1/141/40429.12.-17.The Present Military Situation, with reference to the Peace Proposals by the Ce:Powers.,entral1.-    The peace proposals just put forward by the Central Powers disclose no new feature of importance and their appearance should be in no way a surprise to us, and although they cannot be peremptorily ignored we ought not to imagine that they foreshadow the defeat of the enemy and the acquisition of the aims for which we are really*   fighting - that is, to make future wars of the nature and on the scale of the present one impossible for a long time to come.      It is only to be expected that the enemy should take advantage of the Russian situation (a) to increase pacifist activity in the Entente countries and,so weaken their fighting power; (b) to induce their own people to continue fighting, on the plea of self-defence, if peace cannot be obtained on their own terms; (c) to obtain such a peace as early as possible because of the growing danger to the military caste and autocratic system of government in Germany, and because&quot;Austria, Bulgaria, and Turkey, though unable to make a separate peace, are thoroughly tired of the war and sre disinclined to take any further part in .4it beyond what they are compelled to take by their German masters.2.     As regards (a), the Central Powers have always possessed an enormous advantage in that they have unity of control in diplomatic matters, whereas not only is there no such unity in the Entente buttheir
their so-called war-aims may he classified as either selfish or conflicting, and therefore they have usually &quot;been stated in rather vague terms from the standpoint of the man in the street.     It is for consideration, as I have several, times ventured to suggest In the past, whether the Entente should not publicly make known &quot;what they do not want, even if they have a difficulty in saying what they do want.As regards (c), there is no doubt that Germany, like all tho other belligerents, desires an early peace, her economic conditions are certainly worse than those In England, France, and Italy, and we may reasonably assume that she would accept terms more favourable to us than those just announced.     On the other hand there is as yet no sign that the German people are prepared to renounce the policy which brought on the present war, or that they realise that the doctrine of the &quot;mailed fist&quot; is contrary to all prin-ciples of morality,.      Until they do renounce this policy it would be folly to suppose that we can obtain trustworthy guarantees of future peace.     The German definition of the Russian proposals for peace, on the basis of no annexations and no indemnities, is &quot;not to appropriate forcibly terri-tories conquered during the war&quot;.     This clearly does not debar the Central Powers from exorcising peaceful persuasion upon the peoples of such territories as they may dosire to annex virtually, and they would be free to induce Courland, Lithuania, and Poland to join Germany or Austria, and Macedonia and part of the Dobrudja to join Bulgaria.     17 e should be compelled to return the Colonies to Germany and to restore Mesopotamia and Palestine to Turkey, who would, in effect, be a vassal of Germany. The warwould
would then end with Germany free to exploit her Eastern policy, to establish submarine bases in her colonies, which would threaten our communications within the Empire, and she would become mistress of the Balkans.      Peace would then find Germany in a stronger position than ever, while the burden of the defence of the British Empire would become almost intolerable. It is therefore apparent that what Germany is now seeking is not a lasting peace, but a triice which, while it disperses the Entente forces to the four quarters of the globe, will enable her to organise her forces for a fresh attack, calculated to give her that world dominion which she has failed to obtain in the present war.     I would note here that the effect of the submarine on our communications between the different parts of the Empire seems to be a most important factor in connection with the German colonies,and to merit thorough investigation and report.3.     I think the Var Cabinet agree that there is no prospect of ever acquiring all those vast enemy territories which the different members of the Entente have been promised or wish to acquire, and therefore,  leaving aside these ambitious territor-ial gains, the question tlb can we get what we must get if we are to secure the future peace of the vrorld ?     In other words can we outlast Germany ? , Will Austria or Turkey drop out before France or Italy ?    Will the Central Powers be able to raise the blockade by tapping the resources of Southern Russia ?   Will America be able to make her military power sufficiently felt   ? Can we resist whatever attack the enemy may be able to direct against us while America is preparing ?4,     To none of these questions can a precise answer be given,    For instance, we are unaware of what quantities of supplies are still available in Russia, whether the Russians would relinquish them in view of the great food short are which exists in the Northern Provinces.,    and whether   transportation   could   be organised   in time   toensure
ensure relief being brought to Germany during the critical spring months.   We do know,- however, that in Petrograd and in other places fairly accessible to Germany there are large quantities of guns, munitions, military stores&apos;, and raw materials such as rubber and copper, of which Germany stands in need, and that she may be able to replenish her munition factories therefrom.   The position in the great grain producing districts of the Ukraino and Southern Russia is so obscure that it is not possible to say what can be obtained there, but if peace is concluded between the Caucasus Government and the Central Powers vast quantities of oil may be transferred across the Black Sea from Batoum to the Danube and so relieve the want of petroleum products in the Central Empires.Further, the question of the Entente outlasting Germany to such an extent as to be able to dictate terms of peace to her is obviously affected by many political, social, and economic conditions of the different Entente countries with which I am imperfectly acquainted, and regarding which, indeed, no one can give an accurate fore-cast.     Of no less importance) are the naval and shipping situations, as to which alsa I can express no opinion,   It is therefore quito impossible for me to give a definite and comprehensive reply to the question, and I accordingly wish it to be understood that what is said below is not intended to be a complete answer, but to be considered in conjunction with the other numerous considerations of a non-military character.5.     The War Cabinet have had so recently before them particulars as to the Allied and enemy strengths on thevarious
various fronts that I do not propose to discuss them in detail here.   Broadly speaking it may he assumed that the enemy has, since the beginning of October, brought over to the Western front, either in the form of complete divisions or of drafts combed out from the Eastern front, as many men as he could transport in the time.    It Is improbable that during the winter months he will be able to increase greatly this rate of movement.   His water-ways will be to a great extent frozen, the demand for coal and other commodities required to keep his industrial and civil life going will be increased, while the condition of his railways and rolling stock is known to be deteriorating.    It seems quite evident that the Russian Armies as a whole will not fight again in this war, and that the majority of the Russian soldiers are determined not to do so, but while the situation in Roumania and Southern Russia remains uncertain, it is unlikely that many Austrian troops will be released from that portion of the front, but we may expect generally that, early in the Spring,, although the Entente forces on the Franco-British and Italian fronts may.have some slight numerical superiority, the enemy may be considerably superior in heavy artillery while his forces will be much more homogeneousa    I have already reminded the War Cabinet that ^numbers by themselves are very illusory.   Napoleon maintained that the moral is to the physical as three is to one^ and this is more than ever true now in the fourth year of this tremendous war.   There is more than one weak spot in the morale on the Entente front between the Channel and the Adriatic06*     It is so clearly to the enemy&apos;s interest towin
win a decisive success before America can intervene in force that it is only prudent to assume that he will make the attempt.    Prom what has been said above as to relative strengths in the Spring, he may fairly consider that having foiled us when v/e were numerically very superior, he will have sufficient force to make the attempt worth undertaking, for he may argue that, with the uncertain political situation in Italy, war-weariness in France, and difficulties as to man-power in England, any considerable, success next year may enable him -to obtain the peace he wants though his present offer may be rejected.      If ne does not make the attempt so much the better for us c        YJe shall have gained the time for America to enter the field at no cost to ourselves.7.     The Entente Powers have, for the time being, to act on the iefensive and to accept the disadvantages which the defensive brings -with it.&quot;      These are always very great, one reason for this being that tt is never known for certain where or when the next attack will be made, and this leads to a general nervousness not only amongst the troops but - which is much more important -amongst the Higher Commands and the Governments.     There is onl3r one possible way of ensuring an effective -defence, and that is to have the necessary plans carefully worked out beforehand, and ruthlessly determine not to depart from them unduly early.As to the time when the enemy may attack, it must be assumed that he is reasonably -re11 informed of Americars preparation?, and will know that she may be expected to begin to make her weight felt in the fieldin .
in the Autumn of next year.       Under modern battle conditions it takes a long time to obtain even a partial decision, and therefore it is in the enemy&apos;s interests to begin as early as he can,     It is not probable that he will be able to begin in the immediate future, that is within tho next two or throe weeks, for.he has had to fight very hard throughout this year on the Western front and.has lost heavily In men and materials His troops require a rest, hits drafts require training, and he has to assemble his forces, to replace his guns and accumulate supplies of ammunit-1 on *        As far as those various factors are concerned, we may expect him to be ready from about the middle of February onwards, and as March and April will be the months during which the shortage of food and fuel in Germany &quot;will be most acute, it seems probable that, having regard to the necessity for sustaining the morale of his people j, he will not defer his attack till after February,Sa        As regards the place of attack, we must give the enemy credit for acting on common-sense military prin-oiples,     He may therefore be expected to begin by attacking other points than that on which he means to make his main blow, so as to use up our strength and draw our reserves in wrong directionsj    we must accordingly be prepared to meet an attack on more than one part of the fronts,,        His throe main objectives are the Channel Coast, Paris, and Northern Italy, and he has on the Macedonian front a subsidiary objective with which he may make play. Wherever he may elect tostrike his main blow we must assume that he will pavethe
the way for that blow by threats elsewhere.     Italy is the most tempting bait as, quite apart from her military weakness at the present tine, she has been throughout the war, and still is, in a false strategical position. - Her armies are deployed in a great salient and a successful attack delivered from the mountains against the flank of this salient nay bring disaster.     Having failed to anticipate the Italian oollapse the enemy was unable to follow it up, but for the past month he has probably been endeavouring to exhaust the Italian armies as much as possible so as to prepare for a greater blow next year when his preparations, particularly as regards transportation, have been completed!.     On the other hand, unless the climatic conditions next year are very abnormal, it is unlikely that a great attack will be made from, the mountains before the end of April or the beginning of May, and if it is not, the Italians, with the British and French support they now have, ought meanwhile to be expected, if they will fight, to hold their own.9.   If, as suggested above, the enemy so acts, by feints and spreading false information, as to induce us to disperse our reserves, so that they cannot be used against his main effort, the Salonika front will offer many attractions.     The climate there about the end of February or early in March should be favourable for operations on a large scale, and he will know that any troops we send there could not be made available on the main fronts for many months.     On the other hand, Bulgaria is weary of the war and nay take a great deal of persuading to attack, while the enemy will realise that we can reckon on somere i nfo r cene nt s
reinforcement from the Greek army and. would not in any . event rsquire or be able to send large forces to Macedonia. Still, an attack on this front is an eventuality for which wo must be prepared.10.     As regards tho Franco-British front, ths state of the ground and tho climatic conditions are not favourable for attack early in the year on the northern part of the British portion of ths line, but south of Arras conditions become more favourablo and it will be remembered that in February of 1916 tho enemy was very successful at Verdun, The general conclusion Is that wo must be prepared for a great battle, or rather series of battles, early in the coming year which we shall have to fight defensively; that, boing on the defensive, wo shall have difficulty in docidlng where the enemy(s main attack will fall;    that we must be? pro-pared for losses of ground, prisoners and guns; that wo must have the largest possible number of reserves ready to movo at the shortest notice in any required direction; and that until we can dofino tho enemy&apos;s intentions we must resist urgent appeals for help which are certain to bo made and avoid frittering away our reserves to meet what may prove to bo subsidiary attacks.     In fact we shall require to bo always on the alert, to&quot; keep cool heads, and to act quickly when we do act,11,     If we do this there is no reason why we should not defeat any effort the enemy may make.       The Allied Governments can, however, take certain steps which will greatly facilitate our task If events develop on the lines which have been indicated above.   It is necessary that thoyshould
should come to an early agreement as to their policy in the event of a heavy attack on the Salonika front.   This question is no-&apos; in the hands of tho Military Advisers to the Supreme War Council, and as soon as General Guillaumat has had time to examine and report on the situation the Allied Governments should decide on a definite policy in the event of a withdrawal on that front becoming necessary.     Similarly it is necessary that the French and British Governments should be ready to decide quickly upon the amount of assist-ance which they can&apos; afford to give Italy, and should be prepared to cut their losses In the event of that amount of assistance proving inadequate0     As already stated, it is quite possible that the enemy1s plan may be to draw more Franco-British troops to Italy as a preparation for a main blow on the Franco-British front, or it may turn out that the contrary is the case and that attacks on the Franco-British front may be made to prevent reserves going to Italy, and that the enemy will make a supreme effort to get Italy out of the war.      In order that military plans may be made for either eventuality, it is important that the Military authorities should know in time what the policy of the Governments is to be in either case.    It is not expected that the French and British Gov-ernments can state their policy now, but it must be remem-bered that a general and indefinite decision to support Italy to the utmost of our power may lead to disaster on the Franco-British front., and it will be well to have the question examined as thoroughly as possible beforehand, so that appeals from Italy which are certain to come if she is attacked, may be answered quickly but after full considerationB In this connection it isvery
very urgent that the question of transportation between the Italian and the Franco-British front should be settled with the least possible delay.   Communications are the basis of sound defence and in this respect the enemy has the advantage of us.   Every possible effort must be made to reduce that advantage to a minimum.    The Franco-British front has not been seriously tested since the battle of Verdun and we must expect that the enemy1s next attack will be on a greater scale,    Our efforts to meet it must be correspondingly greata12,     If we defeat the enemy&apos;s offensive, as we may reasonably hope to do if we make suitable and adequate preparations and do not send our reserves off in y/rong directions; how much nearer then should we be to getting a favourable peace ?   This depends not only upon ourselves but also upon the extent to which the other members of the Entente keep in the field, and upon when America can enter In force.     In this connexion we ought to put more pressure on America, who is still concerned rather with talking than with doing.    All the best Americans I meet say this is so, that the country is really not yet In the war, and that much more can be done, and ought to be done, in regard to shipping, standardisation of equipment, and the despatch of men. There is, I am told, as yet no efficient ?/ar organisation machinery, and no sufficient-appreciation of the vital importance&apos; of time.    The moral and physical effect of the intervention of an entirely fresh and enthusiastic army at a late stage of the struggle cannot fail to be of the greatest possible value, and we need to do everything we can to expedite and assist in the preparation and despatch of this army.
13. :    If we do this, and If we determine to endure and if our allies do likewise until America Is ready we may hope to get eventually a favourable peace.   As regards ourselves, it is of the essence of a national war that difficulties should arise in every sphere of national activity, and that sacrifices should be required of every member of the com-munity in the common interests.     No doubt considerable sacrifices have already been made, but I venture to think that up to the present the people of this country have not been called upon for such sacrifices as they are capable of bearing and are willing to make, once they realise that what they are fighting for is not mere territorial aggrandisement but their very lives and Imperial existence,    It is nothing-less than this, for any peace which leaves the military domination of Prussia successful and intact will entail upon us in the future such a strain as would almost certainly render our position intolerable, and to conclude peace before we have made our greatest possible effort would be to estrange our oversea Dominions, to betray our own interests, and to dishonour the memory of those who have laid down their lives for the Empire.     While It would unquestionably be a crime to prolong the war for one day longer than is necessary, or for the purpose of attempting to achieve ends which as a matter of hard fact we cannot hope to achieve, it would be a greater and a cowardly crime to flinch from the effort which we may hope would give us a just and lasting peace if it is within our power to make such effort.     It is of course, for the War Cab-inet and. not for me to decide whether this further effort is within our power or not, but I suggest that it is.   The two mainessentials
essentials to enable us to endure are shipping and men, and to provide both in adequate quantities will call for much greater sacrifices than any we have yet made. Without adequate ships and without adequate men - that is, all the men who can possibly be made available - to fight on land I do not think that we can hope&apos; to obtain a favourable peace.   Therefore, if these ships and men cannot be produced, I can only advise the War Cabinet that, militarily, there seems to be no alternative but to accept peace on&apos;Germany&apos;s terms, and these I fear would, sooner pr later, be disastrous to the British Empire.14.   The above has been written rather hurriedly as I understand the War Cabinet wish to have it at onces I hope, however^ that the main points in the very difficult problem presented have been sufficiently dealt with, and I may say that although the opinions expressed may seem somewhat crude, and not fully supported by evidence, thoy are in themselves the result of many discussions and examinations on the part of the General Staff during the last few monthsc    I would again invite attention to the last sub-para, of paragraph 4a(Signed)   W0R, ROBERTSONaC , I o G a S c&apos;War Officeo 29/12/17 o
