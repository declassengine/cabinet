WEEKLY   REPORT   ON   GREECE. XV.Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.DGW/015.(28 December, 1917).Since the last Report was published (November 26), the centre of interest for Greek affairs has been London and Paris, at which two capitals Mr Venizelos has spent the last six weeks.   The enthusiastic reception accorded to him by the British Government and nation has, as might have been expected, delighted his country-men at home, who are very sensible to such attentions.   The Greek press is full of articles expressing its gratitude to, and affection for, this country.    The Greek people is, however, still not quite satisfied as to the practical effects of Mr Venizelos! mission and the economic and political advantages which will accrue to Greece as a result.   The latter, the political side of Greece1s demands, is shown in the wish for some assurance that Greece, by taking part in the war, will be able to serve the cause dear to the heart of every Greek patriot, the liberation and the union of the whole Greek race.   The Athine, for instance, criticises Mr Balfour* for not alluding to the rights of Greece, together with those of Serbia and Rumania, in his recent speech.   It is, perhaps, too much to expect that Venizelists as a whole will be able to Share without misgivings the firm faith that has always been expressed by their leader that Greece requires no formal guarantee from tneEntente powers of a recognition of her Justifiable national war aims.   The recent-publication by the Russian Maximalists of theTreaty concluded with Italy in April 1915, with its clause assigning the Dodekanese to Italy,-may servo as a handle to anti-Entente propagandists in Greete and strengthen these
misgivings as to the Entente&apos;s favourable attitude towards Greek aspirations.     Even so whole-hearted a Venizelist and pro-Entente paper as Mea Ellas has not abated one jot of its determination to secure from the Entente the recognition of these demands, which include not only the Dodekanese, hut also the Greek parts of Thrace and Asia Minor and Cyprus, as well as Greek co-operation in any international settlement of the question of Constantinople. It is only to he expected that in circles openly or secretly hostile to Venizelos and to the Entente the lack of any recognition on the part of the Entente Powers of Greece!s aspirations should be seized on with avidity In order to increase the hesitation among the Greek people to intervene in a war from which, it is argued, they can draw no advantage to themselves, but serve only the interests of others.The Economic Situation.A more serious obstacle to the successful mobilisation of Greece as a whole and her effective intervention in the war is the unsatisfactory economic condition in which the country continues. It is recognised that it is this problem to which Mr Venizelos must have chiefly drawn the attention of the Entente Governments during his visit to France and England,   It is, therefore, with especial satisfaction that the Greek press and nation has hailed such offers of financial and economic support as the Entente,Powers have been able to give.   Economic reconstruction after the state of disorganisation and bankruptcy, to which the anti-Venizelist Governments have reduced Greece (some account of which was given in Report XIII), Is an indiS^-H sable preliminary to any effective mobilisation of the country.     Consequently, it is announced that about  4,000,000 of the loan the Entente is granting Greece is to he devoted to economic reconstruction.    Mr Venizelos promptly cabled to
Greece the news that his v;ishes with regard to the supply of food and material to Greece by the Allies were accepted by them, and, consequently, considerable amelioration of the economic crisis is expected.    The Entente Powers have also promised not to requisition any more Greek ships.    Further, Mr Venizelos has nov-secured a satisfactory price for the currant crop purchased by this country.    All this reassuring news must, of course, be followed by further prompt measures if an end is to be put to the wide-spread discontent in Greece at the shortage of food, for it had been-somewhat unreasonably hoped that the accession of Mr Venizelos to power would At once restore to the country the economic prosperity it had enjoyed under his previous Governments.     The Greek Ministry of Food appears to be doing its best to cope with the difficult problem of increasing, regulating and distributing supplies.   The bread ration, which had been increased to 100 drams (about 11 oz.) a day per person, has now been extended to 150 drams - for workmen.     Shortage of flour and the inability to export the whole currant crop (the British Government has, however, now promised a price of 49/- instead of 45/- per ton for 10,000 tons) have led the authorities to the step of mixing currants tith the bread to the extent of 15$, thereby improving Its taste and&apos; nutritive value.   The Government continues to do what it can to transport meat, cheese, figs, olive oil and other essential food stuffs from the remoter provinces to Athens, where they are urgently required.   Maximum prices have now been fixed for almost all articles of food (the sale of which is taken over as Government monopolies), and energetic measures have been taken against profiteering in food stuffs by the erection of a special Court to deal with such abuses.The settlement of these questions is urgently necessary both
in the interests of internal order and in the interests of Greecefs relations With the Entente,   The Greek nation cannot exist merely on enthusiasm for its historic friends and recent liberators or on traditional hostility to Bulgaria.   The problem of inducing an army, demoralised.for two years by pacifist propaganda, to make up its mind to enter on an arduous struggle, in which Its Balkan Allies have already suffered so grievously, is enormously complicated when to this natural disinclination is added the absence of any assurance that Greece will thereby attain any tangible territorial or economic advantages, and by the further postponement of any permanent solution of her economic difficulties.   Further, it is anticipated in Greece that another offensive of the Central Powers in Macedonia is Imminent.   Should this eventuate the Greek people as a whole would be forced to make up their mind quickly as to the course they must pursue.   Unless the food question is settled, the Greek army cannot be mobilised, and unless the army is mobilised and properly fed and equipped; it is idle to hope that the Greek nation would be prepared to enter on the struggle they have always dreaded against the forees of the Central Powers.      Only (1) the assurance of regular food supplies from the Allies,   (2) some definite, if not detailed, guarantee that Greek national aspirations will not be ignored, and   (5) adequate military support on the part of the Allies to the liacedonian front would suffice to strengthen the hands of the pro-war party in Greece and to bring fver to them the bulk of the population which still hesitates to adopt their policy firmly.   And yet on the settlement of this question the whole position of Mr Venizelos depends.    If the Entente fails to satisfy the needs of Greece now, it will fail to secure Greek support later, and its failure will mean the failure of Mr Venizelos*   Royalist feeling, which is still latent in many parts of the country, would seize on the opportunity to discredit once for all its chief
opponent and the policy he proposed.   There can he little doubt that for the majority of the Greek nation such a course would be the worse alternative of the two.   They would much prefer a victory of the Entente in which they themselves could take an important and an enthusiastic part, which would secure for them the safety and free development of the unredeemed Greece ef Thrace and Asia and would save Greek commerce in the Levant from the dangerous menace of Germany1s Eastern policy.The conciliatory tone of the Venizelist press towards Italy is evidence that Greece recognises the necessity of Italo-Greek co-operation too strongly to allow this to be deterred from it even by Italian policy in Epirus and the Dodekanese.   Further, Greece, Serbia and Rumania are now working in closer co-operation&apos;than at any time since 1913,   Sir Edward Carson&apos;s words at the inaugural meeting of the Anglo-Rumanian Society on December 7 last were received enthusiastically by the Greek press as an endorsement of a policy which they strongly favour.    Coupled with co-operation with Italy, this new Balkan Alliance, if supported by the Western Powers and allowed to throw its whole military force, with reasonable hope of success, into the struggle, may prove the first solid foundation stone of the future Balkan Federation.Greece and Turkey.The Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs has now issued a collection of official reports of their diplomatic and consular agents touching the persecutions of Greeks in. the Turkish Empire since the outbreak of the European war.    The book, in the main, confirms the various reports which have been published as to the extent and severity of these repressive measures.     In its character the whole persecution bears close resemblance to that of the Armenians.   Both internal and external evidence shows that the
prime instigators snd organisers of these outrages were the German authorities, who were anxious for the systematic elimination of the Greek elements in Asia Minor. . In any oase there is now a deep-seated feeling among Greeks that any return of the Greek populations to Turkish misrule would be a lamentable event.    Some account was given in Report XIII of the establishment of a &quot;Council of the Greeks of the Black Sea&quot; in Paris to take steps to set up an autonomous Government of the Greeks of the Black Sea coast, should Russia disinterest herself in their fate and consequently allow the possibility of their return to Turkish misrule.    The Bleftheros Tipos of October 29/November 11 published a map showing the extent of territory claimed by the &quot;Greek Republic of the Euxine&quot;, as it calls it - a claim which it hopes to lay before the Allied Governments.     The territory stretches from just west of Batum to a point west of 1stifan, that is to say, It includes the whole vilayet of Trebizond and the north-east corner of that of Jt&amp;stamuni (the Sanjak of Sinob). The claim seems an exaggerated one on the basis of population, but those who support it are probably adopting the eastern method of demanding a great deal in the hope of attaining something. There is no inf orr at ion to hand as to whether the prograirme of these Black Sea Greeks has been widely adopted, nor as to what welcome may be extended to it from.,   fcheir neighbours, the Armenians and the Caucasian peoples.22.12.17.
