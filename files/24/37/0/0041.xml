NOTE BY THE GENERAL STAFF ON SIR E^WEYNCOURT&apos; S MEMORANDUM^PROPOSING THE FORMATION OF TANK ARMIES.The value of tanks was demonstrated in the recentfighting near Cambrai, both in the offensive action of the 5rd British Army and also in local counter-offensives when the enemy subsequently attacked the 3rd Army on 30th November/lst December, but the limitation of the success achieved was due to many causes other than those stated, and one was the absence of a lighter and more mobile type of tank.   The necessity for this lighter type for purposes of exploitation of initial success has long been foreseen but hitherto has not materialized, though arrangements which should result in placing a number of lighter machines in the field by 1st June 1918 are now well advanced,,2, Sir Eustace dfEyncourt&apos;s proposals do not differ inprinciple from the scheme on which the 3rd Army offensive against Cambrai was prepared and carried out, but the role of tanks on the defensive, which he does not discuss, also merits consideration.He suggests that one tank with its crew of 8 or 9 men is probably equal to 400 infantry in attack, and that 500 tanks may therefore be regarded as the equivalent of about 200,000 men.   It would be very difficult to establish the fact that the value of a tank is equal to that of any given number of men, &quot;but regarded from the point of view of economising personnel tanks and their crews are armoured machine gun detachments, aided by their own short range shell fire, which can attack withsuccess
2.success unarmoured machine gun detachments at far less cost in casualties than can be hoped for if only unarmoured infantry and machine guns are useda3, The advent of the tank has in reality given us a newarm, and with its aid variety and, therefore, an increased element of surprise can be introduced into the major tactics of an attack,   Formerly the progress of the infantry depended almost entirely upon the efficiency of a preliminary artillery bombardment, but in addition to the heavy expenditure of ammunition entailed this bombardment has the disadvantage of so cratering the ground as to render the passage of the attacking infantry exceedingly difficult.   Attacks can now be mounted with a preliminary artillery bombardment, or with tanks and no bombardment, while the facilities for misleading the enemy by a dummy tank attack constitutes an additional tactical advantage.4.        Sir Eustace rightly visualises the tanks acting in co-operation with infantry and not alone, for obviously a break through by tanks must be followed by an adequate force of infantry and other arms to hold the ground won or exploit the success. It would not be practicable, however, permanently to organize a specialized army round the tanks any more than round the artillery. The value of tanks, as of guns, lies in the assistance they can give to the infantry to overcome the enemy&apos;s defences and thereby reach and defeat his troops.   What is required is an organization which shall be sufficiently elastic to admit of tanks being successfully employed in co-operation with other arms in both offensive and defensive warfare.   The proportion of infantry, artillery and other units to be employed in conjunction with a given number of tanks is a matter which needs to be investigated most carefully on each occasion and with due regard to many localconsiderations
considerations before any large offensive scheme is undertaken . Similarly in defensive warfare tanks must be distributed where they are most likely to be able to act effectively in counter-attacks and suitable bodies of infantry and other arms must be allocated for co-operation with the tanks in these counter-attacks *5. In the light of experience gained during,the Cambraifighting the Tank Corps in France is now being re-organized in three groups, two Heavy and one Light.    At present each Heavy group consists of 2 brigades each of 3 battalions and 28S tanks in the aggregate.    The Light group consists of 2 brigades- each of 3 battalions with an aggregate- of 410 light tanks.     It is proposed to add a third Heavy group^ and to increase both the Heavy and Light groups by the addition of a third brigade in each case when the additional tanks and personnel to man them are forthcoming, but so far as can   at present be foreseen the estimated output of tanks will not admit of the scale of two Heavy and one Light groups being completed before the beginning of August 1918.    These groups will be self-contained as regards transport and the necessary accessory units.    This organization will admit of the tank brigades being employed in either cffen-sive or defensive operations as required.    To meet the require-ments of a defensive period the groups and brigades are located where they can best be used to act counter-offehsively in the case of enemy attack, but having regard to the very specialized: character of tank units it is considered preferable to keep them normally under one centralized control for purposes of training and administrationo    At the same time their distribu-tion lends itself to co-operation in training between the tanks and the other arms.
6.        Sir Eustace d!Eyncourt1s contention that we should collaborate as much as possible with the Americans with the idea of creating a large potential force of tanks on the Western Front is to be commended.   This proposal might well be extended to the French who have a considerable tank programme.     In the present state of British man-po7/er and the depleted condition of our infantry units on the Western Front it would not pay us to exceed the establishment which has recently been approved for the Tank Corps, and in any case, with the forcasted rate of output of tanks, no addition to that standard would be practicable before the month of August 1918.   With American assistance in the production of tanks, however, it should be possible to provide a combined Tank Force which might have great possibilities in the event of offensive operations by the British, French and American forces in the late summer or autumn of 1918,General Staff, War Office.28th December, 1917,
