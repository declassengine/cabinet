Dear Sir Maurice Hankey,

In reply to your letter to Sir John Jellicoe No.24/A/7 of December 6th, 1917, enclosing a copy of the Final Report of the Dardanelles Commission, and inviting his opinion as to whether it is in the public interest that the Report should be published with or without amendments, I send you, for circulation to the War Cabinet, the attached copies of a Memorandum by the Naval Staff on this question.

The First Lord has seen the Memorandum and desires me to add that he strongly deprecates the publication of the Report.

Believe me,

Yours very truly,

(Signed). R.F.DUNNELL.


ta%LJL^From :aJaval.point of view the publication of the Final Report of the Dardanelles Commission would certainly afford valuable information to thea forcei and. shew them what to avoid in any attemptedwould be advisable to postpone publication until the War is ended.-    If, however, it is decided to publish the Report at an earlier date, attention is drawn to the following points with a view to the excision from the Report before publication of all reference to them.The points are set out in the order in which they arise upon the Report and not in any sense in order of importance0 1.   Greek General Staff Plan  (Page 10.)It is suggested that the sentence referring to the plan worked out by the Greek General Staff should be omitted, as- Greece was a neutral at that date (March 1915).2.   fabers of Forts   (Pages 15 and U*)It is suggested that the numbers of forts should be omitted from the text,3*   Admiral Limpus   (PageIt is -suggested that Admiral Limpus1 nameshould be omitted.     Some time ago articles appearedv- 1 -enemy, particularly as.to the diIf faculties in landinglanding on our Coast;and it is suggested that it
in the German Press to the effect that the main purpose of the British Naval Mission in Turkey ?/as to disorganise the Turkish Fleet.    If Admiral Limpus1 name was published, they might well point this out and say that he spent his time in spying.4.   Ayaa Rav and Alexandretta  (Pages 56 and 57J.. It is suggested that the three paragraphs containing referencesto Ayas Bay and Alexandretta should be omitted.5.   Choice of Evacuation or forcing Straits.Pages 58 and 59..)It is suggested that it is not desirable to publish the information given in paragraphs 133 and 134 as to the representations of the Vice-Admiral against evacuation and in favour of an attempt to force the Straits and the Admiralty replies to these representations,6.   Conveyance of Wounded  (Pages 69-81. 95. 96.aM 155=165,.These pages contain many references to thefact that all sorts of craft, other than hospitalships, were used for the conveyance of wounded: Inone case (page 79) it is stated that a transportloaded with ammunition was used to accommodatewounded.      These references would, in the hands of theenemy, lend themselves to propaganda to the effectthat we used hospital ships for carrying troops,ammunitioni etc.    It is difficult to see how thisenemy propaganda could be prevented short of omitting
all these pages, as the general trend of the Report on medical-arrangements presumes that fleet-sweepers, trawlers, empty transports, etc., ha,d to be used to supplement hospital ships proper to accommodate and convey wounded.If these pages are to be published as they stand, it is suggested that a statement should be issued to the Press pointing out that although transports, and other vessels carried wounded they were not marlted as hospital ships, nor was any immunity -claimed for them, so that there was no breach of The Hague Convention,.7.   Retailed Tables jffd Orders Jpv, landingH?ages 140-154).Of particular interest and value to theenemy would be the Appendices to General Sir IanHamilton1s Despatch dated 11th December,1915, givingtables of personnel and materiel required for  thelanding and detailed orders for the operation itself.These Appendices were actually circulated to thePress by the War Office in an advance copy of theLondon Gazette Supplement in January 1916, and wererecalled and suppressed at the earnest request ofthe Admiralty on the  ground &apos;that they would be ofassistance to the enemy.(signed)   R,E.
