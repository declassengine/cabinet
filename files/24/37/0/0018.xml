Colonel JonesTHIS DCCUJgUT IS-THE PROPERTY QE Kiff BBITAITEIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOTlTOEIff,SECRET; -.&apos;    . -&apos; FAR CAP DPT.G.T.C118.PROPOSED INTERNATIONAL GONE&apos;PENCE.(Copy of telegram from Sir..E;Howard (Stockholm) to Secretary of State- for Foreign Affaira).D. 11,30 p.m. December 16th 1917 )- ) 18th December 1917.R. 12o5. p.m, December 19th 1917 )   :Eo, 5^:85.Very confidentiml,My telegram lie.    5468.Mr. Sharp tells ma that Hungarian Socialist leader Felt nor has brought v/it-h him resolution passed at a Hungarian SocMist Congress on November 25th (120,000 people being present at various meetings) demanding a general peace, not a separate peace with Russia, as only general peace can offer guarantees for permanent peace and democratic develop-meht.     Separate peace does not mean end (?of the) v/ar and may even prolong the jar and strengthen reactionary force;;, Hungarian Socialist party will do all in its po&apos;..er therefore to make the Central Power Governments state their war aims clearly and unequivocally. - They ask however that their Coiiirad(ea in) France England and Italy should exercise similar pressure on their GovernmentstThe Hungarian party also urges the (?Dutch) Scan-din uvl&amp;n Committee to issue immediate invitations to -n International Conference at Stoomholm since pressure to end the war and consideration- of&apos; democraticCL w 2ii L^ti J.CL s
demands can only be brought to bear by such Interoation al methods .Socialists of all countries must see to it that this conference is not delayed as every day is of importance.Dr. Welther has brought with him a similar message from Mr. Haase 6f German&apos; minority.    I understand Mr. Huysmans has transmitted this Hungarian proposal to Mr. Henderson which it asked him to submit it to the British and French Socialists.It seems to me that In view of the strong-attitude taken by Dutch Scandinavian Committee and Haase against a Russian separate peace and Bolsheviks generally it would be a tactical error now to discourage this movement.     It would seem that ( ?best means of) fighting extreme Socialist and peace at any price parties would be to call in co-operation of patriotic and reasonable Socialists who desire peace on lines of resolution adopted by the Executive of the British Labour Party as telegraphed from London to-day which seems in the main to uphold war aims of the Allies .   If it was made a condition before allowing passports for such a conference that first resolution to be discussed and passed by the Conference would deal with the violation of Belgium I think we may take it for granted that the Germans would find them-selves in a complete minority .    As I have already ( ?pointed out) in this telegram German majority would have then either to disavow their Government or their own Socialist principles .    In either case this would embarrass Germans.      As far as Russia is concerned it would seem probable that if all Russian Socialistparties
parties are represented majority of British Govern-ment delegates would agree with *ha-t (? is omitted) certain to he almost unanimous sentiment of conference against a separate peace and this would do more than (? anything) else to descredit action of Bolsheviks in the eyes of Russian people.     If on the other hand Bolsheviks refuse passes to moderate Socialists this will equally discredit them.Russian moderate Socialists such as Thiselrod who is now in Stockholm might he relied on to do utmost to-destroy Bolshevik po&apos;7er.Mr. Sharp considers and I agree that.if there were any possibility of passports being now granted to delegates to (? attend) Conference early intimation of this might be used with very good effect to put drag on or altogether block Bolshevik separate peace negotiations in Stockholm or elsewhere.If it could be suggested that International Socialist Conference might take place in February it would Seem almost impossible for Bolsheviks to continue negotiations.-Above considerations are put forward simply with a view to stopping separate peace with Russia, turning public opinion there, discrediting Bolsheviks and giving patriotic Socialists opportunity of stating their views, to the world at large,.    Moral effect of failure of separate peace would also be very (? groat) in Germany and neutral countries..There are no doubt other matters connected withthis
this proposal such as effect.-/ ? on .) military situation ( ? at the ) Front   and&quot; public opinion at: homeabout ( ? groups omitted ) wMch you are much more qualified to offer opinion., .
