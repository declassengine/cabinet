Gun Ammunition for l9lQ*Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for War,At Tuesday&apos;b meeting of the War Cabinet (War Cabinet 309 (4)), I was much disturbed to hear that there was a proposal still further to reduce our ammunition programme for the Army during 1918,That programme has just been cut to the extent of 500,000 ^ tons of shells from the supplies we anticipated receiving during this year from the Ministry of Munitions.   This figure represents a out of not less than 18$,It would in my opinion be fatal to permit any further restriction.   Our Infantry have been trained for the last two   &apos; years to rely very largely on a preponderance of Artillery fire. It is more than probable that that preponderance may pass to the enemy during the six or eight months ahead of us.   It is estimated that the Germans (exclusive of the Austrians) oan bring about 1,700 Field Guns, 650 Field Howitzers, and over 1,600 Heavy guns and Howitzers to the West from the Eastern front during the next six months.   Even with the restrictions already imposed upon us we shall be put to it to give our Infantry all the Artillery support they will require.With the probability of very severe defensive fighting during the coming months, it would be disastrous to run short of field gun ammunition, and this must be distributed along our whole front as the soene or scenes of the decisive battles will neoess-arily be largely left to the enemy&apos;s selection,   Consequently the cut will have to be made probably in the Heavy Shells used with the longer range natures employed largely for oounter-battery work.In connection with this point, I may say that a most interesting German memorandum on counter-battery work issued over Ludendorff!s -signature on the 4th October last was recently captured by the French,   The objeot of this memorandum was to point cut to the German gunners how important was oounter-hattery work, and it included tables ttbased on the losses incurred by one German Army during a period of operations en a large scale&quot;, shewing that of the total losses in German guns, including every casualty from guns completely destroyed down to the inevitable damages which are bound to occur to the guns in battery positions, 59$ in the Heavy Artillery and 53$ in their Field Artillery were due to ,our gun fire,-  Their total losses in guns in these operations amounted to 1,455,Deducting these guns which were only slightly damaged, that is, those which could be repaired and sent back to the line quickly, amounting in all to 418, it appears that our counter-battery work was responsible for 66^ of the damage done to their Heavy Artillery and 60f* in the case of their Field Artillery.These figures show plainly how valuable and effective our heavy shells have been.The

This figure represents a cut of net less than 18$,It would in my opinion be fatal to permit any further restriction.

Tiie War Cabinet are aware that we are constantly being called upon to supply this or that Ally with heavy Howitsers, and it is, of course, useless to do so unless we can furnish them with an efficient Bupply of ammunition.I trust therefore that every possible expedient for saving shipping tonnage may be most carefully investigated before the War Cabinet decide to make any further cut in our ammunition programme, Hi   1- -      ^     - - jUBRBY. j3rd January, 1918,
