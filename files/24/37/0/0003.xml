SEC RJU iThis l)oc ument^ is^he^roperty .of EisBritannic&quot;Ma 3esty&apos; s - Go ve rhi3)eliT7&apos;G.T.3103.UAE OaBIUET.(Copy Telegram from General Poole Ho , 749 Dated 19,1 ,,,17)(Circulated to &quot;rar Cabinet in connection with G,T.3015) iTo-day &apos;I hare had a full discussion with the French and American Missions and have had direct personal reports from Archangel.&apos;    There is no doubt that at Archang^g) the Bolscheviks Have complete control,.and we all agree that no .active steps can te taken.without causing open.friction which would result in us &quot;being turned out of Archangel and leave a clear field for Germany, vJq aro making arrangements to do all possible secretly to check activity on the Railway,   Please arrange to authorise any expenditure I may incur for this which will not be large\   Any defenite- steps to ensure retention of stores for our own use must necessitate application to Bolscheviks which is impossible at present.-   I.r-m trying to arrange unofficial ruling of ,Artillery &quot;Department but  -have no great hope of energectic action.     I am of opinion that ship containing clothing and foods would provide means of peaceful bargaining    at Archangel.,   It could go to Murmansk if ice does not permit Archangel.    If the ship   is at port we could bargain these supplies against a safe-guarding against -Germany of military stores-. Cable reply please.2,Whitehall Gardens,S^7Q24th December, 1917.
