Printed for the Use of the Reconstruction Committee-July 1917.Confidential. .If ^^^^^Et^CTION  COMMITTEE.R.0121.Memorandum on Post-War Commercial Policy in the Lightof Recent Events.The changes which recent events have brought about make it desirable to review the economic situation, present and prospective, and more especially to consider its bearing on the conclusions arrived at by the Paris Conference for dealing with the economic problems that will arise at the end of the War. The question is one of some urgency as Lord Balfour of Burleigh&apos;s Committee, the only body which is reviewing the problems of post-war commercial policy as a whole, was instructed to pursue its enquiries &quot; with special reference to the conclusions reached at the Economic Con-ference of the Allies.&quot; Should those conclusions turn out no longer to be valid in the altered situation a great part of the Committee&apos;s work may be found to be stultified. If fresh instructions are needed no time should be lost in giving them.It is well to remember that when the representatives of the Commercial and Trade Departments of the Allied Governments met in Paris on June 14-17, 1916, it was at a period of grave stress and anxiety for the Allied cause.The Allied Governments therefore felt bound to prepare for all eventualities. Their natural and legitimate anxiety is well reflected in the preamble to the Reso-lutions of the Conference, which sets forth the guiding motives of the detailed policy adopted.   The three salient statements in the preamble may be recalled.(1) The Central Empires are to-day preparing in concert with their Allies, for a contest in the economic plane, which will not only survive the re-establish-ment of peace, but will at that moment attain its full scope and intensity.(2) The agreements which are being prepared for this purpose between their enemies have the obvious object of establishing the domination of the latter over the production and markets of the whole world and of imposing on other countries an intolerable yoke.(3) The representatives of the Allied Governments consider that it has become their duty, on grounds of necessary and legitimate defence, to adopt and realise from now onward all the measures requisite on the one hand to secure for themselves and for the whole of the markets of neutral countries full economic independence and respect for sound commercial practice, and on the other hand to facilitate the organisation on a permanent basis of their economic alliance.At that time, when the preamble was framed, the statements made in (1) and (2) were, no doubt, thought to be justified by the facts, and the enemy policy embodied in them had considerable prospects of realisation. The Resolutions of the Conference which were adopted in response to it were therefore rightly described as based on &quot; grounds of necessary and legitimate defence &quot; defence against commercial aims, methods and principles on the part of Germany which had been pursued for many years prior to the War and had been carried to their fullest extent during the War itself.To-day, however, the situation is very different. The changes may be summed up as follows : (1) The entry of the United States and other neutrals into the War, and the alienation of other neutrals from Germany.(2) The change in the mihtary situation. The prospects of the con-tinuance of the present German economic control over the non-German territory in Eastern Europe and Nearer Asia still remaining in German hands are considerably reduced.U   (33)1339-63   Wt 12-39   125   7/17   E&amp;S
(3) The apprehension that the Central Empires will be able at the mom ent of peace to renew the contest on the economic plane in &quot; its full scope and intensity &quot; need no longer be entertained. There is ample evidence to show that the Central Empires are nearing the end of their stock of foodstuffs and raw materials, and that, even if the blockade does not (as one dare not anticipate) by itself bring about a collapse of their power, the moment of peace will find the German and Austrian authorities faced with the gigantic and unprecedented task of restocking those countries for the primary needs of their populations. The difficulty and complexity of the problem thus pre-sented is thoroughly realised, as their recent utterances show, by the responsible German authorities (see Paper II. on Plans for German Recon-struction), involving as it does an elaborate organisation for the demobilisation of industrial workers, the importation of foodstuffs and raw materials, the regulation of shipping, and the provision of credit as against an adverse foreign exchange. To put it at its lowest, many months must elapse before German manufacturers will be able to produce on a large scale for export or to compete as previously with their rivals in the markets of the world.(4) The Paris Conference, in discussing the re-establishment of Allied countries overrun by the enemy, recommend that those countries should have a prior claim on their &quot; raw materials, industrial and agricultural plant, stock and mercantile fleet,&quot; forbearing to suggest that this need might be met, in whole, or in part, by indemnities extorted from the enemy. Such indemnities for wrong done may now be looked for with more confidence. The point of view of the Allied Governments, including that of the United States, on this question has recently been clearly set forth in response to the Russian Governments invitation.(5) The prolongation and extension of the War, with its immense demand for material of all kinds and its diversion of labour from ordinary productive employment, has changed the economic outlook in a manner which could not have been predicted even a year ago. Whereas, at the time when the Con-ference met, the dumping of manufactured goods could be held to be a danger, the chief element in the situation to-day is a probable world-shortage for some time to come in important raw materials and food-stuffs, accentuated by the recent bad harvests of last year and by the increasing shortage of shipping. Thus a situation has been created which calls for concerted action among the Allies, not so much to defend themselves against German aggression as to provide co-operatively rather than competitively for their own post-war needs.Moreover, the concentration of such an enormous mass of economic power on the side of the Allies would have the further advantage of placing at their disposal a leverage of policy of which it may be found possible to make skilful use in influencing the enemy both during the War and in any peace negotiation.There are  circumstances attending the reception of the resolutions of the Conference themselves which tend to the same conclusion.The final resolution emphasises the necessity of immediate action by the Allied Governments.&quot; for giving full and complete effect&quot; to the policy embodied in the preceding resolutions. Subsequent events, however, have shown that the policy has proved less acceptable than was anticipated to some of the Governments concerned, and that the difficulty of adjusting its execution to the exigencies of their respective interests has not proved easy to surmount. The change of regime in Russia has probably added considerably to the practical difficulties of carrying into elfect the proposals as regards that country. Amongst the other Allies, Japan has made express reservations, whilst the difficulty experienced by the Italian Government in enforcing the blockade of the Central Empires during the war period itself renders it unlikely that the Paris Conference policj&apos;- can be effectively carried through by Italy in the post-war period. Important interests in Belgium have also expressed apprehension at the effect of the Paris Conference policy upon the prosperity of Antwerp.There would appear therefore to be a strong case for a reconsideration of the problems considered at Paris and of the methods suggested for dealing with them.Under these circumstances it is suggested that the Cabinet should take steps by a new invitation to the Allies, including the United States, to secure the reconsideration of the whole question with a view to the adoption of a concerted inter-Ally economic policy during the post-War period.   Such a Conference would also be invaluable
in enabling tke Allies to present a united front in negotiating with the enemy on the many economic questions which are likely to be brought forward in the course of the peace discussions.If this view is adopted by the Government the Reconstruction Committee desire to urge the importance of setting on foot forthwith the investigations and discussions necessary for the formulation of a policy to be advocated on behalf of this country and of the Dominions.
