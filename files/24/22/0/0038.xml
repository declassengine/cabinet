POSITION OF TH  COTTON IMJSTKT.The position of Cotton Stocks ai the present time is giving rise to considerable alarm in Lancashire.    These stocks have in fact fallen to the point which (taking American cotton only) represents about three weeks consumption. It is this obvious feature of the situation which has induced the Cotton Control Board to come forward with a proposal for a uniform reduction in the output of the industry.    The Ministry of Slipping have been approached with a view to ascertaining how much cotton can be promised in the near future, and have been asked to secure supplies of 50,000 to 60,000 tons of American cotton per month.    On August 3rd the Shipping Controller stated that owing to certain fortuitous circumstances he would be able to guarantee the shipment of 70,000 tons of cotton, or say 300,000 bales, in August; that he hoped to reserve space for 50,000 tons or say 220,000 bales in September, but that he could not give any assurance as to the space likely to be forthcoming in subsequent months.It has been estimated that the consumption of the industry is about 55,000 tons per month, or 55,000 bales per week.    Consequently, apart from the small surplus importation in August the importations in subsequent months will be insufficient to meet the monthly requirements of the industry, particularly when account is taken of the fact that it is only shipments of the amounts mentioned, that are offered and not arrivals.    Some of the Cotton may be lost in transit.  Moreover,   as has been stated, importations even of these insufficient amounts are not guaranteed after September.Thus
Thus it will be seen that the position of the industry at the present time is that the reserve or margin on which the industry works is reduced to about three weeis1 supply at Liverpool as against nearly 10 weeks1 supply this time last year, whilst there are in addition about 4 weeks1 supply at the mills or almost certainly less than the amount usually held at the mills.  Moreover, some portion of the stocks held at Liverpool is not usable cotton.  As regards provision for the consumption of the industry from the present date, there is no promise that this will be furnished, and at the best after August it is proposed to provide quantities less than the consumption of the industry so that some reduction in output is unavoidable if shipments cannot be increased.In order to meet the situation the Cotton Control Board has recommended a restriction of production throughout the industry in the form of a curtailment of working machinery which will involve the cutting down of production by nearly 25$ over and above the 18$ by which production is now reduced as a result of labour shortage.    Details of the scheme are appended.    This mi $it not seem a very grave matter for the industry if the restriction continued only for a few weeks, particularly as the Oontrol Board propose to raise a levy fi^m^employers^whx^^will be allowed to work more than the percentage of maoMnery-adopted as the standard, and to distribute the fund so raised amongst the operatives in order to mitigate the distress likely to ensue from reduced wages.  It would be a more serious matter for Lancashire, and probably result in much increase Of labour discontent, if restriction had to be continued for a long time seeing that large numbers of women will be thrown out of work and find themselves unable to get other employment, while in addition a number of men will also be placed in the same position.
!Fhe scheme far reduced production has received the practically unanimous approval of the Cotton Control Board, on which, of course, the Operatives^ Trade Unions are represented; and it is understood that, having regard to the arrangements for collecting a levy from the employers, the Operatives&apos; Organisations have all agreed to withdraw the notice for advances in wages which they had previously sent in, with the proviso, however, that this withdrawal of notices only takes effect so long as the scheme continues in operation and so long as the fund raised by levies on the trades proves adequate for the purpose for which it is designed.Having regard to the danger of doing anything which would increase the labour discontent in the country, I have thought it right to place the facts of the situation &quot;before the Cabinet and to invite the expression of their views as to (l) the desirability of adopting as a temporary measure the recommendation of the Board of Control and (2) the desirability of allocating sufficient further tonnage to secure an increased importation of -American Cotton in the future.A.H.S.7th August, 1917.

Clause 0 hereof.That notice be given to mantifacturers to stop forth-with all but 60^ of the total number of their looms, so that within four weeks of the date of such notice they must not be working more than the aforesaid 6C$.    This extension of time is in order to meet the working up of beams at present in the looms.That a licence to work extra looms be granted to manufacturers on the payment of a weekly levy of 2s. 6d per loom on all looms working over and above the 60$.That all Twiner Doublers be given a week!s notice to stop all but 60/iJ of their total spindlage.   Licences will be given to work beyond 60$ of the total spindlage on the same basis of levy as Hing Spinners.That in the event of the notices for advance in wagee sent in by the operatives&apos; organisations, being withdrawn, the monies received from the payment of levies referred to in preceding clauses will be used by the Board of Control, for the following purposes :-a. To prevent the depiction of the Trade Union funds.b. To ameliorate the want and distress which the discharged operatives would otherwise be put to.c. For any other purpose (brought on by the crisis) that the Board may think proper.This scheme will be dealt with jointly by the Board of Control, and the Trade Unions and Employers&apos; Organisations with a view to causing the least inconvenience and hard-ship during the present critical period, the main object being to spread the burden equally on all sections and to give practical proof of the desire of both employers and employed to work together for the good of all.
