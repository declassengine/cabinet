My Lords agree that the question will require to. be reviewed in the light of the experiences of the present war, but they do not think that the present time is convenient for the discussion of a scheme oi such magnitude and far-reaching consequences, still less for coming to a decision as to its being Sanctioned.3.   Their Lordships therefore regard the. re-opening of the question nov as premature and they are strongly of opinion that its official consideration should be postponed until after the-conclusion of peace.. In these circumstances,&apos; while they are fully convinced of the importance of the question from a. naval as well as1 military point of view, yet they do not think it necessary to express any ^considered opinion upon the carrying out of such an undertaking.I am, Sir, .. Your obedient Servant, (Signed)     0. Murray.
