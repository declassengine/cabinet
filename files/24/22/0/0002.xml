District Agricultural Committees.During the week a representative of the Board has attended a meeting of the Bute Committee when arrangements relating to next year4a work were discussed.2. The 1918 Programme.A circular has been issued to District Agricultural Executive Committees dealing with the arrangements to be made and the steps to be taken in order to carry out the Board&apos;s scheme of additional cultivation for 1918.

E7th July 1917.Sir,I am directed by the Board of Agriculture for 3cotland to say that they have received enquiries from several Agricultur-al Executive Committees with regard to the means to he adopted in order to secure the additional cultivation considered to he necessary in view of the present and prospective shortage in the; food supplies of the country.The Board do not anticipate that as a general rule farmers will he unwilling, when the need is pointed out to them, to under-take the cultivation of additional areas on their farms, provided that they are able to seoure the necessary labour and implements. From the experience gained during the past Spring, however, it appears that in a certain number of oases occupiers of land may for various reasons be reluctant to meet the views of Committees in this respect, and will either refuse to act in accordance with the suggestions made to them or will endeavour to prolong the negotiations to such an extent as in effect to nullify the oom-pulsory powers conferred on the Board by the Defence of the Realm Regulations.     In some instances, also, it is probable that farmers will intimate their willingness to undertake the additional cultivation required of them, but will subsequently put forward pretexts for not complying with the wishes of the Committees concerned.The Board attach great importance to the attainment of the desired/Ihe Secretary,District Agricultural Executive Committee,
desired Increase In the area under orope by means of amicable arrangements wherever possible, but they will net hesitate to have recourse to their compulsory powers where this appears to be neccese? :ary and justifiable.    Ivery effort should, however, in the first place, be made to secure the desired end by agreement-, and no paine should be spared to secure the co-operation of farmers and other oocupiers of land in tke work with which Agricultural Executive Committees have been entrusted.    In this connection it would be advisable for Committees who have arrived at an agreement, with the farmers concerned, as to the area to be put under orope, to emphasise that the arrangement is of the nature of a bargain which will require to be implemented, and if, by 1st February 1918, the Committee are not satisfied that the necessary steps have been taken by a farmer to carry out the work, they should, If so advised, submit the whole facts to the Board in recommending the issue of a Compulsory Order .The Board consider it essential that in every instance all the parties interested should be allowed to submit their observations direct to the Board before the iosue of a compulsory order.       In every case, however, such observations will require to be submitted: -before the expiry of a definite period, and in no instance will the Board decline to act on a recommendation made by a Committee without, giving them an opportunity of considering any statements or objec- . :tions bearing on the proposals which may have been made.I am to add that before it is decided to recommend that tine Board should call upon an occupier to cultivate his land in accord-ranee with certain specified requirements, the Committee should of course  /
- s -course satisfy themselves that the occupier concerned is in a position to undertake the cultivation which is considered to he necessary.    Similarly, in suhmitting proposals involving the entering on and taking possession of land, the Committee should have in view the means wherehy the land is to ho cultivated.   As a general rule, it will he Sound advisahle to arrange for land as taken over to he cultivated hy a neighhouring farmer who has at his disposal the neoessary lahour and implements, hut in con-aidering such arrangements due regard should ho had to the fact that any exercise of the BoardTs compulsory powers may form the subject of a claim to the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission, and every effort should accordingly he made to ensure that any arrangement made will be such as to ensure as far as possihle no charge will fall on public funds.I am, Sir,Your ohedient 3ervant, H.M. CONACHEB,Secretary.

It is hoped that these men will be made available for the ooming harvest and will be allowed to remain on the farms for Autumn ploughing, and I am to request that you will get into communication with the Sub-Commissioner of the Rational Service Department in your district and let him know as   early as possible the numbers of men wanted and where you wish them placed.It is suggested that in tho first instance the men should be put at the disposal of farmers who have promised to undertake additional cultivation.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,H.
