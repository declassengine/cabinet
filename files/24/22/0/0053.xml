Reports indicate certain amount of real feeling exists behind Homo Rule and Besant agitation in Bombay, Mahratta-speaking areas of Bombay and Central Provinces, which are dominated by Tilak&apos;s influence. Elsewhere agitation hollow and kept alive by few politicians. There are faint indications that minorities begin to wonder how their interests would be safeguarded under Home Rule. Action had to be taken to compel Editor of &quot;Bombay Chronicle&quot; [to abstain] from publishing-alarmist rumours of misconduct by recruits in Labour Depot, which were calculated to discourage recruiting. In consequence of excitement caused by these rumours recruitment v/as temporarily stopped in portion of Bombay City.

Matter suitably dealt with. No further trouble anticipated.India Office, Sth August 1917.
