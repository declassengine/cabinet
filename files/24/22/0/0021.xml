HAIG.Field-Marshal, Commanding-in-Chief, British Armies in France.
Report on the battle of 31st July,  1917,  and its results.The preliminary preparations for the offensive on the YPRES front were necessarily of a very elaborate nature.The road and railway communications already in existance were quite insufficient for the assembly and maintenance of -the very large numbers of troops and guns required for the operation,   and a great amount of labour was required to improve existing communications and construct new ones before the troops could be assembled.The arrangements for crossing the YSER canal under the close fire of the enemy also required considerable fore-thought and preparation.The space from which the attack had to be launched wasvery confined and overlooked by the enemy, who had all the advantages of position.Possession of the MESSINES Ridge was of particular value to the enemy in enabling him to bring enfila.de,  and even reverse,  artilleryt fire from the south over our positions in the salient.     But even when ha had been driven from this ridge he still had excellent direct observation from the east and south-east.Consequently it was absolutely essential to gain definite artillery and air superiority before the final assembly of the infantry for assault could be undertaken.The necessary road and railway work wasjtaken in hand in good time,  so far as the means available permitted. When this work was sufficiently advanced ammunition was &quot;dumped&quot; and guns were got into position as quickly as possible.     Counter-battery action wasjifcen commenced.
The artillery struggle was very severe, owing to the unavoidable exposure of our gun positions; moreover the conditions for observation from the air, during the bombard-ment, though at times fair and even good, were often unfavourable.The necessary degree of superiority of fire was, however, gained by the unsparing efforts of the artillery and the Royal Flying Corps, whose work under very trying and difficult conditions is worthy of the highest commendation.The 25th July had been fixed originally as the date to be worked to for the attack, but owing to weather conditions it was found advisable to postpone the assault until the 28th July and,   subsequently,  at the urgent tequest of General Anthoine, Commanding the First French Army (of 6 divisions) co-operating on our left, I sanctioned a further postponement until the 31st July.After the enemy&apos;s artillery fire had been mastered his defensive positions were thoroughly bombarded with such effect that we were enabled to establish posts beyond the Canal on the front of the French and the left British Corps (XIV) before the date fixed for the assault.The artillery superiority gained enabled the final assembly of the assaulting troops to be carried out and the infantry attack to be launched with complete success and little loss.The assault commenced punctually at 3.50 a.m. on the 31st July.The plan of attack was an advance by &quot;bounds&quot; under a heavy barrage up to a final line well within range of our guns;    Ha.lts, for fixed periods,  on intermediate lines (two in number) were arranged for as usual;  and while power was retained to stop the advance on any of these intermediate lines if it should become advisable to do so,  arrangementswereI
were also made to push patrols beyond the final line, when reached, and to take full advantage of any disorganisation of the enemy.    These arrangements included an advance of a portion of the artillery and the use of tanks.On the right of the Fifth Army,, to which the main attack was allotted, the Second Army&apos;s task was to advance a short distance only, on a front of some 10*000 yards, to hold the enemy and force him to distribute his fire.The French Army was to cover the left of the Fifth Army throughout its advance, moving forward in a series of simultaneous bounds.The first line was gained punctually and with ease, and the advance proceeded against the second line in due course. Except on the extreme right this was also reached with complete success, the enemy1s defences being overrun without a check.On the extreme right, where the natural difficulties of the ground are very great, and had been increased by recent rain, the fighting was more severe than further north, the chief trouble being from well hidden and well protected machine-guns which had escaped destruction in the bombardment.The unfavourable state of the atmosphere now began to make itself felt.    Observation from the air was entirely impossible owing to the low clouds, and direction of artillery fire by aeroplane against special targets, for which most careful arrangements had been made, could not be carried out.    Owing mainly to this, and also in some degree to the difficulty of maintaining direction under heavy fire in the broken, difficult, and wooded ground on our right flank our advance there was held up after making some progress towards the second line, which was reached in places.While this struggle was proceeding the advance was
continued further north, and the final objective was reached by the French and by all the divisions on our left and centre without serious difficulty and with very satisfactorily small losses.The impossibility of artillery direction from the air was most unfortunate at this stage.    On our right centre the advance was proceeding equally well, but owing to the check on our extreme right the right flank of the divisions in this area became exposed to fire, while our guns could not be directed from the air on to the- enemyfs counter attacks which now began to be launched.    Consequently the ri&amp;ht centre of the attack had to give a little ground in places in order to maintain its connection with the right.Heavy rain set in in the afternoon, and eventually it was decided that it would be inadvisable, under the atmospheric conditions, to push the advance further for the moment on the right, and troops were ordered to consolidate and hold the ground gained.Summarising the results of the battle I regard them as most satisfactory.    They entirely confirm our ability to overcome the enemyfs aftillery even under the most unfavour- -able conditions, and to assemble our troops for assault and launch the assault even under the enemyfs direct observation. They confirm further that the British Armies can be relied on to drive the enemy from any position by the combined efforts of the infantry, artillery and aeroplanes and to do so without undue loss.On this occasion we were entirely deprived of aeroplane observation, and the artillery was in consequence deprived of much of its power; but nevertheless the advance reached its pbjectives with ease on the whole front of over 15 miles, except as noted above.
Had the weather heen more propitious I have no doubt that we should have reached them everywhere, that the enemy1 s counter-attacks would have suffered even more severely than they have done, and that the success,gained would have been even more considerable. &quot;I cannot speak too highly of the work done before and in the battle by all arms, ranks and services.   The moral of the troops is entirely admirable and all are anxious to follow up the great success and take full advantage of it with as little delay as possible.Unfortunately, however, the persistent bad weather which has continued since the 31st July has rendered impossible the resumption of our advance, and imposed very great hardships on the troops.The enemy no doubt has also suffered from it, but he has gained time at a juncture when he sorely needed it and when a rapid resumption of our advance, for which we were fully prepared, might have gained very considerable and immediate results.As matters stand the ground will require several days of fine weather to dry before the advance can be resumed, and as the rain still continues I cannot yet say when it will be possible to continue the offensive.The delay will doubtless entail a renewal of the struggle for artillery and air supremacy before a fresh infantry assault can be launched.       This supremacy can undoubtedly be gained, and there is not reason to doubt that, given a sufficient duration of suitable weather, the attain-ment of the objects in view is within our power.I must point out, however, that the delay is throwing an increased strain on our guns and on the artillery personnel; while the wastage in both infantry and artillerypersonnel
personnel will &quot;be increased by the hardships due to exposure to such bad weather and the enormous labour resulting from ; it in maintaining the troops and getting forward ammunition, etc, over ground which is reported to be now as bad as that with which we had to deal last winter on the SOMME and ANCRE,As regards the falsity of enemy reports of fighting since the 31st July, I beg to confirm here my secret telegram NO.&apos;0.A.D. 588, of yesterday1s date.    With the exception of a few minor and successful enterprises, duly reported in my communiques, no attack has been launched since the 31st July, nor will anything more than minor enterprises be attempted until the conditions of weather and ground are sufficiently favourable to justify it.The enemy has launched numerous unsuccessful counter attacks and his object would appear to be to cover up the failure of these by reporting the repulse of attacks which we have not made.In conclusion I am glad to report that our casualties may be regarded as light for so great a battle and a large proportion of the wounds are reported to be slight.The enemy&apos;s casualties cannot be accurately estimated and the information available does not justify me in stating a figure   for them.    We have, however, captured over 6,000 prisoners and. the number of enemy dead on the battlefield is reported to be very large,We know from prisoners that the enemy suffered very heavily in our bombardment and I have no doubt that the total of his casualties exceeds ours very considerably and not improbably by as much as 100$-.The positions gained by us will facilitate very greatly the preparations for a further advance when weatherconditions
conditions permit of itD. HAIG.Field-Marshal, Commanding-in-Chi ef, 4th August, 1917.   British Armies in France .
