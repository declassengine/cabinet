From :- General Barter. 9th Aug. 19170To C.I.G.S. 7*35 p.m.Noo 1164.This morning I had a private interview with Kornilof.     I was with the General for several days before and after attack of 8th army at Stanislav, and we established very cordial mutual relations.        I was therefore warmly received by him.We discussed following points:-1.     Present position.2.    Future plans with regard German and Russian offensives. 3.     Equipment of Roumanian Army. &apos; 4.    Anti-war propaganda of 9th army committeea 5.     Possible separate peace for Roumania. . 6.     Destruction of cereal, oil wells and rolling stock in Roumania.My telegram 1133 gives Kornilof!s views with regard to numbers (1) aid (2) to which I can add that Russians are now showing greater resistance.       11th Army9 for instance, made a counter-attack of 3 days in which very heavy losses were inflicted on a German division.Kornilof hopes in a month1s time this army will be in good fighting trim, when it will take offensive together with right flank of 7th army in Southerly direction.   The command *f 11th army Yfill be given to General Misnitski, an able and energetic officer.Other
Other instances of determination of fighting by individual formations are also to hand; but the state of 11th army is still bad.     Units have marched bodily away from the front with bancl playing, etc.     Committee of this army has been also engaged in active propaganda amongst Roumanians,-It is considered that German offensive on Roumanian front, i.e* down valley of Trotus along the railway from Focsani, and in the neighbourhood of Galatz, are merely demonstrations to assist main German attack in Bukovina,While Allied Troops available to meet this offensive are ample, some apprehension appears to be felt in Roumania that continuation of demonstrations referred to may cease unauthorised and voluntary retirement on part of Russian troops.As to the equipment of Roumanian army-,     This now consists of 15 divisions, 11 of which are effective e.     In addition to remaining 4 divisions, which are not complete with artillery etc., there are in depots about 60,000 men0     Kornil thinks that the 4 divisions and those In the depots should be considered as a reserve for the 11 Roumanian divisions already equipped &quot;and that these latter should be supplied with necessary quota of heavy artillery and other material necessary.     &apos;.&apos;.&quot;ith this view I agree,.As regards number (4) a cable has been sent already to General Scherbachef, instructing Mm to take necessary measures to stop activity of this committee, and in&apos;addition Kornilof has obtained. Governments consent to send a commissary with special powers&quot;to use force; if necessary, to obtain desired result.Paragraph 5.     Kornilof is of opinion that so far. King and Government are loyal; but at interview with Roumanian representatives yesterday he had a suspicion thatPro-German
Pro-German party in Roumania was strongly advocating a separate peace.Regarding destruction of cereal, oil and rolling stock,, he is in full accord with your view, and is detailing orders in accordance to commanders concerned.     I assured myself before my departure from Roumania that every disposi-tion had been made for immediate destruction and I obtained Scherbachef1s personal premise of thorough co-operation with our officers.I am also glad to report that provisional Govern-ment had accepted all the clauses of Kornilo^s ultimatum on his taking supreme command, and that Xornilof himself, far from relaxing his efforts to discipline the army, is insisting on still wider and more comprehensive measures including application of martial law, and death penalty to the agitators (?) He says that he is determined also to clear all troops out of the large cities and to replace them by Cossack garrisons,.   Pie has to this end demanded that Petrograd, Moscow, Odessa and Kief be declared within zone of military operations.     This demand has been favourably received by Government, and he is now waiting only slightest pretext to oarry his intention into operation if necessary by force.
