July 29.. July 22.. July 15..	20 17 21 13	3 3 3 4	19 24 13 23There has been a slight increase in the number of large ships sunk. The losses were distributed as follows : Bay of Biscay, 6 ; Channel, 5 ; North Sea, North and West of Scotland, and Spanish coast, 3 each; Mediterranean, 2 ; Irish Sea, 1.Of a total of seventeen ships sunk in the vicinity of the United Kingdom, six were inward and eleven outward bound. It was pointed out in Naval Appreciation 1 that the majority of sinkings occurred amongst the inward-bound ships, and that in that particular week (21st to 27th May) the proportion was 8 to 1, whilst in April five-sixths of the ships sunk in the vicinity of the United Kingdom were homeward bound. As the convoy system has developed, ensuring a higher degree of protection to the inward trade, the disproportion between the two has gradually decreased, until in the current week it has been reversed in the proportion of nearly 2 to 1. Thus, one result of the convoy system has been a greatly intensified attack on the outward trade. At one time it was thought that the comparatively light losses.of the latter were mainly due to the better control which it was possible to exercise over its sailing, but more recent figures indicate that before the introduction of the convoy system the enemy submarines concentrated in the areas where the inward trade was to be found. The increased sinkings in outward-bound ships may be partly due to the withdrawal of patrols for convoys, and arrangements are now being made to convo3r some of the outward trade. It is hoped to commence this system about the middle of August. Lamlash is being prepared as a port of assembly for the outward Clyde and North Irish Sea trade, and trawlers are being collected at Milford to escort the British Channel ships out of the submarine zone.At least fifteen to seventeen large enemy submarines have been out during the week, and of these seven to eleven have been operating to the westward of the British Isles. The area of greatest activity has been to the north west of Ireland. During the week fifty-nine ships have been convoyed across the North Atlantic in safety. One ship which lost her convoy shortly after leaving the United States, proceeded ahead independently and was torpedoed and sunk twenty-four hours ahead of the remainder.Fifteen engagements have been reported with the enemy submarines during the week. One U.C. type submarine is known to have been destroyed by mines off the Irish coast.There has been the usual mining activity off the East Coast of England and Scotland and South Coast of Ireland. The enemy has also made one of his periodical visits to the West Coast of Scotland, and has laid mines in various localities. Total number of enemy mines destroyed diiring the week, sixty.Comparison of Losses in Approach Areas to the United Kingdom.All British ships approaching the United Kingdom from the Atlantic are brought in through one of three areas of concentration, the focal points of which are the Scilly Islands off the south-west corner of England, the Fastnet off the south-wrest of Ireland, and Tory Island off the north-west of Ireland.The following figures show the total losses incurred in these three areas during the two months April and May and the month of June : [649-11]

No accurate information is available on this point, except that the tonnage on the Fastnet approach route has probably decreased during J une, owing to the commencement of the convoy system in the North Atlantic. The increased losses in the Scilly area may be partly due to a noticeable increase of submarines in the Bay of Biscay, with the object no doubt of intercepting American transports.Minor Operations.A large number of mine nets, covering a total distance of 20 miles, was successfully laid in the vicinity of Zeebrugge and Ostend towards the end of July. The enemy destroyers attempted to interfere with the operation, but were easily driven off. A patrol of destroyers by day and coastal motor-boats by night is now established and will be maintained, weather permitting. It is supported by one Jo-inch-gun monitor, one cruiser, and two small monitors.The usual bombing raids have- been carried out by machines of the Royal Naval Air Service operating from Dunkirk.. Deep minelaying has been continued in the English Channel during the week.  .Light cruisers and destroyers from the Grand Fleet carried out a sweep towards the Danish coast during the week without incident.Summary of Naval Intelligence.Movements of German Merchant Ships.To and from Norwegian ports : Arrived, 1.0.   Left, 9. To and from Rotterdam : Arrived, nil.   Left, 5.Steamship &quot;Silvia&quot; arrived Stavanger August 3rd, 1917, and discharged 800 barrels of petroleum, and proceeded same day with coal for Bergen.The Russian Government protested strongly to Norwegian Government about this ship the last time she was at Vardo, saying that, although she was being used to supply kerosene to Norway, she was also a submarine supply ship.
Russia.Baltic.-Kronstadt after a spell of quiet is again rather disturbed. The new Commandant has aroused opposition through too resolute methods, and has been relieved on account of ill-health. The situation in the Baltic Fleet generally has improved, but should there be a necessity for choice between the non-Socialist parties and those represented by the Coiincil of Soldiers&apos; and Workmens Delegates, it will undoubtedly side with the latter.Black Sea-Captain Nemitz, late Commodore of T.B.D.&apos;s, Black Sea Fleet, has heen promoted to Rear-Admiral, and appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Black Sea Fleet, instead of Admiral Lukin, who temporarily held command after the retirement of Admiral Kolchak.Siceden.An agent reports on good authority that 800 machine guns arrived in Sweden during the months of June and July from the Skoda Works. This makes a total of 4,300 received since the outbreak of war.Norway.In the case of the steamship &quot; Thorunn,&quot; which has now been settled between the Norwegian and German Governments by her release, the question of capture inside territorial waters was considered. The old claim of Norway to a 4-mile limit was again raised, but was not followed up. The Norwegian &quot; Shipping News &quot; considers that the agreement reached is a proof of uujusti liable weakness on the part of the Norwegian Government, who did not sufficiently press their case.Turkey.In July coal continued to come in regularly to Constantinople from Zunguldak in the Black Sea. The traffic appears to be carried on regularly in small steamers and sailing craft, and seems to have increased lately owing to the slack blockade by the Russian Black Sea Fleet. The price of coal in Constantinople is still high, but this may be due to profiteering, as it is well known that the Young Turks who control the trade are lining their pockets.Air Information.The following is an extract from a report on the damage caused by the air raids on St. Denis Westrem at the end of May and the beginning of June : &quot; When the Aviation Park at St. Denis Westrem was bombed towards the end of May, two sheds were destroyed, and three or four days afterwards one shed was burnt and four aviators killed. At the same time the largest of the gas reservoirs belonging to the Ghent Gasworks Company was blown up. Nobody was killed. At the beginning of June the Hotel Universal, Rue de la Station, was hit, several officers and a few Belgians being killed and wounded. The bombardment of Ghent St. Pierre Station at the beginning of June did not do much damage, a few waggons being destroyed and a few railway employes being killed. The Imperial train with the Kaiser and all his staff was also bombed at the beginning of June, but no one was hit. The Kaiser got off at Ghent St. Pierre, and was taken to Ghent in a car.&quot;Naval Staff, August 8, 1917.o
