4      oSECRET,OPERATIONS,From:-   General Ball arc!, Roumania. To: -       CcI,G .S.rB.A. 683     6th August, 1917, 4,50 p,m.It was decided on August 3rd that the Court and the Government and diplomatic Corps should be evacuated, at once.But on the 5th better news caused a postponement and the subject is much under discussion*The diplomatists are, naturally, strongly opposed to an evacuation until the last possible moment as the political effect would be very bad,I have urged from the military point of view that heavy baggage and non (one group undecipherable) baggage and non military stores also superfluous Individuals should be sent off now.     This move need not involve any political effect *This would leave the Court &amp;c, with only light baggage and they could be sent off in a ? couple of trains at the last moment if necessary*There may be serious congestion at the last unless the preliminary move is begun at once.Probable orders ? will then be sent to the rear-guard to hold out in order to let trains get away and the result would be a serious military disaster.As there is only one railway bridge across the Pruth at Umgeni all evacuation by rail must go that way and an accident to that bridge would entail heavy loss.The British Minister and General Decondolle and General Berthelot agree with the above in principle but it is difficult to get definite orders issued,The dual control by Roumania and Russia ? complicates operations and ordinary precautions are looked upon as signs of pessimism and panic-     But as the question has been ?opened I hope that some method may be evolved and that a central authority-will be appointed.
