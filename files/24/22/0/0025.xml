"..... suggests that, wherever possible, the Trades "Council should take the initiative."

The Secretary for the Glasgow district is Mr. William Shaw, Secretary, Glasgow Trades Council. The Provisional Committee include George Lansbury, J.Ramsay Macdonald, Tom Quelch, Robert Smillie, Philip Snowden, W.C. Anderson, F.W. Jowett, etc.

The Magistrates, on receipt of the Chief Constable&apos;s recommendation, held a meeting, which the Lord Provost and the Sheriff of Lanarkshire also attended, and as the result the Town Clerk, with the concurrence of all those authorities, was instructed to ask the Secretary for Scotland to authorise the Lord Provost and the Chief Constable jointly, in terms of Regulation 9A of the Defence of the Realm Regulations, to issue an Order prohibiting the holding of the proposed meeting. The reasons prompting the request are summarised in a telegram telegram received from the Town Clerk, to the effect that "there is apprehension of grave "disorder arising because of disturbances at previous "meetings of similar character in Glasgow, and of "disturbances in other towns arising out of meetings of the "Workers&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Councils. A counter demonstration "has been threatened, if the meettug is allowed to proceed. "At least 20O police would require to be a? allocated "to afford protection and prevent disorder, and this, in "view of the large reduction, amounting to early one "half of the available police force, would be an undue "demand.  The holding of the meeting on a Saturday "afternoon, when the streets are ?rowited and all the "police are required for ordinary duty throughout the "city, greatly adds to the difficulty. At a meeting "held in Charing Cross Halls, Glasgow, on 12th April, "Addressed by Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, disorder actually "occurred, and the presence of a large body of police "was required to restore and maintain order." The

Chief


Chief Constable states his opinion to be that the holding of the proposed meeting would be at the risk of grave disorder, which the police, in their present depleted state, would be unable to prevent.

The Lord Advocate saw the Sheriff in Edinburgh yesterday, and the Sheriff told him that, in the circumstances, he saw no alternative but to concur in the Chief Constable&apos;s request.

On the other hand the Secretary to the Glasgow Trades Council represents to the Secretary for Scotland that he had heard of the Magistrates&apos; representation. He represents that each delegate to the conference is admitted by presenting a delegate&apos;s credential card at the entrance to the hall. "The public are not admitted, so "that the conference is strictly private. In view of the "decision of the Magistrates I have to request you to "direct that as this conference is strictly private, it "must not he prohibited".

........

From the point of view of public order, there would seem to be no doubt that a case has arisen for the exercise of the powers conferred on the Secretary for Scotland by Defence of the Realm Regulation 9A, and if no other  considerations were present, I should be prepared to grant the authority asked for, i.e. to authorise the Lord Provost and Chief Constable to make an order prohibiting the holding of tho meeting, and leaving it to them to exorcise the authority, if they remain of the opinion which has been communicated to me.

I understand, however, that similar applications have reached the Home Secretary from one or two centres in England, and it is doubtless desirable that any action taken should, in similar circumstances, be the same on both sides of the Border.

There
There.arc, of -course, further considerations of policy involved, and it therefore^^eeeme-expediejit that tlie matter should he brought before the War Cabinet, with a view to a decision being reae&amp;ed.jsaiclL.Jtf1^^ account of the whole circumstances of the case.(Signed) RjMUMRO.-Scottish Office,.Monday, 6th August, 1917,
