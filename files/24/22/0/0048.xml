CaJI. . X,,1INTERNATIOHAL   SO CIALISTIntelligence Bureau, Department of Information.CONFERENCE   at   STOCKHOLM.In a report dated June 18th, the history of the Stockholm Conference was fol^wed as far as the oublication of the German Me-joritarian Socialist Delegation^ programme on June 14th.    The present report carries the record on to the end of July. (I)   RECAPITULATION.The original invitation to the Congress was issued, in April, by the leaders of the Dutoh section of the International, who had been co-opted on to the Central Executive (originally consisting of the Belgian lea-ders) since the German invasion of Belgium.The Dutch leaders went to Stockholm towards the end of April. About May 3rd they amalgamated with a Scandinavian Socialist Committee, under the  residency.of Mr. Branting, and with the &quot;technical assistance&quot; of Mr. Camilla Huysmans, the original Belgian general-secretary of the International.During May and June, delegations from the various national sections of the International came to Stockholm, conferred with the  oint Standing Committee, and in most cases published programmes for a peace-settlement.Attempts to -irganiee a rival &quot;Zimmerwaldian&quot; conference (the Zimmerwaldians are extremists who have repudiated the International for its failure to take action against Governments at the outbreak of V/ar and thereafter), and also a conference of Trades Unaions (as opposed to Socialist political parties) both broke down.The following national delegations conferred with Mr. Branting^ committee in the following orderBulgarian &quot;Broad&quot; (i.e. Major!tarisn) socialistsHay 21 - 2.

Prom the beginning of the war we have consistently demanded peace without annexations or indemnities, based upon national s elf-government&quot;.(h) Serbian independence must be restored.    Union of all Serbs din national state^ and Republican Balkan Federation also desirable.(i) &quot;Prussian and Austrian-Poland te* have the same right as Russian Poland to national independence.(jjj   Prolongation of war cannot settle Alsace-Lorraine.     In 1871 it w^s annexed to Germany against the will of the population. A plebiscite is the only solution.     Whichever way the vote turned, it would bring Germany a balance of gain - economic, political end moral.(k)   Political and economic independence of Belgium, according to Bethumn Hcllweg&apos;s promise, is essential.     Reparation for damage done is entirely distinot from a war indemnity.(1)   Condemnation of colonial conquest.   Possession of non-self-governing colonies equivalent to sl^ve-cwning.     Colonies not necessary for industrial development.(m) The International muet be made strong, end national sections must be prepared to fight their governments on behalf of the International Socialist Peace &quot;Programme.
(iv) adjournment of the conference,&quot;Representatives&quot; of Russian Moslemsi Persians, Turks. Indians, Egyptians and Flemish Socialists errived at Stockholm during July, but it is net clear   whether any of them were reoeived in audience by the Staading   Committee.    The Persians and Flemings published, not pro-grammes after consultation with the Committee, but mere ocmmunicationsrto the Press.     The Flemings took an &quot;AcMvist&quot; line, demanding oultural, economic and political autonomy for the Flemish population in Belgium aftor the war, with the alternative of revolution against the Belgian state;   but they were denounced as imposters by the Belgian Socialist Party.     They were in fact, simply oreaturos of the GermanAdministration in Belgium, like the &quot;Bohemians&quot; whom the Austrian ;. siGovernment had sent with the Austrian socialist delegation in May. and the same suspicion attaches to the other delegations which arrived in July.It bed been the original intention of the Standing Sommittee to hold a plenary conference of all the delegations after the preliminary separate audiences were over;   but in the course of June it had become clear that delegations from Britain, Franco and Belgium would not be able to attend, and on Juno 26th the Conference was tasygftre adjourned. On June 88th   the Butch members of the Joint Committee returned to Holland, leaving Branting;   the Scandinavian members, and Huysmans to carry on.(V)   THE RUSSIAN   DELEGATION.A few days after the Dutchmen left Stockholm the Russians errived there: They are delegates from the Petrograd C.W.S.D., and are said to belong to Tserotelli&apos;8 group.    At any rate they are Minimalists, net Maximalists, and therefore not extremists, as the standard goes in Russia now.    They are:-   H. F*r\ich, 3, Goldenberg, W. Rosanov, N. Rousanov, and A. Smirnov.
*-Signed by Huysmans, the Russians, the Scandinavians (headed by Branting), and the Dutch (who presumably telegraphed their assent as they do not appear to have returned fro Stockholm since June 28th)On July 11th these Russian delegates fused themselves with Branting i committee, and on July 13th the new joint body published an invitation to a plenary Socialist Conference at Stockholm on August ISth1-.(VI)   THE JOINT INVITATION of July 13th.(A)   &quot;Proletariats of all nations, unite your forces&quot;(b)   Initiative of present invitation comes from Petrograd C.W.S.D. sanctioned by the All-Russia tf.S.D.Congress,(o)   and supported by the &quot;effective co-operation&quot; of the Dutch-Scandinavian Committee.(d) A Russo-Dutch^ Scandinavian Organisation Bureau for the General Conference (fixed -nrovisionally for August 18th) has been set up, and will rigorously observe the regular procedure of Congresses of the International.(e) Provisional prcgromme.I.   The World War and the International. .2.   The Pe&amp;ce Programme cf tho International.3.     Ways and moans of g&amp;rrying aims into offoct.(f) &quot;The organisers of tho General Conference ere deeply con^iiiO^ed that in order to out an end to the World War, the Internationa: will have to induce all Socialist Parties to refuse all collaboration with their respective Governments, should these decline to make known the objects Justifying a continuation : of hostilities, or formulate in an open or disguised language Imperialistic aims from which they decline to depart.&quot;Under the conviction that your organisation also adheres to these Views and is -prepared to accept the^obTigatldn of&quot; giving effect, without hesitation or deviation, to the general Conference, in as far as they are in conformity with its grin-&quot; olpleSt the Delegation of the Congress of Russia and the Putcl. Scandinavian Committee invite you to take an active part in th* International Sooialist Conference by sending representatives&quot;.N.B. -   The two paragraphs last quoted are the crux of the document.   Vappears that the Russian delegates wished to make acceptance of theobligation proposed in these paragraphs a formal condition of attendencefor the various national groups to whom the invitation was issued.
Branting prevailed on them to modify this, and express it as a ttot a demand.     He saw that *a the latter form the invitation would have no chance of success, and he was personally against the policy of threatening the governments with a breach of ihe party truce in any form at all.    But he had to allow it to pass in the present modified wording, as a ooncessian to the Russians, who regard the threat to &quot;bring pressure on the governments as the most important point in their pre? grartoe, and would probably have broken off relations with him altogether if he bad not compromised.This would bxve alienated the Russians from the International, and thrown them into the arms of the Zimmerwalelian, or Revolutionary party, which lias broken with the International (both Majority and Minority) since the beginning of the war.As it is, the Ziamerwaldiens have refused to o^-operato with tho Russians, as the latter admit with frank regret in a post-script to the invitation of July 13th.(VII)   THE CONFERENCE at PARIS.After July 13th, the Russian Delegates wont on to confer with British Socialist groups in London , and on July 20th tho Executive Committee of the French Scoialist Party invited representatives both of the Russiana and of tho British to confer with them at Paris.Since the first debate over the question of attending the Conference, last May (for which see previous report) there has been a rapproche-Jnont in Franoo between Majority and Minority Socialists, and the Exeoutive acted, on July 20thj0n behalf of both groups.&quot;&apos;Mr. Henderson*and Mr. Ramsay MSodoaald therefore vent over tojParis as representatives, respectively, of the Majority and Minority groups .Mr. Henderson&apos;8 action in attending this conference was fore-shadowed in an interview at Stockholm on July 17th, on his way back from Petrograd to London, in which he insisted on, (a) a preliminary inter-Ally congress (in&amp; (b) a representative British mandate aa the conditions for his apurc-val of a General Congress at Stookholm.
ithin British Socialism.     The Russian delegates were represented by jjM. Ehrlich and Goldenberg (of course tooth kinoritarians), the French by M.M. Renaudel and Longuet - Majoritarian and Minoritarian respec-tively.This conference of six representatives at Paris published a declaration on July 31st:-(a) They endorsed the invitation of July 13th.(b) They fixed the date for September 9th - 16th at Stockholm (or at Christiania if political difficulties made Stockholm impos-sible)(c) They arranged an inter-Ally Congress to precede the General Congress, and to be held in London on August 28th - 29th (This on the motion on the British delegates).(d) There was to be representation throughout for both Majority and Minority groups.(e) &quot;As the success of international action depends on the loyalty with which the resolutions adopted are observed, the national sec-tiohs participating in the Conference undertake, when general decisions have been arrived at, formerly to make known at the meet-lag of the International in what manner they propose to oarry such decisions into effect&quot;The last paragraph is notably weaker that the corresponding clause in the invitation of July 13th.     The delegates are now not to be bound to any specific action in their respective countries, but only to a declaration of what action they intend to take.On the other hand, the German Majoritarian Socialist Party, in answer to the invitation of July 13th, has agreed to take political action in Germany to enforce decisions of the General Conference, if the Csame obligation is aocepted by the Socialist Parties in all belligerent states.
4*The latest probabilities are that he will not resign.v/hether or not the Conference will take place depends on thedecisions of French and British Socialism.     The French SocialistfParty has stated that, iB the French Government refuses passports again they will insist on M. Thomas&apos; resignation, hut there are contradictory reports as to the line taken by M. Thomas himself.     According to one account he refuses to resign;   according to another he agrees to do so, hut warns his party that in that case he will lead the Socialist Wing in France that is against an inconclusive peace.&apos;The attitude of British Socialism will not he known till August 10th, the date fixed for the Congress at Central Hall, Westminster, to decide for or against participation.A.
