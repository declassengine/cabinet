Since the beginning of the war 753,003 pensions, including children^ allowances, have been awarded.Table II shows that last week 48 grants of supplementary pensions and special allowances were made by the Statutory Committee against 52 in the previous week.   The total number to date is 4,248. 2. The number of fresh claims to pension ofdisabled soldiers dealt with by the Awards to Soldiers Branch during the week ending 1st August was 4,500 as compared with 4,900 during the previous week, and 3,600 during the week before.Of the 4,500 cases 2,885 were disposed of by the award of pension, permanent or temporary, 1,605 by the grant of gratuities, and in 10 cases the claims were rejected.    Claims which had previously been rejected under former Warrants were admitted in 438 cases, 399 of the men being granted gratuities and 39 pensions. The total number of claims previously rejected which have been dealt with up to date is 5,871 of which 924 have &quot;been met by the award of pension and 4,947 by gratuities. 3. The work of awarding and authorising paymentof Widows and Dependants pensions in current cases is completely up to date.3,125
3,125 reassessments of dependants pensions were made during the week against 3,002 last week and 3,152 the week before.   There remain 33,402 cases to be dealt with (Appendix I).     The 3,125 cases this week include 991 dependants pensioned under the old Warrant who have bene-fitted by the re-assessment to the average extent of 4/6 a week, and 654 dependant parents whose cases had been settled by a gratuity under the Old Warrant but have now been placed on pension at an average rate of 7/5d a week.    The rest of the 3,125 receive no benefit, their pensions already being equal to pre-war dependanee.As a result of the weekrs re-examinations as to entitlement under the New Warrant, 38 widows not previously helped have been admitted to full pension, and 28 to temporary pension, while in 20 cases it has not been found possible to give help.   15 dependants have been admitted to pension or gratuity and 19 have been finally refused. 143 (widows and dependants) remain to be dealt with out of the original total of 4,523. (Appendix II). 4. The grants made to widows when they are notifiedof their husbands&apos;, deaths are now being issued at the  5 rate approved by the Treasury as a modification of the Royal Warrant. 3,000 authorities for payment ofthese grants in cases of death on or after the 1st July 1916, notified before the 4th April 1917, were sent to the Pension Issue Office.5* The monthly report on forfeitures etc, ofwidows1 pensions gives the following figuresPensions

The Royal Warrant for the retired pay of officersdisabled and for the pensions of the families and relatives of officers deceased and for the pensions of nurses disabled in consequence of the present war, was enacted on the 1stAugust.   For its consideration a Meeting of the Pensionsbeengroup in the House of Commons &amp;a&amp;/held on the previous day called together in consequence of an Article in the issue of the Morning Post of the 26th July which attacked the provisions of the Warrant, especially in their application to Officers of the Regular Army.   The Article is based on a misapprehension of these provisions which the  Sinister proposes to dispel in a letter to the-paper in question.Treatment.7. The nineteenth Meeting of the Committee onInstitutional Treatment in England and Wales was held on 2nd August. The Report is annexed as Appendix III and the principal points dealt with in it are as follows(1) Neurasthenics.      73 patients are at Golders Green and 15 more are going there this week.   The home at Leicester will soon be ready for occupation by 100 patients and Allerton Hall, Leeds, is now being prepared.   Sir John Collie has recommended that Leopards Park, Co. Dublin,if
if used at all should be for men.   He proposes to Inspect various places that have been offered in tho provinces, viz., in Gloucestershire, at Stoke on Trent and at Scriven near Neath.   There are 9 convalescents in camp at Witham.(2) Epileptics.   The conditions of the occupation by soldier and sailor patients of a villa at the Monyhull Colony near Birmingham have been settled with the Guardians.(3) Tuberculous. 27 out of the 32 beds made available by the Metropolitan Asylums Board are occupied.   Steps are to be taken to hurry on the completion cf Brierley Hall, Yorkshire, for 100 advanced cases.   The arrangement, for 30 beds in the Papworth Colony, Cambridgeshire, have been settled.   Further information is to be sought with reference to an offer of accommodation for 50 patients at Stoke on Trent.8. The treatment of tuberculosis in farm coloniescontinues to be pressed on the Minister.   The Secretary of the ;7elsh National Memorial Association and Sir Robert Phillip, Medical Officer for Edinburgh, have both urged -thti   form of treatment.   They point out that the three er four months normally allowed in a Sanatorium are not sufficient to produce a cure and that more extended treat-ment combined with light work is necessary.   A Report on the practicability and the conditions of farm colony treatment has accordingly been requested from Dr. Hartley, the Advisor to the Joint Institutional Committee, and Sir A* Newsholme, Chief Medical Officer of the Local Government Board has also been asked to state his view.9. The second meeting of the Conference referred toin paragraph 8 of last weekrs Report to determine the distinction to be drawn between attributable and non-attributable cases of Insanity was held on the 3rd instantaat the Board of Control and/note of their proceedings is annexed as Appendix IV
10. In order to secure that disabled men on dischargefrom military service should pass with the least possible delay under the care of their panel doctors arrangements were made by the Insurance Commission in the second year of the War whereby men were given a special paper of Instructions telling them how to got into communication with their Local Insurance Committees and Approved Societies. Experience, however, has shown that a large number of men do not pay attention to this leaflet, or mislay it, and in consequence fio not obtain the treatment they should from their panel doctors until a considerable time has elapsed after their discharge.   In order to avoid this, the Ministry in oo-operation with the Insurance Commissioners have arranged that steps should be taken to furrnish the man on discharge with a Medical Voucher, which he can at once present to a pamal doctor in his own place of residence in order to obtain treatment? and the Ministry have undertaken to distribute these cards to each man with the notification that is sent from the Ministry as to the award of pension or gratuity.   Under this arrangement there should be no excuse for delay on the part of the man in obtaining- the necessary treatment.11. The Joint Committees for the East Midland District(comprising Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire, Derbyshire and Rutland) have submitted a comprehensive report on the facilities for treatment and training in their aroa.   The Report shows that the Local Coranittees are making substantial use of the various civil, military and Red Cross Hospitals, and that they are also making genuine efforts to get into touch with all disabled men in their Districts.The Norfolk Local Committee have submitted a well considered scheme for the provision of treatment in theCounty
County which is already in successful operation.  Under this scheme the local panel doctors are invited to furnish a Report in any case which they may consider to require special treatment and the case is then considered by the Medical Members of the Local Committees and by them referred, if necessary, to consultants who have given their services free for the purpose.12. Special sanction was given to the treatmentduring the week ended the 1st. August in 50 cases outside approved general schemes.   In addition, Local Committees reported that 45 cases had been given treatment by them during the same week, but as this was the first in which arrangements under the New Instructions became operative the figures are necessarily far from complete.   It will be of interest to note that in 1,500 cases treatment has been arranged by the Statutory Committee or Ministry directly, that is otherwise than, through a Local Committee, since the 4th April.Training.IS. In view of the near approach of the holidayseason, it has been necessary to ask Local Committees to make special arrangements wherever possible to enable men to continue their training, and it has been suggested that where special classes for disabled men are in operation, they should proceed with a break of not more than a fort-night.   This it has been ascertained can easily be arrange[ without requiring the attendance of the general staff of the technical Institutes.14. The Minister has been impressed with thedesirability of affording disabled men during their perioc of treatment in Hospitals, whether before they are dis-charged from the Army or subsequently, an opportunity of persuing the technical study of the skilled occupationwhich
which they may desire to adopt.    He has accordingly made arrangements with the Central Library for Students, a voluntary organisation which Undertakes to lend books of reference and technical study, for the supply to disabled men in Hospital of any books they may require for the purpose of study, and he has addressed a circular (No 11) to Local Committees informing them of the arrangement.   A copy of the circular and Form of Application are given in Appendix V. 15. The scheme for the training of disabled men in thetrade of Diamond Cutting has made substantial progress, and the first batch of men will commence training next week at the Technical Schools, Brighton, where a special workshop has been fitted up with accommodation for thirty men.   The equipment has been provided by Mr. Oppenheimer at a cost which will amount to  1,500 in respect of machinery and fittings. The men will be trained for a period of six months and the cost of running the Institute will be provided by Mr. Oppenheimer, who undertakes also, at the end of the period of training, to employ the men, if found suitable for a period of three years and to give them a commencing wage of  2 a week, subject to increase in accordance with their efficiency. It is estimated that competent men will be able to earn within three years, anything between  3 and  5 a week.   Special arrangements are also being made for the men to be lodged during their period of training and Mr. Oppenheimer will contribute towards the cost of this. 16. The Swindon War Pensions Committee havingexperionced difficulty in regard to the training of disabled men in certain of the technical trades in the district, owing to a misunderstanding with the Trade Unions concerned, a series of conferences have been held, in which Major Mitchell, the Adviser on Training to the Ministry, has taken part, with the result that a general agreement has now been reached. The
principal terms of agreement are:-(1) That a suitable rate of wages after the manrs training is to be determined by the local Trade Advisory Committee and the rate is to be fixed according to the man!s earning capacity.(2) That where piece-work is customary, disabled soldiers and sailors are to have special conditions arranged with the prospective employer and the Tradts Union concerned.(3) That a guarantee shall be obtained from any prospective employer, that the employment of a disabled soldier or sailor is only intended to fill a vacancy, and shall not be to the detriment or entail the removal of existing employees.(4) That time shall, if possible, be set apart in each day for lessons in literature or some other humanistic study, so that the distabled soldier or sailor can be assisted to a wider life, than the purely economic one.(5) That where possible the Pensions Committee shall see that the disabled soldier or sailor follows his previous occupation.The points raised in the first three of the foregoing proposals will it is apprehended arise in a , substantial number of cases in which employees are members of organised Trade Associations and careful consideration is being given to them by this Ministry in consultation with the Ministry of Labour.The experlenco obtained up to the present time points in the direction of the formation of Local Trade Advisory Committees for the specific trades concerned, srtiich should advise as to the conditions of training and as to the terms of subsequent employment as far as this can be controlled by either the Local War Pensions Committee or the trade concerned.
17. (1) Industrial Training     A comprehensive fortraining disabled men has been submitted by the JointAdvisory (Disablements) Committee for Lancashire andWestacrfcSadV&apos;   The Education Sub-Committee who preparedthe Scheme have adopted the suggestion made to them byMajor Mitchell that they should establish a number ofcentres in Lancashire, at each of which, training in onior two special subjects should be given, in order tolocalise the training in various branches of industrv.Thev suggest that training in general electrical ana...iuonanical engineering  motor mechanics and driving,mechanical drawing and tracing and workshop arithmetic,in Cotton Spinning and weaving, and in clerical work inconnection with the Textile industry qJ-wviM be providedat the uolton Technical School under the auspices of theBolton Education Committee; that training in variousbranches of the building trade, such as that for Clericof Works, Builders&apos; Draughtsmen, Carpenters, Joiners.Cabinet makers and 1*1 Commercial subjects, Boot repairingand Kinematograph operating, should be provided at th*Liverpool Technical Institute (the course in Kinematographwork at the Technical School being taken in conjunctionwith practical work at the Training Centre established bythe Branch Training Committee of the Trade AdvisoryCommittee for the Kinematograph Cndttstry) j. that classesfpr training men as firemen, shotfirers, lampmen, minemachinery attendants, clerks and attendants for the MiningIndustry should be provided at tho Mining College, Wican, thatand/Commercial training should be provided at the Harris Institute, Preston.       After consultation with the Ministry of Labour the scheme has been sanctioned on condition that the fee charged in respect of each course does not, except where a special estliiarke of the cost hasbeen
been submitted, exceeds 7/6d per head per week and on the assumption that the Local Committee have obtained the aeaent of the Local Association of Employers and Workpeople to the s cheme.The Local Committee for Aberdeen who have previously been requested to exercise great caution in the admission of men to the classes in Wireless Telegraphy at the gcottisft Wireless College havo been asked to furnish a report when the first net of men have completed the course in order that the whole question of the desirability of training disabled men in this industry may be reconsidered in connection with the prospects of their obtaining permanent employment when trained.The Local Committee for Lanarkshire have submitted a scheme for training disabled men in the Weaving Industry at a Training Centre proposed to be established by Messrs. MacTTab Limited of Slateford, Midlothian, at Strathaycn which many years ago was the centre of the hand loom weaving Industry in this part of Scotland.     The Local Committee have been asked to furnish further particulars in regard to the scheme.(2) Agricultural Training.   Sanction has been given to tho scheme submitted by the Surrey Local Committee foratraining disabled men in motor tractor work at the School recently established by the Board of Agriculture at WoldinghanA report has been received from the Lancashire Local Committee which shows that the schemo of training at the Hulton Farm School is a marked success.   All the available accommodation has now been taken up, and the number of candidates exceeds that of the vacancies epen toathem. I
13.      Sanction has been given to the training of 13 individual men as shown in Appendix VI, and in 62 other cases further information has been requested or modifications&apos;-lave been suggested.Organisation.19. A statement of the proceedings of the StatutoryCommittee for the week ending 1st August, 1917 is annexed (Appendix \fljf).   The reports of the Inspectors of Accounts show that the work of the Local Committees at Preston and Bolton is well done.   The low rents at the former place are reflected in the small amount required for supplementary allowances;   from Birmingham on the other hand complaints as to the insufficiency of these allowances to meet the high rents have recently come to the Minister.   The work of the Llanelly District Committee is suffering from the quarrel between the Carmarthenshire County Council and the Borough of Leianelly due to the latter claiming and the former opposing (on apparently reasonable grounds) a separate Local Committeej steps are being taken by the Minister to terminate this quarrel.   Generally, unsatisfactory reports have been received on the work of the Sub-Committees in Monmouth but improvement is promised in some cases.   In Irelard , one more County has formed a Local Committee.   The defaulters in this respect are now Donegal, Tipperary, South Riding and Longjjtird, and the Committee for Mayo is also not yet at work. 20. In last week&apos;s report it was stated in errorthat the Naval and Military War Pensions etc, (Transfer of Powers Bill) was road a third time in the House of Lords on the 26th July.   The third reading did not take- place till the 2nd instant, and the amendments introduced by the Government in the Lords have still to be dealt&apos; with in theCommons.
Commons.     It has boon decided that the day to be appointed by order in Council for the dissolution of the Statutory Committee should be the 1st September. 21. The estimates of administrative expenditure ofLocal Committees prepared in accordance with the ITaval and Military War Pensions etc., (Administrative Expenses) Act, 1917, for the period between the date of the passing of that Act (May.17th) until the end of the current financial year have all been submitted by the Local Authorities and are under consideration of the Local Government Board, who are In communication with tho Ministry on various relevant points.Staff, etc22. Table III shows an addition of 124 to tho staffof the Ministry during the week, 51 having been added to tho Awards to Loldicrs Branch and 68 to the Pensions Issue Office, whore the increase this week and last is not a real one being due to taking on 106 holiday workers to replace girls on their annual leave.   The staff on the books of the Ministry now comprises 170 men and 3,487 women or 3,657 In all.   The statutory Committee employ 109 men and 180 women or 289 In all, bringing up the grand total to 3,946.The daily percentage of absences during the week was 3*7 among tho male and 3*8 among the female staff. 23. During the month in which the staff has increasedfrom 3,328 to 3,487 or by 159, 1 man and 119 women resigned voluntarily, 3 women were dismissed, 2 were transferred and 1 died.   About half tho voluntary resignations appear to occur in tho first month1s service and a certain number of them are suggested on account of evident unsuitability to tho work.   But the number is higher than it should be. 24. Table IV shows that on the staff of the Departmentthere arc now employed in London 50 Officers and men discharged disabled in consequence of the present war.   It is proposed toobtaiixx
obtain corresponding information from other permanent departments.M.H.3r&amp; August 1917.-v.

APPENDIX III.COMMITTEE ON INSTITUTIONAL TREATMENT? The nineteenth meeting of the Committee ms held At Westminster House, Millbank, on Thursday the 2nd August, 1917.1, Present:-   Sir Arthur Griffith Boscawen,The Hon. Arthur Stanley,      and Sir Alfred Pearce Gould,     with Sir John Collie, Sir B. Haward, Dr. H.S. Hartley Dr. Cilub^rt Bonu, Mr. Hore, andMr. Stannard representing Sir Walter Lawrence.2. Neurastheniai:-(a) Leopardstown Park, Ireland.     Sir John  oilio read a report from Colonel Dawson on his vieit of Inspection to the property.     The Home was originally offered for officers hut he suggested that if it was accepted it should be used for men.   Sir John Collie thought that this Committee should wait until it was satisfied that a Home for Neurasthenics was necessary for the South of Ireland and then it should be used for men.   He would again communicate with Colonel Dawson and report to the Committee at aa later stage.     It was agreed that If used at all the home should be one for men.(b) The difficulty of obtaining suitable Medical Officers for Neurasthenia homes was discussed.   Sir John Cellie said that Medical men lander 41 were claimed by the Army Authorities aid new men over 41 were not of much use for this particular class of work.     He could occasionally get poung men from Ireland but they required training.     Major Rons of the MaghuliInstitution had been very successful in training young men there.   He suggested that young men should be given three months training and a fixed salary be paid to them during that period part of it to be re-talned and paid when they took up their duties.   He suggested 3. 3. 0 per week and board for three months. .   He regarded this question of the training of young Medical men as urgent and of the utmost importance.Sir
Sir Arthur Bosoawen said that this question wasone for the Ministry rather than the Institutional Committee. He asked Sir John Cellle to draw up a minute and he would present it to the Minister and disouss the whole matter with him.could be trained at Wandswerth on the lines Sir John Collie wanted.     He would look into the matter.(e)     Leicester Frith, Leicester.     Sir John Collie reported his correspondence with the Mayor of Leicester relative to this Institution.    The authorities were anxious to establish the Home as soon as poiiible and it would soon be ready for occupation.    The Leicester Committee would manage the Institution.     This Committee would provide the Mc dical Officer and three of the Physicians of the Leioester Hospital had promised to go on the staff.      One hundred patients would be aooommodated and the building did not require much structural alterations.(d) Sir John Collie report had had some correspond-emeo with Mr. -Low of the British Red Cross Society Liverpool, relative to the establishment of homes for Neurasthenics and that he had informed him of the Committees decision that Homes of this nature must have accommodation for fifty patients at - -least, otherwise the Committee would not officially reoognise them.(e) Highfield - Oolders Green.    Sir John Collie reported that at the present time there were 73 patients in the Institution and 15 mem being admitted this week.    A few men had been discharged during the past fortnight as too ^satisfactory to deal with.     They were now altering the whole system at Golders Green and admitting the worst of the oases presented.     One of the Medical Staff of the Malda ValeSir Alfred Pearee Gould said that one young DooterHospital
j&amp;xtfprtal whs&quot; attending at the Home of Recovery three days-a week and examining each patient as he was admitted. He had had an interview with the Director General and pro-pounded a scheme to him which was now being considered by the Adjutant General. The report was read to the meeting and Sir John Collie said he would report the result at a subsequent meeting.(f) Sir John Collie handed in written reports of his visits to and inspection of (1) No.13 Crescent Wood -Upper Sydenham (2) Summers Court, Shooters Hill and (3) Gunnerabury High School, Chiswick all of which he described as unsuitable for the Committees purpose.Essex House, Barnes he also reported as unsuitable.(g) Wltham Camp,   Essex.   Sir John Collie reported .v:that there were nine convalescent patients there at present . and that permission had been obtained from the MilitaryAuthorities to fill in the trenches which had been dug in the neighbourhood.(h) Sir Arthur Boscawen explained the offha- ay Mr. Morgan of Abbotsford House, Gloucestershire.     Mr. Morgan ppoposed to charge only a nominal rent  1 for hhe first year and subsequently something between fifty and a hundred pounds.      There were 4 acres of ground included in the offer but if required more than 100 acres oould be made available.     Sir John Collie said he was going;down to inspect the property on Friday week.   He thought It could be made a Convalescent Home for Neurastheniceoases andthus relieve the strain on the original treatment Institutions.(i) Allerton Hall, Leeds.     Mr. Stanley said that this Home was now being prepared for occupation.   It was 2$ miles out of Leeds and suitable in every way.      3,300 was required to put it in order for the Committees require-ments.   He though  650 a fair rental but tho Commit i,ee wasobtaining
obtaining it for  550.   Mr. ferrif had been down and inspected it on behalf of the Red Cross and Sir John Collie recommended the place as an admirable ene which would accommodate at least 100&apos;patients.     It was resolved that the Institution be taken over.   The Red Gross to pay the rent for 3 years and In the meantime to go en with the adjustment of the legal questions in connection with the occupation.   The working of equipping the Institution would be carried out under the management of the ieeds Infirmary.     Sir Arthur Boscawen said he had disoussed and was at present considering the financial question and would report to a subsequent meeting.(j)   Stoke-on-Trent.     Sir Arthur Boscawen reported that he had had an interview with the Town Clerk of Stoke-on-Trent relative to the offer of a home for Neurasthenics which would be given and equipped free.   The Committee agreed that Sir John Collie should inspect the property and report later.(k)   Scrlven - near $bath.     Sir Arthur Boscawen reported in connection with this Home.      He read ar:letter from Mr. Stephens to Mr. Marley Samson in reference to it.   Mr. Samson had told him that It was a suitable place and was near the large Military Hospital at IHath the staff of whieh could undertake   the management * It could be obtained at a small rental and would accommodate 60 beds.     Sir John Collie was requested to inspect and report.(1)   Highfield. Golders Green.   Mr . Stanley said that arrangements had had to be made In connection with a fire escape.   The Committee sanctioned the payment of  539. 12. 9. and the calling of competitive tenders for the other work which he outlined.Sir John Collie read a ^letter from Mr. Burleigh relative to salaries in connection with tke Intensive french. Culture soheme and payment of fares to patients.     The papers were handed to Mr. Hore to deal with and reply.(m)
(m)   Enlargement of Golden Green:   Sir John Gollie reported that there were not any placet available as a suitable home for the nurses near the Institution.   There was our house within 5 minutes walk and he would inspect it and report.(n)   Letter from Mr. Burleigh re payment of Pensions and allowances to patients at Golders Green.   Sir Arthur Boscawen explained the position.   He had seen Mr. Coles with reference to it and the matter is now being straightened out. 3* Monyhull.Letter dated 26th July from the Clerk to the Birmingham Guardians was read setting out proposed terms and conditions of oooupatlon of villa at the Colony.    A general dlssusslon took plase on the financial position and also on the question of distinction from pauper patients.    It was resolved that a formal agreement was not neoossary but that a letter embodying the terms of the arrangement would be sufficient. The Committee agreed to the scheme  mnd the matter was left in the hands of Sir A. Boscawen and Mr. Stanley to complete. 4. Lonsdaie House.Mr. Stanley referred to necessary work at Lonsdaie House which should be done.   The cost would be about  939 of which the Committee would have to ^ftunfr  500 and the balance would be provided elsewhere.     It was agreed to sanction tho payment.5. Tuberculosis.Dr. H.S.Hartley reported that the Metropolitan Asylum Board had 32 beds available of which 27 were occupied. Standard Pavilion.     There had not been any answer to letters re this.   Mr. Hore agreed to write with reference to the matter,Brierley Hall.       Dr. Hartley-said that If we could getpriority

AFEETNDXX IVNote on Second Meeting of Conference on distortion between attributable and non-attributable cases of Lunacy held on August 5rd.I.       There were present the same representatives of the Departments concerned as on the previous occasion. 2,       The Conference, proceeding   on the lines previously adopted, considered the various forms and varieties of Insanity with a view to guIdL ng Medical Boards and the Ministry in determining those cases   of insanity which . could not be considered as eligible fcr pension.    The Conference agreed to the following:-(a) Forms and varieties of mental disorder officially recognised f^r statistical purposes are about 26 in number. The differential diagnosis between certain of them is by no means an easy matter even in the hands of experts.    It is suggested therefore that in deciding whether a manfs insanity has been caused or aggravated by service a diagnosis of the form or variety of mental disorder is of assistance in only a limited number of cases and that the majority of these forms need not concern those responsible for the decision,(b) &quot;Congenital mental deficiency&quot; appearing on a Medical Report is an insufficient term to enable the case to be adequately considered as it includes feeble-minded casep of higher grade,     Ri h grac&amp;feeble-mindedness (that is        feeble minded cases of moderate degree) though recognised medically as a predisposing cause of insanity should be ignored in assessing a case for pension purposes,(c) Insanity associated with Epilepsy,    Epilepsyprior to enlistment ought not to be raised against theeligibility for pension on account gf insanity arisingafter enlistment, unless the conditions of service weresuch
such as   to afford no evidence of aggravation.(d)   Alcoholism,;        The following factors should be taken as unfavourable to a man*s claim to, pension, namely,- Definite evidence that,(1) prior to enlistment he had been mentally affected, (including Delirium Tremens) as a result of Alcoholic excess; ^r (2) heavy drinking for some years prior tc joining the Colours or during Service; The following factors should not necessarily be ragarded as unfavourable to a raan&apos;s claim to pension, namely,-Alcoholism, following serious physical or mental exhaustion, head injury, concussion, sun-stroke, debilitating illness,      fever, the result of ?/ar Service, whether in the field or in the training camp.
Circular No. 11.MINISTRY OF PENSIONS,Secretary&apos;s Office,Westminster House, MILLBANK, - LONDON, S.W. 1. ilLOAN OF TECHNICAL LITERATURE TO  WOUNDED  IN  HOSPITALS.Sir,- I am directed by the Minister of Pensions to state that he has been impressed with the desirability of affording wounded men, during their stay in Military and other Hospitals, an opportunity of pursuing the study, so far as their condition permits, of the theoretical and technical side of any skilled occupation which they may, after discharge, desire to undertake. With this view he has approached the Managing Body of the Central Library for Students, 20, Tavistock Square, W.G., which has been formed for the purpose of supplying students&apos; books of reference and other works of technical instruction. The Committee of Management have kindly consented to meet Mr. Barnes&apos; suggestion on the following conditions: (1) A loan of books will be made only through the accredited Hospital Visitors appointed by Local Committees, and on a Visitors recom-mendation.(2) Where a man in hospital desires, the loan of a technical book, and the Visitor considers that he may suitably be provided with it, one of the accompanying Forms of Application should be filled up by the man and cpunter-signed by the Hospital Visitor.(3) The book will be sent by post to the Hospital Visitor, addressed to the Hospital, and the, Visitor will be asked to be responsible for its safe return to the Library on the man&apos;s discharge from the Hospital. The Minister of Pensions will be responsible for the cost of postage both ways. If any book is lost or damaged the fact should be reported to the Librarian. In any case where the man is unable to quote the title of the book he requires, the nature and branch of the subject to. W be studied should beindicated and whether an elementary or advanced text book is required. The Librarian of the Central Library will then forward the book which he considers most suitable to the case, or alist of books from which a selection can be made.\The Minister of Pensions will be obliged if your Committee will bring this to the notice of your Hospital Visitors and will notify him of the names of those Visitors who will be willing &apos;to undertake to arrange for the loan of books on the above terms and of the Hospitals and other Military Institutions visited by them.I am,Your obedient Servant,Secretary. .The Secretary or ClerkLocal War.

APPEND 3Xifc*&quot;33XFAR PENSIONS, &amp;C, STATUTORY COMLTITTiiiE.REPORT TO THE PENSIONS MINISTER For week ended 1st August 1917.ORGANIZATION BRANCH.Extracts from Reports of Inspectors of Accounts.PRESTON LOCAL COMMITTEE.The work is reported to be efficiently done here. Payments are moderate for the size of the town. The small amount for Supplementary Allowances is accounted for by low rents.BOLTON LOCAL COMMITTEE.The work is conducted from a central office and the visiting is done voluntarily by the Guild of Help.     The workers are largely voluntary but there is feeling that more staff will be needed to cope with the constantly increasing work.One of the main difficulties with this Local Committee is the shortage of institutions to which men can be sent for treatment.Bolton is a to?/n with a considerable variety of trades so that there are no difficulties as regards training.     Hen from other parts of Lancashire are shortly to be sent to this town for training purposes.The work is well done and the Regulations rigidlyfollowed.CARMARTHENSHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE.Llanelly District Committee.There seems to be great difficulty in getting this Committee together, though numbering 27, even a quorum of 5 is diffioult to get together to form a meeting.  * The Mayor has not attended a meeting since March and declines to do anything unless the claims of Llanelly as a separate Local Committee are   acceded to.     This District Committee looks
upon it as an indignity that the County Local Committee insist on the books statements being sent to Carmarthen for audit.COUNTY OF MOHMOUTK LOCAL COMMITTEE,Chepstow Sub-Committee,On the occasion of the Inspectors last visit, he pointed out various irregularities and asked that all cases should be reviewed.     This has been done with the result that many payments have been stopped.     The Seoretaryfs office is in the Workhouse and at the time of his call the Guardians were sitting.     This has its objections.Llantarnan Sub-Committee.Since the Inspector&apos;s last visit, the Committee have reviewed the whole of the cases and re-assessed the payments. Both organization and administration are weak but the Committee can be credited with discrimination and care in administering the Regulations.     The work generally is progressing smoothly.Discharge notifications come in from Newport hut there is no register and no instructions.     The Secretary appears quite ignorant of the facilities offered for the after-care of discharged men.     There are about 100 in the district and with the exception of the totally disabled, all are working.Rhymney Sub-Committee,Return visit paid by Inspector on July 26th,     Still no improvement in organization.     The situation is, however, saved by the existence of a local fund.Nothing seems to be known of the Disablement Register. Nearly all discharged men are at work but several are waiting institutional treatment.Bedwas Sub-Qommittee.In response to the Committee&apos;s request, the Inspector attended their, meeting on July 23rd when the Agenda was described as the first meeting of the Sub-Committee.     Previous-ly&apos; it appears the work had been carried out by the f*ld Ward Committees of the Prince of Wales Fund.The Inspector was agreeably surprised to find how readily they accepted his suggestions both as to organization and administration.-     Labour is very strongly represented on the Committee, but the Labour Members were most reasonable and cordially thanked the Inspector for attending.As regards disabled men, nothing has been done. There is no Register and no papers, only a mass of notifications.Information has been* received from the County Kilkenny Local Committee that they propose to take up their Statutory duties on the 1st August.
