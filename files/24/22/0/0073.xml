)/ES/516.n i  ilSUMMARY OF BLOCKADE IITFOR1A.TIOZlug. 5-9. 1917.3ERMANY. The Mark Exchange shows no perceptible improvementeither in Switzerland or in Sweden.   On the Stockholm Exchange the rate fell to 41.50 on Aug 3rd; &quot;by Aug. 7th it had recovered to 42.25, the rate of a week ago.   On Aug. 7th the Swiss Mark rate stood at 63.30 a slightly lowerlevel than that at the end of July.Cold and Silver Ornaments are being openly requisition-ed in Germany to replenish the metallic reserves of the Reiehs Bank.In Switzerland the German Government is endeavouring to borrow 40 million frs. a month for a period of nine months, Negotiations are also reported from Holland for a German loan, in Dutch currency, on a smaller scale.RESTRICTION OF ENEMY SUPPLIES.     E.^.Government have furnished SirC. Spring Rice with figures as to the expenses and liabilities which we have incurred in purchasing certain neutral sup-plies which would otherwise have reached our enemies.   The grand total of expenditure and liabilities is given as  37,000,000 of which it is estimated that  22,000,000 must be written off as a loss.   The heaviest item of expenditure has been Norwegian ^ish (upwards of  21,000,000).   Dutch Fish has cost us between  1,000;,000 and  2,000,000, and Dutch Agricultural Produce  3,500,000.DENMARK.        With reference to the Danish proposals noted last week, H.M. Government have informed the Danish Government that we are not prepared to facilitate the importation of any fodder stuffs into Denmark.   We are however, prepared to relieve the Danish Government of their contracts for Oilcake and
2972.Maize in the United States and the Argentine.   We have pro-tested against the proposal to give Germany half of the Danish exports of Butter, Bacon and Eggs, and against the refusal to limit the export of Eorses and Cattle to Germany. The Danish Government say that, in the past, they were only able to defend their action in giving us a relatively large proportion of the exports of Butter, Bacon and Eggs on the ground that we were giving them facilities for the importation of Fo-f der stuffs.  - The facilities being with-dravm, they cannot resist the demand of Germany for an equeJ. share in these exports.The Danish Government have agreed to limit the ex-ports of Fish to Germany to 2,1Q0 tons a month on the unfler-s tan ding that we shall give facilities for the import of Mineral Oils.   They reluctantly accept the condition r/hieh we attach to fishing supplies of British origin, namely that these shall not be used in any way for the advantage of Germany.The Swedish Government have refused to permit the resumption of the Transit Parcel Post Service to Sussia. The suggestion has been made to H.M.Government that, until this decision is reversed, we should refuse all further facilities to the Swedish liner &quot;Stockholm&quot; which is the pioneer ship of the Swedish-American Passenger Line.   The shares of this line are a most popular investment&quot; in Sweden, and the &quot;Stockholm&quot; is regarded as a national asset.The bases of our proposal for a Swedish Shipping -Agreement are :-
3.298(l)     That we should leave Sweden the ships which she requires for her essential imports.(2)     That we should license the export of coal to Sweden from this country.(3)     That in return we should secure the services of the remainder of the Swedish Mercantile Marine.Sir B. Howard thinks it improbable that the present Swedish Ministry will sanction any general Shipping Agreement.   There will, however, be a General Election in September and if a Coalition or a Liberal Government comes into power after the Election our proposals will have more chance of being considered.BTEBKLMBS. The Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs recentlystates that the creation of the new Central Export Co. would necessitate the revision of our existing agreements with the N.O.T. and the Landbouw Export Bureau.   This statement has caused some anxiety to H.M.Government who are, however, assured that at present there will be no change in the directorate of the Landbouw Export Bureau and that the Central,Export Co. will impede German more than Allied purchases.     The Dutch Government explain that no export of Live Cattle from Holland has yet begun and that they hope to arrange for a satisfactory distri-bution between the belligerents of such exports as may be necessary.We have notified the 1.0,0?. that after October 1st. we can allow no further free imports into Holland of Tobacco, Coffee and Cinchona Bark.   Experience has proved that the free imports of these articles go entirely to our enemies.It is hoped that the recent acute differences betwen
H.M.Government and the 1.0.5.&apos; may shortly he settled. It is the opinion of Sir W., Townley that any diminution of- the influence of the 1.0.2. would only &quot;benefit our enemies.ITALY. There is an acute shortage of Iron and Goal inItaly even for the manufacture of Munitions.     The Italian General Staff recently asked for an increase in the supply of munitions which would have involved the consumption of an extra 40,000 tons of Iron and 40,000 tons of coal.   The Government were unable to conrply with the request of the General Staff, and indeed have been compelled to reduce the output of munitions by one-third.UNITED STATES. It was announced in the Press on Aug. 7th thatthe United States Shipping Board had taken over the construction of all ships no?/ being completed in United States yards.   But the Shipping Board have assured Sir 0. Spring Rice that this step does not affect the question of ownership or the subsequent disposal of the ships.GERMAN SUBMARINE CAMPAIGN.
