3 S C R E T, 1636WAR CAB lira?.PROPOSED TRANSPORT OOICTREEfCE II? LOHPOIt.Copy of.letter gated 4th August 1917, from the ffirst lord of the Admiralty to the&apos; Secretary, War Cabins^4 Copy of Minute ro-ferred to attached.Dear Hankey,I have just receivedtoday (4th August) the Minutes of Wer Cabinet 198 P of the 30th July, in which for the first tine I ses that I em asked to act as Chairman of the Transport Conference.&quot;I note that the United States profer to await the result of tho conference of their own boforo they take part in the London Conference, so that the matter is not at the moment as pressing as it would appear from the Minutes.I would liko, however, to represent to the War Cabinet that this is a matter which really hardly concerns the Adrairalty directly, and that it is almost entirely a matter for the &quot;shipping Con-troll er.I did not know that the Wer Cabinet proposed to select me as- chairmen, but I would like to represent to them   that at the time when I am handing over my old duties to the now Controller, and making myself acquainted with the duties of ray new poet, it io practically impossible for me to afford sufficient time now to do the work which falls to me, and if to that is to be added the Chairmanship of this Conference, it merely means that I shall not be able to do such justice as would otherwise be possible to xs$ functions in the Admiralty.I hope vory much indood that the Vfer Cabinet will be able to find cnother Chtiman. I assume that It is considered that Sir Joseph J&amp;eley would not, on account of his Department being respon-sihlo in an executive sense for tho manipulation of the available tonnage, be such an impartial Chairman as one drawn from another Department and if that is so, I would venture to suggest that if a Chairman with Hiniaterlal rank is necessary, Sir Albert Stanley would be c. vory suitable nominee.It is of course certain that a great many questions will arise as to the tonnage neceesary to maintain the Forces at various strengths in the various arms of Military sorvice, but all this Information is in a ftirly complote form already
%n the Office of the Director General of Movementa &amp; Railways in the War Office, aha would of course be available to whoever was appointed as Chairman.I hope In all the circumstances that the Cabinet will be able to find a substitute; for this work, which I really oahnot afford the time to undertake.Yours sinoereiiv,(Sgd) E GEDDS8.EXTRACT FROM WAR CABINET 198.ROPOSEDIrafsportDEFERENCE If london.(12)   With reference to Paper G.T,1534, namelythe Report of the Allied Naval and Military Conferenoeheld in Paris on July 24th, the War Cabinet were informedthat the proposal to hold a Conference was made by theBritish, with a view of finding out how many United8tates troops could be transported and maintained on theWestern Front.    The present proposals of the UnitedStates Military Authorities, as regards the shippingrequired to maintain their foroe, were looked upon asextremely high.   The War Cabinet felt that we shouldguard, as far as possible, against any attempt on thepart of the Conference to create a shipping pool, itbeing highly undesirable and dangerous that the controlof shipping should be taken out of our hands and placedin the hands of the Allies as a- whole.The War Cabinet decided that:-The Pirst Lord of the Admiralty should beasked to act as Chairman of the Conference,and requested him to issue the Teras of Referenos,and to telegraph such to the United StatesGovernment.
