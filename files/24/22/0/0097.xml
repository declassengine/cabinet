k ORE j. WAR CABIHBT.I. 1697. SHORTAGE OF PETROL AS AfFEOTING TRANSPORT FOR-- HOI1S EgFEHCE FORMATIONS.Note by the Jecretary of at&amp;te for the Colonies.I venture to invite the attention of the War Cabinet to the fact that the present great shortage of petroleum oils renders it imperative that the ^greatest care should be exercised not only in the use of these products for existing purposes, but also in the introduction of new schemes which involve the use of petrol for their carrying out.In this connection I would call attention to a recent reorganization of transport for home defence formations under which motor- was substituted for horse transport involving an extra expenditure of some  ,500,000 gallons of petrol per annum.I venture to submit that this decision should be recon-sidered having regard to the extreme shortage of petrol which not only does not suffice for ordinary civil needs but is even insufficient for existing military and naval requirements.(Intd.)
