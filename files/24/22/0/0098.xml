AIR   BOARD.Report to the Cabinet..153/26, Hth August, 1917,eral Policy.       1.    The results of investigation into the medicalaspects or flying, a subject which was referred to in the Report to the Cabinet dated 10th March, have frequently   . engaged the attention of the Boards     The enquiries which have been conducted by the Committee set up by the Board&apos; have shown the extremely Important Influence of the physiological condition of pilots upon their efficiency, v and it is evident that there is much scope for further research.     The Board have had before them proposals for the reconstitutlon and strengthening of their Medical Research Committee and the better definition of its func-tions, and have asked for the concurrence of the Admiralty and War Office therein.2.     The Report of the 14th April drew attention to the probability of the adoption of a 200 h,p. rotary en-gine in the near future.     The first 200 hfp. Clerget en-gine has now been received and will be flown in the course of the next few weeks.    The first B.R.2., a rotary engine of about the same power but of British design, will also be running early in September and promises well.     Not only does it appear that the problem of a rotary engine of this power has been solved, but the position of the rotary engine from the point of view of supply has been radically altered in the last six months.    It has become, as corn-pared with the other types, the simplest manufacturing proposition, while Its   life, which was only a few months ago far shorter than that of the stationary engine, now -bids fair to exceed the latter.    The effect of these changes on the problem of supply will be important and will react upon the design and supply of aeroplanes. They offer a striking illustration of the rapid evolution of aeronautics and of the complexity of the problem of supply.ply* 1.
