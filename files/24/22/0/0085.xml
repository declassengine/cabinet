Since the date of my last report, 4 convoys have been brought in, consisting of 71 ships of 517,000 tons dead weight, and 11 more are on passage consisting of 172 ships of 1,147,000 tons.   The casualties suffered amongst convoyed ships during the past week are as follows      By enemy action, 1 steamer torpedoed in convoy and sunk.   By marine peril, 1 steamer1 in convoy sunk as the result of striking &quot;a long grey object, possibly a submarine&apos;^ which also sank.  A fast convoy has been arranged from Sierra Leone, and a slow one from Dakar, which will provide two convoys every 18 dgyfs for ships coming up from the South Atlantic.    It is hoped to make a beginning with convoys for outward bound ships in about a weokfs time.Collier tonnage.
