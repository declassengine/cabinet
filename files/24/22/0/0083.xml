G.T. 1685.WAR   CABINET.SUPPLIES CP OATS TO ITALY.319Memorandum by Sir E. ITyldfrore Smith.,T. 1161.to Cabinet 0,Minute 3.On June 23rd I submitted a memorandum to the War Cabinet on the subject of the serious situation regarding the supplies of Oats to Italy in which I pointed out that owing to the excessive shortage, the horses and mules in the Italian Army were being rationed at the rate of 3.3 lbs. per diem, against the normal ration of 11 lbs.At that time there was an anticipated deficit of 15,000 tons for June and 40,000 tons for July.In order to maintain the normal daily ration of 11 lb3. per head, the minimum quantity required to be imported into Italy Is 60,000 tons monthly.The War Cabinet decided that:-(a) The War Office should release the S. S.nLangholm,f then on passage from Dakar with 5,962 tons of Oats,(b) that the Shipping Controller should allot another vessel for the carriage of Oats to Italy at the earliest possible date.As regards (a) the &quot;Langholm&quot; was duly ceded and arrived in Italy on July 25th.As regards (b) the Shipping Controller on the 29th June allocated the S. . &quot;Clan Mackollar&quot; and the S.S. &quot;Clan Cumming&quot; which have - together shipped 10,692 tons.These boats had, however, not arrived in Italy by the end of July.The following are the actual figures of requires ments, arrivals and deficits for the months of June and July:-Requirements *Arrivals.Deficit.June60,00030,874xJuly^60^000 120,00056 p S 93,901e5.52534,67/5.
including the S.S. &quot;Langholm&quot;. showing a total deficit for these two-months- of 34,675 tons,I also suggested to the War Cabinet on the 27th June that it might be possible tc divert to Italy a few cargoes of Oats destined for British civilian requirements.No decision was taken at the Cabinet but the Ministry of Pood were subsequently approached and agreed to cede two steamers, tho S.S. &quot;Uganda&quot; and S.S. &quot;Wearpool&quot;, to carry together 10,400 tons which are due in Italy in mid-September.The following are the actual figures of requirements,expected arrivals, and deficits for the months of Augustand September:-Requirements.     Expected Arrivals.        Deficit.xAugust. 60,000 29,044 30,956.September.     60,000 45.75.0 16,250.120,000 72,794 47,206.xIncluding the S.S.&quot;Clan Mackellar&quot; and &quot;Clan Cumming&quot;,*including the S.S. &quot;Uganda&quot; and &quot;Wearpool&quot;, leaving a deficit of 47,206 tons which with the deficit on the months of June and July of 34,675 makes up a total deficit on the four months ending 30th September of nearly 82,000 tons or 33-        over the period.In reply to a request for the cession of additional steamers the Ministry of Pood notified me on the 19th July that the Pood Controller was prepared to allocate two further cargoes to Italy.   As the result, however, of correspondence between the Food Controller and the   Ship-ping Controller respecting the transference of the two steamers involved,   i am now informed by the Ministry of Food that the Shipping Controller is unable to place this further tonnage at the disposal of the Italian Government.  \ without Instructions from the War Cabinet,In view of the grave situation in Italy as regards the supply of Oats for the Italian Army, and as the Food
10th August,1917Controller is willing to release both the Oats and the ships capable of carrying them which had been allocated to British civilian requirements, I would urge upon the attention of the War Cabinet the extreme desirability of allowing the diversion of the two steamers in   question to the Italian Oats service.It will be seen that even if this step is agreed to the deficit on the Italian requirements will still be of the most serious nature.(sgd) E. Wyldbore Smith
