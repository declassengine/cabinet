SECRET.MINISTEY  OF  FOOD.for Week ending Wednesday, August 1, 1917.PART I-ACTION  TAKEN.Orders under the Defence of the Realm Regulations.The following Orders have been, issued during the week : (1) The Cattle and Meat (Returns) Order 1917, dated July 28, 1917, requires all persons engaged in the production, purchase, sale, distribution, transport, storage, or shipment of any cattle or meat to furnish such particulars as to their businesses as may from time to time be specified by or on behalf of the Food Controller and to verify such particulars in such manner as the Food Controller may direct.(2) The Winter Beans Order 1917, dated July 29, 1917, prohibits the use before December 1 of winter-sown winler beans grown in Great Britain for any purpose other than seed. It also prohibits purchases by or sales to any persons other than such persons as ordinarily deal in such beans and with a view to their being used or re-sold for seed purposes. Buyers must give certificates to sellers identifying each buyer and stating the purpose for which the beans are required. Certificates must be retained by sellers and be open to the inspection of any authorised person.(3) The Sea Fishing (England and Wales) Order, 1917, dated July 30, 1917, empowers the Board of Agriculture to authorise the taking of sea fish in tidal or territorial waters by any method the use of which is now unlawful; and to permit the sale of fish so taken. Any such Order may be made to apply either generally or partially and may contain such conditions and restrictions as appear to be necessary. Fixed nets, stake nets, or other erections may not be used on tidal lands without the consent of the Board of Trade, and a similar consent must be obtained from the Commissioners of Woods and Forests in respect of foreshores under their control.(4) The Fisheries (Ireland) Order, 1917, dated July 30, 1917, empowers the Irish Department of Agriculture to authorise the taking of salmon and sea trout in Ireland by engines other than single rod and line until such date in the year 1917 as the Department may from time to time specify. Any such Order may be made to apply either generally or partially and may contain such conditions and restrictions as appear to be necessary The Order further substitutes the hour of 9.25 p.m. for the hour of 8 p.m. as the limit of day-time for the netting of salmon.(5) The Pickled Herring (Returns) Order, 1917, dated July 31, 1917, requires all persons owning or having power to sell any pickled herrings cured on or after May 1 of any of the scheduled descriptions to furnish to the Food Controller on. or before the 14th August and every calendar month thereafter, particulars of all herrings owned or controlled on the last day of the preceding month, and of all herrings sold or disposed of during that month. Where the stock at the end of any month does not exceed 25 barrels, no return is required.The object of this Order is to procure returns which will keep the -Cured Fish Committee informed as to the position of stocks and sales in connection with their arrangements for the purchase and control of supplies of pickled herrings.(C) The Milk (Returns) Order, 1917, dated July 31, 1917, requires all persons engaged in the production, purchase, sale, distribution, transport, or storage of any milk, to furnish such particulars as to their businesses as may from time to time be specified by or on behalf of the Food Controller and to verify such particulars in such manner as the Food Controller may direct. ...... .:a  (33)3659-1   Pk 1   50  8/17   E &amp; S A
(7) The Flour Mills Order (No. 2), 1917, dated July 31, 1917,...applies the provisions of Regulation 2 GG. to all flour mills in the United Kingdom which use any wheat in the making of flour or meal, and to all pro-vender and grist mills connected with any flour mill as part of the same establishment. Every person having the management or control of a flour mill must forward to the Food Controller before August 7 the names of the proprietors, the postal address of the mill, and the hourly and weekly output capacity. After August 11 no wheat may be ground except at a mill in respect of which such particulars have been furnished. The Order contains similar provisions with regard to records, inspection, and returns as were applied under the preceding Order to flour mills with an output of or over five sacks an hour which have been controlled since April 30.Control of Prices and Supplies.In the House of Lords, on July 26, Lord Rhondda gave the following additional details as to the arrangements in regard to the prices and distribution of essential foodstuffs which were outlined in last week&apos;s Report:- Bread. The retail price of flour will be fixed to correspond with that of bread. The price for British wheat of sound quality will be fixed to average 72s. per quarter for the year, starting at 70s. in the early part of the year and rising to 74s. later. The 1917 Crop (Restriction) Order will not apply to dealings in grain purchased for purposes of seed.Meat. The wholesale carcase price of beef will be the same for the great industrial centres. All wholesale and retail dealers will be registered, and their rates of profit limited by fixing prices. Disobedience to -orders will involve the withdrawal of their right to trade, in addition to purely legal punishment. The fixing of retail price lists for the different joints will, within limits, be settled by the local food committees. Arrangements will be made by which local shortages can be dealt with expeditiously, and, if necessary, limited supplies can be equitably distributed. So far as tonnage facilities permit, every effort will be made to obtain larger and cheaper supplies of feeding stuffs. Mutton and pork prices will be fixed relatively to those fixed for beef.Milk. The retail price of winter milk must necessarily be governed by the promise given last April that unless the prices of feeding-stuffs are in the meantime substantially reduced, the winter contract prices of milk will not be less than Is. 8d. a gallon ; to this must be added the expenses of wholesale and retail distribution, but these expenses will be strictly controlled at each stage.Local Food Committees. The first duties of local food committees will be :  (1) To exercise certain powers in regard to the enforcement of the Food Con-trollei^s Orders;(2) To register the retailers of various foodstuffs, and to recommend necessaryvariations in the scale of prices as fixed by the Food Controller ; (3) To continue and develop the campaign for food economy ; (4) To administer a new scheme of sugar distribution.Sugar - -The scheme of sugar distribution which the local food committees are asked to administer is designed to correct the inequalities of the present system. Arrangements will be made to ration hotels, restaurants, and manufacturers, and every householder will be invited to apply to the food control committee for a card. The registration of this card with a retailer will enable such retailer to apply for sugar to meet his customers requirements. This method will incidentally procure information which may be of great value in adjusting the regulation of other food-stuffs.Tea and Margarine. Lord Rhondda added that he was giving consideration to the question of the prices and supplies of tea and margarine and hoped to announce his policy on those matters shortly.Enforcement of Orders.At a conference with representatives of the Ministry last week the milk producers of Baildon and Yeadon (West Yorkshire) declared that unless they were permitted to charge Is. bd. per gallon, instead of the regulation price of Is. 2d., they would close down their business.   Each producer was thereupon served with an Order prohibiting
him from selling or otherwise disposing of any milking cows. in InY possession at the date of the Order, and requiring him generally to conduct his business in the usual and proper manner and to sell his milk at the regulation price. The result has been satisfactory.Messrs. Little &amp; Ballantyne were prosecuted at Carlisle at the request of this Ministry for wholesale contraventions of the Food Controllers Orders. On the 14 charo-es laid, illegal profits of 2161. were proved by the prosecution, and the offences were^admitted by the defendants. The penalties imposed amounted in all to 80Z. No clearer case of illegal trading in potatoes has hitherto been established, and the fact that on conviction the magistrates merely deprived the offenders of about one-third of their illegal gains is discouraging.The first prosecution for impersonation of an official of the Food Controller^ Department took place at the request of this Ministry on the 25th July. Offences under Regulation 45 G. of the Defence of the Realm Regulations were established. Two defendants were each fined .15/,., and the third was fined hi. for aiding and abetting.PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.The import of wheat, though still high as compared with that of either the earlier part of the year or the corresponding period of last year, is lower than it has been for four weeks.In the paragraphs relating to consumption a preliminary statement is made as to the results shown by the last inquiry into the use and sale of flour by retailers. Consumption decreased in July, but only by a small amount.Imports.The aggregate weight of the principal imported foods was ^00,000 tons last week, though this is 16,000 tons less than in the previous week, and 64,000 tons less than in the week ending July 14th, it is still up to the level reached at the end of June. These differences are mainly attributable to the changes in the weight of wheat and flour imported; last week this amounted to 172,000 tons, and in the two previous weeks to 198,000 tons and 266,000 tons respectively.Large amounts of oats and maize arrived, and more barley than in any recent week except that immediately preceding, the three together account for an increase of 25,300 tons. The variations during the last eight weeks are shown below in tabular form.The quantities of beef and mutton are both greater than in the previous week. 11,325 tons of beef were imported, far more than in previous weeks and more than double the average for the year so far. . .In the case of mutton the arrivals, 4,204 tons, were considerably above the average, but not so great as those of a fortnight before.The increase of bacon and hams over the previous week was slight and the amounts were less than in other recent weeks ; similar remarks apply to butter and margarine.The quantities of sugar imported have varied considerably from week to week : Week endingSugar Imported.Maize, Bailey and Oats.June 9 ,, 16 ,, 23 ,,  30July  714 21 28Tons. 9,900 56,200 23,200 39,000 35,100 18,400 40,800 16,400Tons.37,30028,50017,90047,90037,40048,30052,60077,900Consumption of Meat and Bread.Meat-There was no change in the supplies at the London Central Market, and the quantity is still considerably below the levels of last year.   The average for July
(4,807 tons) is 2 per cent, below that for June, 1917, and 15 per cent, below that for t July, 1916.The supply at Manchester in the week ending July 21st, showed an improve-ment over the previous two weeks, and was only 31 per cent, below the supply in the corresponding week of 1916. That at Liverpool was slightly above last week and 6 per cent, more than last year. At Glasgow the supply continues to fall and was only 363 tons in the week ending July 21st as compared with 547 tons in the corre-sponding week of 1916.The number of fat cattle at 51 markets increased 4 per cent, over the previous week and was 2 per cent, more than last year.Bread and Flour. The preliminary returns for the use and sale of flour by retailers in the four weeks ended July 21st are available. Replies were received up to July 31st from 5,180 retailers using 750,1)00 sacks of flour, and accounting for about one quarter of the whole consumption in the country. The quantity recorded is 2 per cent, less than that used or sold by the same retailers in the previous four weeks (ended June 23rd, 1917), and 5  per cent, less than in the corresponding weeks (ended July 22nd) in 1916.The results are placed in relation to the estimates given in the Report for July 18th, in the following table : Retail Consumption of Bread and Flour (measured as Percentagesof the level of May 1917).Month.	1916.	1917.January -	_	(98)*February	(94)	(103)March	(99)	109April     -	99	104May	100	100June      -	97i	94iJuly	98	92$* The numbers in brackets depend on too few returns for satisfactory comparison.The diminution in consumption has now continued for four months. In July it was 15 per cent, less than in March of this year. Further comments are reserved till the returns have been completed and analysed.Wholesale Prices.The price of barley, after increasing from 69s. 5d. to 72s. Id. in three weeks, dropped to 65s. Id., its May level, in the week July 15th-21st. Other cereals have hardly changed for three months.Rice has risen 9d., returning to 28s. 6cZ., its price throughout May and June.English beef continues to fall, and Argentine beef to rise, till the difference between them is only 12s.
