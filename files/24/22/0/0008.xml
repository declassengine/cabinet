S 1 C R E T. WAR CABINET.G.T. 1608.t LABOUR    DISPUTES.(MI1HJTE by Lord Kilner and Mr. Barnes)By Minute 5. of War Cabinet 191. the Memoranda en Labour Disputes by the Controller of Coal Mines (Paper G.t 14*i) and Sir George Aston.th (Paper G.T. 1444) were reforrdd to us for decision on July 20th.We have had several interviews with Mr. Hodge and Sir George Askwith on behalf of the Ministry of Labour and with/ Kr. Calthrop and Sir Richard Redmayne representing the Coal Controller&apos;s side.     Dr. Macnamara also was present on one occasion, as he is interested in a somewhat similar question affecting the dockyards.     The result of these Conferences leads us to think that the point at issue between the Coal Controller and the Ministry of Labour cannot be decided by itself.     The principle involved is very far reaching and affects several other Departments.We think that a decision of the War Cabinet will have to be taken on the broad question, whether the Ministry of Labour is to be the sole authority to deal with all labour disputes or whether the more or less independent jurisdiction of several Government Departments with regard to such disputes, when arising within their respective spheres of activity, should be maintained or extended.     The Departments chiefly concerned are the Ministry of Munitions, the Admiralty, the Shipping Controller and the Railway Executive Committee. We suggest that the terms of our Reference should be widened and that we should be instructed to hold a Conference of representatives of all the interested parties, with a view to bringing up a general report to the Cabinet, which should focus the whole question and suggest a way of putting an end of the conflict of authority which at present undoubtedly exists in the handling of labour disputes by Government Departments.(Initialled) M.G. 1*;. B.2 Whitehall Gardens. S.W.3rd August. 1017.
