SECRET. Intelligence Bureau.- 1 Department of Information.PRV//013Vfoeklfr Report on Rumania.   XIII August 8th, 1917.THE GENERAL SITUATION.In last week13 report the effects of the Russian defeats in end-ing the Cabinet crisis and rallying the Conservative elements in the country to the temporary Bupport of the Government, were described. Since then the military situation ha3 becdme steadily worse.     The Rumanian authorities are making every preparation for the evaluation of Moldavia, and the transferance of the capital to Kherson or some other town in South V/est Russia.     In view of this situation, party politics in Rumania are for the moment in abeyance.     Whatever offers Germany may make Rumania with a view to a separate peace, it is quits certain that there is no danger of it;   both the Rumanian Government and the Rumanian nation know perfectly well that the future of their aotual, if not their nominal, independence is bound up with the defeat of the Central Powers.    Unpleasant as the prospect of retreat must be - a retreat which has been necessitated not by the defeat of Rumanian troops but by the dlbficle of the Russian Army - responsible elements in the nation are prepared to submit even to this final crowning misfortune, and do not contemplate for a moment any falling away fpora the alliance to which they have committed themselves.     TL.ere is, however, a natural anxiety lest the Russian military authorities should order the evacuation of their troops from Moldavia before there is any absolute necessity for so doing.   Mr. Balfour&apos;s telegram to Sir G. Buchanan of July 28 has called the attention of the Russian Government to the seriousness of any suoh step.Attention has already been callod, in a wire from Sir G. Barolay,
to the discontent of the Rumanian Prime Minister at the merely con-sultive capacity allowed to the Rumanian representative at the paris Conference.   V/ith Mr. Brtftinnu the recognition of Rumania&apos;s claims is not merely a matter of national interest but of personal dignity. He is by no means willing for Rumania to be granted merely the status of Serbia or Greece in relation to the Alliance as a whole.     His own preference, as has been pointed out, is rather for friendship with Staly than for friendship with Serbia, and he has hitherto shown no grasp of the necessity for a firm &amp;llis.ncer between tho Rumanians ?.nd the Jugo-Slavs if the respective ends of both peoples -*.re to be ob-toincd.     It rem&amp;ins to be seen whether the pressure of events will induce Mr. Br&amp;ti&amp;nu to adopt a more friendly attitude towards the Scrbij -v-nd a more conciliatory attitude on the question of the B-^nat. On thia point, &amp;s is known, considerable differences of opinion exist between the Prime Minister and Mr. T&amp;ke Ionescu. Further Light on Internal Politics.A full gregrcmme of tha^Labour Party has now come to hand, though subjected to cenjiojcshlp at the hands of the Government.     Tho pro-gramme is signed by a Committee of fifteen, most of whom are deputies.More importrnt than the statement of the Labour Party, which has already been discussed, are the views of Mr. Take Ionescu, whose speech on the reforms is now available in full pxaa.s reports,     He considered that the necessary reforms might be classified under seven heads:1.     Electoral Reform for the Chamber.2.     Electoral Reform for the Senate.3.     A further distribution of land to the peasants.4.     The solution of the Jewish question.
6.     Administrative Reform.7.     A reconstruction of political parties on an up-to-dateand popular basis. As $o the land question, while exonerating the boer classes of Rumania from the charges of selfishness and oppressiveness so often burled against them in th* past, Mr. Take Ionescu left no doubt that modern conditions necessitated a further distribution of land to the peasants who form the bulk of the population, and the grant of an unconditional universal suffrage to all Rumanian citizens. On the solution of the Jewish question he said:&quot;It was not possible for a sensible man to maintain that weTshould incorporate provinces ?/here we found Sews whom we must make Rumanian citizens, Jews who had fought under the enemy flag, and at the same time that there should remain in our midst, as aliens, our own Jews, some of whom had fought under our own flag. Such a con-oeption no one can admit. So my fourth ooint is that we must solve the Jewish question, give it a solution large and complete, without restrictions, without equivocations, wi&amp;hout reserves, in an honest spirit, as a oountry ought to do which has pledged mts word to itself and has to respect it.&quot;(It is worthy of note that in reply to an interpellation Mr. Brlttianu declared that he associated the Government v/ith Mr. Take Ionescu&apos;s views on the Jewish question.)He also spoke at length on the remaining heads but want of space forbids further reference to these. RUMANIAN IRREDENTA:During the past week ther-e is little news of conditions in tfallachia.     The German authorities claim that the stocks of grain found by tbam in Rumania &quot;exceeded all expectation and are large
9. 8. 17.A.W.A.L.enough to cover the total consumption of the German population and army and those of their allies for one month&quot;.    In a previous re-port we have described some of the efforts made by the occupying armies to increase the output of food in the province.     There is no doubt that economic reasons play some part - if a part subordinate to political considerations - in attracting the German armies to the invasion of Moldavia and Bessarabia.It is stated in the Rumanian press that Professor Virgil Arion, brother of the notorious Germanophil politician, C.C.Arion, v/ho was in Stockholm when Rumania entered the war, is back in Bucarest and has been appointed by the Rumanian authorities Deputy Sinister of Public Instruction.     The announcement of this appointment calls forth great indignation in the Iasi press, and gives some indi-cation of the feeling against those prominent Rumanian politicians who remained behind in Bucarest and are co-operating with the Germans.Another instance of this is the opinion of the press of all parties in Iasi, on the attitude of the ex-Prime Minister, Titu Maiorescu, who died at the beginning of July.     Their verdict is that if Maiorescu had died two&quot;years earlier he would have been looked on as one of the greatest of Rumanian statesmen, but that his Germanophi: attitude during the last year of his life has deprived him for ever of the right to any such title.
