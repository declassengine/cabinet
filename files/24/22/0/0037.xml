i^MIimi LABODB OTRSSTi,/ft T1W1^^In awkward situation has developed during the last few weeks which I should like to bring to the notice of the far Cabinet.Shortly after the War began the two principal Railway Trade Unions met the Railway Companies and entered into a truce for the period of the War.    No new questions were to be raised and the existing conciliation scheme which was about to lapse was to be continued.    Whilst owing to the increased cost of living this agreement has not been kept in its entirety and a war bonus has been given, the Unions have hitherto refrained from raising new questions.    This situation is now altered.    The Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen has put forward a demand for increased wages and other alterations in conditions of labour, and especially a demand for the principle of an 8 hour day.    At about the same time the National Union of Bailwaymen asked that the existing bonus of 15/- a week should be converted into wages.   .Ag regards this latter demand the Railway Executive Committee have agreed with the National Union that the bonus shall be regarded as war wages, that is, for the period of the war the bonus is calculated as wages and overtime is paid on that basis% The cost of the 15/- bonus to the Companies and therefore to the country is about 22 millions per annum; the concession now made will add another 3 millions.    The same concession has been offered to the Associated Society of Engineers and Piremen but they have refused to accept it and their d representatives say that their instructions from theSociety are that whilst they may negotiate as regards
waged and other conditions they have no power to negotiate with regard to the demand for the principle of an 8 hour day, and if this is not conceded, a meeting of the delegates is to be summoned to decide on further action.    It was quite plainly put to us that the probability is that the delegates will decide on a strikeQ    The request, however, is an impossible onso    It is not an honest demand for reduced hours of work, as it is admitted by the Society under present conditions it is impossible to reduce the hours to any appreciable extent.    It is merely an alteration in the hours worked before overtime begins to be worked, that is to say, the 60 hour week now in force would become 48 hours at the ordinary rate and 12 hours at overtime rates of time and a quarter, or in some cases time and a half.    If an increase in wages is the only thing desired there are other ways of obtaining it than by this method.    The Companies have shown no reluctance to negotiate on wages matters, and the very fact that a bonus now amounting to 15/- a week is being given is proof of this.    The 8 hour day was a pre-war demand and should not be considered under .war conditions, thougjh it is a question which might quite fairly be raised by the men when the war is over.    Similar demands have been raised in other industries where the men have sought to vary pre-war conditions in their favour, and I understand that such applications have not been considered.    If a different policy is adopted in the case of the railways very serious difficulties will arise in other industries.    On the railways themselves, the demand, if conceded to the locomotive men, mast apply to other grades as well, and it is estimated by the railway companies that the cost would
approximately amount to 10 millions per annum.Under the present arrangements a driver at 8/-a day in a 60 hour week and working in the week 72 hours would now get 48/- for his normal week*s work plus 15/-war bonus, plus 12 hours overtime at time and a quarter -a total of 75/-.    l&amp;der the concession v&amp;ich tiie National Union of Bailwaymen are prepared to accept he would receive 48/- plus 15/- as before, plus 15 hours overtime calculated on a 10/6d. da , that is 15/9d., making a total of 78/9d,   On the 8 hour day basis he would receive 48/-plus 15/- plus 24 hours overtime at time and a quarter equivalent to 30 hours.   This would make a total if overtime is not calculated on the bonus 93/-, or 102/4-^d. if the bonus is included for the purpose of calculating overtime.A.H.S.BOARD OF fB&amp;DE,7th August, 1917.
