of 24th July. British, (llth August, 1917.)Austria-Hungary and Great Britain.     The short speech of Lord Robert Cecil delivered in the House of Commons on July 24 - in which he pointed out that Austria-Hungary was not the chief enemy and declined to attempt a more precise definition of what the Entente meant by &quot;liberation&quot; as applied to the Slavs of Austria-Hungary - has awakened a considerable echo in the Dual Monarchy, and has given rise to very interesting official declarations.     Of these the most interesting are the leading article in the official Fremdenblatt of the 27th July and a semi-official communique from Vienna (obviously from the Baliplatz) in the Pester Lloyd of the same date.     In both cases Lord Robert Cecils remarks are treated as extremely important owing to their unaggressive character and are contrasted in tone with the declarations &quot;to which we are accustomed from Mr. Lloyd George&quot;.     The greatest possible emphasis is laid upon the alliance with Germany, which is described as &quot;so strongly knit that no human power could loosen it&quot;: and Lord Robert Cecil is assured that his &quot;attempt to drive a wedge in between Austria-Hungary and Germany either proves him to be &quot;the victim of optical delusions&quot;, or is inspired by &quot;an arriere pensie which it is not easy to guess&quot;.     He is further reminded that the principle of loyalty to allies was firmly enounced by himself with still greater force to the Central Powers, and that just as Britain in his words is ready to defer to Prancefs wishes in the matter of Alsace-Lorraine, so Austria-Hungary is ready to defer unconditionally
2 -to Germany in the same question.&quot;To Berlin via Vienna.&quot;   After these very strong affirmations of loyalty to the German alliance the two articles add the assurance that if London should regard Vienna as the shortest road to Berlin, Vienna would not adopt a hostile attitude, &quot;but would consider in accord with Germany the advisability of stepping on to the bridge which England might erect for the purpose of a possible peace by agreement&quot;.     In thi3 connection and before dealing with the concrete overture to Great Britain contained in these articles, it is well to point out that the Berlin organ of the Pan-German agrarians, the Deutsche Tageszeitung, published a very severe criticism of the Fremdenblatt article, and absolutely denied the suggestion &quot;that it was only necessary to break the ice in order to set peace negotiations in motion through the mediation of Austria-Hungary between Britain and Germany&quot;, whereas on the contrary it was obvious that the real war issue is &quot;a life-and-death struggle of the German Empire against the world-coalition led by Anglo-Saxondom&quot;.     It is not the remarks of this extreme Jingo paper and its director, Count Reventlow, to which we desire to draw attention, but to the commentary upon them telegraphed simultaneously with the article itself by the Fremden-blatt correspondent in Berlin to Vienna.     The correspondent may be presumed to have taken a copy of the Deutsche Tagoozeitung to the Vilhelmstrasoe, for he announces &quot;that ho has been assured from an authoritative quarter&quot; that Vienna may rest assured that Reventlow&apos;s views are not those of the majority of the German people nor of official circles, find that &quot;if an opportunity such as the Fremdenblatt seems to see should offer for the Entente seeking a road for peace negotiations to Germany through Austria-Hungary, then of course 3erlin is not merely satisfied but delighted&quot;.     This ia repeated in other words in the KCliiische Zeitung, by its Berlin correspondent, who has very intimate relations Y/ith the V/ilhelmstraose.     His oto,tement is in turn reproduced prominently by the Germanophil press
agencies of Switzerland.     Their cruder method of referring to &quot;the unmistakable advances made by iOngland to Austria&quot; is of course intended to sow alarm and distrust towards Britain and Prance among the Italians, Serbians and Rumanians.Serbian Restoration.     Apart from their hints of Austria&apos;s willingness to act as intermediary, the Premdenblatt and Pester Lloyd express themselves on the Serbian question with a moderation quite unv;onted in Austro-Hungarian official publications.     With regard to Lord Robert Cecii&apos;s demand for the restoration of the Serbian State, a reference to Count Czernin&apos;s declarations regarding &quot;peace without annexation&quot; is treated as a sufficient answer.   Thio, if it means anything, should mean that Austria-Hungary is prepared to accept the territorial status quo as regards Serbia: but here the Deutsche Tageszeitung is very much to the point when it argues that &quot;a restoration of the old Serbia&quot; is out of the question for the simple reason that Bulgaria holds, and intends to hold, the southern portions of Serbia.     There are already numerous signs of alarm and annoyance in Sofia at Count Czerninfs acceptance of the &quot;no annexation formula, and it may be assumed that Vienna, if genuinely disposed to accept the Entente demand for the restoration of Serbia, is really juggling with the phrase and may hope that the Entente would accept Serbia&apos;s old frontiers on the west but at the same time a revision of the nev; frontiers on the east which she acquired in 1913.Meanwhile the idea of &quot;compensations&quot; for Serbia is dismissed &quot;with a smile of pity&quot; and great emphasis is laid on the need for preventing Serbia ever again becoming &quot;a centre of agitation against the existence of tho Monarchy&quot; and &quot;a danger for European peace&quot; -a phrase which bears a dangerous resemblance to the contento of the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum to Serbia and of the ITote to the Powers by which it was sought .to justify that ultimatum.     It is un-necesoary to add that Serbia&apos;s real menace to the Dual Lonarchy was her very existence as a free State, and that that menace will
continue so long as it is possible for the Southern Slavs of Austria and Hungary to compare their own unfree political position v/ith that of Serbia.Finally it is asserted with great emphasis that the &quot;so-called Southern Slav Question&quot; is a purely internal question of Austria-Hungary, who will never recognise its international character.     The Southern Slavs of the Monarchy, it is alleged, are not hindered in their free cultural development, but &quot;we are firmly determined to remain masters in our own house&quot;.     The idea that purely in-ternal questions of the Monarchy could be dealt with at a Peace Congress must be repudiated v/ith all possible firmness.     The right to self-determination is claimed for Austria-Hungary - in other words it is claimed for the State organism and denied for the various races which form its component parts.The ffeue Preie Presse is much less conciliatory, and observes sarcastically that Austria-Hungary cannot distinguish between a &quot;chief enemy&quot; and a &quot;secondary enemy&quot;, but stands and falls with Germany.     It denies most vigorously the possibility of a return to the pre-war relations betv/een Austria-Hungary and Serbia, declares that the former will &quot;never under any circumstances&quot; tolerate the discussion of her internal affairs - e.g. the Southern Slav Question -at a peace congress, and demands a change of policy on the part of England, in the shape of a return to the attitude of Lord Salisbury in 1878 and 1885 in respect to Bosnia and Bulgaria.     The Clerical Reichspo3t even goes so far as to detect signs that England is returning to &quot;the older political tradition which it has abandoned&quot;.Hungarian Opinion.   Equal prominence has been given to Lord Robert Cecil&apos;s speech throughout the whole Hungarian press.     The Jingo Peoti Hirlap contrasted his moderation v/ith Sir E. Carson&apos;s phrase about the Rhine, and assumes that &quot;the English are no longer keen on the liberation of oppressed peoples&quot; and that &quot;one fine day Lord Robert will go on to say that not only in the Southern Slav
Question, but in the question of Democracy also &apos;it would be dangerous to go further1 with the proclamation of general principles. The Daily Mail of Hungary, Az Est, treats him as having &quot;repudiated the impudent and highfalutin Southern Slav and Rumanian designs1? i while the Radical Vilag hails his Conciliatory tone1 as the first sign that the Entente is giving up the war*-aims announced to President Wilson last January.     It lays down as the tv-o necessary preliminaries to a speedy peace, (1) the revision of Entente war-aims, and (2) the democratisation of Central Kurope.      It is interesting to note that the Social Democrat organ, in a leader entitled &quot;London to Berlin via Vienna&quot;, admits that &quot;Separate Peace is a bad formula, and English   diplomacy might learn from the German and Russian examples&quot;.All this shows how closely and anxiously Vienna is follov;ing every expression of opinion in London.     On the 29th  uly the Fremdenblatt affects to discover &quot;remarkable contradictions&quot; in the pronouncements of British Ministers in the previous week.     Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s &quot;high-flying and insulting manner&quot; is contrasted with Lord Robert Cecils &quot;avoidance of anything offensive&quot;, while of Mr.*Bonar Law&apos;s speech they qaote from Uhland&apos;s ballad, &quot;And what he thought v/as blood and what he spoke was vengeance&quot;.     The conclusion drawn by the official Viennese organ in that inside the British Cabinet and &quot;apparently&quot; also the British Parliament there is no unanimity on questions of peace.     The figures of the division on the Macdonald peace motion in the House of Commons, showing only one fourth of the members to be present, are taken as proving far&quot; greater&quot;ambiguity&quot; on the part of the &quot;authoritative English factors&quot; than that   ascribed by Mr. Lloyd George to the German Chancellor.Other important articles could be cited, contrasting kr. Asquith*s moderation with the &quot;old-wives1 tales&quot; of Hr. Bonar Law,
R.W.S.V/. 11/8/17.who, we are told, was always Ha clumsy speaker, stiff and insulting&quot; No peace, we are assured, can ever be expected from men like him or Mr. Lloyd George.The Czech press appears to have been profoundly alarmed at Lord Robert Cecil&apos;s speech: how radically misunderstood it has been is perhaps best illustrated by the comment of the chief Czech Clerical organ, which represents him as having repudiated the Serbs and their aspirations and as warning them that England was not in any way tied as to the form in which Serbia is to be evacuated.     This ingenious theory is propounded as a warning to the Czechs not to rely upon the support of the Entente IIt will be obvious from the above summary that the speeches delivered last Wednesday by Mr. Lloyd George and Lord Robert Cecil at the luncheon to the Serbian Prime Minister will be regarded in Austria as demolishing the whole fabric of speculations and overtures erected by the inspired press b  Vienna upon the basis of recent British pronouncements.
