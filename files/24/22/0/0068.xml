3SECRET.Intelligence Bureau, Department of Information.DBW/014.Weekly Report on Bulgaria, 14. August 10th, 1917.INTERNAL   POLITICS.There is no news to hand this week as to further developments in party politics in Bulgaria. BULGARIA and her ALLIES.In report No. 10 some account was given of the violent contro-versy which broke out in the Bulgarian press over the articles pub-, lished by the German Socialist Deputy, Hermann Wendel,disputing the &quot;Bulgarian&quot;character of the Slav population of Macedonia and ad-vising the Bulgarians to compromise with Serbia over the Macedonian question.     For the last three weeks this controversy has raged fiercely and Wendel has added fuel to the flames by publishing another articles in Vprw&amp;rts, emphasising the points he had pre-viously made.     He states at great length,- quoting numerous au-thorities on the Slav question - that till 50 years ago the Macedonian Slavs were neither Serbs nor Bulgars but something between the two, and that Bulgaria!s claim to the whole of Serbian Macedonia can be .supT)Orted neither by history or equity.     He eoncludes:    &quot;partisans of a violent peace suoh &amp;s the Bulgarians demand are far from con-tonting themselves with the Pelagoni-.\n Plain round Monastir;    they demand for themselves the whole of Macedonia and the Valley of the Mcrava in order to force their way across Albania to the Adriatic Sea.    Nevertheless there i3 a more urgent need for Bulgaria than the possession of Skoplje, Nish and Prizren.     This need is thepeace for which all Europe is yearning and which cannot be put off by the annexationist aims of any of the parties&quot;.     As was to be
2.expected the article has aroused infuriated replies in the Bulgarian press.     Apparently the flrerman Government fears that it was unwise so to alarm Bulgaria, for the Kfllnische Zeitung publishes in this connection a wire from Berlin in which it explains that the Bulgarian publio   has &quot;exaggerated the importance of Deputy V-endel&apos;s articles....     However we consider it once more indispensable to set forth in exact and unequivocal fashion that not only the German Government but also public opinion in Germany,to-day as formerly, understands perfectly v/ell Bulgaria&apos;s great political aim the attain-ment of which has been assured by the heroic Bulgarian army&quot;    Hr. Radoslavov had shown marked uneasiness at the tolerance on the part of the Central Empires of the German Socialist campaign denying the Bulgarian claim to the whole of Macedonia and the Dobruja.     He had alraady pointed out that such agitations cannot uffeot the rights of Bulgaria wfrich are secured to her by solemn treaty with her Allies. It is possible that Tsar Ferdinand who has just arrived at Friedrichs-hafen as the guest of the King of tJtlrttemberg will approach the German Government on this subject.In spite of spasmodic friction between Bulgaria and Germany the rapprochement between the two continues.     On July 7 an inaugural meeting of the new &quot;Society for the development of cultural and economic-links with Germany&quot; took place in Sofia.     A list of the Members of Committee is. instructive.     It inoludes not only the leaders of Government, but well known Nationalist (Geshovis) dcputios.     Prof. Hiletic, Mr. Peyev-Plyachkov,  (ex-Minister of Education and Editor of the Mir), Raehko Hadzharov (ex-Editor of Mir and formerly Minister in London).     The other Opposition parties are also well represented:   the Democratic party by prof. Molov (Deputy and ex-Minister), the Agrarians by Mr. Omarchevski.     These formerly Rossophil parties are continuing their double game of reinsuring themselves with Germany, while at the
s.they favour intrigues for rapprochements with the Entente Powers.     * The news which has come to hand that arrangements arc being made between Turkey and Bulgaria with a view to joint action, should the possibility and desirability of a separate peaoe with the Entente Powers become clear, would not be altogether surprising.     If the news is corroct it would show that the position in both countries and the state of public cpinion is mush worse than is otherwise known. If Bulgaria made peaoe by herself then she might hope to porsuade the Entente into making concessions te her not only of Serbian, Rumanian and Greek territory, but also into offering hor the bribe of Adrianoplo and Eastern Thrace.     If she made pease in conjunction ^ith Turkey she could not look for tho bribe of Turkish territory. Still it might well be thought in Bulgaria   that tho Entente Powers are more likely to consider a joint offer for a separate peace on the part of two powers than the mere single offer from Bulgaria. The- conclusion would be that Bulgaria is so anxious for peace that she is willing to forego many advantages in return for it.     This conclusion, however, does not tally with information frem other sources kb to the state of public opinion and the opinion of political leaders of all parties, who, though they are warm suppor -ers of pcaoo are not, so far as can be seen, contemplating any detachment from the Central Powers.10. 6. 17.
