IN SPIRITDRISFKIffG AS A RgSULT Off - THIS SHORTAGE OF BEER.I.Copy of letter from Lord D&apos;Abernon to the Secretary,&apos; War Cabinet.&quot;&quot;Central Control Board (Liquor -OlrarrYic) Latymer House, 134, Piccadilly., London, W.I..August 10th, 1917. !y dear Hankey,I/enclose a Memorandum by Mr,Butler to read in connection ith my note&apos;of yesterday.Mr.Nevile has read Mr.Butler1s Memorandum and concurs n the views put forward.     He confirms that there is now a large ncrease in the consumption of spirits which is met by the con-umption of accumulated stocks..    When these stocks are exhausted he present discontent will be greatly increased.Yours very truly,. (Signed)   DrA33RN0U.&quot;Brewing and the Resumption of Malting&quot; ( G.T..1654).II.Copy of Memoraa&amp;um by Mr.W.Waters Butler, Chairman of Mitchell1 s and Butler&apos;s r*&quot;Ltd, Birmingham.There is much evidence that the 20$ direct increase to rewers of the permitted output for the year,&apos;bringing the rate ? to 12,500,000 barrels per annum, at present applied to the ^rrent quarter only, is not only insufficient to^meet the demands t consumers, but also that the deficiency is leading to much &quot;ritation among the workers.     Manufacturers are appealing to rewers to Bend more beer to the licensed houses near works, but Ms is impossible under present arrangements, as the limited Entity has to be rationed out over all the licensed properties,  Hants having the. right to claim their proportion based on Msvious supplies.     The free customer finds it practically imposs-^le to get any additional barrelage to his permitted quantity, as U brewers both in urban and rural districts, brewing all they e permitted to brew-have insufficient beer to meet the reqiire-mts of their ovm licensed houses.
; Brewers have made appeals to the Ministry of Food to issue permits for additional barrelage out of the 134^ in-crease which is at the disposal of the Ministry, plus the considerable volume (part of the 20% increase) which Is rep? esented by the barrelage not taken up by such firms as Messrs. Guinness, Bass, Mann &amp; Crossman, and others, who, in consequence 6f the conditions laid down in connection with the permitted increase, have not availed themselves of the option; and thus the barrelage representing 20% of their standard barrelage falls into the hands c-f the Pood Con-troller.In some cases the Ministry has given permits to Manu-facturers to obtain beer from brewers, but how such beer is to be sold in such works, or whether the intention of these manufacturers is to give beer away to their workpeople., is not clear..   There are clubs in some works and the beer might be distributed through them, but if it is the intention of the Ministry of Pood that these manufacturers may sell beer to their workpeople, then the position of the Central Control Board, from the point of view of the Control of the sale of liquor, requires consideration, as up to the present time the policy of the Board has been to grant permits for the sale of 2 per cent beer only.   The Food Controller in granting his permits has also suggested a price for the beer of 48/- net per barrel, which figure is too low for a beer of 56 degrees the maximum gravity at which the beer in question may be brewed, although the gravity of the beer to be supplied   for the given price is not stated.The present shortage is causing an abnormal consumption of beer in a short time when it is on sale In any particular houses, consumers crowding out such houses immediately beer is delivered to them, and demanding the licensee to put it on sale forthwith although not in a fit condition for retailing.. Consumers often decline to part with glasses when empty, but-thrust them forward to be filled again, the licensee in some cases instead of drawing from the usual beer machine filling them from jugs into which beer has already been drawn.. Cases are known In which the struggle for beer has been so great that the licensee and his assistants have found it im-possible to cope with the. crowd, and being utterly prostrated have stopped the supply, which naturally has been keenly resented by the people in the house.   It is not difficult to realise that supervision of the premises is impossible under such conditions, houses often being filled to the doorways and many people in addition drinking on the pavement.The public are under the impression that now they are not getting the 20/? increase, and that beer for some reason is being held up.   I may say that In the case of my own firm the bulk barrelage has been increased 42-Jfb, and our Inspectors report that on Bank Holiday every house controlled by us In Birmingham,(over600) was practically sold out of beer. The present prices are such that to-day the consumer Is getting this larger volume of beer at a slightly lower aggregate cost than the former smaller volume of stronger beer, or in other words he is getting an increase of 42^/Tin volume without extra cost.
Government beer in this district is brewed of the full strength, and is sold at 4d. per pint, but having been accustomed to stronger beer the consumer complains as to the k strength, and purchases some of the stronger ales or spiritB.There is plenty of evidence that the most serious result of the shortage of beer is that former consumers of beer only are now becoming drinkers of spirits, our Inspector reporting that it is not until such beer drinkers have quite failed to get beer that they call for spirits.Many spirit houses are full of customers when no beer is on sale.As corroberation of this increase in the consumption of spirits the figures in connection with our own trade for the month of July are as followsIrish   Whiskey 50 per cent increase over 1916Scotch      &quot;       32   &quot;       &quot;        &quot; &quot;       &quot;Brandy 14   &quot;       &quot;   decrease     &quot;       &quot;    (this isexceedingly costly just now) Rum 9 per cent increase (usually has a lowsale in summer months) Gin 41 per cent decrease (almost impossibleto obtain)Port &amp; Sherry   26   &quot;       &quot; &quot;       ( do.   do.   do.    )In considering these figures it must be remembered that merchants are permitted to withdraw from bond only bO% of the quantity withdrawn in the corresponding period last year* The above figures point to a spirit famine approaching, unless permission is given to withdraw from bond more than the said 50^.So great has the demand for spirits become that the public will drink any form of spirits at the present time, a notable example being the call for white rum in quantities,, which formerly was drunk but rarely.Further, the sale of bottled spirits has practically been discontinued, so that the consumption is mainly confined to indoor sales.Again,  with regard to this demand for spirits:- last week the orders for our managed, houses were1,329 bulk gallons )     of a maximum420 gallons in bottle ).     strength of 30 u.p.this week the orders are1,745 bulk gallons 552 gallons in bottlewhich is a consumption of 10% in excess of the weekly average of the month of January last, a time of the year when the consumption is far greater than in the summer months. During the corresponding period last year the figures wore:-897 bulk gallons )    of a maximum strength540 gallons in bottle )    of 25 u.p.the retail price this year being a minimum of 5d. per l/20th of a pint, whereas last year it wa3 only 3d. for a similar quantity but of a maximum strength of 25 u.p. instead of 30 u.p. of this year.
Surely it must be granted that this big increase in the demand for spirits, especially aa it comes from former beer drinkers, is detrimental from many points of view, and the only way to effect an improvement is to increase the output of beer; otherwise a famine in spirits will ensue, with the consequent cry for an increase in the deliveries of spirits from bond.The 15% decrease in the sutput of beer on the standard year (which was in operation up to the end of March last) as against the present 60$. met the&apos; situation, and the sooner the Ministry of Pood feels in a position to return to the higher output the better it will be from the point of view of relieving the intense irritation among the workers, and checking what may develop into a grave evil, namely, of beer drinkers being forced into becoming spirit drinkers.As an example of the danger to public order consequent upon a beer shortage, my firm was requested about 10 days a&amp;o, by the Superintendent of Police of a large town to send more beer into it as he had received intimation that rioting would occur if the licensed houses had no beer on sale, and so convinced was he of the probability of such disorder that, he had stopped all leave to the men of his depleted Porce.(Intd.)   W.W.B.9th August, 1917.
