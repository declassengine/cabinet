eve.Telegrams:-Growmore, Sowest, Londos.274tyhone:-Victoria 8240.BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES.To avoid delay, address all communications to :  The Director General.FOOD PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT.72, Victoria Street,London, S.W. (1)8th August, 1917.Sir,I beg to submit the following Report of the FoodProduction Department for the week ended 7th August:-There Is reason to fear that the heavy rains lastweek have done a considerable amount of damage to standing crops.   The amount of laid corn will greatly add to the task of gathering the harvest, especially in vie:/ of the shortage of skilled labour.Agricultural Executive Committees for Bedford and Kent.that owing to the large quantity of corn which has been laid in those counties, the services of additional men who can use a sickle or scythe will be required.   Enquiries are being made in this matter by the Department&apos;s Commissioners for the counties concerned, and it is hoped that the services of women may be made, to some extent, available for this work.LOCAL ORGANISATION. 7ork of Agricultural Executive Committees. In Hampshire the Executive Committee have referred to this Department the case of a farm near Alresford of which a Belgian Company have taken a lease in order to use it as a stock farmj the Committee find the land to be in a foul condition and desire to assist the Belgian Company in the matter.   One of the Departments Technical Advisers has been instructed to inspect and report upon the condition of theRepresentations have been received from the
faring.In Surrey the Committee have arranged with Lord Cunliffo to let, for six years, a neglected farm of 150 acres owned by him in the Ashtead district.Rabbits Order.Action under the Rabbits Order is reported from Hampshire, Kesteven, Warwickshire and from Bedfordshire, where a person from outside has been authorised to kill the rabbits on a piece of land belonging to the Chicksands Estate xThich it is now proposed to cultivate, and a similar authority has been given with regard to Mr. Pyn^s lands at Everton and Tempsford.Hon^compllance with orders issued by Committees.In Cornwall a prosecution against Mr. Batley, of Rosewastis Farm, for non-compliance with an order directing him to plant with potatoes 5 acres of suitable land on the farm, has resulted in the imposition of a fine of  20, the Bench insisted on the view that an order made under the Defence of tho Realm Act cannot be questioned.     It is thought that this will have a very salutary effect on cultivation in the county and In the country generally,,On the other hand, in Lincolnshire Mr. 7/oodhead of Friskney had grown mustard in defiance of the Committee&apos;s general announcement made earlier in the year that mustard must not be grown without a licence from them.     The Committee recommended that the crop should be confiscated, as they did not consider that any fine that could be imposed would be a sufficient deterrent as against the large profit that the crop would yield;   but the Board have no power to confiscate crops, and the Committee accordingly made an order upon Mr. roodhead to plough the crop in green or to use it for feeding. rrith this order Mr. roodhead did not comply;   he was prosecuted and fined  3.     The imposition of a nominal fine of this character is regrettable and likely to encourage evasion-2-
of the orders of the Executive Committee.Compensation for ploughing up grass land.The arrangements, which had been proposed in order to provide for any loss incurred by the conversion of grass land Into arable cultivation in connection with the scheme for the 1918 harvest, having been found impracticable without legislation, instructions have been issued to Agricultural Executive Committees to make a formal compulsory order in every case where ferass land is to be broken up under this scheme, in order to safeguard ihe claims of owner and tenant to receive compensation from the Defence of the Realm (Losses) Commission for any direct and substantial loss that may be incurred. Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No.2).Particulars received from 1,049 Boronghs or Urban District Councils show that 193,251 applications have been made for plots, and 174,422 plots, containing a total area of 12,902 acres, have been provided under the Order.HORTICULTURAL SECTION. Fruit and Vegetable Bottling.   The demonstrations In fruit bottling, vegetable drying and jam-making at the Food Economy Exhibition have been continued, and a total of 500 demonstra-tions have been given since the Exhibition opened, including two at the House of Commons for the benefit of members and their wives.The number of classes held during the week in different parts of the country by Travelling Instructors was 235, making a total of 1,189.The total number of glass jars for r/hich orders had been received up to August 4th was 1,592,940.   The total number of jars despatched by the manufacturers up to August 4th was 758,024. Hat the rate of delivery promised by the manufacturers been realised all the orders received would have no.7 been executed.
Potato Spraying.   Severe outbreaks of disease amongst unsprayed potatoes are reported from Devon, and minor outbreaks from Cornwall, Somerset, Gloucestershire, Glamorgan, Pembroke, Dorset, Hampshire, Berkshire and Sussex.   Assistance has been given to Local Authorities in organising and extending the spraying in Devon, In which both the military and the police, as well as the local press have vigorously co-operated. Preserving Vegetables and Fruit.   Pulping plant has been installed at the Old Brewery, Cheltenham, and should be ready for use within a week. Arrangements have been made for pulping to commence at Maidstone and at Budeley within a few days.The Drying Station at ;Vye is being installed, and plans for the installation of a drying plant at Paddock Wood are completed, and work on the necessary alterations to the buildings is to commence at once.A further 8,000 casks, making a total of 20,000 have been secured.TECHNICAL DIVISION. Feeding of Dairy Cows.   An enquiry is in progress as to the feeding and management of dairy herds in the neighbourhood of cities and large towns. Nearly 150 returns, covering about 40 towns, have been received, and the information is now being tabulated.Use of Nitre Cake in the manufacture of Fertilisers. An extensive series of experiments, both in the laboratory and at the works, is being conducted in connection with this subject, which has become important owing to the need for the utmost economy in the use of sulphuric acid. The present position is hopeful. Recently the Ministry of Munitions has induced sulphate of ammonia manufac-turers to experiment with nitre cake, and a Committee, on which this Department is represented, has been formed to watch the trials. Pot and field experiments are made with samples whenever the makers turn them out satisfactorily.
Calcium Carbonate containing Ammonium Nitrate. As considerable quantities of this material will be available, experiments havebeen started to ascertain what effect the ammonium nitrate islikely to produce on plants, and whether;the material will beaDpreciably superior to other waste limes and chalk residues atpresent in use.Superphosphate from de-arsenicated acid.   At the request of the Ministry of Inanitions, experiments have been instituted to ascertain whether any material advantage would accrue from the use of de-arsenlcated acid in the manufacture of superphosphate. Inspection of Land.   A visit has been paid to a grass dairy farm in Essex, the owner of which objects to break up a portion of his land on the ground that this would mean a reduction in the output of milk.    The inspection showed that there was little or no foundation for this contention, and that if the breaking up of the required area is coupled with proper manuring and treatment of the rest of the farm, the output of milk could be maintained while the production of other foods would be increased. Breaking up grass land.   An inspection has been made of crops growing on newly broken grassland in East Wiltshire.     Pour farms were visited on which the crops (oats and &quot;dredge corn&quot;) were very good, and two on which the crops (oats) were failures.     The growers were well satisfied with the yearfs results;   even where the crop failed, it Was agreed that the cause was want of experience, and that next time there would be success.    Where successful, the crops would be very profitable.     On one farm, on the Chalk, 1,000 acres promised 5 quarters of oats per acre;   on another, also on the 6halk, 250 acres promised 6-7 quarters per acre;   on another, on the Greensand, oat crops of 8-9 quarters per acre were seen. Close to Stonehenge oats wore growing on land whioh, until last April, had been virgin Down,     The crop was surprisingly good, and promised 6 quarters per acre.     All who have had experience In breaking up grass land in Wiltshire emphasise the importance of using the roller freely, and aay that if the land can be made firm,
the danger of failure from wireworm is very largely diminished.LABOUR.Soldier Labour.      Although, under the recent Cabinet decision, 20,000 skilled men should have been drafted from the Army to agriculture during the month of July, the first instalments of men are only now arriving at the Distribution Centres.     Reports so far received from a few of the Department1s Commissioners shew that only a very small percentage of these men are skilled ploughmen capable of taking charge of a team of horses.    Many of them have been used to driving horses in a town, but have no knowledge of farm work;    such men would have to be trained before they could undertake ploughing. Of the remainder, some have been previously employed as grooms, or gardeners, and have only a slight agricultural experience.     A few others have experience of driving machinery or repair work, and may be useful with short training for tractor driving.     The majority, however, are totally unskilled, and a large proportion are of un-satisfactory physique.Prisoners of War;      Two new schemes for the employment of batches of prisoners of war have been sent to the War Office during the week^ In addition, requests have been made that further men should be added to two of the existing camps.Policemen.        Of the London policemen lent by the Commissioners of Police for ploughing, nearly 100 have been sent out In charge of teams, and satisfactory reports of their work have been received. At the request of this Department, notices have been posted up In all police stations in the Metropolitan area inviting-constables to assist in harvest work during their ordinary holiday, and, judging^ by the numerous enquiries which have been received for the address of Executive Committees, there is likely to he a ready response. Horses.      The organisation for the purchase of horses has been completed, and considerable progress should be made during the next week.
-Women fs, Brangh,The difficulty of finding employment for NationalService wom$n  to which reference was made last week, still continuesIt has been decided that in future all Cpurses of Instruction shallinclude some specialised work which is likely to be required duringthe winter months, such as management of stock, milking, motortractor driving, etc., and training centres which are unable toprovide such special instruction are being closed down.Returns received this week shew that 6167 women have beenaccepted for work on the land under the National Service Scheme,and 9,813 rejected.     Those accepted are accounted for as follows :-In Instruction Centres...    ...    t.,. 1,270On Farm work ...    ............4,273Waiting for references to be placed in Training Centres ..    ...     230V/aiting for employment in Depots...     196Waiting in their own homes ...     198.MACHINERY   AND   IMPLEMENTS.There are now 788 motor tractors allocated to Agricultural Executive Committees i-n England and Wales;    in addition 4 tractors have been   offered to Leicester and 6 to Somerset, which have not yet been taken up.     Notice has beegn received of the shipment of a further 500 Titan Tractors from New   York, and their arrival is expected daily.     Meanwhile steps are being taken to acquire additional tractors of such other, makes as are considered reliable by the Department and are available in this country for delivery.The number of sets of harness supplied to Executive Committees is now 760.SUPPLIES,Approved Agents.   An arrangement has been made with the Cornwall Agricultural Merchants Association, (with the approval of the
Agricultural Executive Committee) whereby all its members are recognised as &quot;Approved Agents1&apos;, on the undertaking of the Association that in the aggregate 800 tons of sulphate of ammonia will be stored in the county, i.e. an average of 20 tons per member.     The Association will settle the allocation;    some small firms may take only 5 tons, and the larger firms perhaps 100. This safeguards the interests of the smaller men, and ensures wide distribution.     Other counties, especially those who have found it difficult to secure an adequate number of Approved Agents are being invited to adopt a similar arrangement. Sulphate of Ammonia.      During the last week there has been considerable demand, and the Distribution Committee has placed orders for the following quantitiesDurham, Cheshire, Lancashire, Yorkshire......   800 tons.Lincolnshire, Leicester, Warwick, Gloucester ... 910 Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Herts.     ...    ...     ...   450Kent, Surrey, Sussex......    ...       ...     ...   800Wilts, Hants, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, Cornwall 1,400Ireland ...   ...   ...   ......   ...   ...   ...   1,400Sc far orders promise to keep well abreast of output. Superphosphates.   The Treasury grant in aid of transport charges from makers1 works to farmer^ nearest station, has been fixed on the basis of paying any excess over 10/- per ton. Negotiations are actively proceeding with the Ministry of Munitions to ensure publicatL on of fixed prices at the earliest moment.Basic Slag.      Arrangements have been made securing a supply of low grade slag for Essex, Middlesex, and Herts, over and above the amount previously estimated as available. Seed Wheat of the 1917 Crop.      Reports from the Inspection
Committee show that the work has been interrupted by bad weather during the past week, but a very considerable portion of the Inspection has been carried out and there is every prospect that the remainder of the work will be finished before harvesting operations commence.Seeds other than Cereals,,      The Sub-Committee - have considered and approved of arrangements for the preparation of standard packets of seed for the use of allotment holders and steps are being taken to bring the recommendations of the Committee to the notice both of merchants and allotment holders.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Dir ec tor-General.The Rt. Hon, Rowland E. Prothero, M.P.President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.
