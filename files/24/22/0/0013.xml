I TOP. Operations.QClllFrom 3?.i.&quot;.. 0 in CFrance, to C.I.G.S3/8/17, ;.idniLht.0. A.D. 586.Following are facts as to operations preceding and on July 31st.   Enemy before the battle had excellent observation over the YrRliS salient and advantages of the artillery position were decidedly with him, the Allied positions being much exposed.   In spite of this, Allied artillery, ably assisted by aeroplanes, fou^nt his artillery down, and gained the ascend-ancy, thus allowing the infantry to cross tne difficult obstacle of the YSEii CVi&amp;AL with almost no loss, and to launch their assult with entire success on a front of over 15 miles,.We nave gained  md now hold the positions from which the enemy over-locked the YPR11S salient, the captured area being as reported in my ^official communiques. Ten German Divisions have been withdrawn exhausted ks a result of our bombardment and one day&apos;s fighting. Both prisoners and captured documents testify to the demoralisation of these divisions; he possess evidence that one Bavarian Division was withdrawn as a result f the refusal of many men to enter the trenches,. According to statement f captured officers,our artillery fire was terrible,and they express the strongest dissatisfaction with the support they received from the jrcrman artillery. Total number of prisoners taken in tne battle now amounts o 6122. dumber of German dead on the battlefield is reported to be jreater than on any former occasion,. German reports of British attacks &apos;-v:.lsed. are purely fictitious, no British attacks, except those reported a the communiques having taken place. On and since July 31st, as already Imported, several enemy counterattacks have been repulsed. Generallypeaking, the German communiques are so deliberately misleading that theymlay be fairly described as a tissue of falsehood.
