We deeply regret that the Committee should not have recommended the total abolition of all forms of wage-earning employment of children who are full-time scholars0     We cannot believe it is possible &quot;to perfect a civilisation for which our men have shed their blood and our women their tears&quot; so long as we tolerate the employment of young children for gain,&quot;In the Memorandum on the Education Bill 1917 thefollowing passage occurs:- (p0 90 Section 90 (i))&quot;Clause 13 deals with the amendment of the Employ-ment of Children Act of 1903o     We welcome its recognition of the unsatisfactory nature of the eondition which that Act endeavoured to regulate,. It is undoubtedly the case that the several hundred thousand children at present employed 1before and after school hours as milk sellers,e rrand
errand boys, newspaper vendors, and in other occupations are crippled in their educational work &quot;by fatigue and are 1 iab 1 e to be demoralised by the casual nature of their occupation,-,     3ut the proposal of the Bill to subtract two hours from those in which they may be thus employed is inadequate.     They would still be overworked; their education would continue to suffer-; and experience shows that the policy of mere regulation is one which, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to make administratively effective. We would point out that the Bill abolishes partial exemption and full time exemption below the age of 14 notwithstanding the poverty&apos; of the parents or any questions of industrial difficulty and dislocation which might ariseQ     Children employed out of school hours are engaged in all kinds of miscellaneous occupations, and their value to industry as a whole is relatively smalla     Their earnings, moreover, are, in the aggregate, of much less account than the earnings of &quot;half-timers&quot; and full-time juvenile workers under 14 whose employment the Bill proposes to prohibit altogether0     We submit therefore, that there is a strong ease for&apos;also completely prohibiting (aS distinct from merely regulating), the employment of children of school age for purposes of gain on the days on which they are under an obligation to make full time attendance at school&quot;&quot;0The Committee would re-iterate the view already expressed that the Bill should be amended so as to prohibit the employment for gain.of school children on days when they are required to attend school0     If this were done,, the question before us would not arise0The Committee are strongly of opinion, however, that if the employment of school children is to continue, the Act should be administered by the Board of Education and not by the Home Office^     The arguments urged by the fdrmer we regard as more weighty than those adduced by the latter.     On the other hand, it is recognised that there will be difficulties where children under 14 and young persons over 14 are doing the same kind of work underthe
the supervision of two different Central AuthoritiesIt is important, however, that so far as full time scholars are concerned, educational considerations should prevail ahove all others, and this would he hest achieved &quot;by making the Board of Education the authority for confirming employment hyelaws.If this step were taken,  it is suggested that the Board of Education should regulate the employment of-school children more closely than in the paste     The Committee have already recorded the view that the proposals of the Bill in this respect are inadequate.     The Employment of Children Act should &quot;be separately amended, in order to ensure that the employment of children does not deprive them of the full benefits of education in school, nor retard -their mental and physical development0
