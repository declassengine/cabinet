(3) of the minutes of the War Cabinet Meeting of August 7th,  the following is a summary of the instructions given to General Milne respecting his relations with General Sarrail, and the manner in which these instructions have been carried out,  since the time when General barrail was appointed Allied Commander-in-Chief.the relations between General barrail and General Milne formed one of the subjects of discussion at the Allied Conference in Rome on January 5th/7th 1917.     the decision of the Conference was conveyed to General Milne by the Secretary of State for \7ar in a telegram dated 13th January.     In this telegram General Milne was informed tha&apos;o ohe Conference had decided that the relations between General tarrail and the Commanders of the various Allied forces at Salonika &quot;should be based on the principles which governed the relations between the British Commander-in-chief and the Commander of the French forces in the Gallipoli Expedition, that is to say, the Commander of each of the Allied Forces shall comply with the orders of tho Commander-in-chief as&apos; regards military operations subject to the right of direct communication with and with reference to, his own Government,&quot;     The telegram then proceeded to quote the instructions issued on 3rd May 1915, by the French Government to General Gouraud, as follows:-it mThe/ j!
2.&quot;The mission of the commander-in-Chief of the French Expeditionary Force is to co-operate with the British Expeditionary Force and the Anglo-French naval forces. General Sir I. Hamilton commanding the British Expeditionary Force, being entrusted with the supreme control of operations in the East, General Gouraud will give him the value of his experience as well as the support of the forces under his command.    He will conform to General Hamilton&apos;s directions and he will take care to preserve, as far as he possibly can, the homogeneity of the French Corps in such sector of operations as the Commander-in-Chief shall allocate to him.&quot; For the further guidance of General Milne a letter from the French Minister of War to Lord Kitchener, dated 30th May, 191 was quoted in which it was stated that &apos;?whlle General Gouraud should receive from General Hamilton the directions necessarv to co-operation and a clear indication of the object to be attained, he has been left perfectly free to choose the means he will employ and the method of utilizing his troops in that sector of operations allotted to him by the Commander-in-Chief.&quot;     While forwarding the above for General Milne&apos;s information and guidance, he was instructed &quot;to refer to this office should circumstances cause him to think it necessary or useful to take part in operations other than those at present agreed to by the Allied Governments.&quot;2. On 10th February General Milne telegraphed protestingc. 604     against an order given by General Sarrail to move a 0-2-17.British brigade to Petra, as it would place an undue strain upon his troops and endanger his position on theStruma
Struma front, and he considered that the sanction ofH.M. Government was required for the move.     GeneralMilne added that &quot;as, since his return from the RomeConference General Sarrail gives me no informationof his plans, I cannot understand what his intentionis&quot;.     The matter was brought before the Y/ar Cabineton 12th February and they decided that &quot;General Milneshould comply with General Sarrail&apos;s order and sendthe Brigade to Petra&quot;.     At the same time theyinstructed the Secretary of State for Y/ar to writeW.C.62.     &quot;to the French Minister of War to point out that whilethey had instructed General Milne to carry outGeneral Sarrail1s order, &quot;they desired at the sametime to brinr. to the notice of General Lyautey thatGeneral Sarrail did not appear to have given anyreasons to General Milne for the move, nor to havetaken the latter into his confidence to the extentdue to the size of the force commanded by GeneralMilne, and that they hoped he might give instructions29369        accordingly&quot;.     This decision was conveyed to General u.ItG.S.12th Feb. Milne on the same day and he was informed that ;rthe W.C.82      Cabinet assumes that you have already represented toSarrail, or will do so, the military objections whichyou refer to, and% that you will come to a satisfactoryagreement with him&quot;. 3. On 24th February I telegraphed to GeneralMilne that I had received General Sarrail&apos;s plan29965        of operations for the offensive and asked whether C.I.G.S.24th Fob. General Milne was in general agreement with it.G.C.675.   The latter replied on 25th February that &quot;in draw-25th Feb.ing up his proposed plan General Sarrail has not consulted me&quot;, and enumerated several grave objectionsto
Itto the scheme.   He proceeded however to draw up a planG-.C.694.       for British co-operation in the offensive, and on 28th 28th Feb.February he telegraphed that he had seen GeneralSarrail who had agreed to his proposals. This offensivewas ordered to take place at the beginning of April, butGeneral Sarrail subsequently decided to postpone it tillthe 10th, and finally till the 25th of April.C.I.G.S. On 17th April I telegraphed to General Milne in the3293117.4.17.       following terms &quot;What I want to know is whether Sarrailreally means to attack the Bulgarians and when.    Is ityour opinion that postponement is due to necessarymilitary causes, or have you reason to think that hehas some ulterior motive&quot;.G.C.948. General Milne replied on the same, date that17.4.17.although he could not discover why this change of plan was regarded as advisable, yet &quot;l have no reason for stating that General Sarrail had any ulterior motive underlying the delay, and I am confident that he now really intends to attack, as he has definitely ordered my attack to take place on April 24th&quot;. This wasW.C.122.     reported to the War Cabinet on the following day.The British forces had beon ready to commence operations on 3rd April, but in accordance with General Sarrail&apos;s instructions General Milne postponed his attack until the 24th. The role assigned to the British forces was a secondary onc^ designed to contain as many of the enemy on their front as possible, to draw the Bulgarian reserves to that quarter and thus assist the main attack by the French and Serbians which was to take place on the 26th east of Monastir.
anIt was not until after the British attack had taken place that General Milne discovered that the French and Serbians were not ready.     This delay was not solely due to unfavourable weather conditions, but also to the fact that sufficient time had not been allowed for artillery preparation.     The British attack had been therefore abortive and heavy losses had been sustained for no object whatever.     In these circumstances General Milne decided not to undertake further operations, until he was certain that the ^ther armies were readysOn 26th April General Milne telegraphed that although General Sarrail had told him on the 16th that the French and Serbians were to commence operations on the 26th, he had that day informed him that the bombardment would not commence until the 28th, while the Chief of General Sarrail&apos;s Staff had told him on the day before that the Serbians were behind-hand with their arrangements.     This General Milne &quot;regarded as an excuse to cover probabilities&quot;.   He added that General Sarrail had urged him to continue hi3 operations with as little delay as possible.In view of the unsatisfactory situation disclosed in the above telegram, I telegraphed on 27th April as follows, &quot;Your G,Bo985- of 26th April tends to confirm my suspicions that Sarrail is not really in earnest about offensive. His plan of your commencing and continuing the attack for a still undefined period before the main attack commences seems in the circum-stances unlikely, even if he is in earnest, to afford results commensurate with the probable losses.   The War Cabinet wish try have your opinion on the whole subject,  and you are free to tel Sarrail what is said above.   The V/ar Cabinet do not press for
e.an offensive opposed to his judgment, but they desire to know what he really means to do as, on account of increasing shipping difficulty, time presses&quot;.    In conclusion I reminded General Milne that his instructions as given in my 27875 of 13th January &quot;gave him the necessary authority, before complying with Sarrail&apos;s plan, to refer to War Cabinet should he doubt their soundness&quot;.    In sendinf this telegram i had in mind not only the situation as disclosed by General Milne but also the reported intention of the French Government, who had just proposed another Conference on the Balkans, to take action against Greece, an intention which, if it were really entertained, was incompatible with a whole-hearted offensive against Bulgaria.General Milne replied on 30th April that he had not considered that he had any justification for taking further action than to impress on General Sarrail the necessity of synchronising the allied attack as far as possible, a view with which the latter did not however agree.     He had not considered it his duty to refer the matter to the Far Cabinet.    He stated that he had just seen General Sarrail who had given him his views and requested him to continue the offensive.In this interview General Sarrail had stated that he mignt have to abandon the offensive after a short time in view of possible action against Greece.    He had received instructions that the Powers had decided to dethrone Xing Constantine and measures would consequently have to be taken against Thessaly.
In view of this information I telegraphed on 2nd May to General Milne that &quot;General Sarrail seemed to be more concerned with Greece than Bulgaria and even such action as he does contemplate does not justify hope of seriously defeating Bulgaria.    In these circumstances the wisdom of continuing the offensive I must leave to your judgment. If he really means business, of which I cannot possibly judge here, you ought to co-operate; otherwise you ought not to lose men for no really useful purpose&quot;.    I added that &quot;our information from the French Government indicates that no such instructions as those you mention have been sent to Sarrail, and in any case you should take no part in Thessaly operations without instructions from here&quot;.General Milne telegraphed on the same day that General Sarrail had just informed him that the French artillery preparation would not begin till 5th May, and that it was unlikely their attack would follow till 3 or 4 days later. &quot;His instructions t* me are to attack as soon as possible having regard to the dates, and I shall be guided by eventstThe British attack took place on May 8th and was followed1 on the 9th and 10th by the main French and Serbian attack in the neighbourhood of Monastir.     Fighting continued for some time longer but the results were very small and in no way commensurate with the effort made or the losses incurred.   Between 24th April and 20th May the approx imate losses of the various Allied armies were as follows:-British5,000French4,500Italian3,000Russian1,500The Serbian losses are unknown but they were compar-atively small.
The above is I believe a complete summary of all communications which have passed between General Milne and myself bearing in any way on the relations between him and General Sarrail, and on British co-operation in General Sarrail&apos;s plans. With reference to the asser-tion, which has been made in France, that General Milne did net support General Sarrail in an active policy,  it may be pointed out that General Milne carried out all General Sarrail&apos;s instructions and gave him every support, in spite cf the fact that General Sarrail had disregarded the instructions conveyed to him after :the Rome Conference, had kept General Milne in the dark as to his future plans, and that when he was informed of the plan he objected to it strongly on the ground that there was no co-ordination between the operations of the different armies.    This did not however prevent him carrying it through to the best of his ability.    The British Army was ready to attack soon after the beginning of April, the original date fixed for the offensive, but it could not do sc owing to the delay in the French preparations.    Our attack on the 24th was a pure waste of effort&quot; and of life owing to the failure of the French to co-operate and to acquaint General Milne with the fact that they could not co-operate. TheBritish Army nevertheless made a second attack on the 6th May.       That there was no lack of co-operation on our part is.proved by the fact that, although our attack was a secondary operation it actually entailed heavier losses than these incurred by any other of the Allied armies.W, R. ROBERTSON,
