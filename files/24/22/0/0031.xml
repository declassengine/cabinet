&quot;^j2^p \z 145%^.^L^^atlQng-&apos;-SECRET.Prom   C.LG.S., to G-.0.C., Mesopotamia, repeated Co-in-C,, India,38890. Cipher. 2nd Aug. 1917.    2.55 p.m.Having again reviewed the question of possible developments in Mesopotamia I calculate that under very favourable conditions the Turks might assemble by the end of September at and south of Mosul a force composed of 96,000 rifles 320 field and 64 heavy guns, with about 1400 rounds per field gun and 750 rounds per heavy gun.    If the Russians on the Persian front are reasonably active I estimate that the Turks are unlikely to be in a position to bring -more than 72,000 rifles 240 field and 48 heavy guns against you, and that in proportion as the Russians make their weight felt or not, this force may be increased up to the maximum given above.I estimate also that by the end of September when you have received all reinforcements arranged for including drafts and the increase to establishment of your native regiments you should on the Tigris front have 75,000 rifles and sabres 200 field and 84 heavy guns, 4,5 inch howitzers being included in the latter with 3,600 rounds &quot;per field gun and between 2400 and 4000 rounds per heavy gun according to nature.   Let me have your remarks on these estimates.It appears to me that if they are correct even in the worst case, i.e. if the Russians have no effect, you should be well able to hold your own.   Through the gap on your right the enemy may however be able to get small bodies into Persia to make trouble there, and possibly raid your corxuunications from.the Persian hills assisted by Ivurds and Arabs.    I presume that your comiunicationG   are guarded sufficiently to prevent any serious interruption by such attack.
yrora:-   G.O.C., MesopotamiaRepeated to India.5th August 1917.7.40 p.a.Z.3090. Your 38890 of 2nd August.Assuming that rumours of movements are accurate and that enemy&apos;s troops and guns are already in motion, I calculate that as regards time and space eleven divisions, numbering approximatelytrated by the enemy south of kosul by the end of September.Basis of calculation for field-guns:  4 per Division and for heavy guns 4 per Division.These figures added to our estimate of enemy1s forces now opposed to ourselves and Russians as far north as and including Rowanduz area, namely 29,500 rifles with 133 field and mountain and 11 heavy guns make a total cf 96,500 rifles with 397 field and 55 heavy guns.Amount of artillery ammunition would presumably be limited only by considerations of supply and transport.As regards numbers to contain Russians on Persian front, the Russians have approximately 31,000 rifles with  2,000 sabres and 102 guns collected there now, which 10,000 Turkish troops with 36 guns are holding in check.It seems therefore unlikely that the Turks would detach many more troops for this purpose, unless the Russians make progress soon in -view    of    early advent of snow in the mountains and the low morale of Russian troops; but assuming that the Turkish containing force is made up to 15,000 provided with 72 field and 11 heavy guns, this would mean that they could bring 81,500 rifles with 325 field and 45 heavy guns against us on date mentioned.As regards supplies, our experience is that the ration strength of the enemy is usually at least double his strength in rifles,The enemy would,therefore,have to supply in the whole area67,000 rifles with  64 field and 44 heavy guns,could be concen-193,000
193,000 men, but this should not be impracticable in the country round and south of Mosul, even granted that the wheat harvest this year has only been fair.   The barley harvest has been bad, and this -fact will militate against rationing transport animals. Indeed, it seems to me that transport will probably be the crux of problem for the enemy.   To meet his requirements he has, like us, to depend on rail, river and land transport.   The rail-head is at present, as far as our latest information goes, still in the vicinity of DERBISIYE.Turkish river steamers scarcely exist now, and we have no information as to material increase in native river-craft.   Animal transport is available locally, but it will require collecting, and it is more than doubtful whether it will be sufficient to meet the greatly increased requirements. This means that the enemy will have to depend to a large extent on motor transport between rail-headend his fighting formations, especially where troops are operating away from rivers *   As to whether such transport and petrol are available in sufficient quantities, I have no definite information, although we have some reports of motor vehicles working between railhead and Masrjik,I am anxious not to under-estimate what the enemy can do, but taking points into consideration and even allowing for maximum efforts backed by German organization, I cannot help feeling that we are allowing liberally for numbers which the enemy can concentrate against us by the end of September,It is for that reason that I have been so anxious for an early and a combined offensive against the Turks on all fronts, although I realise that the Russian difficulty may be insuperable.An important factor to bear in mind is the large number of desertions which the Turks usually have when moving to Mesopotamia.How far the enemy will be able to expand his forces against us subsequent to September will depend mainly on the action of Russia on the Caucasus front, and the progress made by us in Syria, added to any transport difficulties which he may have.
The figures that you give as regards this force are substantially correct, provided that you include Baghdad garrison, that all reinforcements and drafts arrive in time, and that Indian regiments are completed to new establishments.As regards ammunition, we calculate that we shall have, according to nature of guns, 2400 to 3,500 rounds per field gun, and 1,900 to 3,800 rounds per heavy gun.That being so, we should, in my opinion, provided that we are kept well stocked with men, supplies and munitions of war, be able to deal satisfactorily with the enemy, even if by the end of September his numbers reach the figures you estimate.As regards my communications;    it is difficult to say definitely^that they are adequately guarded in view of their length and of the immense number of tribesmen living along them;   but, in my opinion, our system of posts at intervals, with mobile columns at important centres, is the most suitable plan for meet.ing the situation,    bearing in mind the importance of assembling the maximum number possible at the front to deal with the enemy, and I am not anxious about them.Addressed London repeated India.
