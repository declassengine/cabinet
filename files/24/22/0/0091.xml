SECRET.MINISTRY  OF  FOOD.Report for Week ending Wednesday, August 8, 1917.PART I.-ACTION TAKEN.Control of Prices and Supplies.^a^fters. No Orders under the Defence of the Realm Regulations have been issued from the Ministry during the week.Cereals. In the House of Lords, on August 2, Lord Rhondda outlined his prepared scheme  or controlling the price and distribution of the 1917 crops. It was, he said, intended to reserve all wheat, rye, and barley for use as human food or for seed. Oats not required for milling would be available for animal food. Maximum prices would he fixed for barley, oats, wheat, and rye, and these maximum prices would apply only to sound grain of good quality. In order to prevent dealings in damaged grain at prices above the maximum fixed for sound grain, the maximum price for damaged grain would he 7s. per qr. below the current maximum price for sound grain. The price at which imported grain would be sold to millers would be adjusted from time to time in parity with the current maximum prices for sound home-grown grain. Flour millers would he encouraged to buy their grain direct from farmers, but where the services of a merchant were necessary the extra cost would not exceed Is. a qr. Purchasers other than millers might, when buying through a recognised intermediary, pay an additional 2s. a qr., and in transactions not exceeding 15 sacks a total addition of 4s. a qr. would be allowed. It would not be legal to sell grain other than by weight, and the prices were fixed on the basis of payment net cash within seven days from completion of delivery. The producer would find his own, or be responsible for the hire of sacks until the grain was delivered, and delivery would be made by the producer, either to the nearest railway station, or at his option to the purchasers premises. x\ll freight, haulage, porterage, and cartage from the point at which delivery was made by the producer would be paid by the buyer, as would also the cost of sack hire (if any) from the time of delivery.In the House of Commons, on August 8, Mr. Clynes stated that the cost to the Exchequer of selling the 4-lb. loaf at 9d. was estimated at 40,000,001)1. a year. He added that this estimate must be regarded as merely provisional owing to the number of uncertain- factors which affected the calculation,Sugar. It has been decided that the general instructions issued to local autho-rities in connection with- Lord Rhondda&apos;s scheme for the improved distribution of sugar will be laid on the Table of the House of Commons.Meat.-A deputation from the National Federation of Meat Traders&apos; Associations was received at Grosvenor House on August 8. They expressed their apprehension that the fixing of prices would affect supplies and desired to be assured that no definite action would be taken with regard to the fixing of retail prices of meat without representatives of the trade being consulted. They were informed that the Committee to be appointed to advise on questions arising out of the fixing of retail prices would include representatives of Co-operative Societies and multiple shops and two members of the Federation.Brewing. Conferences have been held with Irish brewers with a view to deciding what alterations in the conditions attached to brewing 20 per cent, additional beer as set forth in the Intoxicating Liquor (Output and Delivery) Order No. 2 are necessary to enable Irish brewers to accept the option offered to the whole trade. ^ Provisions. Representatives of Jam Manufacturers, Jam Retailers, the Dried Fruit Trade and the Bacon Trade have been received during the week.The position in regard to tea is causing some anxiety and the Shipping Controller has been pressed to provide additional tonnage.Local Organisations.It was announced in the Press on August 5, that Lord Rhondda, through the Local Government Board and the Scottish Office, had invited the co-operation of Local Authorities throughout Great Britain in the work of Food Control.A  (33)3659-2   Pk 1   60  8/17   E &amp; S A
The authorities approached in England and Wales were: in London, the Common Council of the City and the Metropolitan Borough Councils; outside London, the Municipal Borough Council and the Urban and Rural District Councils ; in Scotland :-(a), in&apos; each county a joint- committee of .the County Council and the Town Councils of those Burghs whoso population in 1011 did not exceed 5,000, provided that the Town Council of auy large burgh may also join; and (6) in all other burghs the Town Council. These authorities have been asked to appoint Food Committees which will administer a new scheme of sugar distribution, continue the campaign for food economy, and, when their organisation is complete, deal with other foodstuffs, including bread and meat. The necessary expenses of these Committees will be a charge on the Exchequer ; for, while free to delegate work as they think fit to sub-committees, they will need a special staff and will be put to other cost. It will be their first duty to safeguard the interests of consumers.Lord Rhondda has appointed the following to he Food Commissioners : For the City of London and MetropolitanBoroughs -------  Mr. H. J. Greenwood.For the Southern Home Counties, with head-quarters in London   - .   -     -     -     -   Mr. F. E. Blackburne-Hall.For Yorkshire, with headquarters at Leeds    -   Mr. J. A. Greene.For North Wales, with headquarters at Car-uarvon      - -      -      -      - Mr. J. R. Hughes.For the Eastern Counties of Scotland, withheadquarters at Edinburgh       -      -      -   Lt.-Col. H. A. Rose, D.S.O.For the Western Counties of Scotland, withheadquarters at Glasgow   -.     -      -      -   The Hon. Gideon.Murray.The first duties of the Food Commissioners will be to act as the representatives of the Ministry of Food for the purpose of supervising in their respective divisions the execution of the Food Controller^ instructions. They will be responsible for assisting the local Food Control Committees in the performance of their work and for keeping the Committees in touch with one another and with the Ministry of Food.   Further appointments will be announced in due course.      -Enforcement of Orders.Potatoes. The fines inflicted in the Metropolitan area for contraventions of the Orders are far more adequate than elsewhere. Scotland Yard undertook proceedings against a number of vendors as a result of a minor prosecution undertaken at the request of this Ministry. Two Spitalfields dealers were fined 1021.2s. and 501,^ respectively.A few reports have been received that this years main crop potatoes were being sold in contravention of the Crop (Restriction) Order. The Chief Constable of Perth-shire has been asked to prevent a proposed. sale&apos; by auction and&apos;to prosecute the auctioneers. &apos;Horses Rationing Order, 1917. Successful prosecutions under this Order have been reported by the Chief Constable, County Constabulary, Northallerton.-Sugar (Domestic Preserving) Order, 1917. Several local authorities are showing energy in investigating contraventions of this Order. Some disappointment has undoubtedly been caused by prosecutions under Article 5 which have failed becaxxse the false statements in the applications for sugar were made prior to the date of the Order. The Ministry is urging prosecutions under Article 1 or, in the case of offences by the grocer, under Article 4, and it is thought that such prosecutions will succeed.PART II. SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.Jmports. ......The aggregate imports of principal foods were 2\ per cent. (7,700 tons) lower last week than the week before.&quot; (See Table&quot; A.) There are decreases in wheat and flour (16,700 tons), beef (7,800 tons), mutton (2,300 tons), and butter (800 tons), while sugar and glucose show an increase of 15,300 tons, margarine of 600 tons, and barley,
oats, and maize (together) of 2,800 tons. These are all of the nature of fluctuations such as are to be expected week by week.The total is 63,500 tons (27 per cent.) higher than in the corresponding week last year, and 60,700 tons above the average of this year so far.    .Consumption.Meat. There was no important change in the supplies of meat at London and Liverpool markets in the most recent week recorded (Table B.), but there was a considerable increase at Glasgow, and a decrease at Manchester. -The average for July in the four markets together was 2\ per cent, below that for June and 131 Per cent- below that for July last year.The number of fat cattle at 51 markets was 26 per cent, higher last week than the week before, and the average for July 1917 was 7 per cent, above that for June 1917, and 14 per cent, above that for July 1916.A great increase is also shown in the supply of fat sheep and fat pigs. The average for July for the former was 16 per cent, above June 1917 and equal to that of July 1916.Bread and Flour.-The reports from bakers and retailers of flour for the four weeks ended July 21st have been completed. It is estimated that they cover rather more than a quarter of the whole retail consumption of the country, and they are representative of all parts of the United Kingdom, and of traders &apos;on a small scale as well as of large concerns.The results, combined with those of previous enquiries, are as follows : Retail Consumption of Bread and Flour (measured as Percentagesof the level of May 1917).   ,Month.1910.1917.January -FebruaryMarchAprilMayJ uneJuly(94) (99) 99 100 97^ 99 &quot;(98)* (103)10910-1100 9ih 92&quot;* The numbers in brackets depend on too few returns for a satisfactory comparison.The consumption in July 191.7 was over two and under three percent, below that in June, and 16 per cent, below that in March. The diminution is not so great as in previous months in spite of some increase in the supply of potatoes; but last year the consumption increased slightly in July, as compared with June. The result is satis-factory in that a great improvement has been made since March of this year Avhen it appears that 10 per cent, more was consumed than in March 193 6.In Table 1L, the results for May 1917 and June and July, 1916 and 1917, are&apos; exhibited in districts.   There is a considerable fall this month in Yorkshire and tke* Northern Counties of England where home baking is the custom, and very general complaints are made by the retailers that the flour they receive is of a bad colour and difficult to bake.   In Scotland a considerable fail has occurred.The fall in July in other districts is insignificant. For London there is no change and very little anywhere in the South or the Midlands. In the South Western Counties there has been hardly any reduction since May or as compared with last year. In many small towns and country districts throughout England and Wales a slight increase is recorded last month.The deliveries from the mills,! were 2,490,000 sacks in the four weeks ended June 23rd, and 2,100,000 in the subsequent four weeks, a fall of 151- Per cent- If appears from the bakers&apos; returns of stocks that this statement is consistent with the estimate of consumption above given, for the stocks held by retailers were considerably lower on July 21st than on June 23rd.t Estimated as accounting for 80 per cent, of the output of all mills.
Stocks.The bakers and retailers were requested to report their stocks of flour on June 23rd and July 21st, when sending their returns of consumption. The following Table summarises their reports.Unit 100 Sacks.	Consumption&apos;		Number of Weeks	Four Weeks ended	Stock, &quot;July 21st.	Consumption held in	July 21st.

In England and Wales the stock held by retailers in country districts is in many cases relatively larger than in the towns.The stock on June 23rd, was 12 per cent, higher than on July 21st, and equal to about three weeks&apos; consumption.Wholesale Prices.The price of barley, which had fallen before the last report, has now risen again to 73s. Qd.   (See Table D.)British beef has again fallen and Argentine beef again risen, till the difference is only 4s. per cwt.British mutton has returned to 143s. after standing at 138s. for a fortnight.Bacon has risen another Is. or Is. Qd. and is higher than at any previous time.Irish butter has risen to 197s. Qd.; it was at 180s. Qd. five weeks ago, and J\rew Zealand butter has risen Is.The prices of other foods are unchanged. The price of palm-kernel cake has risen 5 per cent.Retail Prices.In Table F. are given the retail prices of the principal foods on August 1st, 1917, as compiled by the Department of Labour Statistics. The general increase since July, 1914, of the cost of the standard budget of working class expenditure on food is estimated at 102 per cent. A small part of this increase may have been avoided by the substitution of articles which have increased relatively little for those which have increased more. The average is &apos;2\ per cent, below that for July 1st and equal to that of J une 1st this year.The only&apos;important change since July 1st is in the price of potatoes, which has fallen 38 per cent.   They are now cheaper than in any month since May, 1916.Bread and flour are very nearly at the same price as in June or July, but dearer than in any previous month.Beef has risen about 1 per cent, in the month. English mutton has fallen 1 per cent, but frozen mutton has risen very slightly. All meat is dearer than on June 1st or at any earlier date. Bacon is also higher than ever before, having increased 4 per cent, in the month, but as compared with July, 1914, it has risen less than mutton or beef.Tea and sugar are up about 1 per cent, in the month. Cheese and margarine have fallen 5 and 4 per cent, respectively, but butter has risen 3 per cent.When comparison is made between Table 1) (wholesale prices). in this and previous reports and Table F (retail prices), it will be seen that during the month the wholesale price of English beef has fallen 10 per cent, while the retail price has risen very slightly. There is no recorded change in the wholesale prices of frozen muttton or of tea or sugar to account for the retail rise in these articles. The retail prices of the other commodities that are shown in both tables have risen, fallen or.remained stationary in agreement with the wholesale prices.
