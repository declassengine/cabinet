the problems of indian government.address by the right hon. lord islington, g.c.m.g, d.s.o.I have been invited by the Oxford University Delegacy for the Extension of Teaching to contribute my share to the course of lectures by addressing you on &quot; the Problems of Indian Government.&quot; It is a vast subject, and one of absorbing interest, and I am deeply sensible of the compliment that has been conferred on me by the invitation. It would have been hard enough to discuss the subject adequately in the time at my disposal even before, the war, when the difficulties of Indian administration were less prominent, and when the reforms introduced by Lord Morley and Lord Minto had softened the edge of political agitation; but the war has brought into prominence new facts, and has emphasised the peculiar character of British rule in India so that I think it may be fairly said that at the present time m there is no question so full of difficulty, so urgently requiring study, so insistently demanding solution, as the problem of British rule in India. My difficulty has been to know, not what to say, but what.to omit. India preseuts every manner of problem, political, social, economic and industrial. To some extent these various aspects are intertwined. It is impossible, in considering any Indian problem, to overlook the fact that India has not attained a full degree of national unitj^. Her peoples are still sharply divided by differences of religious beliefs, by the degree of intellectual progress, and by the character of their economic, development. But though these divisions and differences can only disappear after the lapse of many generations, recent years have seen a steady progress in the direction of greater unity and the development of what, for want of a better term, may be called a national consciousness. This is the result partly of the unifying influence of British administration and Jaw, and partly of the growth of education. Education has inculcated in India the great ideas of freedom and responsibility, which we with other free nations cherish, and has inspired her with the hope of developing these ideas to the same ends as the other great units of the British Empire. So it has come about that at the present time there is one great Indian question which dominates all others, that of India&apos;s part iu the Empire with which is indissolubly connected, the problem of her internal political development. The supreme importance of this question justifies me, I think, in singling it out as the subject on which your attention should be primarily concentrated.The war has shown how solid and united the Empire is, and India must be given credit for the conspicuous part she lias played in this struggle. She has given of her best as generously and as sincerely as any other part of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions. She has done this freely and without the applica-tion of external pressure, because with the Dominions she realised that in this war the existence- of the British Empire was at stake and the principles of liberty on which it is founded were threatened by the contrary forces of autocracy and militarism. This spontaneous response to the high spiritual call of the war has revealed India in a new light and has brought into prominence the problem of her future development. The ideals of the British Empire have been revitalised by the ordeal through which it is passing, and with this reawakening the attitude of the Empire as a whole towards India has changed. This change is exemplified by the invitation of representatives from India to the special series of Imperial War Cabinet meetings which were held last spring, and by the inclusion of her repre-sentatives in the special Imperial War Conference which sat at the sameOT 518   100   8/17A
2time. Among the resolutions of the Conference was one which dealt with India&apos;s representation at the regular Imperial Conferences which will be held hereafter, and it is now an established fact that India will in future be included in those Conferences in which the Dominions and United Kingdom have alone hitherto participated.This recognition of India&apos;s place in the Empire is only India&apos;s due. Yet it does not alter the fact that by her constitutional and political institutions India is in a very different position from the United Kingdom and the great self-governing Dominions. But British rule in India does not stand still, and in statutes and in solemn declarations undertakings have been made which hold out to India visions of higher ideals of government than it has so far been found practicable to attain. The aspiration of India is to continue its march along the lines that have been followed in the self-governing Dominions, lines of progress, it should&apos; be noted, that are in no way inconsistent with Indian political development during the last 50 years. India looks forward to a time when under the osgis of the Crown she can take her stand as a self-governing member of the Empire, with all the privileges and responsibilities that this position entails. The problem for British rule is to help India to achieve its aspirations in such a way as may be for the greatest good of India and its vast population.This is, I think, a fitting subject for students to consider, and for the time being I shall lay aside the official mantle that I wear as Under Secretary of State for India and speak to you as a student to students on one of the most engrossing problems that political students have ever had to consider. You will understand, therefore, that in what I am going to say I am not necessarily voicing the views of the Secretary of State for India or the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government. I shall give expression to my own views as one who has now for long pondered these weighty questions, and who has had the advantage of Avatching at first hand the working of British Government in India and at Home.Now, before it is possible to look into the future we must cast our eyes back into the past. For this purpose I need not carry you further back than 1858 when the Crown finally took over from the East India Company the administration of the vast territories which had been acquired in the course of the preceding 250 years. We must consider what is the present position of the Indian Government on the Legislative and Executive sides, and when we have grasped this, and studied the changes that have taken place in the last 50 years, we shall be in a better position to consider what the lines of progress should be, and to distinguish between what is imme-cllately practicable, and what must be still regarded as visionary and veiled, in the obscurity of the future.Let us now turn to the early history of the Indian Legislative Assemblies. Immediately prior to 1858 the machinery for Indian Legislation was a Council, which comprised the Governor-General, the Commander-in-Chief, the four ordinary members of the Govern or- GoneraTs Executive Council, and six special members two judges and four officials representing the several Indian Pro-vinces. At the time of the Mutiny, therefore, the whole of Indian legislation rested with an official body, and non-official opinion had no direct voice in shaping the destinies of the people. This was clearly a position, that could not long endure, and in 1861 an important Act was passed under which the Governor-General was empowered to nominate not less than six and not more than 12 persons, of whom at least one-half were to be non-officials, to collaborate with the ordinary members of the Executive Council and the Commander-in-Chief in the legislative work of Government. These nominated members of the Legislative Council are the additional members, of whom I will say more hereafter. The inclusion of non-officials was a move in the direction of liberalising the Government of India, but it did not introduce as much outside influence as the change would appear to suggest. First, the fact that the additional members had to be nominated by the Governor-General ensured that no one who was likely &quot;by his views to.be unacceptable to Government would be appointed.   Secondly, the business which the Legis-
lative Council was empowered to transact was strictly limited to legislation. The right of interpolation, and of asking questions, was not given by the Act of 1861. Corresponding measures were taken&quot; to enlarge the size of the Councils of the Governors of the Presidencies of Bombay and Madras.The next landmark in the history of the Indian Legislative Councils is presented by the Indian Councils Act of 1892. By this measure the number of additional members of the Viceroy&apos;s Legislative Council was increased from the minimum of-6 and maximum of 12 provided by the Act of 1861 to a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 16, and as regards the Legislative Councils of the Governors of Bombay and Madras, the number of additional members was increased from the minimum of 4 and maximum of 8, as provided by the Act of 1861, to a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 20. Corresponding powers were taken to deal with the other provinces. An important change was also made regarding the method by which these additional Legislative members were to be appointed by admitting the principle of representation, the means of giving effect to it being left to the discretion of the Governor-General.The Act of 1892 also extended the functions of the Legislative Councils. The Governor-General was empowered to make rules authorising the discussion of the annual financial statement in the Legislative Council, and the asking of questions. The functions of the Legislative Councils of the Governors of Bombay and Madras were correspondingly extended. This Act thus marked&apos; an important advance on the tentative pror posals of 1861. The Legislative Councils were, larger; the number of non-official representatives was greater than had been possible before, and the functions of the Council were widened. The method under which the additional representatives were to be appointed was more liberal.We now come to the third landmark in recent Indian political history, the Act of 1909, which is associated with the names of Lord Morley and Lord Minto, who at the time were Secretary of State and Vicerojr respectively. By this Act the constitution of the Councils was changed in three respects. The maximum number of additional members of the Governor-GeneraTs Council was increased from 16 to 60, and in the case of the Provincial Councils the numbers of additional members were doubled or more than doubled. Apart from the additional members there were, of course, the official representatives of the Executive Government.This increase in numbers gave room for the introduction of many shades of opinion which previously could not have been represented, and is, in itself, of great importance. But more important still was the change effected by the new law in the proportion between the official and non-official members. Under previous legislation at least one half of the additional members of the Viceroy&apos;s Legislative Council, and the Legislative Council of Madras and Bombay had to be non-official. In the case of the other Legislative Councils the proportion had to be at least one-third. An official majority, though not required by statute, had in practice always existed prior to the Act of 1909, except in Bombay where, for some years, the official members had been in the minority. By the regulations under the Act of 1909 an official majority of four was prescribed for the Viceroy&apos;s Legislative Council, but in all the other Legislative Councils there had to be a majority of non-officials.Lastly, an important change was made in the method of appointment or election.. We have seen that under the Act of 1861 the additional members were nominated by the Head of the Government, Viceroy, or Governor, as the case might be. By the Act of 1892 the principle of representation was admitted though not definitely prescribed. Under the Act of 1909, on the other hand, the additional members had by Statute to include not only nominated members, but also members elected in accordance wdth regulations made under the Act. A separate set of regulations exist for every Legislative Council, and rules to suit each province have been laid down as to the method of election. The important point which I would emphasise is that by gradual steps India had advanced to a position under which some members
of her Legislative Councils had by law to be elected by non-official bodies in contrast with the system of nomination which prevailed in the Act of 1861. Special provision has been made for the representation of particular communities, such as the Mohammedans, the planting communities in Madras and Bihar, and the tea and jute industries in Bengal and Assam.The second important group of changes made by tbe Act of 1909 relates to the functions of the Legislative Councils. These functions, as I explained above, had already been extended by the Act of 1892. Under the Act of 1909, the Executive authorities were required to make rules authorising the discussion of the financial statement and any matter of general public interest and the asking of questions subject to such conditions as might be prescribed. Under these rules members in contrast to their power under previously existing provisions have the right to propose resolutions either on the Budget or on matters of general public importance and to divide the Councils upon them. The resolutions are not binding upon the Government, but take the form of recommendations to be acted upon or not as the Executive think fit. On public grounds it has been considered necessary to exclude from the subjects that may be raised for discussion matters affecting the relation of the Government with foreign States or Native States, and certain other special subjects.The general effect of the Act of 1909 may, therefore, be summarised as follows : It enlarged the size of the Councils, and in particular provided for a non-official majority in the Provincial as distinct from the A7iceroy&apos;s &apos; Council; it definitely recognised the principle of election; it enlarged the functions of the Councils and increased, indirectly, though the resolutions of the Councils were not binding by law, the influence of the non-official members.This then is the position of the Indian Legislative Councils to-day.I now come to the Executive side of the Indian Government which really administers the country in all its details, and I refer here not to the heads of the executive machinery, that is, the Executive Councils of the Viceroy and the larger Provinces, but to the great administrative services. In dealing with these services, it will be convenient to consider together their present and future development. The question of the evolution of the Executive Councils I will treat later when considering the future of the Legislative Councils of which I&apos;have just given you the history.You probably all know the principle that in India no distinction of race or colour affects the question of emploj-ment under Government. This principle has been asserted by Parliament and by Royal Proclamation. As you know, the Government of India is a bureaucracy. This has been inevitable, owing to the backwardness of large sections of the population in the matters of education and political capacity. It has always been the policy of the British Government to recruit the bureaucracy in such a way as to hold the door open for eligible Indians. The number of such Indians has been steadily increasing. Though this is undoubtedly true, the rate of progress has by no means been as rapid as could have been wished. An elaborate enquiry -in 1887, which led to certain important results, divided the chief Indian services into Imperial and Provincial, the , Provincial generally speaking holding offices of a subordinate character, the supreme control being vested in the Imperial services of which the chief is the Indian Civil Service. This Service has been solely recruited in this country by open competition, Indians being eligible to compete with Europeans. The Government were of opinion that the whole conditions of the executive services required re-examination, and in 1912 a Royal Corn-mission, of which I had the honour to be Chairman, was appointed. We undertook a full enquiry into the position of almost all the important -services, 24 in number, and have issued a report on each which those of you who are interested can obtain. . In that report we set out the progress that has been made in increasing the number of Indians in higher employment in India, comparing the position to-day with that prevailing in 1887&apos; when the-earlier enquiry was held. We found that, taking the posts carrying a salary of 160Z. a year or over, the number of Indians had increased from 3,003 in
1887 to 4,573 in 1913. This represents an increase from34to 42 percent, of the total of such appointments in the 26 years. As regards the posts carrying a salary of 400Z. a year or over, the increase in the number of Indians was 427 to 942, representing an increase from 12 per cent, of the total of such posts to 19 per cent. As regards posts carrying a salary of 640L a year or over, the number of Indians had risen from 77 in 1887 to 242 in 1913, representing an increase from 4 per cent, of the total number of officials on such salary to 10 per cent. You will understand that as regards posts carrying a salary of less than 1607. practically the whole staff is Indian. The Commission full)7 appreciated the difficulties of making rapid changes in the character of the Government machine, but we were definitely of opinion that in view of the progress made by the country in the last 30 years, the increase in the Indian element indicated in the figures I have mentioned was quite insufficient.What I am about to say will, I hope, find its way to India, and be read by many there. Indians know, or at least should know, that I am keenly in sympathy with constitutional and administrative progress in India, and I am content to rest the claim to possess that sentiment on ihe contents of the Public Services report.The recommendations of that report display an even recognition of claims for reform in the interests of both European and British elements of the Services in India. To read the Indian criticisms on the report one might be led to suppose that the reference was confined to reforms as regards Indians, and that proposals to ameliorate the conditions of Europeans lay outside the proper purview of the Commission. I need not dwell on the necessity that a scheme of reform in the Services should be comprehensive, and one which should fulfil the requirements of both races which inevitably differ in certain aspects. I am glad to reflect that there are some highly important proposals in the report which if adopted will improve the position of the British officer and will enable him to become much more efficient for the special work demanded of him in India.Time will not permit me to-night to elaborate many of these latter&apos; proposals. But I desire to say a word about those which relate specifically to Indians if only to dispel the erroneous view that has apparently been formed of them through the crusade of undiscriminating and hitherto unchallenged condemnation that has been passed on these proposals in India.In the first place the Report recommends that several important services of a scientific or technical kind should normally be recruited entirely in India. The&apos;most important of these services are Agriculture, Forest, Mines, Finance, Salt and Excise.&quot; It will, of course, not be possible in all these departments to start at once appointing only Indians, as there is not at present a sufficient supply of qualified Indians available, but the report recommends that in most of these cases half the appointments should, if possible, at once be given to Indians after a suitable course of training. In order that the recommendation that recruitment should eventually be wholly from Indians may not remain a mere pious aspiration, the report, very strongly recommends that immediate steps should be taken to set up in India new training establishments, or to develop existing institutions, on a level of efficiency comparable with those to be found in Europe, in which the necessary technical qualifications may be acquired by Indians.I may be allowed, perhaps, to make here a short digression, and say that I regard it as one of our foremost duties to give to India educational facilities for the acquisition of European learning and skill in scientific and industrial methods, so that Indians may be able to study what is most important in European thought and material civilisation without leaving their own country, and also that western systems of knowledge may have an opportunity of developing in India on lines suitable to the physical conditions of that continent and the peculiar genius of its peoples. I look forward, of course, to there being always an interchange of advanced students between IndiaOT 518 B
and Great Britain, but it should not be necessary for an Indian to come to Europe for the essentials of an education of any type, and in this connection I emphasise the importance of including military education. I look forward to selected Indians being admitted to commissioned ranks, and in due course India should have her Sandhurst to train these young officers just as she should possess her Colleges for Agriculture, Forestry, Medicine, Geology, Engineering, &amp;c.There is a second group of services in which the Royal Commission consider that there are grounds of policy and efficiency for having an admixture both of Indians and Europeans, neither element being, generally speaking, markedly predominant. The most important of these services are Education, Medical, and Public Works.The present organisation in the Education Department in particular is very defective and fosters many anomalies of an irritating character which tend to emphasise race discrimination. Our proposals include the removal of all these anomalies and suggest an organisation on practical lines, which will ensure the appointment of a large body of qualified Indians to the higher branches of the service.I now come to a third and last group of Services in which the Royal Commission consider that for the present the preponderating element should be British, in view of the special responsibility of these Services for the security of India. These are the Indian Civil Service and the Police Service. I may say that this recommendation is, of course, framed with a view to existing conditions. What the composition of these Services may be or ought to be in the course of two or three generations I will not attempt to prophesy.In the case of the Indian Civil Service, it is recommended that one-quarter of the superior appointments be filled by Indians, exclusive &apos;of any Indians who enter the Service through the examination in England. Under the present :proposal, this arrangement will give nine appoint-ments to be filled yearly by direct appointment in India on a system of combined nomination and competitive examination.- This will ensure the admission of a much larger number of Indians annually to the Indian Civil Service than have hitherto been able to enter by the competitive examination in England. It will afford them an opportunity hitherto denied them of entering the service by a competitive examination held in their own country and from their own universities without being obliged at an early age to leave their home and family surroundings. Again, there is no rigid limitation in the number 9 proposed in the report. It can easily be increased to 12 without any disturbance of the scheme. Were it made 12, this would ensure that one-third of the superior posts of the Indian Civil Service would be held by Indians.This mention of appointment in India by competitive examination with certain safeguards reminds me that I should say a few words on the general question of the method of appointment of Indians in India to the public services. There is among many Indians a demand for the competitive examination system pure and simple as the universal method of recruitment. The Commission were satisfied that in the present stage of development of education in India, such a method (though it would doubtless obtain men of high qualifications in certain directions) would not secure the appointment of the most suitable candidates both as regards general character and administrative ability, and1 would leave certain classes without j)roper representation in the public services. But the Commission, while recom-mending in general a continuation of appointment by nomination, proposed that the selection of candidates should always be entrusted to a Committee which should comprise members in touch with educational institutions, and should include Indian and unofficial representatives. Vacancies should be widely advertised, and an educational qualifying test imposed. Under a system of nomination on such a broad basis, the way should not be barred to any Indian candidate of real merit.
One further proposal of the Commission of some importance I will mention and that is that, in those Services which are to continue to contain both Indians and Europeans, Indians should invariably receive the same pay as Europeans on reaching administrative rank (and in some cases earlier) and all Indians recruited in Europe should receive the same pay as Europeans.I think that the survey which I have given of some of the. proposals of the Commission will suffice&apos; to show that its recommendations have been framed on generous lines and in effect grant many of the most important demands which have been made by educated and political opinion in India.Perhaps the most important feature is that its schemes are in no case of a final nature and offer no hindrance to further progress in the assumption by Indians of the administration.Mindful as I am of the valuable part this great University along with others has played in the past in training the young officer, British and Indian, for the career of an Indian Administrator, I feel compelled to allude, before passing on, to a proposal in the Report that the age at which the Open Competitive Examination for the Indian Civil Service which is held now at from 22 to 24 should be reduced to the school leaving age 17 to 19. There is, I know, in some quarters strong opposition to the change. I realise that this change, if it is adopted, will .be accompanied with certain inconvenience to Schools and Universities, but with all the facts before us in this connection, we found ourselves obliged to recommend it in consideration of the very strong appeal that was made to us in India.The case for the change is based upon the most imperative Indian requirements. We were convinced that civilians should commence their career in India earlier than they do now. The present system brings men out to India at the age of 25. A man of this age must ordinarily have his aptitudes and outlook more or less fixed, and to this extent he is less easy to train in the highly specialised work of Indian adminis-tration. His ideas have been already moulded outside India. Again, he is more likely to be married at that age than at the age of 22, and this is a serious disability to him in the early years of his profession. It is objected that boys who have been educated in certain schools will not be able to compete on an equality with those who have been to the English public schools. This, it is contended, would specially be the case in some of the Scottish schools, but is not borne out by the experience of the past 20 years at the Balliol scholarship examinations, which show no less than 44 successes from Scottish Schools and Universities, a truly astonishing record. It is true that in the majority of cases the successful candidates were above the age of 19, but there is a heavy handicap for age in these examinations, and I am confident of eminent support in Oxford in saying that the Scottish educated boy is quite able to compete at the University with the product from the English public school.Finally, and this is one of the strongest arguments in favour of a change, the present age limits permit of only a single year&apos;s probation. By almost universal consent this has proved insufficient to secure that officers arrive in India with a proper training in the law which they will be called on to administer, in the languages which they will be called on to talk, and in the history and habits of the people whom they will be called on to govern. It is proposed, therefore, to increase the one year&apos;s probation to three years. Indians who enter the Indian Civil Service by the Indian examination will all come home for this probationary course. This increase has the additional advantage that it will enable the probationers, both British and Indian, not only to be called to the Bar, &quot;but also to qualify for a University degree.I hope all these facts will be given careful consideration when the time comes to decide whether the age for entry to the Indian Civil Service should be lowered.   May I make this plea ?   If our Schools and Universities are to
play their part in meeting the growing demands of the Empire, it is not unreasonable to ask them to make what educational adjustment may be found necessary to enable this important and far-reaching reform for Indian administration to be carried out.So much for the Report of the Commission.I would like now to summarise the position that has been reached. Broadly speaking, we have in India a vast bureaucracy, the lower ranks being Indian, the higher ranks being mainly European. On the other hand we have important legislative Councils largely composed of Indians with a free power of criticism of the acts of the executive by means of question, and with control over legislation, containing large numbers of Indian representatives who, in spite of the powers to criticise and obstruct, have no real responsibility for the policy of the Government. Suppose then that the policy of the Government fails to meet with the approval of the Indian representatives. On these occasions Indian members record their votes against the Government, and we have the unfortunate result of a division practically based on the race principle. On the other hand, supposing the Government were to concede what the Indian representatives ask, and embark upon a policy which they did not approve, the Indian representative would not be held accountable to India or the Empire in the event of a calamity. This is a very grave defect in the present system, and one which must be reckoned with in modelling any new scheme of political reform.The free right of criticism which the unofficial representatives on the Legislative Council enjoy is reflected in and supplemented by a similar attitude in a large part of the Indian press. The representatives of the Government are thus between two fires, the press on the one hand, and the non-official Councillors on the other. The Europeans in India are of course a very small proportion of the total population, and as -is always the case with established Governments they have not the same opportunities for defence as their critics have for attack. In constitutional countries there is always the safeguard that the critics may be called - upon to take the reins of office from a Government that has lost the confidence of the public, and this limits the extent of the criticism and compels those who are anxious to criticise to formulate an alternative constructive policy of their own which they are prepared to put into effect if entrusted with office. In India this safeguard is altogether lacking. Hence it comes about that criticism in India is often not only not constructive but also purely hostile. This tendency, to exaggeration is the result of the peculiar situation of India to-day, in which critics of the Government have full power to criticise but have no responsi-bility for the effects of their criticism.It is easy to dwell on defects. It is harder to devise a means of over-coming them, and before you can form a judgment for yourselves you will naturally expect me to tell you of the direction in which Indian thought is moving in these important matters.Some months ago a Memorandum was submitted to the Viceroy by a number of elected additional Members of the Imperial (that is, the Viceroy&apos;s) Legislative Council. The most important part .of the Memorandum dealt with political reforms, and it is, I think, the most authoritative document yet produced by India&apos;s public men on the subject. The chief measures proposed by the additional Members were the following :- .First, a large increase in the numbers of Members of the Imperial and Provincial Legislative Councils.Secondly, the grant to the Legislative Councils of the power to pass laws and resolutions on all matters of Indian administration with the exception of the direction of military affairs, foreign relations, declarations of war, the making of peace and the entering into treaties other than commercial, which were to be vested in the Government of India. These laws and resolutions were of course to have a binding character, and the only safeguard would
have been the exercise of the veto by the Governor-General in Council or Governor in Council, as the case might be.Thirdly, the abolition of the Council of the Secretary of State.Fourthly, the grant of autonomy to Local Governments, and the grant of an immediate full measure of local self-government.On the executive side the additional Members proposed that all the major Provinces should be placed under an Executive composed. of a Governor from the United Kingdom and an Executive Council, and on the Executive Council one-half of the Members were to be Indians. It was further proposed that the elected representatives of the. people, that is, the elected additional Members of the Legislative Council, should have a voice in the selection of the Indian Members of the Executive Council.Now I have a serious criticism to offer to some of the proposals in this scheme. From the large increase in the numbers of the Councillors it would necessarily follow that the Government would be in a substantial permanent minority, because it is impossible, having regard to the limited number of officials in India to spare, for what would be quasi-Parliamentary duties, a sufficient number to counterbalance adequately the increase in the Indian elected mem-bers. Without, therefore, other radical changes the effect of the proposals, so far as the Legislative Councils are concerned, would be to place the Government in a constant risk of seeing measures and resolutions carried to which it objected, and the responsibility for the execution and con-sequences of these measures could never, as in this and other constitutional countries, be placed upon those responsible for their introduction. It is idle to think that the Governor-GeneraTs or the Governors veto would be a sufficient check in such circumstances, because if it is to be of value, such a veto must be used sparingly and in respect of matters of high importance. The weapon would be dulled by constant use, and the position of a Governor who exercised it freely and not only in matters of high moment would become impossible. The effect of the changes taken as a whole would thus be to accentuate the evil to which I have previously referred. The power of the critics would be increased without their receiving any real additional responsibility, and there can be no sound Government which does not combine these twTo functions, namely, criticism and responsibility. Again, under the present consitution of India, the Secretary of State&apos;s Council performs the necessary part of giving the Secretary of State, who is a politician, usually without first-hand knowledge of India, advice to enable him to exercise the control vested in him by Parliament over the acts of the Indian Government. Until the intellectual and political condition of India has advanced to a stage when this power of control can be safely transferred to the Indian people, the Secretary of State&apos;s Council in some form must be retained.On the executive side there is much to be said for the establishment of Council Government under a Governor from home in all the major Provinces, and subject to the necessary changes in the position of , the higher elements of the bureaucracy, there is no reason why Govern-ment on western lines subject to such modification as the special conditions of India entail should not be introduced. But to enable the necessary changes to be effected, careful enquiry is a necessary preliminary. Whatever the result of this enquiry, there would be, grave objection to the proposal that the Indian Members of the Executive Councils should be selected by the additional Members of the Legislative Councils. Members of the Executive Government (and I refer here both to the Government of India and the Local Governments) must be appointed by the Crown on the advice of the Governor-General or Governor as the case may be. The idea of an elected executive is quite unknown to British practice. It would not tend to the establishment of a stable executive. While no doubt the Governor-General or Governor would frequently look to the elected Legislative Councils for his Indian Executive Councillors, he must be free to recommend for the supremely important posts in question those men whom he considers best fitted to discharge the duty. He could not afford to take into his intimate counsel men who might be selected on the strength of a programme that he did not approve, and in whom he lacked confidence.OT 518 C
These are all serious drawbacks in the scheme of the additional members. But I do not think that the Memorandum was by any means a barren document. Its virtue lies in those portions which show that the writers were conscious that a beginning of India&apos;s political advancement must be made at once in the provinces. The idea of provincial autonomy and the development of local self-government are fruitful ideas. Indeed, I believe the most pressing reform in India to-day is in the direction of decentralization.This brings me to certain suggestions which I will ask you to consider for the development on sound lines of Indian polity.I, would say at once that if the ideals of the British Empire stand for I anything, India&apos;s future must be in accord with these ideals, and her I ultimate ambition which she must one day realise after successfully I surmounting the difficulties before her is the attainment of responsible \ Government within the Empire. This ideal, which took this country many i centuries to achieve, cannot be reached in a day, nor can it be given by I Acts of Parliament alone. The journey may be long and arduous and the 1 dangers of a false step cannot be ignored. It is the task of British I statesmanship, which alone has the necessary experience, to guide India so t  that she may not falter or relapse on the way.Now, where should immediate developments and experiments be made ?I In the Punchayats, the organ of village Government, in the municipalitiesI which administer the towns and in the District Boards, which administer1 country areas.The municipalities and District Boards should be vested with powers&apos;toI, deal with matters of purely local importance, such as sanitation, lighting,I and in some cases, primary education; and the powers and responsibilities&apos;; of the local bodies must be defined by Act so as to ensure the due dischargeI of the duties entrusted to them.   They must have authority within definitelyI specified limits to impose local taxation for the maintenance of local services.I In the event of mal-administration or mis-government, the superior Govern-I ment, that is to say, the Provincial Government, must have the right byI law to intervene, and, if necessary, to exercise control for a period with aI view to setting affairs in order.   The members of the municipal bodies andI their chairmen must be freely chosen by the constituents to, whose welfareI they administer.   Those constituents must have the right and power to make1 their influence felt in the event of the local bodies failing; to  discharge. I their duties, and to substitute for an inefficient Board a Board pledged toI carry out the reforms which they desire.   A healthy local party spirit mustI come into being as a stimulus to efficient administration ; for it is only underI the vigorous criticism of those primarily interested that municipal, or, indeed,I any communal administration, can be efficient.I now come to the Presidency and Provincial Governments and their I   Legislative Councils.In the granting of wider powers in this connection it will be necessary I to examine most carefully the present relations of these Governments I to the Government of India, that is to say, the supreme central Government. I I am strongly of opinion that such an examination will show that much I can be done with great benefit in the direction of decentralization. It will, I I believe, be found that the whole civil machinery of Government in India I to-day is excessively centralized. In other words, the development of the I country has outstripped the capacity of any central Government to exercise I effective administration. The Government of India holds the threads of I detailed administration too firmly in its own hands, and in too many I directions controls functions which can be far better performed by Provincial I Governments.i - i    t *As the Provinces in India develop politically and industrially, it isI  inevitable that the Government of India must become less in touch withI  their aspirations and &quot;necessities.    Uniformity of system and procedureI  imposed from a central Government must become less appropriate andmore incongruous with time.I . The present system entails unnecessary delay often on matters of local I urgency.   . This  creates general suspicion.    It  impedes progress  and
engenders discontent, and the idea prevails-however ill-founded-that there is connivance between the Central and Provincial Governments to obstruct advance and action. Such matters as Police, Education, Agriculture, Forestry, Public Works and Buildings, and questions regarding industrial enterprise might be handed over entirely to the larger of the Provincial Governments. In the case of the Police the Governor should have power to sanction expenditure required without necessarily obtaining the approval of the Legislative Council. Modern India should be treated far less as a group of uniform Provinces under a Central Government. Each Province should be allowed to work out its own redemption by itself in accordance with its own capacity..Such a change will not, of course, be easy. It will not only present many difficulties but may arouse certain prejudice.Besides increasing the field of responsibility of Local Governments, 1 consider that we must aim at transferring definite spheres of public business from bureaucratic to more representative control a control to be exercised through the medium of elected representatives acting in co-operation with the Government. This might perhaps best be effected by the constitution, somewhat on the French- plan, of Standing Committees of the Legislative Councils, containing a large proportion of unofficial members, responsible for assisting the executive in framing its proposals on certain specified groups of questions.I should like to see instead of an executive consisting of a Governor supported by officials, with one Indian colleague, a Government consisting of a Governor and four Executive Councillors,, two European and two Indian. I should regard the members of the Services as eligible for the post of Governor, though no doubt this officer would be usually appointed from home. The Indian members like their European colleagues would be nominated by the Crown on the recommendation of the Governor who would, of course, endeavour to choose men of wide outlook and not necessarily of the official classes. The Government would, as I suggested, act in certain Departments with the assistance of the Legislative Council or a Committee thereof to whom they would refer their policy before its execution. It would then be open to the Legislative Council to criticise and suggest improvements which the Government would adopt unless they could convince the Legislative Council that there were sufficient reasons for acting otherwise. If the Indian Members of the Governors Council were properly chosen it cannot be doubted that the Governments policy would be formulated with due regard for the views of the Indian elected Members of the Legislative Council. In so far as criticism of their proposals was made in the Council it may be assumed that it would, as in our Parliament, be due to the fact that there was reasonable ground for the existence of more than one opinion. The debates in the Council would be invested with a reality which does not exist at present.; for Indian speakers would not, as now, always be found on the opposition side, and it is to be remembered that if in deference to the Legislative Council the Government modified their policy, the Council would have to shoulder the responsibility for the results. This is the essence of responsible Government as we under-stand it. To secure its introduction into Indian Local Government a suitable system of election is important, so that the elected members may be properly representative of the various classes of Indian society. Only if this is done, will it be possible consistently with the interest of the people to make the elected Councillors responsible for policy, and to make them realise that for whatever they say or do they will be held accountable to constituents free to displace them if they fail to give satisfaction.The method of election should continue as at present to be based on a community franchise, but where possible the system of election should be direct instead of, as now in certain cases, indirect. At the present stage of development this is capable of giving a more democratic representation than would be possible under a purely territorial system which would I have no doubt result in the domination of the Legislative Councils by a single class.Adequate powers of taxation must be given to the Local Governments to ensure that funds are available for the services they control.&apos;   At present
the Government of India acts as the banker of the Local Governments who deposit their free balances with the Government of India. The Government of India in its turn utilises the money for capital purposes, e.g., on the construction of railways and irrigation works. It thus happens that if the &apos;Local Governments wish, at a time of general stringency, to draw on their accumulated balances for local purposes, they may be unable to do so as the money is not available in a realisable form. It would, of course, be impossible to tolerate a position in which the Local Governments were free to spend large sums of money when the Government of India was. in a position of financial difficulty. But some means must be found of leaving provincial balances to a greater extent than at present under the control of the Local Governments, and only in exceptional cases should the Government of India restrict Provincial Governments from utilising the sums at their credit. In view of the large amount of provincial moneys which have been utilised by the Government of India for capital purposes it would be impossible, except over a period of years, to place provincial balances in their entirety under the control of the Local Governments, but a beginning in this direction should be made as soon as possible on the return of normal financial conditions after the war. Power would, of course, have to be retained by superior authority, as by Local Governments in the case of municipalities, to intervene in the last resort should a Province squander its resources and tend to drift into bankruptcy; but I should hope that this power would in practice be only nominal as the Provinces can be trusted to exercise wisely the increased powers that this proposal would give them. The real check on provincial mismanagement would come from provincial public opinion, for any deficiency in provincial revenue would have to be made good, either hj cutting down the local Services or by increasing local taxation. The prospect of these alternatives should ensure a rigid scrutiny over the provincial budget by the representatives of the people of the Province.If the important changes that I have indicated were carried out it would be undesirable and unnecessary to increase to any considerable extent the number of Members of the Provincial Councils. The important thing is to invest the Members there are already with responsibility.Assuming the above suggestions were carried out it might be found that for efficient conduct of economic and -administrative control a wider area of local government should in some instances be adopted. To give effect to this it would be necessary to consider whether and to what extent a grouping of areas under one Provincial Government might be made.All these proposals pre-suppose the progressive growth of political capacity which is &quot;necessarily bound up with the spread of education  literary and industrial. The beginnings will be small. But the seed will be capable of indefinite growth and if carefully tended will prepare India for the realisation of her rinal ambition to be a self-governing member of the British Empire.I now come to the position of the Government of India. It may be that if some such scheme of provincial self-government as I have outlined could be introduced it would be right for the Provinces to transact more of their business with this country and the Secretary of State in direct communication with the India Office instead of almost invariably through the Government of India as hitherto.I have purposely refrained from discussing the future position of the India Office in any reconstruction of Government that may take place in India. In doing so, I fully realise that changes will have to be effected. It is obvious that any modifications which may be made in the respective powers of the Government of India and Local Governments will entail cor-respondingly a consideration of the relationship now existing between the India Office and Governments in India. This is an intricate problem which can only be dealt with after careful enquiry, and I prefer to suspend my judgment in regard to it for the present.But even if these changes, and they are all changes which could only be introduced slowly and on careful enquiry, were made the Government of India would still, and always must, remain responsible
/for the Imperial side-or I might say federal side-of Indian government. It is impossible that the Government of India should ever divest itself of the control over the Army and the forces for local naval defence, foreign relations, commuications (including railways, posts and telegraphs), customs, currency, all of which Services are of wider than local range. The liberal-isacion of the supreme legislative and executive councils would follow the lines which I have sketched in the case of the provincial councils, but in view of the greater importance of the matters in which the Imperial authorities have to deal, progress would necessarily be slower and would be dependent on the success of the changes in the Provincial Governments.If all the changes that. I have mentioned could in clue time be carried out the picture that India would present would resemble, with the necessary differences entailed by local conditions, in particular the existence of the Native States, that of the Commonwealth of Australia which, as you know, is a Federation of self-governing States in which the central authority exercises control over matters affecting equally all the com-ponent units.In any final scheme of Indian self-government it is clear that provision must be made for the Native States which in area and population cover one-third of the Indian peninsula. Comprised within the legal definition of India, they are excluded from that of British India, and do not form part of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions. Proud to acknowledge the paramountcy of the British Crown, their rulers are so far from being British subjects that they enjoy an almost complete internal sovereignty solemnly guaranteed to them, with certain limitations, by formal treaties the scrupulous observance of which is a point of honour with the British Government. And yet, though historically and constitutionally divorced from the body politic of British India they are inextricably bound up with it by their geographical position, which necessarily exposes them on all sides to influences from without; while railways, posts and telegraphs must,tend more and more to level artificial barriers and to foster the growth of common sentiment. Thus it is that making no claim to&apos; interfere in the affairs of British India and jealous of interference in their own, they claim to take part in the defence of the British Empire, and wherever the Indian Army has fought, Imperial Service Troops have stood side by side with their British and Indian comrades.Obviously, therefore, they must occupy an important place in any of our schemes. What that place must be it would be premature to discuss now ; but there are certain principles which must always be borne steadily in mind-: First. The States must come into our scheme of their own free will. We can put no pressure upon them which the letter and the spirit of our treaty engagements with them do not permit.Second. We cannot ask them to come into any scheme which does not reserve to them all the rights which their treaties guarantee to them. I low-ever insistent may be the demands for accommodation and give and take, their treaty rights must be scrupulously respected.Third. Nothing must be done to impair the personal link which binds them to the Crown.Subject to the above considerations, there is scope in the future for much mutual intercourse between these States and British India. I can conceive a reciprocal benefit arising to both by such intercourse and I am sure that the - chiefs themselves will from time to time willingly avail themselves of such opportunities that may offer to secure assistance and co-operation from the British Government in any public movement that they may have in contemplation for the advancement and prosperity of their State.The programme I have sketched-and I repeat no one is responsible for it but myself can only be successfully achieved if hasty action is avoided, and each step in developing the growth of free institutions is taken after due deliberation as part of a considered plan. Great patience will be needed if the fruit is not to be lost by excess of zeal, to pluck it before it is ripe. Political reforms must go hand in hand with an advance in political capacity which in  its  turn  is  dependent  on theOT 518 D
diffusion and improvement of education. Much has been done in recent years to accelerate the advance of education in India. In the last 10 years the expenditure on education has risen from 3,525,500Z. in 1905-6 to 7,388;600Z. in 1915-16, and the number of pupils in the primary and secondary schools has risen from 4,490,800 to 6,766,600 in the same time. In England and Wales the number of pupils in the public elementary schools in 1916 was approximately 6,070,300, and you will appreciate the lesson of these figures when you remember that British India has a population of approximately 250,000,000 as compared with 36,000,000 ^ in England and Wales. The proportion of literates in India is, therefore, in spite of recent progress very low. According to the 1911 census (I. give approximate ficures) only one male in eight was classed as literate, and only one in 100 alliterate in English, and as regards females, only one in 100 was classed as literate and only one in 1,000 as literate m English. Compulsory primary education has not yet been introduced in India, and it will be a long time before higher education can be put within reach of the bulk of the population. Education, more education, seems to me the watchword of policy for the next generation. In addressing such an audience as this I cannot but feel that you will realise how impossible it is that there can be sound political progress towards responsible government without corresponding progress in the education of the people ; for it is only by education that they will be able to exert an effective control over those in authority. But teachers must be found to carry out the work. The teaching problem must be solved in India as a prelude to the wider extension of education. Out of 267,001) teachers in India only 80,000 have undergone a course of training. Again, this education must not be purely literary ; it must be increasingly technical and industrial. If industrial development is to take place as it should on a wide and expanding scale in consonance with the wealth of natural products with which India is endowed, then there must be Indians fitted by scientific and technical training available for the work. Agriculture, the chief industry of India, is capable of immense development if advanced on scientific lines. As I have already said, every provision must be made to ensure that in India itself the best opportunities for a sound education in all branches on modern lines is provided, for it is impossible to expect any real diffusion of education if it can only be obtained by sending Indian boys and girls overseas with all the expense and other disadvantages that this involves. As Indians fitted for employment in the public services whether admini-strative or technical services become available, the Government must not hesitate, but, on the contrary, must do everything it can to take advantage of the material that lies nearest to its door. In this sphere it will probably be found possible to make the greatest progress in the immediate future.It is generally admitted that recent events throughout the world have combined to accelerate the demand in India for political advance. It is equally admitted that an advance should he made and without undue delay.The character and degree of this reform can only be adopted after searching examination. The machinery of Government in India is delicately poised and it would be an evil day for the country and its peoples if changes were effected so precipitately that they ultimately proved incompatible with the peculiar conditions of the country. It is not difficult to set in motion a new system of Government, whilst it would be infinitely difficult to retrace or withdraw that system even if it were found to be disastrous to the country.The world to-day has a tragic lesson presented to it a lesson of which all responsible leaders in every country must take account.Russia, in her effort to extricate herself from an autocratic system, has allowed herself to be hurled headlong into anarchy by the extremists of her country. Wild and impracticable theorists for a time attained such influence among her people that she was brought to the very brink of national ruin. One cannot refrain from the reflection as to how much misery in Russia and how much suffering among all nations in this war would have been avoided had prudent and practical counsels prevailed as the outcome of the revolution. I would therefore earnestly and sympathetically say to those in India who to-day are advocating extreme measures of reform:  &quot;Be patient.&quot;   &quot; Be reasonable.&quot;   &quot; Limit your influence and assistance to
those measures which are practical towards the solution of the problem.&apos;r The end in view can best be reached by gradual and moderate steps. It is suggested by some that nothing short of constitutional self-government should suffice and that this should be established in India at an early date.You cannot transform a highly centralised bureaucracy into a set of decentralised self-governing systems in the passing of a night. If any British Government were to attempt such a task, were to allow themselves in a nervous spirit to act against their judgment and experience in the face of agitation, they would indeed betray the trust that has been imposed upon them.The success of the reforms must depend on the spirit in which they are carried out by those to whom they are granted.The further development of these reforms will likewise depend on the extent of assistance and co-operation afforded. British and Indian public men and officials must for years to come carve out in joint effort the destinies of British India. Their continued co-operation is a vital element in this great undertaking, as every patriotic Indian who loves his country must realise.&apos; The opportunity for India is great. May it be granted that both races, British and Indian, will with single-minded endeavour, combine to avail themselves of the occasion.8th August 1917.
