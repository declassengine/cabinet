*S  4fe-L   MILITARY   CONFERENCE,   AUGUST   7,   1917.6f - I Present :General Foch.General Sir W. Robertson.1. The Military Conference considered the question asked by his Excellency Baron Sonnino at the previous political Conference, namely: What number of batteries can be sent from the Western Front to the Italian Front for employment in September next 1 *The Military Conference considered and reaffirmed their agreement with the conclusions of the Military Conference, at which Generals Foch, Cadorna, and Robertson were present, held at Paris on the 24th July, 1917, regarding this question, namely : &quot; (1.) The actions at present developing on all fronts are the realisation of plans drawn up at previous meetings. There is no reason to make any modifications ;  in any case, it would be, for the moment, impossible.&quot; (2.) In the present condition of Austria, the knocking-out of this Power is to be aimed at : :- (a.) By continuing the attack on the German forces according to the programme prescribed between France and Great Britain, which ensures, apart from important objectives which are directly con-nected with it, the tying-down of the German armies to the Franco-British front. (&amp;.) By attacking Austria simultaneously on two fronts, the Italian and the Russian, with every available means. With this object, Great Britain and France have sent to Italy all the heavy artillery and munitions they have been able to spare. At the same time, it is recognised on the one side that Italy will not possess even then all the means necessary to ensure the decisive defeat of Austria, and on the other side, that it is impossible for Great Britain and France to do more for the moment..&quot; General Cadorna estimates that an action against Austria, in order to be decisive, should stretch from Tolmino to the sea (80 kilog.), and would require 10 infantry divisions and 400 heavy guns in addition to his present forces ; he cannot, however, on the eve of a great offensive, say in what measure he will be in a position to undertake a second, or determine what forces will be necessary to make it.&quot; Under these circumstances, and in view of the primary importance of this objective of knocking-out Austria, it was decided to examine, when the operations now in progress are finished, the situation which will result therefrom, as well as the opportunity and possi- i bility of placing at the disposal of Italy the forces necessary to enable her to attain this objective.&quot;2. General Foch desired to repeat that, in his opinion, it was now too late to attempt to change the military plans for 1917.Sir W. Robertson expressed his agreement with this view, and stated that it was impossible to say when the Anglo-French offensive just begun would terminate, ! but Sir Douglas Haig has reported that it may take several weeks before he attains his first main objective, and the delay caused by bad weather strengthens this probability.Both Generals Foch and Robertson agreed that the fact that the Anglo-French offensive had begun successfully reinforced the reasons which induced them to decide at Paris that it was necessary to continue these operations as planned.For the reasons given above, both Generals are agreed that it is not possible to f send any further batteries of artillery from the Western Front to the Italian Front to be ready for action in September of this year.    These batteries would necessarily have to be withdrawn from the troops in action.J. FOCH.W.  R.  ROBERTSON. August 7, 1917. /
