As everyone is occupied with politics they find it very difficult to get any consideration in their recommendations.     They consider improvement in exploitation would increase carrying capacity by 40 per cent.     There are now 25 per cent of Russian engines under or waiting repair and 8 per cent of 580,000 wagonB.The mission recommends that all engine and wagon construction work should he stopped in order to hasten repairs. They propose to send   a unit *f 84 officials to teach American method of exploitation on 2,000 miles of line in western Siberia. They point out that everything suffers through lack of order.The men in repair shops do not work properly.     The miners at Taiga? ^here the coal is of high quality, have been on strike for 3 months so coal has to be carried from mine in the interior 900 miles further east.     Americans can supply by end of January only 375 engines.     It is difficult to hope that the Russians may be induced in time to make sufficient changes in exploitation to save the situation.NOTE.   Wprd &quot;exploitation&quot; is not eertain.     * On railway 50 milesE.S.B. of TOlvISK.
