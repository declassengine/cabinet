.T. 1688,nt Memorandum for the Third Sea Lord and The Controller of the Admiralty.SECRETARY,War Cabinet,I send you herewith for circulation to the War Cabinet a memorandum on Mammoth Ships presented to me by the Third Sea Lord and Controller, and concurred in by the Shipping Controller and Eirst Sea Lord,I endorse the recommendation made in paragraph 9.(Initialled) E.C.G.11.8.17.FIRST LORD...l) In the discussion on the programme for merchant shipbuildingthe possibilities of constructing a number of large vessels described as &quot;Mammoth Ships1&apos; which could be fitted with ,!bulg9s&quot; as a definite protection against submarine attack has been fully explored-.2) The Chief of Naval Staff holds the opinion that if wopossessed a moderate number of these vessels by the Spring of 1918, the position of this country with regard to the future importation of food-stuffs would be much better than it will be under present conditions,. In his opinion the advantages of Mammoth Ships lie not only in definite protection given by the ,r bulges&quot; but in the fact that such large vessels can with comparative economy carry cargo at a rate of speed impracticable for small cargo carriers, further.that a small number of homo-geneous units can be conveyed more effectively than a large number of miscellaneous vessels.   He considers also that the doubts thrown on the efficacy of the &quot;bulges&quot; as protection are somewhat over-rated..     On these grounds,  therefore,  the Chief of Naval Staff deplores the absence of Mammoth Ships and, while he concurs in the view reached in this memorandum that it would not be a good policy to initiate the construction of such vessels at the present time, he considers the matter of such importance from a military point of view that the decision not to construct Mammoth-Ships and the grounds on which it is based should be laid before the Cabinet.....) After carefur consideration it would seem that the mostconvenient size to build such ships is of the following dimensionsLength..............700 feet.Breadth...... ........... 90 feet.Depth....., *........... 52 feet.The approximate particulars of such a ship are

Harland &amp; Wolff 3 yard at Belfast, however, is differently situated.   One end of their yard is laid out expressly for building, the largest type passenger steamer, and is, therefore, suitable for the construction of ships of this sort, in addition to which the labour conditions in Ireland make it easier to increase the labour in the Belfast yards than in similar yards in England.   It would, therefore, seem that if the mammoth merchant ships are to be constructed at the present juncture, they must, unless other urgent work is to be set aside, be constructed. in Messts. Harland Wolffs yard at Belfast.It would be possible to construct in the Belfast yard two such ships, a double bottom for one being already partially constructed, and material for a second double bottom being partially worked.The builders estimate that they could complete the first of such ships in 15 months and the second in 17 months, but this estimate is very optimistic and the Admiralty is of the opinion that in all probability we should not get the first ship very much under 17 months,, unless the whole of the oilier work in the yard is made entirely secondary to this construction.(5) The addition of &quot;bulges&quot; i3 undoubtedly a protection,but only one vessel so fitted has up to the present been struck by a torpedo, and the device must, therefore, be regarded to some extent as experimental.   Further it is pro&quot;*?-able that a vessle fitted with &quot;bulges&quot; would require repair after one of the &quot;bulges&quot; had been broken, and during the repair period, the large size of the mammoth ship would seriously increase the difficulty and loss of repair.   It should be remembered also that docking facilities on the other side of the Atlantic are even less suitable for large steamers than here.   &quot;Bulges&quot; would consume 3,-000 tons of steel,  or more, to the vessel, without any additional carrying capacity.(6) It is evident from the above that only two mamiac&amp;th shipscan at present be put in hand, and the possibility of building a homogeneous fleet of these vessels must, therefore, be abandoned.
(7) Fui-ther, it has he en de-cided that the construction oft^c&apos;units of this type is inadvisablea   In steel, in labour and in time the mammoth 3hip is extravagant.(a) The quantity of steel required forMammoth ship is      14.700 tons, 11.000 ton ship is   2,950 tons, 8^000 ton ship is   2,220 tons,from which it will be seen that it is possible to build five 11,000 ton ships and 6.6 - 8,000 ton ships, the result being that with the same quantity of steel we could obtain in the case of theMammoth Ship,.......,.26,900 tons of deadweighttonnage.11,000 ton ship.......55,000   &quot;     &quot;       &quot;8,000 ton ship.......52.800   &quot;     &quot;       &quot;the smaller ship in both cases showing nearly twice the deadweight tonnage for the same amount of steel,(b) Comparing the labour employed on these three types, Messrs., Karl and inform she Admiral tn that an average of &apos;li 000   men will be employed on the Liammoth ship for the period of lb months.   This gives a figure of 50.. 000 men-months.Similarly the 11,000 ton ship will take 500 men 10 months to construct-  giving 6,000 men-months;  and the 8,000 ton ship will take^bimijar number of men 8 months to construct,  giving 4.,000 men-months. This gives a result that the30j000 men-months on the mammoth ship will give a deadweight tonnage of 26;900 tens.30,000 men-months employed on 450 feet ship will &quot;give a deadweight tonnage of 66,000 tons.,30,000 men-months employed on 400 feet ship will give a deadweight tonnage of 60,000 tons.both of which are considerably more that double the tonnage of the mammoth ship.(c) On the question of time also the mammoth ship is expensive.In the case of the 11,000 ton ship employing the same amount of labour we should have 4 vessels floated with a tonnage of 44,000 Ions for   montns before the mammoth ship could be put in commission, and before the mammoth was out, half-way thiough -with the buildin-: of 4 other vessels.In the case of the 400 feet ship,  similarly we should have 4 vessels giving 32,000 tons dead-weight in commission 7 months before the mammoth ship could be put in service, and another four almost completed.
In addition to the constructional disadvantages there are various disadvantages in operation.   While the smaller vessels can he docked and handled at many pcrts in England and the Continent, the mammoth- ship is restricted to the use of the largest ports, and facilities for repair are even worse.   The Gladstone Dock, Liverpool is the only commercial dock in which they can be taken fully laden, and they can use only four other commercial docks partially laden.   The Admiralty Docks and Pontoons at Rosyth, Portsmouth and Invergordon could handle mammoth ships, but are required for other purposes.In view of the above considerations, the Admiralty do not recommend the construction of mammoth ships at the present time, and the Shipping Controller is in agreement with this view.(initialled) A.G.A.(Initialled)   L.H. 10,8,17.
