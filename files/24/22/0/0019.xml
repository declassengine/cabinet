DESPATCH.   C3. From Brigadier-General A. KNOX, Military Attache.Subject.   MILITARY RIOTS IN PETROGRAD ON THE 16th AND 17thJULY, 1917.British Embassy, Petrograd.22nd July, 1917.A short account of the military riots which took place in Petrograd on the 16th and 17th July may be of interest.The 1st Depdt Machine-Gun Regiment was the prime mover in what was meant to be a military revolt. This regiment is one of four formed last autumn to supply trained machine-gunners to regiments of the line. On the 12th March it mustered 19,000 men. On the 16th July it had dwindled to 6,000-7,000 men, simply owing to desertion,, for, in the intervening four months it had not supplied a single man to the front. Immediately after the Revolution it established its headquarters in the Peopled Palace and for weeks refused to move in spite of the efforts of the workman Godev who was charged by the then Minister of War, Guchkov, to reason with the men.As in the case of all bad units the disaffection was led by an ensign in this case Semashko. He was arrested in June by Kerenski&apos;s orders as a deserter, but was liberated soon afterwards by the Guard upon the demand of the men. Next day Semashko led the regiment through the main streets of the capital in procession trailing its machine guns.   The Government did nothing and the citizens trembled.On Sunday the 15th July the regiment held a meeting in the People&apos;s Palace. &quot; The proceedings,&quot; wrote the Pravda in a number which it is hoped will be its last &quot; were remarkable for the exceptional enthusiasm of the ripening revolutionary move-men t.&quot; The men were addressed by the two Bolsheviki, Trotski and Lunarcharski. They were finally roused to grim indignation by the description of a soldier, just returned from the front, of the brutal disbandment of the Grenadier Regiment of the Guard for merely refusing to go to the trenches when ordered.The Depot Battalion of the Grenadier Regiment had corrupted by its drafts one of the finest regiments in the Russian Army. It agreed to demonstrate with the machine gunners.There was an all-night sitting of Bolsheviki at Lenins headquarters, the house of the dancer Kshinskaya. Lenin himself was absent in Pinland and only returned on Tuesday.On Monday, delegates were sent to all the units in Petrograd inviting them to come out armed.   The invitation met in most cases with a flat refusal.About 8 p.m. the 1st Machine-gun Regiment, with Semashko at its head, the Grenadier Dep6t Battalion and the Moscow Depdt Battalion marched south across the Troitski Bridge and past the Embassy, accompanied by large crowds of armed workmen. They seized all the automobiles on the streets and armed them with machine guns, men with fixed bayonets as usual lying along the splash boards to frighten women. The demonstration was joined by part of the. Pavlovtski Battalion, the 1st, 3rd, 176th and 180th Depot Regiments, the 6th Dep6t Engineer Battalion and the 89th and 90th Drujini of Opolchenie.The more respectable members of the &quot; Militia,&quot; who had been masquerading as police since March, went home ; the others joined the rioters.The crowd separated into two groups, one going west to the Marie Palace, where the ministers usually meet, and the other east to the Duma.Banners proclaimed &quot; Down with the ten capitalist ministers &quot; and,&quot; All the power to the Council of Workingmen and Soldier Deputies,&quot; excuses peculiarly idiotic, for several of the &quot; capitalist&quot; ministers had resigned a few hours before, and the Council of Workingmen and Soldier Deputies had repeatedly stated that it was working in complete harmony with the Provisional Gove rnment, and did not desire to usurp its powers.(B17/510)   20   8/17   HAS   4900wo
The Ministers were not at the Marie Palace, so the western column of rioters proceeded to the Nevski Prospekt, and practical men commenced looting shops.At the Duma a meeting of the working rnens section of the Council of Working-men and Soldier Deputies had been hastily summoned. It consisted largely of Bolsheviki. Zinoviev [alias Apfelbaum, Lenins chief lieutenant) appealed for stronger measures against the anti-revolutionist tendencies of the bourgeois ministers, of the officers at General Headquarters, and the permanent officials at the Ministries. &quot; The counter - revolutionary agitation,&quot; he proclaimed, &quot; is being carried on -with the participation of prominent Allied diplomatists. In the environs of Petrograd are stationed Cossack regiments of anti-revolutionary tendencies, about which even Kerenski is ignorant.&quot;The Commander-in-Chief Polovtsev had taken snch measures as were possible. Some weeks before he had wheedled 380 of its 800 machine guns from the 1st Machine-Gun Eegiment, and had sent them to the front. He had removed the shell from the Michael School of Artillery, so the guns which the insurgents captured were of no use to them. He now called out the eight squadrons of Don Cossacks, the only immediately available troops on whom he could depend for active work. They formed a mobile reserve in the courtyards of the Anichkov and Winter Palaces, and they were in time to prevent the rioters from seizing the cars of the Automobile Company. Polovtsev sent the Volinski Depot Battalion to guard the Duma &quot; as in the days of the Great Revolution.&quot; He called a guard of the Preobrajenski Regiment to protect the District Offices.The staff remained quite cool though none of its members slept for three nights. They had not sufficient force at first to attempt interference with the demonstration and had to wait till the bulk of the garrison declared itself.There was a certain amount of shooting on Monday night but none by the supporters of the Government. An insurgent car drove up the Nevski with a machine gun. Some of the onlookers hooted and the car opened fire killing and wounding a large number of spectators and 40 of the demonstrators from the Pavlovtski Battalion.To all appearances the town was completely in the power of the insurgents all Tuesday the 17th. Some 6,000 soldiers and sailors arrived from Kronstadt and paraded through the principal streets to the Duma in the afternoon with such inscriptions on their banners as : &quot;A separate peace with William 1 Down with the French and English capitalists !&quot;At 3 p.m. the situation was very critical. The Socialist Minister Chernov tried to address the Kronstadt mutineers at the Duma but was promptly arrested and very roughly handled. He was only released upon the intervention of two of his associates of politics a shade more advanced. The incident is in no way to be regretted but it showed the dangerous tendencies of the crowd.The Council of Workingmen and Soldiers&apos; Deputies issued a proclamation strongly condemning the armed demonstration. On the other hand some anarchists seized the Novoe Vremya offices and issued leaflets ridiculing Kerenski as a &quot; little Napoleon &quot; and calling on the troops to elect delegates to a &quot; revolutionary committee to control the Council of Workingmen and Soldiers&apos; Deputies.&quot;At this time the Staff had in hand for active operations eight squadrons of Cossacks, a few squadrons of Dep6t Cavalry, a battery of Horse Artillery and the yunkers of the Paul and Vladimir Military Schools (some 240 in all). It was known, however, that the bulk of the garrison had so far refused to join the insurgents.In the evening most of the Kronstadt contingent returned to the Fortress, rather depressed, with the exception of those who had looted private apartments.In the evening the Staff sent out four Cossack patrols of a squadron each. One of these, soon after passing the Embassy, was ambushed and suffered heavily. The insurgents were incensed against the Cossacks. A motor car carrying some of the dead was stopped and the bodies were thrown out. A wounded Cossack was unmercifully beaten.There was heavy rain on Tuesday night and on Wednesday morning, and this helped to cool down excitement.It was at 3 p.m. on the 17th when things seemed nearly hopeless that a group of officials of the Ministry of Justice took the step which the best judges now consider saved the situation. The Ministry was in possession of material proving the connection of the Bolsheviki with German propaganda. The officials considered that the Provisional Government was doomed and they knew that the triumph of the Bolsheviki meant the destruction of such inconvenient material. They took their information to the District Staff, and with the consent of the Minister of Justice, made a communication
to an evening&apos; paper, the Jivoe Slovo (Living Word). As time was pressing they considered even this step insufficient and they communicated the broad outline of the contents of their dossier to the men of the Preobrajenski Battalion. The Minister of Ways, Nekrasov, in order to obtain favour with the Council of Workingmen and Soldier Deputies, who had good reason to fear disclosures, did all he could to prevent them, but failed.   The news spread rapidly, and by Wednesday morning the situation was saved.Early on Wednesday the bridges were opened to prevent further processions. The Yunkers and detachments of the Preobrajenski Battalion disarmed parties of insurgents in the streets.   Terrorist automobiles disappeared.In the afternoon the prominent Bolsheviki Kamenev (alias Rosenfeldt) came to the District Staff to get a permit. When he was about to leave the troops interfered and asked that he should be arrested. It was good to observe the fine indignation with which his companion Lieber asked whether the soldiers or the Commander-in-Chief gave orders in the Petrograd Military District.By Wednesday evening most of the units that had taken part in the demonstration had expressed their regret and had promised to be good in future.The troops ordered from the front-the 14th Cavalry Division, a cyclist battalion and a brigade of the 45th Division commenced to arrive on Wednesday night.The District Staff took the offensive on Thursday morning. Kshinskaya&apos;s house was occupied about 8 a.m., but most of its garrison had fled to the Fortress of Peter and Paul. As in the case of fighting the Embassy would have come under the fire of the insurgents, the Minister of Foreign Affairs asked the Ambassador to move to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but the Ambassador and his family refused. After much parleying some 700 men chiefly of the 1st Machine-Gun Regiment and of the Kronstadt garrison surrendered about 3 p.m. Their arms were taken but none of the men were detained.There was much firing at intervals on Friday night but few casualties. A sailor and two soldiers caught red handed with a machine gun were litterally torn to pieces and this had a quieting effect. The casualties of the week are estimated at from 700 to 1,000. They were almost all caused by the insurgents and the victims were peaceful citizens and fellow rioters.The bulk of the rioters were arrant cowards. A group of Kronstadt republicans were crossing the Troitski bridge when the 12 o&apos;clock gun went off. They threw themselves flat in the mud and remained there for upwards of a minute.The guilty units are being disarmed with the exception of the Kronstadt people, whose turn it is hoped will come later. The 1st Machine-Gun Regiment was disarmed on Saturday and the Grenadier Battalion on Saturday night. The following depot units will be disarmed in succession : Moskovski and Pavlovtski Battalions, 1st, 3rd, 176th and 180th Regiments. Some of the men are being sent to the front and others are being drafted into labour battalions.The revolt was ill organized and premature. That it nearly succeeded is simply evidence of the volcano on which we have been living.When events took a turn for the better on Wednesday, the 18th, the Ambassador gave the Minister of Foreign Affairs the following paper :-If the Government gains the upper hand in the present crisis and wishes to continue the war effectively in concert with the Allies, it is suggested that the Committee of Public Safety should 1. Re-establish the death penalty throughout Russia for all individuals subject tomilitary and naval law. 2. Require the units who took part in the unlawful demonstration of Monday andTuesday, the 3rd and 4th July, to give up agitators for punishment. 3. Disarm all workmen in Petrograd.4. Establish a military censorship of the Press with authority to confiscate themachinery of papers inciting the troops or the population to conduct to theprejudice of good order and military discipline. 5. Establish a police-militia in Petrograd and other large towns under woundedofficers from soldiers who have  been wounded at the front, choosingpreferably men of 40 years and over. 6. Disarm all units in Petrograd and district who do not agree to the aboveconditions and transform them into labour battalions.i. /Some of jthese.suggestions are being complied with but only in a half-hearted manner.   Very few of the workmen have been disarmed.   The Minister of War has(4900) A 2
at last prohibited the circulation of the Pravda and the Trench Pravda in the army at the front, but he has taken no steps to establish a military censorship.It seems very unlikely that the death penalty in military law will be officially re-established, but it may come in practice. To-day&apos;s communique states that the Commander-in-Chief of the South-West Front has given orders that runaway soldiers are to be fired upon.The disaster to the Russian arms now in progress on the South-West Front was, of course, forseen by everyone, even civilians, except fools and idealists.The Russian Government has been warned repeatedly. The Ambassador warned Kerenski at his first interview on or about the 20th March of the certain result of the undermining of military discipline. Kerenski replied: &quot; We are not fools, we are grown-up men, we know Russia and we consider that the course we are following is the only one that will lead to the desired ends.&quot; The Ambassador warned Prince Lvov on the 14th April, and on the 1st May handed the paper of which a copy is attached (Appendix A.) to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. On the 7th May he took the notes of which a copy is attached in Appendix B. to an interview with M. Kerenski. Warnings and remonstrance had no effect. The Allies were called pessimists for their pains. The autocracy brought Russia very near to disaster, but the flabbiness of the Government which succeeded it has done the country and the cause of the Allies more harm in four months than the autocracy accomplished in two and a half years.No one, Russian or foreigner, can foresee what will now happen. There may be a military dictatorship. There is a chance that the new Government may be formed on a broader basis, and allowed to work unfettered by interference. The power of the &quot; Council&quot; has been much weakened by the revelations of the Intelligence Department, for it drew its influence, though the majority of its members were nominally opposed to the Bolsheviks, from the effect of the brutal Socialist propaganda on the nerves of the Government. It made a bad blunder by trying to burk the enquiry into the connection of the Bolsheviki with German agitation by appointing a committee of five full-blooded Jews to enquire into the charges-Messrs. Lieber, Gotz, Dan, Krokhmal, and Goldmann. On the other hand, though one German organization has been struck at, there are many others. The people are all sick of the war. They don&apos;t want to fight, and the majority would welcome in their ignorance any crowning disaster that would force Russia into a separate peace.It is difficult to hope that it is not already too late to save the Army,ALFRED KNOX, Brigadier-General,.Military Attache, Petrograd,
APPENDICES.APPENDIX A.LETTER PROM MILITARY ATTACHE TO THE AMBASSADOR ON THE 1st MAY.The Ambassador,On the 14th April you read the following statement to Prince Lvov : &quot; Agitation in the Russian Army. &quot; Even in peace time politics should never be allowed in an army.&quot; The state of the Petrograd garrison is evident. Three-fourths of the officers, including all the best, have been expelled by the men, who do exactly as they like. No work is being done. No officer dares to give a punishment.&quot;Perhaps the state of the Petrograd garrison is unavoidable, but there is no excuse for allowing agitators to visit troops at the front. If the visits of politicians of every shade of opinion to the army area were stopped, the unfortunate officers might have some chance of restoring discipline before active operations commence. If these visits continue the Russian Army will not be able to pin down the 72 German and 42 Austrian divisions now in the Eastern Theatre, and a large part of these divisions will be added to the 147 divisions with which Russia&apos;s allies have to contend in the Western Theatre. In other words, it is Russia&apos;s allies that will have to pay for the demoralization that is being allowed to set in in the Russian Army in the Field.&quot; Discipline is everything in contemporary war. The discipline in the Russian army under the old regime was always less severe than in other armies. If the present agitation is allowed to continue there will be no discipline whatsoever left.&quot;Prince Lvov replied that the Army was a better fighting machine than it had ever been and that it was quite well able to deal with agitators.I returned to Petrograd from a visit to the Northern Front on the 28th April. I gave you my opinion of the deplorable state of things at the front. Units have been turned into debating societies, the infantry refuse to allow the guns to shoot at the enemy, parleying in betrayal of the Allies and .of the best interests of Russia takes place daily with the enemy who laughs at the credulity of the Russian peasant soldier. Many senior officers complained that the Government, to whom every army has a right to look for support, had left all the burden of dealing with agitation to the army.In Petrograd things are growing daily worse. The tens of thousands of able-bodied men in uniform who saunter about the streets without a thought of going to the front or of working to prepare themselves for war, when every able-bodied man and most of the women in England and France are straining every nerve to beat the common enemy, will be a disgrace for all time to the Russian people and their Government.Even Lenin disclaims the idea of a separate peace, but his agitation tends to the same end by the utter ruin it is bringing on the Russian Army. ^The movement of German troops to the Western Theatre you foretold to Prince Lvov on the 14th April is going on. Here are details of accessions of enemy strength in the respective theatres from the 15th March, when Germany first heard of the Russian Revolution, till the 10th May : To the Western Theatre. From the Eastern Theatre, established ..      .. .. .. 5 divisions.,,            ,,            surmised-. ..      .. .. .. 13 ,,From the interior bf Germany        .. .. .. ..10 ,,To the Eastern Theatre. From the Western Theatre, established ..      .. .. .. 1 ,,,,           ,,            surmised ,.      ,. .. .. 2 .,Prom the interior of Germany       ..      ..      ..       ....     3      ,,It is necessary for us to arrive at some conclusion as to whether the Russian Army will bo able to fight. No army in the history of the world has ever fought with such anti-war agitation in rear as is now permitted by the Government in Petrograd.I consider the following steps should be taken immediately :-1. The recommendations of General Polivanovs committee regarding committees should be taken into everyday use at once in every army in their entirety.2. The army must be isolated from political pollution till the end of the war. No Bolshevik should be allowed near the army.   Any found in the army area should be dealt with by the army command.3. All anti-war agitation, including such papers as the Pravda, Soldatskaya Pravda and the Novoya Jizu, must be suppressed at once.4. Anti-war agitators, such as Khaust and Sievers in the 436th Regiment, must be arrested and confined.5. All parleying with the enemy must be stopped.1st May, 1917.
APPENDIX B.NOTES PEE PARED FROM AMBASSADORS INTERVIEW WITH KERENSKI ON 7th MAY.Russia&apos;s allies have serious cause for complaint. Six weeks have now passed since the revolution which was accomplished not by the &quot;proletariat&quot; but by a union of all classes. In this 6 weeks the army has been reduced to an armed mob by the expulsion of the best officers and the slackening of all sense of discipline.The army will never be able to fight unless it has a united public opinion in favour of the war in rear.In Petrograd an anti-war propaganda is being openly conducted. The ignorant Russian workmen and idle Russian soldier are told that it is the capitalists of England that wanted the war and that it is they that are forcing Russia to continue to wage it. If this propaganda is continued it will in a short time be safer to wear German uniform in Petrograd than British.The old Government ziever taught public opinion in Russia why the allies are fighting : Austria&apos;s attack on Serbia and Germany&apos;s invasion of Belgium. This did not matter as the old Government did not depend on public opinion.   Public opinion now counts and the Government does nothing to instruct it.The present Government takes no steps to stop attacks on the allies. It interferes in nothing and allows Germany&apos;s paid agents to do their work.The Russian socialists tbink they will get peace by coquetting with the German social democrats. The Germans are simply fooling them while France and England do the fighting.Petrograd, to-day, with its enormous masses of uniformed men doing nothing and unwilling to go to the war is a disgrace to the Russian Government, who know that all of the manhood of England and France are fighting and working for the cause of freedom and not only talking about it.M. Kerenski is the most powerful man in Russia, to-day.He must know that a war engineered by the capitalists of England is an impossibility. Does he imagine that we are so fond of our capitalists that four million men of all classes would volunteer to risk their lives for them ?M. Kerenski makes many speeches about the &quot;sun of freedom.&quot;   Why does he never say anything- to turn peopie&apos;s thoughts towards the vigorous prosecution of the war so that it may be ended this year ? Why does he say nothing to squash the cowardly attacks on Russia&apos;s allies &apos;iThe chief note of Tuesday&apos;s demonstration was robbery of land and confiscation of capital. There is a good deal of British capital in Russia now, and if Russia is to develope after the war she will require British and American capital. Does M. Kerenski think that any sane foreigner would invest a penny in Russia at present ?
