Since the beginning of the war 762,371 pensions, including children&apos;s allowances , have &quot;been awarded.supplementary pensions and special allowances were made by the Statutory Committee against 48 in the previous week. The total number to date is 4,278.disabled soldiers dealt with by the Awards to Soldiers Branch during ttLP week ending 8th August was 3,800 as compared with 4,500 during the previous wee3c, and 4,900 during the week before.the award of pension, permanent or temporary, and 1,231 by the grant of gratuities, and in 8 cases the claims were rejected.     Claims which had previously been rejected under former Warrants were admitted in 420 cases, 399 of the men being granted gratuities and 21 pensions.   The total number of claims previously rejected which have been dealt with up to date is 6,291 of which 945 have been met by the award of pension and 5,346 by gratuities.A return showing month by month down to July 31st the pension claims of dtsaoled soldiers dealt with by theMinistryTable II shows that last week 30 grants ofThe number of fresh claims to pension ofOf the 3,800 cases 2,561 were disposed of by
Ministry of Pensions is annexed as-Appendix I hereto. 5. The work of awarding and authorising..paymentof Widows and Dependants pensions in current cases is completely up to date.2,586 re-assessments of dependants pensions were made during the week against 3,125 last week and 3,002 the week before.     There remain 30,819 cases to be dealt with (Appendix II).     The 2,586 cases this week include 688 dependants pensioned under the olfl Warrant who have benefitted by the re-assessment to the average extent of 4/6 a week, and 480 dependent parents whose eases had been settled by a gratuity under the Old Warrant but have now been placed on pension at an average rate of 7/6 a week. The rest of the 2,586 receive no benefit, their pensions already being equal to pre-war dependanoe.As a result of the week&apos;s re-examinations as to entitlement under the new Warrant, 15 widows not previously helped have been admitted to full pension, and 18 to temporary pensipn, while in 27 cases it has not been found possible to give help.     83 (widows and dependants) remain to be dealt with out of the original total of 4,523. (Appendix III).4. The grants made to widows when they are notifiedof their husbands1 deaths are now being issued at the  5 rate approved by the Treasury as a modification of the Royal Warrant.     The issue of the additional  2 to bring the grants issued since the 4th April up to this amount has been started.   11,000 authorities for payment of the  5 grants in cases of death on or after the 1st July,1916, notified beforenthe 4th April 1917, have been sent to the Pension Issue Office and the issue of these also is about to begin.   About 28,000 notifications have still to be sent to the Pension Issue Office.
5. On the 6th instant the Treasury notified theirapproval to a recommendation of the Minister that in deciding as to awards of pension there should be some extension of the interpretation hitherto given to attributability in the case of accidents ocourring off duty.6. A start has been made in bringing into operationthe provisions of the New Warrant for Army Officers and Nurses.   New cases which had been held heck for two or three weeks are first being dealt with, and the work of re-assessing past cases will then be taken up.   A communique was sent to the principal newspapers and has been published in issues of the 11th instant deprecating unnecessary correspondence and explaining in what ^cases application is, or is not, required. 7. At the request of Members of the House ofCommons associated with the Parliamentary \7ar Pensions Bureau the Minister of Pensions and Sir Arthur Boscawen attended a Meeting at the House of Commons, at which some 20 Members were present and explained certain features bf the new Army Officers1 Warrant.   The Members were satisfied on most points, but are to hold a further Meeting after receiving a written statement from Mr. Barnes.8. A criticism of the provisions of the Warrantrelating to the retired pay of Officers of the Regular Army has appeared in the &quot;Morning Post&quot;.   The writer, who signs himself &quot;Old Comtemptible&quot; is himself a Regular Officer disabled by -Wounds.   The &quot;Morning Post&quot; has published a signed reply from the Minister, but the critic has written a further challenge and a brief answer to this letter which contains fresh errors is under consideration^
9. The draft Orders In Council for Naval Officers,Nurses and Warrant Officers, have been submitted to the Treasury,   These follow the lines of the Army warrant and the cost is not considerable.   It is hoped therefore that there will be little further delay before they can be publi shed.TREATI.flS.vJT *10. The Twentieth Meeting of the Committee on Institu-tional Treatment in England &amp;   &quot;Tales was held on the 9th August.    The Report is annexed as Appendix IV hereto, and deals largely with financial matters which owing to the diversity of the arrangements at the different classes of institution present some complications.11, Appendix V gives the classification of the di3abil-ities for which officers and men of both the Army and .!avy have been discharged (A) during the month of July 1917 and (B) since the beginning of the &apos;..&apos;ar up to the 31st July 1917. 12. Appendix VI gives the numbers of limbless menadmitted or awaiting admission to fitting hospitals or other-wise dealt with up to the 31st July,    It shows a total of 19,259 against last month&apos;s total of 10,266 and a waiting list of 7,799 against last month&apos;s figure of 7,494 - an increase of 305, .During July the following numbers were admitted to and discharged from the various limb-fitting hospitals:-Name of Hospital                                    Number NumberAdmitted, Discharged -Roehampton House.                ..,                 445 409Dover House (Officers)        ....              32 33Prince of -Tales Hospital, Cardiff 20 81 Princes Louise!s Scottish Hospital,Glasgow ..,                  129 93Edenhall Hostel, Xelso.       .4.                  30 27Duke of Connaught&apos;s Hospital, Bray. 30 18 Ulster Volunteer Force Hospital, elfast ,.,                  17 9753 620As
5,454From the beginning of the War to the end of June 690 totally blind soldiers and sailors had been admitted to the Blinded Soldiers1 and Sailors1 Hostel, St. Punstan&apos;s Regents Park, and its annexes of whom 277 had passed through.   Of this number 239 had been fully trained and set up for themselves, and the remaining 38 owing to mental and physical disability had left without being set up.   During July 31 men were admitted and 20 discharged, and at the end of the month there were 413 in residence.   110 in hospital were to follow when fit to be discharged from the Army. 14. Representations have been made by Local Committeesand others that considerable hardship is caused to discharged men whose teeth have had to be extracted during their military service and who under arrangements hitherto existing, were not (Supplied with artificial teeth.   In certain cases chiefly in Gastric complaints a man.s teeth have been extracted as a necessary incident of the treatment otherwise given him.   Arrangements have nov? been made by which artifi* clal teeth may be supplied to discharged soldiers and sailors at public expense;-As far as can be ascertained Dover House has fitted 379 officers with artificial limbs from the opening of the hospital in June 1915 till the 31st July 1917.   117 were undergoing treatment or otherwise, being looked after from there on the latter date, and 160 were on a waiting list. 656 officers cases were thus accounted for. 13. The number of pensioners with injured eyesight,as shown by Appendix V is as followsArmy Warrant Officers, N.C.O. *s and men   ... 4,714Seamen and Marines       ...        *..     * *     * * * w3Army officers              * * *        ........ 33Navy Officers              ...         ........ 14
(1)    Where the dental defect requires the provision of artificial teeth and such defect can be attributed to conditions arising from or aggravated by Naval or Military service, those conditions to be assumed in any case where the manfs teeth have been extracted while in the service; and (2)   Where the discharged man is undergoing treatment and the artificial teeth are reported to be necessary for the efficacy of that treatment.   The Ministry have been in consultation with the Ivory Cross Society, a voluntary Organ-isation formed for the purpose of supplying artificial teeth to disabled men and others in need of assistance of this nature and it is proposed to take advantage of the Panel of Dentists throughout the Kingdom with which this Society have made arrangements, for the purpose of this supply both in cases where it can be made at the public expense under the above conditions and in other cases which the Society are prepared to deal with at their own expense.15.       A third Meeting of the Committee referred to inwas heldparagraph 9 of last week&apos;s report/to determine the distinction to be drawn between attributable and non-attributable cases of insanity.   The Committee have submitted on the 10th instant the Formula and directions embodied in Appendix VII of this Report.Arrangements have now been made with the Scottish Board of Control for the treatment of men discharged from military service on account of mental affection as service patients in District and Rural Asylums in Scotland.   The arrangement is in terms similar to that agreed to with the English Board of Control.16.      The Instructions recently issued by the Ministry for the Treatment and Training of Disabled Men require that before treatment is given by Local Com. ittees a certificate shouldbe
be obtained from a tiedical Referee appointed by the Minister indicating the nature of the manfs disability and the form of treatment required.   Ah advertisement has been inserted in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; and the!Wcet&quot; inviting applications from doctors for posts of Medical Referees.   It is uncertain at present what number of referees will be required but it is contemplated that one at least will be appointed for every town of 50,000 population, who will examine not only cases arising in the town but also in the surrounding district.   A copy of the terms of appointment and the qualifications required for the post are given in Appendix VIII.17. The Instructions for treatment and training requirethat Local Committees should make use of all Institutional facilities for treatment existing in their area and to assist Local Committees in ascertaining the Institutions available and t - make arrangements with them lists of the Military, Auxiliary and other Hospitals known to the Ministry are being oirculated to them and at the same time to the Joint Disablement Committees recently set up.   The Joint Committees should be in a better position than many of the smaller Local Committees to ascertain and make the necessary arrangements for the treatment required.18&apos; Appendix IX shows that general schemes of treatmenthave been submitted by the Counties of Essex and Huntingdon ondby the Town of Leicester, and have been sanctioned.Special sanction was given during the week ended the8th August to treatment in 54 individual cases outside approvedgeneral schemes.   Appendix 10 gives a list of these cases andAppendix XI shows that 92 men were admitted to treatment duringthe week of whom 60 went to hospitals or other institutions.notifications to This list prepared from/the Pension Issue Office, is notexhaustive but will in future weeks, when the new arrangements are in fuller operation, become more complete.
TRAINING,19. Appendix XII shows the principal scheme^ whichhave been submitted to the Ministry during the week.   The only prpposal of a novel character as regards Industrial Training is that for training disabled men in the ready-made clothing trade which is new under consideration.The training of disabled men for agricultural work has not made ae good progress as Industrial Training. For general agricultural work, actual work on a farm is probably the most suitable form of training that can be given, but there is no sign of any general desire to adopt this form of occupation on the part of disabled men.   Apart from the question of wages, the general conditions of the work whioh at times is necessarily heavy and involves exposure, are only suitable to a comparatively small number of disabled men.   The more scientific training offered by the Agricultural Colleges has greater possibilities, but is obviously only suited to a comparatively limited number of men.A more promising opening may perhaps be found in market gardening and in the training of men as saa11-holders. The Norwich   Looal Committee have submitted a scheme of this nature which will provide training for some 50 men on an estate a short distance from the City.   It is new being carefully considered in consultation with the Board of Agriculture from the point of view of ascertaining the likelihood of the men so trained securing a permanent live-Hhoed after their training, in the neighbourhood.The Leicester Local Committee have submitted a somewhat similar proposal for the training of a small number of men, who ultimately would, with the help probably of the Mayor1s (Voluntary) Fund, be supplied with the small capital necessary to operate a small holding successfully.
A Conference Is being arranged with the Board of Agrleul-ture to consider the means by vrtiich the training 0f disabled men in market gardening or other forms of small hold in-, c^ri be  iade to fit in with the Land Settlement Schemes which the Board of Agriculture have in hand, and more generally with the provision of small holdings under the St&amp;tutory powers possessed by County Councils.   In the meantime, however, sanction has been given to a scheme of horticultural training submitted by the Denbighshire Local Committee.    In this case it is proposed to utilise the land of the Wrexham Garden Village, belonging to the Welsh Town Planning and Housing Trust.   Details of the scheme are given in Appendix XII.SO. Sanction has been given to training in 28Individual cases as shown in Appendix XIII and In 146 cases further Information has been requested or inodifica-tion of the original proposals su$ ested.   In addition notifications have been received that 56 men were sent by Local Committees to training in factories or workshops during the week.21. A Conference was held on the loth instant toconsider the training to be offered to invalided officers, A report of this Conference is given in Appendix XIV, from which it will be seen that while the demand for training at the present time is very small it may reaaonsfcly be expected to expand.   The view of the Conference was that the most promising forms of training which can be offered would be (fi) in engineering and other branches of applied science such as chemistry, and (b) in commercial subjects of a superior k^^fe W^or^W/alning the Universities, both old and new, will be able to afford facilities.   It is proposed to formulate suggestions toofficers
officers in a note of which the Draft will be considered at a further conference.22. Major Mitchell, Adviser to the Ministry inmatters of technical training is proceding to Switzerland in connection with a scheme for training the disabled prisoners of War at various centres there.   The scheme is being financed by the Red Cross Society and the cost for the first year is estimated at  4,000.   Lord Sandwich is to preside over the training which so far as is determined is to be in making parts of pianos and in fancy leather work.   The work is to he done for Mr. John Brinsmead (piano) and Mr. Herbert Worrall (fancy leather) and the firms of these gentlemen have promised subsequent employment to any disabled man who will make himself qualified for it.ORGANISATION.23. A statement of the proceedings of the StatutoryCommittee for the week end^d *Sth August 1917, is annexed (Appendix XV).   The reports of the Inspectors of Accounts show that Middleeborough is doing well but that the disabled men &quot;avoid anything thet savours of further discipline in the way of training and treatment&quot;.   The North Riding of Yorkshire Local Committee- and those of its sub-cown ittees that have been inspected are doing well but in one of them the work is carried on in the same building as thet of the Council of Social Welfare which has disadvantages.   Tfle organisation and administration of the Dundee Conmittee require overhauling.   The Westmoreland Committee is doing well.   The conditions as regards the Pembroke Committee have Improved since the last- inspection and the latest report as to the Newport Committee is very satisfactory.
24. Applications for a separate Local Committee underSection 3 of the Naval &amp; Military War Pensions etc. Act (Administrative Expenses) of 1917, have been received from the Councils of Tunbridge Wells, Maidstone, Erith, Beckenham, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Gosport &amp; Alverstoke, Worthing. Llanelly, and Hcve.   The Minister proposes that Committees should be set up at Tunbridge Wells, Worthing and Hc*e, and is making further enquiry as regards Newcastle-v.nder-Lyme and Llanelly.   No sufficient reasons for separate Committees have been shown in the other cases.25. The Naval &amp; Military Var Pensions etc (Transferof Powers) Bill Is now awaiting the Royal Assent and condltibhaD invitations in the terms of the letter in Appendix XVI have been sent to some members of the Statutory Committee, and others to the members of the Special Grants Committee proposed to be set up under the Bill.STAFF.26. Table III shows an addition of 65 to the staffof the Committee during the week, 35 having been added to the Awards to Soldiers Branch and 27 to the Pension Issue Office, where there are now 128 holiday workers replacing girls on leave.   The staff on the books of the Ministry now comprises 169 men and 3553 women or 3722 in all.   The Statutory Committee employ 109 men and 183 women or 291 in all, bringing up the grand total to 4,013.The daily percentage   of absences during the week was 3.5 among the male and 2.9 among the female staff.The structural alterations at the Tate Gallery with a view to improving the ventilation there have beencompleted.
completed.   The Vault is; very satisfactory; an adequate supply of fresh air is secured and it is hoped this is leading to considerable improvement in the health of the staff *Jiere.M.N.11th August 1917.P,S.

APPENDIX IV. COMMITTEE ON INSTITUTIONAL TREATMENT.The twentieth meeting of the Committee was held at WestminsterHouse Millbank on Thursday the 9th August 1917,1, Present - Sir Arthur Griffith-Bosoawen and the Hon.ArthurStanley with Sir H, Hav/ard and Mr. Stannard representingSir Walter Lawrence. 2. Sir Alfred Pearce Gould Dr. R. Fox Symons and Dr. C. HubertBond were unavoidably prevented from attending, 3. Lit. Stanley read a letter from Dr. R, Fox Symons relative to the question of the payment of separation allowances to the wives of men in paraplegic institutions.     He said that following on the resolutions passed at the meeting of the Committee on 26th July with reference to paraplegics he had informed the men at Lonsdale Houso that separation allowances would be paid.     A letter had since been received from the Ministry of Pensions that the separation allowance could not be paid.     At the request of the Committee Mr. Flynn and fir. Coles attended the meeting,     A general discussion took place as to the exact position and Mr, Flynn explained the Ministry1 s attitude.     He said that the proposal had gone on to the Treasury for confirmation.     It was outside the arrangement existing between the Ministry and the Treasury.     It was agreed that Sir Arthur Boscawen and Mr, Flynn should attend at the Treasury and end^avow to havs the matter settled on the lines of the resolutions,4.   Interned Soldiers - Mr. Stanley said that he had a communication!&apos;rom the War Office regarding the Technical Instruction of British Soldiers -interned in Switzerland.     The Red Cross Society would Inanee the matter but he was desirous of bringing it undor this iommittee.     It was to be clearly understood that the bringing of -he work under the Committee did not in any way place any liability on the Ministry in connection with finance.     It was Agreed that the work should be done under the auspices ef tho Committee
Committee on Institutional Treatment, Such money as may be required to be charged on the funds paid to the Committeo by the Red Cross.5.   Monyhull - A copy of the letter dated August 1917 from the Ministry to the Clerk, Union Offices, Birmingham was read replying to the terms set out by the Guardians in their letter dated 26th July.     Some further suggestions were made. 6.   Chalfont - Account and vouchers for  1440. 3. 1. in respect, of expend&apos;.jure defrayed on Chalfont by His Majesty1 s Office of Works during the quarter ending 30th June 1917 were presented and payment sanctioned, the papers to be sent to Mr. Stanley, 7.   Maghull - A copy of the letter dated 2nd August 1917 from the Ministry to the Hon.Secretary, Bartlett Home was read and considered.8.   Great Barr Park.   Epileptic Colony.     A letter dated 19th July 1917 from the Clerk to the Walsall and West Bromwich Unions Joint Committee with regard to accommodation for discharged soldiers suffering from epilepsy was considered.     It was decided that a letter be written to the Committee thanking them for their letter and offer and Informing them that this Committee had already arranged for accommodation for epileptic patients at Monyhull Colony, Birmingham, and such accommodation would probably meet the Committees present requirements in the Midland District.     The offer would be borne in mind should further accommodation for epileptics be decided upon.

APFENDIX VII.FORMULA TO ASSIST IN DECIDING THE ELIGIBILITY FOR PENSION OF A MAN WHO HAS BEEN DISCHARGED FROM EITHER OF THE SERVICES CN ACCOUNT  F INSANITY CS WHO HAS BECOME INSANE SUBSEQUENT TO DISCHARGE.RULE 1.    A man discharged on the grounds of certifiable insanity should be regarded as pensionable unless definite evidence is forthcoming that he was the subject of insanity (which includes idiocy and advanced imbecility) at the time of enlistment or unless he is excluded by any of the conditions contained in the &quot;Directions&quot; attached hereto.RULE 3.     A man discharged on the grounds of certifiable insanity should, prima facie, be regarded as pensionable although, prior to enlistment, he may have had one attack of certified insanity.    When, however, a man has had more than one attack of certified insanity prior to enlistment, there must (to render him pensionable) be evidence that his present attack of insanity has been caused or aggravated by war service.RULE 5.    For the purpose of Article 9 of the Rt^al Warrant a man should not be regarded as pensionable, if during the period which has elapsed since he was discharged, he has been able to follow an ordinary civilian life, and no connection can reasonably be traced between the attack *f insanity and the man&apos;s previous .naval or military service,.
DIRECTIONS FOR APPLYING THE FOREGOING &quot;FORMULA&quot;.A differential diagnosis between the numerous forms of mental disorder, officially recognised for statistical purposes, is by no means an easy matter even in the hands of experts, and, in deciding whether * manfs insanity has been caused or aggravated by service, such a diagnosis, except in the cases mentioned below, need not concern those responsible for the decision,(1)   &quot;CTongenital mental, deficiency&quot; appearing on a medical report is an insufficient term to enable the case to he adequately considered, as it may include feeble-minded cases of high grade.High-grade feeble-mindedness (i.e* feeble-mindadne8s of only moderate degree), though recognised medically as a predisposing cats e of insanity, should be Ignored in assessing a case for pension purposes.(2)     Insanity associated with epilepsf Epilepsy prior to enlistment should not disentitle a man te pension on the ground that the epilepsy has occasioned an attack *f insanity which has occurred after enlistment.(3)     In cases of insanity associated with syphilis, including genera] paralysis of the insane, non-pensionability should be confined to those men , who had shown definite evidence of cerebral disease before enlistment.
(4)     Insanity associated with Alcrcholism:-(fa) The following factors should not he regarded as unfavourable to a manfs claim for a pension:-Alccholism following great mental 9r physical exhaustion, head injury, eoneussien, sun stroke, debilitating illness or fever, tile results *f war service.(b) The following factors should be taken as unfavourable to a man&apos;s claim for a pension:&apos;.**Befinite evidence that, prior to enlistment, he had had an attack of delirium tremens or been otherwise mentally affected as the result of alcoholic excess, or that he had been drinking heavily fa* a considerable period prior to enlistment or during his asavice.
APPENDIX VIII.APPOINTMENT OF MEDICAL REFEREES.The Minister of Pensions desires to appoint Local Medical Referees for the purpose of medical examination and certification under the terms of the Royal Warrant and Order in Council, and the Instructions issued by him for their administration.Qualifications.-Ihe qualification primarily required will be that of a registered medical practitioner of substantial experience in general practice. Weight will be given to the possession of official experience in the R.A.M.C. or otherwise in military or auxiliary hospitals in the treatment of men injured in the present war, or experience as a certifying factory surgeon or as a medical referee under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act. Duties. A Medical Referee will be required(a) To examine all persons duly referred to him under the instructions of the Minister of Pensions by the Local Committee or by the Minister. (6) To give a medical certificate on the form prescribed in all such cases.(c) To advise and to report in the prescribed form on all cases submitted to him for report where personal examination of a man is unnecessary.[The duties are indicated in more detail in the accompanying Extract from the &quot; Instructions and Notes on the Treatment and Training of disabled men.&quot;]Remuneration. Remuneration will be by fee at the rate of ox. for each case personally examined and certified or reported 011 without personal examination. Appointments will be ter-ininable at one month&apos;s notice.Areas. A Medical Referee will not be appointed necessarily to a particular Local Committee or a defined area, but will be required to certify or report on cases which can more convenently be referred to him than to another Referee. One Referee will probably be appointed in the first instance in each Town with over 50,000 population, and for such other districts as may be found to form convenient centres of population.A Medical Referee will not be required to travel; persons referred to him will be required to preseut themselves at his Surgery or at any other convenient place which he may appoint.Extract from the Instructions for the Treatment and Tkaining of Disabled Men.12. Subject to the foregoing Instruction any disabled man who applies to the Local Committee for treatment, or who is found to be in need of treatment, shall be referred for medical, examination in the first instance to the Medical Referee appointed by ihe Minister of Pensions :  Provided that if the Local Committee are satisfied on any certificate, given by a general practitioner in attendance on(12734.)   Wt. 24449-G- 52.   2000.   8/17.   D &amp; S.   G. 2.
the ruan or otherwise, that the case is one requiring immediate and urgent treatment, or unnecessary delay or inconvenience would be caused by requiring the man to be examined by the Medical Eeferee, they may, after consultation with the Medical Referee, send the man at once to the nearest military Hospital (if the case is one of wound or injury) or (in any other case) to the appropriate civil hospital witb which arrangements have been or may be made.13. (1) The Medical Referee shall in every case referred to him give a certificate in the form prescribed by the Minister of Tensions, and shaii, if he considers that the case requires Insiitu-tional treatment, deal with it as follows:  [a) If the case is one in which he is satisfied that the dis-ability is due to a wound or injury sustained in naval or military service, and requires surgical (including orthopaedic) treatment, whether residential or other-wise, he shall recommend tbe Local Committee to refer tbe case to a suitable military hospital.(b) In any other case he shall recommend the Local Coni-mittee to refer the man to the general or special hospital suitable to tbe circumstances of tbe case, witlt which arrangements have been or are made with the authorities of such hospital by the Local Committee ni accordance with Instruction 8.(2) The Medical Referee shall be furnished by the Local Coin-mittee with a copy of any medical certificate or report in their possession relating to any case referred to hiin.(3) The reasonable travelling and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the man for purposes in connection with his examina-tion and treatment may be defrayed by the Local Committee.
APPENDIX IX. SCHEMES OF TREATMENT.ii A scheme comprising the various General andPrivate Hospitals and Convalescent Homes with which arrangements for Treatment are proposed to he made has been submitted by the Leicester Local Committee, and provisional sanction has been accorded pending the submission o  a more completo scheme in co-operation with the County.2.        The Essex Local Committee have submitted a list of the V.A.D. and Auxiliary Hospitals situated in their County with a description of the nature of the Treatment available in each.     The use of the insti-tutions specified has been sanctioned provisionally, subject to the completion of the list* 3, The Huntingdonshire Local Committoe have4applied for sanction to use the following hospitals,-Addonbrooke1s Hospital, Cambridge,Peterboro1 InfirmaryThe County Hospital (Huntingdon).This proposal has been sanctioned provisionally and general instructions for the preparation of a more complete scheme of treatment have been issuedf

APPENDIX XII.SCHEMES FOR TRAINING.* *1.    A scheme has been submitted by the Newcastle-on-Tyne Local Committee to establish a centre for training as electzrieity sub-station attendants at the J &amp; J. Cowen School.    The Local Committee have been advised to con-suit the local branch of the Electrical Trades Union before making formal application to the Minister for sanction to the scheme.2,    The Fifeshire Local Committee have renewed their application for sanction to a proposal to provide train-ing in switch-hoard work at the Cowdenbcath Mining School, In view ojf the fact that the instruction in this process forms only a small part of the general course in electri-cal Engineering, previously approved by the Statutory Committee, the desired sanction has been given.     The question of the desirability of continuing to provide instruction in this subject both at Cowdenbeath and al3o at Edinburgh is to be referred to the Joint Committee for Central Scotland at their next meeting. 3.     Mr. Salaman of Circus Street, Harylebono Rd, W., has submitted a proposal for training disabled men in the Ready-made clothing trade.    Mr. Salaman, who is a Con-tractor for clothing to the War Office, stated that this trade had previously been in the hands of the Russians and that owing to their return to Russia, the consequent shortage of labour in the trade, the increasing demand for ready-made clothing and the growth of export trade, there was a good opening for trained men, who should obtain permanent employment in this industry at a wage of 35/- to  3. per week.    The work is done entirely by machinery and many of the machines can be managed bymen
men disabled by the lose of a leg or Injuries in the lower part of the body*    Mr. Salomon stated that he would fee prepared to take disabled men on trial for ft week end If s&amp;tiefied that thoy were likely to be satisfactory, he would then engage them at  1* per week with a rise of 5/- per week until they were able to earn 35/- per weok on piece rate wages*    This proposal will be considered in consult-atlon with the Ministry of Labour.4.    Sanction has been given to the scheme submitted by the Swindon Local Committee f^r training disabled men in Tracter work, Ploughing and General Agricultural Engineering at the works of Mr- E.C,Stairway, whe is the Government Tractor representative for the district.5*    The proposal of the Local Committoe for Denbighshire to establish a Horticultural Training Centre for disabled men at The Wrexham Garden Village has been sanctioned, on con-dltion that the Local Committee exercise great care in the selection of men to bo trained and that the training extends over a period of 12 months.    The Local Committee have boen informed that in the case of a man, who intends to become a small holder on the completion of his training, and is financially able to do so, the Minister will be prepared to consider favourably an application for the extension of tho course up to a maximum period of two years, provided that e  report by a competent expert Is furnished before tho end of the first year, stating that the additional training would bo justified.    The expenses incidental to tho first yoar^ training ere to bo met by the HHelsh Town-Planning &amp; Housing Trust, and a fee not oxcoeding 7/6 per man per week is to be charged in order tu repay tho advances made by them.    It is stipulated however that the scheme Is not to be brought into operation unless at least 10 men are ready to undergo the training.    The Board ef Agriculture have been requested to arrange for the periodical inspection of the vork in order that the Minister may be assured that the training is satis-factory.

AfPEBDIX XIV,NOTE ON PROCEEDINGS OP CONFERENCE ON THE TRAINING OF INVALIDED OFFICERS. HELD AT THE MINISTRY ON AUGUST 10th.(l) Present Sir Matthew Nathan, Mr. Hore, Mr. Wynneand Major Mitchell, representing the Ministry.    Mr. Cyril Jackson, Chairman of tho Statutory Committee, Mr. Roberts representing the Cambridge Appointments Board, Mr. Allen, the Assistant Director of Education for the County of London. Mr. Barnard representing the Board of Agriculture, Mr. Sutherland representing the Board of Education , Mr. Darton, In charge of the Officers1 Employment Bureau at the Ministry of Labour and a lady representing the London School of Economics.(2) Mr. Cyril Jacksoa and Mr. Darton gave a briefaccount of the demand so far experienced for eithor employment, or training with a view to employment, among disabled officers, from which it appoared that only in four oasoa 30 far had officers asked for training.    It was gonerally agreed that the position would probably be mater-ially altered when the inducements offered by the new Royal Warrant became more generally known. (3) With rogard to the demand for employment bydisabled officers it was agreed that at present men who possessed ability or an education sufficient to enable them to take up new work, if not to rosunie their old occupation, were (unless totally disabled) able very readily to obtain employment.    Very frequently, however, such men were retained in military service on administrative work, and consequently the officers at preeont invalided who applied for employment were not fullyrepresentative
representative of the officer class.(4) The Conference proceeded to consider classes ofoccupation which with a period of training might suitably be offered to men of the officer class.     In this connection it was pointed out that a substantial proportion, 25% to Z0% of the applications so far received specified a prcfcronoc for an outdoor life.(5) The possibilities of agricultural occupation forofficers were carefully considered.     An agricultural life in this country it was agreed offered little scope fcr a man of the officer class unless either he had capital cr was prepared to work a small holding cn which he would have to do the entire work himself, and even in the latter case some small capital was necessary.     In this connection it appeared that while the Board of Agriculture were instituting three farm colonies on which prospective small holders would receive training for a year or so they had not at present decided on any similar scheme for men of the officer class, though the question had been tentatively considered.(6) Openings for agricultural employment exist no doubt inthe self-governing colonies, but it is understood that these colonies are averse to receiving men suffering from any disability such as would be likely to interfere with their value as producers and workers.    The question, however, of the training of disabled officers or men for ultimate agricultural occupation in the colonies is clearly one to be further considered in consultation with the Agenta-Oeneral of the Colonies.    In the Crown Colonies, on the ether hand, there are no doubt openings on rubber and tea plantations and for these no particular training in this country would be required.
(7) It was agreed that there were a certain number ofsubsidiary employments connected with the land for tfiich disabled officers after a period of training might be suitable, such as Inspectorships under County Councils, as Instructors in Agricultural Colleges or Inspectors under the Board of Agriculture, but unless a man had had some pre-war experience of agricultural work or a previous training that fitted him for it, the training for a year or so? which might be offered by the Ministry would not give him a sufficient knowledge of the subject to enable him to fill these appointments very sucsess-fully.     The occupation of land surveying again w^uld require a rather prolonged training ar$ in any case it appeared doubtful whether the openings in this occupation were numerous, (0) The possible openings in forestry for men of theofficer class were considered to be dependent entirely cn whether or no any large schemes ftf afforestation were started by public bodies after the war.    Apart from this; forestry did net, except in the case of men whe had had special experience before the war, offer any openings,(9) The possibilities of technical education at auniversity were then considered, and Mr, Roberts nade the proposal that there might usefully be provided - for men who had already had part of their university course -(a) a one yearJs course of training for work inindustrial concerns,(b) a six months1 course of commercial training.(10) As regardu the industrial training, it was agreedthat there were likely to be many openings in responsible positions In such trades as textile and ether insustries, at salaries commencing at  150 ta  200 a year.    It would be ordinarily necessary that a man should have an education before the war of a scientific Or mathematical character in order to enable him tc pi*fit by a single yearf8 training,    Mr. Robertsthought
thought that the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge would offer facilities for training in this direction,    Major Mitchell represented that for technical industrial work training should preferably be given in universities like Manchester an$ Liverpool where the university was situated in anindustrial centre and the training would be more specifically directed to the knowledge of particular processes. It was agreed generally that both types of university draining would serve In different cases,(11) With regard to tho Commercial course, Mr. Robertsstated that he had had many applications from firms abroaddesirous of taking men with a good education and with someknowledge of languages and of commercial correspondence.    As aandrule such offers carried good remuneration/he thought that there should be abundant scope for a course of the kind he suggested.    In this connection it was represented that the London School of Economics offered&apos;a course of general education which was designed to cultivate wider intelligence to men who propose to adopt a commercial career, (12) The question was raised aa to the possibility ofsubsidising un^*r tae Royal Warrant cases where a man desired to vtjmpiete a course of education which had already been commenced at a university or at some professional pursuit before the war. or would have been so commenced but for the war.    Subject to official decision as to whether training can be provided in cases where the manfs or officer^ disablement does not necessitate a change of, occupation or otherwise render assistance to complete his education It was agreed that any assistance given in such cases should be dependant on a definite ascertainment that the education was designed to lead to a specific occupation for which the man was suited,     In this connection it was pointedout
out that universities generally had given special facilities to students whose careers had been interrupted by their service in the war to complete their education on demobilisation or on discharge within a substantially reduced period - ordinarily a year, if they had already been a year at a university, or two years If they had not.    On this point, however, it was intimated that the Ministry had still to decide what limit, if any, either in point of time or money, should be set to the assistance which could be gives! under the Royal Warrant,
APPENDIX XVI.4589.MINISTRY OF PENSIONS, WESTMINSTER HOUSE, MILLBANK,   S.W.I.August, 1917.Sir,You   are doubtless aware that a Bill has just passed through Parliament and is awaiting the Royal Ascent to provide for tho dissolution of the Statutory Committee established under the Naval and Military War Pensions , &amp;c, Act, 1915, and for the transfer of their powers, duties, and functions to the Minister of Pensions.These powers, duties, and functions as regards organisation and as regards matters which are covered by Roya1 Warrants and Ordo rs-in-Counc il, including provisions for the health and training of disabled officers and men will in future be exercised and performed directly by the Minister,   There remain, however, large classes of individual cases, in which discretionary grants have been given in the past by the Statutory Committee, that are not covered by Warrants or Orders.The Transfer of Powers Bill creates a Special Grants Committee to deal with these cases both generally by the making.of regulations, subject to the Minister!s approval, by which grants will be governed, and individually by determining the amounts of the grants $o be made under the regulations.     The Special Grants Committee is also charged with certain other duties of which the nature will be apparent from a perusal of the enclosed extracts, viz:-los.No.l.(i) Of Clause 2 of the Naval and Military War Pensions etc., (Transfer of Powers Bill, 1917, dealing with the constitution and powers of the Special Grants Committee and
P.S.&quot;&quot;I enclose a scale of travelling expenses and allowances i to Members based on the scale approved by the Treasury for Members&apos;of the Statutory Committee which the Minister proposes to adopt for the Special Grants Committee,(ii) of Paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (fV (g), (h), and (k) of subsection (1) of Section throe of the Naval and Military War Pensions, etc. Act, 1915, to which paragraphs reference is made in (i).These extracts show the high importance of the duties imposed on the Special Grants Committee.   It is the desire of the Minister that these duties should be sympathetically and efficiently carried out so as tb  secure prompt and proper treatment of every case which should receive State assistance but which falls outside the en-actments by which that assistance is ordinarily governed and also so as to render to the Ministry real assistance by the determination of facts and in other matters.-   On the assumption that the Transfer of Powers Bill will very shortly receive the Royal Assent Mr, Barnes has now directed me to invite you to be a Member of the Special Grants Committee.It is proposed that the date for the transfer of the Statutory Committee&apos;s powers and for the setting up of the new Committee shall be the 1st September and thatthat Committee shall meet for the first time at 22,12Abingdon Street, S.w. at/noon on Monday, 3rd September.The olace, hour and day of Meeting, will, however, be confirmed to you as soon as the required steps have been taken for the transfer of powers and when you have given the favourable reply to this letter that Mr. Barnes is anxious to roceive at a very early date.i I have the honour to be,Sir,Your obedient Servant,

Ho explained the reasons for setting up Joint Committees and the functions which would ordinarily fall to them.Sir Arthur Griffith Boscawen also spoke as to the establishment of the Joint Committees and the part which they would play in the general schemes&apos;for treatment and training.The following points among others, wcro raised by thorepresentatives present:-(1) Inspection.     It was asked Sir Robert Pox whether the duties of the representative included the inspection of Local Committees.. Hr. Hincks, who followed, urged the necessity for detailed inspection.   In reply it was pointed out that the title of Inspector, to which some Local Committees had a very natural objection, had been generally avoided.   At the same time the ropresentativo was expected to keep in close touch not only with tho Joint Committee at every Meeting of which, including Meetings of its Executive, he should make a point of being presont, but also with tho Local Committees and their Disablement Sub-Committees of which as many Meetings as possible should be attended. There were good, bad, and indifferent Committees and the representatives should not only look upon themselves as the eyes and ears of the Ministry, but should endeavour without causing offence to make more efficient the Committees whose work was not satisfactory.(2) Advanced information.     Mr. Cozens Hardy asked whether advanced information could be given them in order to be able to deal more effectually with questions raised by the Joint Committees, and it was promised that this request would be met as far as possible.
(3) Payment of Doctors.   Mr, Cozens Hardy also raised points as to the question of payment of doctors at hospitals.   He was informed that the Ministry had beon in consultation on the subject with their Medical Advisers and the British Medical Association.   The question Yfas a large one affecting other Departments than the Ministry,(4) Delegation of Powers.   In reply to various questions on this point Sir Arthur Griffith Boscawen laid down the following main principles,(i) In any Joint Committee area all the Constituent Local Committees 3hould delegate the same powors.(ii) Local Committees should deal with their own men in their own area up to the limits of the facilities of their area and the power to do this should not be delegated to a Joint Committee(5) Attendance at Meetings of Local Committees and Joint fiommit*ees.      Lady Baxter asked whether the repre-sentatives had a right to do this.   It was promised that a circular should be issued notifying the appointment of the representative and requesting that he should receive an invitation to attend each Meeting of the Joint Committee of the various Local Committeos, and of their disablement sub-committees ,(6) Soldiers Unions.    In replybto questions as to whether mombers of these associations should be invited to serve on Committees, Mr. Barnes stated that he had learned with^pleasure of a number of such associations and he hoped that representatives of these associations would in many cases find places on Joint Committees and on Local Committees.(7) In reply to Mr. Hincks it was stated that it would be necessary for the representative to communicate with the Local Committees as well as the Joint Committees.
(8) Mr. Lloyd Jones asked whether the representative would he required to deal with other matters than treatment and training.   In reply it was pointed out that the sole functions of Joint Committees and therefore the main functions of the representative were comprised in treatment and training, but his assistanco in dealing with other matters would also be involved.(9) Captain Cooper and Mr. Lane referred to cases of stoppago of pensions in the case of ro-enlisted men in Ireland. Mr. Barnes pointed out that any such stoppage was entirely illegal and etated that he would have immediate enquiries made.(10) Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Barnard referred to the condition as to tubercular patients more particularly as toAdvanced cases1 and *after care1.     Sir Arthur GriffithstatedBoscawen/what was being done and could be done in these matters, more particular3ywith referenco to the establishment of extension -wards for advanced cases and farm colonies for suitable cases discharged from Sanatoria.
