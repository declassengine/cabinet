Extract from WAR CABINET 201.Minutes of a Meeting held at 10,-Downing Street, S.W, on Wednesday, August 1st, 1917, at 11.15.a.m.Ulan-Power: 1.       The War Cabinet had a preliminary discussion on a Recruiting Memorandum prepared at their request by the Director of Proposals. Recruiting.It was pointed out that the proposals involved the transfer of recruiting for the Army to a civilian organisation, and it was decided that this should be done.It was therefore necessary to decide whether this or-ganisation should be set up in a new Department or placed under an existing Department.   It was not deemed desirable to create a nm Department, and it was therefore for consideration whether the recruiting organisation should be embodied in:-(a) The Local Government Board,(b) The National Service Department,(c) The Ministry of Labour.A further question arises as to whether recruiting for shipbuilding should be under the National Service Department or the Labour Ministry.It was also pointed out that, in the War Cabinet programme of questions awaiting consideration for the current week, there are nine items dealing with Man-Power.The War Cabinet decided that a Committee composed ofLord Milner, General Smut3, and Mr. Barnes,should be formed, who should have full and final powers, on behalf of the War Cabinet, to decide, in consultation with the Depart-ments concerned^ all questions of recruiting and Man-Power, and report their decisions to the War Cabinet.
