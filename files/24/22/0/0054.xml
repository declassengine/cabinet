SECRET. S.T. 1654.WAR   CABINET.5iT.1645 I recognise that the decision must depend upon consider-ations of food supply and tonnage, and I assume that these considerations still make it necessary to restrict the output of beer to a figure much lower than the figure for 1916-17, viz. 26,000,000 standard barrels.Subject, however, to these considerations, I am of opinion that, from the point of view of the proper oontrol of the liquor traffic, It is desirable that the utmost possible alleviation of the present restriction should be allowed.-Several of the Area Reports of the Commission which has recently inquired into the causes of Industrial Unrest have given a prominent place among these causes to the so-called &quot;Liquor Restrictions&quot;,   and it appears on examination of the Reports that most of the discontent under this heading is due not to the restrictions which have been imposed by this Board, or even to the high price at which beer is sold,   but to the scarcity of beer caused by the restrictions upon output.jProm reports received, I believe that the alleviation resulting from the Food Controllers Order of the 7th of July will not prove sufficient either to meet the reasonable necessities of the population or to enable the liquor traffic to be conducted under conditions consistent with the national Interest.    Public houses are now frequently finding themselves temporarily sold out of beer and many districts are therefore suffering from alternations of drink-famine and rush-drinking which are prejudicial to public order.In these circumstances I desire to press upon the consid-eration of the War Cabinet the recommendation which the Central Control Board made in their Memorandum of the 19th of June, 1917, that beer containing not more than 8$ of proof spirit should be excluded from the restrictions on barrelage.   Under the stimulus of necessity, beer gravities have of late fallen rapidly all over the country, and light-gravity beers are appreciated to an extent which would have been thought impossible only a year ago.I believe, therefore, that the adoption of the Board1s recommendation would result in a very substantial relief being afforded, with a minimum consumption of food stuffs.     This is a result which, whether by the means suggested or in some other way, it iB urgently desirable to attain.(Sgd). D&apos;Abernon.Central Control Board (liquor Traffic) August 9th, 1917,
