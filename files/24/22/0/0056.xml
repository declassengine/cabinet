P.    Operations. SECRET.From ;-   General Barter, Russia, To :-       C.I.G.S., War Office.August 7th, 1917.Handed in 6C2 p.m.No, 1180.Up to the present I have not had a personal interview with Kornilloff hut I have received the following information from an authoritative source0 Kornilloff says ;-&quot;I made the following conditions &quot;when I was asked to take the supreme command(1),    I should be responsible for my acts tc the legal Government only.   Hence I do not recognize any committee.(2).   The application of disciplinary measures and the death penalty etc., which I have put into operation on a front, be extended to all troops in the empire.(3).   Sanction to inflict the death penalty on those commanders who do not repress lack of discipline among troops with sufficient energy.As these conditions have been accepted by the government, I consider that I shall have sufficientauthority to restore sound discipline in the Army, If the government wishes later on to restrict the authority given to.me., I shall relinquish my postc So far I have not dared to abolish committees of Armies and Army corps but I have given pointed orders that members of committees are not to leave their units whilst in the front line and that no political meetings of any kind are to take placeeCertain improvements in the 11th and 7th Army fronts have already been produced by these measures. Troops in retreat have come to a halt.    Some have even made counter-attacks,    In the 1st and 9th Armies the lack of discipline evil continues dangerouse For ,this-reason and to provide for the situation resulting from loss of Chernovits, I have split up the 1st Army and I have re-constituted the 8th Army, Those Corps of the 0th Army which are north of the , Dneister are being transferred to the 7th Army0 Thus all corps which are now south of Dneister as far as Kimpolung constitute 8th Army and is now included in Roumanian front, commander of which will have a strong force for defence of his right flank.   By Pi this arrangement the Roumanian front will be able tomaintain the position now&apos; held.   The Dneister now becomes the line of demarkation between the south-west and Roumanian fronts&quot;.The possibility
2.The possibility of furnishing the five Roumanian divisions which are now in reserve with artillery and other material, so as to have available 15 Roumanian divisions well organised and disciplined, is also being considered by Kornilloff.     The enemy&apos;s forces are not numerous.     He has re-grouped between the Dneister and the Pruth, whore ho is making his principal effort, what weak reserves he had available on the south-west front.Thus there is only a hostile curtain in front of the 11th Army.-    Kornilloff intends to profit by this situation. He hopes that in one month the 11th Army will be in the position to resume partial offensive which will be directed against the left flank of enemy forces attacking between the Dneister and Pruth.     He cannot yet say what he can do with the other armies.     I am informed personally by Kornilloff&apos;s commissary that they hope to be able to re-establish proper saluting of officers in two or three weeks.As an example of the very bad state of the 9th Army, its committee has recently issued a manifesto to the Roumanian people protesting against executions of spies and deserters in Roumania:   tchis after orders have been issued by Kornilloff and the Provisional Government for the restoration of the death penalty.
