,D/HS/48949SMM&apos;RY OF BLOCKADE Of FORMATION27th July - gad Aug. 19X7SSRMASY.A sure source reports that four million sterling ingold was expected to reach Constantinople from Germany byJuly 18,     This sum was to be expended on the purchase- of supplies.     On July 17, the Wiener Bank in Constantinople received one million sterling in gold for the same purpose, p re s mm bly from Aus tri a.In the last week of July the mark-exchange showed a further decline on the neutral European bourses.   On July 31 the Stockholm rate was 42*25, the par of exchange being 88.88. On the same day the Amsterdam rate was 33,75 (par being 59,26),     On July 30 the Swiss rate was 53.60 (par being 123.44).     Mo marked improvement is to be expected while shortage of labour and difficulties of transport prevent Germany from exporting freely to her neutral neighbours. In July the deliveries of German coal to &quot;Denmark were less than 50$ of the promised amount, and the Chamber of Manufacturers oomph in of a default in the deliveries of iron.   The Danish Government are stated to have received a warning from Berlin that all exports to Denmark will be stopped from Sept.30. owing to difficulties of transport:   but it may be doubted whether this intimation is to be taken literally.   It is clear that deliveries of coal to Switzerland will be reduced when the German-Swiss Agreement Is renewed.   The problem of railway transport in Germany will be complicated for the next two or three months by the necessity of making abnormal deliveries of coal to the home market.   The distribution of the winter coal-supplies has hardly yet begun, and must be effected simultaneously with the transport of the German and Roumanian harvests.
The Danish Government consider that their population sen be adequately rationed until next harvest from the available supplies of native foodstuffs, and that there will be a handsome margin (four months1 rations) for oon tingencies.     But they beg us to raise, or at least to mitigate, the embargo on fodderstuffs, and make two al-ternative proposals,(1) la return for unrestricted supplies of fodder-stuffs they would limit the export of live cattle to 5,030 head a week, and that of horses to 8,000 head a month; and they tould continue to divide the exports of butter, eggs, and bacon between England and Germany in the same proportions as at present.(2) Or, if we will give them facilities for im-ports of 175,000 tons of f odderstuffs and cereals, they will agree not to export more than 40$ of their butter and bacon to Germany, and will attempt to divide the emergency ex-?)Orts of meat equally between Germany and England;   but they will in this case give no undertakings as to cattle and horses.Xf we reject both these proposals, they will be obliged to export at least 50$ of their butter and bacon to Germany and to permit the -unrestricted export of horses and cattle;   but they would still attempt to give us 50^ of the emergency exports of meat.   It may appear surpris-ing that Denmark should adopt so conciliatory an attitude towards us.     But the explanation is probably to be found in the fear that coal-supplies will soon be unobtainable from Germany.    The Chamber of Manufacturers are on the point of asking Berlin to grant immunity td vessels carry-ing coal &quot;from England to Denmark;  and they have asked us whether we will permit Denmark to receive increased quan-tities of British coal, in the event of a favourable reply from Berlin.
The German Government are making special efforts to convince Sweden that her exports of iron-ore to Germany should he maintained even at the cost of a breach with the United States.     Licences have recently been granted for the expert of 20,000 tons of potash from Germany to Sweden; it is even reported that Germany lias offered Sweden supplies of wheat arid petroleum.     Bxports of iron ore from Sweden to Germany are taking place at the rate of over four million tons per annum;   but in view of Germany&apos;s evident nervousness respecting future imports, it is unlikely that any considerable reserves of this indispensable raw material have been accumulated in Germany.-   We are intimating to the Swedish (Government that, in return for a satisfactory shipping agreement, we would supply Sweden with as much coal as she needs and would permit Swedish vessels to call for examination outside the United Kingdom, and to receive British bunker coal.The Norwegian Mission to the United States -id 11 repre-sent that Norway consumes about 400,000 tons of bread corn per annum, while she only produces 30,000 tons; and that her visible stocks on Juno 1* were not quite sufficient to last three months.     They will also argue that under our Fish Agreement the exports of Norwegian fish to Germany are unimportant.      The figures as to corn may be correct.   If so, it is clear that the United States can exact favourable terms from Horway.     The contention as to fish-exports is inexact.     In the first half of this year the Norwegian Government licenced the export of 55,000 tons of fish to Germany.     The average annual exports under the Fish Agree -ment would be about 85,000 tons;     and last year Germany
also received from Norway 20,000 tons of canned fish. Germany has already threatened Norway with dire conse-quences if the fish-trade is suspended - which is an addi-tional proof of its importance to our enemies,     There is so much ill-feeling against the Germans in Norway owing to the outrages of the submarine campaign, that a large part of the population would he glad of a plausible excuse foe restricting Norwegian exports to Germany,HSTHBRltAHDS.   The official tr&amp;ae-returns for the first three months of 1917, show satisfactory decrease in the exports of certain articles to Germany.     According to the returns, the total exports of butter, cheese, eggs, meat, flour, margarine and fish are only 32,791 tons as compared with 119,054 tons in the corresponding period of 1916;   the exoorts of coffee are 768 tons as compared with 34,418 tons; and those of livestock are 827 head as compared with 13,076 head.     These official statistics are not to be implicitly trusted; they are believed to understate the exports of agricultural produce to Germany in the present year.     But even if a considerable allowance is made for errors and concealments, the comparison with last year18 figures yields satisfactory results.The Dutch Government have decided to allow the transit to Belgium of no more sand and gravel after Aug. 15, except when specific consignments are deraonstrably required in Belgium for non-military purposes.   It is to be hoped that the saving clause will not in practice be applied too laxly.     For some time past the shipments of sand and gravel passing from Germany to Ghent and other military centres have been scandalously large.
iu cThe Federal Government are negotiating with Germany to secure an extension of the German-Swiss Agree-ment.   The President has announced that Switzerland will he required to make a considerable loan to Germany, for the purpose of maintaining the mark-exchange;   The amount of the loan is understood to be 40,000,000 francs. It is ru-moured that one form of compensation which the Swiss pro-pose to offer is electric power.[7, ITALY.a special committee of the British War Cabinet is consider ing the question of coal supplies for Italy, It is suggested that, since Italy has wheat-stocks sufficient for her needs until January 1918, the ships at present ordered to load American wheat fer Italy should bring coal instead. It is improbable that the supplies of coal from Great Britain can be increased before September.   But wheat can be brought from India to Italy before the Italian stocks are exhausted.mum) STATBt?Aparty in Congress demands with some asperitythat we shall permit the goods of German origin which are lying at Rotterdam for American account to come lbrv.ard; and Mr, Wilson has asked for assurances that this conces-sion will paid.     The qiestion is of no great importance in regard to the blockade if we can provide against the danger of goodsbeing shipped for which payment has not yet been made.Mr. Wilson desires to be informed what action is likely to be taken by Holland and the Scandinavian countries if they are deprived of American supplies, and what action we should take or expect the United States to take if spy
of the states affected sMuld be attacked by Germany or should enter into alliance with Germany.She Allies have assented to the suggestion of the United States that a Council of the Allies should be con-stituted to determine the allocation of American financial and tonnage facilities.     It is proposed that the Council should sit in Europe; and that an Executive Committee of the Allies should -sit at Washington to make all necessary arrangements for contracts and purchases to be effected in the United States with American financial assistance,rue,., OAMEMM&apos;The following is a summary of the losses of merchantshipping due to enemy action, which were officially re-ported in the period July 2? to Aug.2, inclusive.
