WAR   CAB TOT, IS?RlIiEASE oif&apos; im FOR MILITARY SERVICE PROMihdustriI&amp; uiim board or trabe controlCopy of letter from the Secretai-y, Eoard of Trade, to the Secretary, War Cabinet.BOARD OR TRADE,7, Whitehall Gardens, London   S.W. 1. 3rd August 1917.Sir,I am directed by the Board of Tra.de to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th July asking that the War Cabinet may be furnished with a statement on the Monday of each week showing the proportion, up to, and including the previous Rriday, of the quotas of men actually released so far as this Department is concerned.In reply the Board understand that as regards Coal Mines, a communication has been sent direct by the War Cabinet to the Con-troller, to which he has replied.&quot;-^&quot;As regards Railways, I am to state that the Board are informed by the Railway Executive Committee that the names of over 21,000 men had been forwarded to the Director of Recruiting by July 25th, arrangements having been made to re-lea.se the whole of these men. The Railway Com-panies have therefore aJLready arranged the re-lease of their whole quota.As regards Docks, the Board desire me to say that it would not appear to be possible to supply weekly any useful statement of the in-crease in the numbers of men released.   There has been some delay on the part of certain Port Labour Committees in carrying cut instructions, but when
these Committees do release the men required, they will probably do so in one block so that weekly returns are scarcely practicable,   The first in-stalment being now completed, the Committees which have already released men cannot be called upon for further quotas until substitutes are provided. An official Minute has been sent out to the various Committees asking them to state the number, if any, of the substitutes they will require.   Pending further replies to this it does not seem advisable to issue instructions for the release of the second instalment.    I am to add that Lord Rhondda gave an undertaking to the Ministry of Shipping and to the Board of Trade that after the with-drawal of certificates from the first instalment of men the question of the further withdrawal of certificates, especially from the West Coast ports, should be re-opened for consideration. The number of men released up to the 31st July, was over.3,500.I am, Sir,,Your obedient Servant, (Sgd.) W.P. MAKWOOD.
