3SECRET.IlJTJLLLIGjSrc:BUREAU,&apos;Department of Information,BYJP/012.Weekly. Report on Poland.   Xll. (10th August, 1917.)Politico in Poland remain under the influence of three seto of events: the criois in the Legiony caused by their refusal to take the oath; the arrest of Pilsudski and other leaders of the Left; and the negotiations in Warsaw with tho representatives of tho German and Austrian governments for the formation of a Polish government.The conservatives and so-called &quot;moderates&quot; in the Provisional Council of State had intended by means of the oath to &quot;purge&quot; the Legions of revolutionary elements; and evidently did not reckon with the possibility of the Legions following practically in a body the lead of Pilsudski.     Having been defeated, they broke out in accusations against Pilsudski and his group, this time v/ithout sufficiently reckoning with the psychology of the Germans.     The Germans had not wished for a crioio but, once it had arisen, took the matter into their own hando and acted with brutal incioiveneeo. The Provisional Council of State which had aimed at establishing its complete authority in the Legions and in the country at large, now sees the Legions rallying to Pilsudski, the Germans taking action against Pilsudski and his followers, public opinion throughout Poland indignant and pointing to the action of the Council aa the source of the trouble, confusion everywhere, the worst possible condition in which to negotiate for the constitution of the new government and the new Council of State.     The opponents of the present Provisional Council of State are of course making the moot of its embarrassments; socialist and radical politicians of the
&quot;Left&quot; in the Austrian sphere of occupation and Galicia seem almost to forget their grief at the arrest of their comrades in the German sphere in the joy of being able to    sadd&amp;e- the moderates with the responsibility for it.     The late pro-Russians of the &quot;Right&quot; similarly fulminate against the &quot;Centre&quot; and call on the Provisional Council of State to resign, which the latter had anyhow decided to do long ago in favour of the new government and Council to be formed under the auspices of Archbishop Kakowski, Prince Lubomirski and the present Crown Marshal; but then it is always useful for those who may enter the new body to fix the blame on its blundering pre-decessor.     At the same time the late pro-Russian conservatives take good care to emphasise that no taint of Pilsudski&apos;s revolution-ary thinking attaches to them.     They remain &quot;ministeriables&quot;. Meantime the Provisional Council of State makes pathetic efforts to clear itself in the eyes of the public; it protests to the Germans against the internment of the Legionaries, who as volunteers were free to take or refuse the oath, and against the arrest of Pilsudski, whom they now try to clear of accusations which originally had been probably suggested to the Germans by adherents of the Council. But most of all do the men concerned in the disastrous blunders of the last few weeks desire a speedy constitution of the new govern-ment and Council - evidently even they hope that the dissolution of the present Council will bury their blunders and that they will enter the new Council in a garb of 3nowy whiteness.     It is the old trick of clearing the bankruptcy and reforming the company.During the last week of July Herr Helfferich, Prince Hatzfeld and Dr. Lev/aid arrived at Warsaw as representatives of the German government, Baron Eichhoff and General Rozwadowski as Austria!o representatives; whilst Governor-General von Beseler returned from Berlin after conferences with Herr Michaelis.     Count Adam Tarnowski, the late Austro-Hungarian minister at Sofia and ambassador at Y/ashington, seems to have assisted in the double character of
Austria1s trusted agent and of a Polish statesman.     Prince Lubomirski returned from Marienbad to take part in the negotiations. Meantime the papers supporting the Provisional Council of State gave out most optimistic forecasts concerning further concessions to be made to Poland by the Central Powers.     This may have been done in order to divert public attention from recent events, but it is also possible that the reports are based on fact; as it was pointed out in our report of July 24, the Central Powers &quot;can afford to make concessions to the government of a Lubomirski, a Niemojowski or a Tarnowski such as they would hardly have made to a Polish government led by men of the stamp of Pilsudski&quot;.     On August 1 a statement was officially given out at Warsaw to the effect that at the conferences complete agreement had been attained between the delegates and that &quot;an important step in the development of the Polish State will be made shortly&quot;.Count Adam Tarnowski is obviously the Austrian candidate for the Polish Premiership, whilst the Germans seem to favour prince Drucki-Lubecki, a magnate from Posnania, whose character and past are equally unattractive.     The Westminster Gazette reprinted on Saturday, August 4, a Berlin wire of the Polltiken alleging that Count Tarnowski has been appointed Polish Premier, whilst The Times published on Monday, August 6, a Zurich wire alleging that he has been appointed Austro-Hungarian Minister at Stockholm.     His candidature for the Premiership has been discussed in the Polish press for almost two months, and when he started for Warsaw (about July 20) to take part in the negotiations it was stated that he would proceed from there to Stockholm.     It is therefore obvious how either rumour might have originated.     It seems more likel&amp; that Count Tarnowski has gone to Stockholm in order to discuss the results of the Warsaw conferences with representative1-Poles frcm Petrograd.     The Poles in Warsaw depend to a very large extent on the moral support of the Poles in Russia and of the revolutionary
Russian government, and it would therefore he hut natural if they communicated with the latter before taking any decisive steps. To the Central Pov/ers the relations betv/een the Warsaw Poles and Russia are no doubt agreeable because they may hope to use the poles as intermediaries in the preparations for peace negotiations with Russia.     Lastly it is certain that the differences which exist in the Polish Question between Austria and Russia are much smaller than those betv/een Germany and Russia, and possibly even than the differences betv/een Austria and Germany.     It is therefore possible that Austria is trying to play Russia against Germany by proving, e.g., that certain proposals put forward by Germany are completely unacceptable to Russia, whilst Austria&apos;s counter-proposals would not form an obstacle to peace.     But for the very same reason that Austria is likely to u^e Count Tarnov/ski for diplomatic work of that kind, Germany is unlikely to accept him as Polish Premier.     He is much too clever and much too closely connected with Austria.L.B.N.10/8/17.
