,&apos; HALLMilitary Attache, Petrograd, D.H.I.A-4th August, 1917.1284With reference to Ambassador^ telegram 1191 to Foreign Office.On military grounds I think the time has come when we must risk a note to Russian Government,     We will he supported by all the intelligent part of the population. The step is absolutely necessary for the country is moving Btraight to ruin as things stand at present.    During past fortnight no real steps have been taken to re-establish the prestige of the officers and discipline amongst troops in rear.     Till discipline is established in rear and troops are made to fight it is impossible to look for any improve-ment in the army at the front.     Till discipline is established in the army it is impossible to force the men in the railway repair shops and the mines to work and, if they continue as at present, a general breakdown of railway transport in the winter and a famine at Petrograd and in the army will occur.     Kerenski is at present the only man with any magnetic influence amongst the Ministry who has not yet understood the necessity of discipline,Hone of his immediate military advisers are men of character.     Socialists want to run- a class war in preference to the race war and this appeals to the mass of the soldiers as being less dangerous.Tseretelli and others think they can run both wars simultaneously.     We have to tell Russian Government plainly that this is impossible./A
