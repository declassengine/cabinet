SalonicaV Punishment of Soldiers.IQRaHDUM by the Secretary of State for War.In connection with V/ar Cabinet 195(7) and ^ar Cabinet. 2), I circulate the following informationWith reference to the statement made in the House of CommpnB by Mr,Dillon as to the state of discipline in the Army at Salonika and the suggestion that there were thousands of British soldiers in the prisons in the Mediterranean, enquiry was made by cable as to the total number of prisoners undergoing sentence excluding Salonilca and England.   As a result it was ascertained that there.were 44 prisoners in Winchester Gaol, 85 in prison in Egypt&apos; of whom by. now 5 would have been released on remission of sentence and 29 oh suspension of sentence, thus reducing the number there to 51.     As regards the prisoners at Winchester General Milne reported on the 13th June&apos; that he was shortly sending some 35 prisoners soldiers under sentence of penal servitude or impyiBonmeirfc with hard labour to England via Malta.adding that owing tc shipping difficulties it might be some considerable time before they reached their destination. These are obviously the men who with others making up the 44 have recently arrived at Y/inchester.   In all these cases General Milne stated that although the interests of discipline in his opinion, demanded that severe sentences should be promulgated and put, into. execution he recommended release on suspension of sentence after only a few months of the oent inoeSihave been served and that on release the prisoners should be sent to units serving in some other theatre of war.   These men will be released on suspension at the end of three or six months according^to the nature of their offences.   Court Martial proceedings have not at, present reached the War Office so no definite opinion on each case can yet be formed.The cases to which General Milne drawB special attention, namely,, those of three men of the 2nd Garrison Battalion Royal Irish Fusiliers; the proceedings are available and have been scrutinized but there is nothing in the proceedings to show that the operation was of an unnecessary nature and,undertaken contrary to General Milne&apos;s orders as stated by him in his letter.   The. proceedings show that there was a patrol of some 50 strong which went out at night in an attempt to catch some Bulgars who had been seen in a house. The patrol was in charge of a Second Lieutenant and it seems probable that the meaning underlying General Milne&apos;a words is that there was probably some Standing Order prohibiting midnight ventures of this description without special authority but I am making enquiry as to this,DERBY,2nd August, 1917.
