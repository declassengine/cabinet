Confidential.Printed for the Use of the Reconstruction Committee-August, 1917.Shipping and Shipbuilding Policy./[ITTEE ON COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL POLICY TO RECONSTRUCTION COMMITTEE.Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy, 7, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I., Sir, 14th June 1917.,1 have the honour to forward to you herewith, to be laid before the Prime Minister, copy of a Resolution adopted by the Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy at their meeting on Thursday, 14th June, on the subject of a Memorial addressed to the President of the Board of Trade by the Departmental Committee on Shipping and Shipbuilding, together with a copy of that Memorial.I am, Sir,Yours faithfully.BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH.Vaughan Nash, Esq., C.B., C.V.O.,Reconstruction Committee.Enclosure 1 in No. I.Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy, 7, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.The Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy have had before them a memorial addressed to the President of the Board of Trade by the Departmental Committee on Shipping and Shipbuilding, on the subject of the shipbuilding policy to be pursued by H.M. Government.The Committee desire to express their complete concurrence in the recommenda-tions made by the Shipping and Shipbuilding Committee, and their earnest hope that H.M. Government will take .those recommendations into their immediate and most serious consideration, with a view to the adoption of a programme of merchant shipbuilding on a scale adequate to safeguard our mercantile position both in the present grave emergency and in regard to the very difficult shipping situation which will arise after the war.Enclosure 2 in No. 1. BOARD   OF   TRADE.DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON SHIPPING AND SHIPBUILDING.To the Right Honourable Sir xAlbert H. Stanley, M.P., President of theBoard of Trade.Sir,In order to carry out the task entrusted to us by your predecessor, we have necessarily had to give our earnest consideration to the shipbuilding policy pursued by His Majesty&apos;s Government since the outbreak of hostilities.2. As a result we are impelled, as a Committee representing shipowners, shipbuilders and marine engineers, to record the grave anxiety with which we view the present and more especially the prospective position of the British mercantile marine.3. We recognise to the full the formidable nature of the difficulties that have beset the Government throughout the war, especially in view of our heavy military obligations; and we, therefore, abstain, so far as possible, from detailed criticism which could serve no useful purpose.U   (33)1339-35(3321)   Wt 12   125   8/17   E &amp; S
24. Nevertheless, we are obliged to state our considered opinion that the policy which neglected the building of merchant ships in the United Kingdom was fatally mistaken, and is responsible for onr present difficulties and our future peril.(i) Not only have we failed to utilise the great resources of our yards for repairingthe wastage inseparable from naval war, but we have allowed the output of merchant ships to fall far below the standard of normal times. Thus the natural growth of the mercantile marine was artificially restricted at the very time when every nerve should have been strained to make good the ravages of a devastating war.(ii) The neglect of merchant shipbuilding disregarded the axiom of naval war .that the upkeep of the merchant fleet in war is as necessary to a country dependent on sea communications as the maintenance of the fighting fleet itself. Had that principle received due recognition, the conflict between naval and mercantile construction would have been mitigated; and adequate provision would have been made for merchant shipbuilding, as part of a larger naval policy necessary for the safety of the country and having the first claim on the national resources, (in) So long as the past policy is not reversed, the wastage of our mercantile marine will continue unchecked. But that wastage is cumulative and progressive ; and there cannot fail to come a time, in the not distant future, when the position will be one of extreme gravity, and we shall lose, perhaps for ever, that maritime ascendency which is the essence of our being. Without a strong and supreme merchant navy, economic recon-struction after the war would be impossible and the promise of imperial consolidation unfulfilled.5. Even now we doubt whether the essential danger of the situation is fully realised and whether such efforts as are made do not proceed rather from the exigencies of the moment than from an adequate realisation of the imperial issue at stake. For instead of pressing forward the construction of merchant ships at home, efforts are being made to improvise merchant shipbuilding on a large scale in the United States  a policy which, whatever its effect on the war, must, unless accompanied by a decisive effort in this country, hasten our own ultimate decline.6. We are convinced that them situation demands the immediate inception of a bold programme of merchant shipbuilding in this country on a scale of output amounting to not less than 3,000,000 tons a year, as the only means of safeguarding our position both now and in the future. It is the grave duty of this Committee to warn His Majesty&apos;s Government that, unless a. decisive effort is made, the shipping and shipbuilding industries o  the country, with all that depends on them, will be compromised beyond redemption.7. Whatever the difficulties inherent in the problem, it is our confident belief that they can be overcome by the organised effort and the unreserved co-operation of all concerned; and we venture to urge, with all the earnestness in our power, that the question should receive the most urgent attention of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, and that the whole situation should be reviewed in the light of these grave considerations.8. We should be glad to be informed at an early date of the steps which it is proposed to take in order to meet the pressing needs of the situation.We have the honour to be, Sir,   .Your obedient Servants,(Signed)      ALFRED BOOTH, Chairman.

III.-COMMITTEE ON COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL POLICY TORECONSTRUCTION COMMITTEE.Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policv, 7, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, Sir, 9th July 1917.With reference to Sir M. Bonham Carter&apos;s letter of the 21st June relative to the Resolution of the Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy on the subject of the present shipbuilding position, I am directed by Lord Balfour of Burleigh to state that he has been in communication thereon with the Chairman of the Shipping and Shipbuilding Committee.I am now to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before the Reconstruction Committee, copy of a letter which Lord Balfour has received from Sir Alfred Booth.I am, Sir,Your obedient servant, The Secretary, PERCY ASHLEY.Reconstruction Committee.Enclosure in No. III.Board of Trade Shipping and Shipbuilding Committee,7, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, Dear Lord Balfour, 6th July 1917.The Reconstruction Committee have, I understand, made enquiries as to the basis of certain statements in the Memorial recently addressed by the Shipping and Shipbuilding Committee to the President of the Board of Trade on the subject of the present shipbuilding position. The following remarks will help you to reply to their letter.II-RECONSTRUCTION COMMITTEE TO COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL &quot;   * POLICY COMMITTEE. .   &apos;   &apos;   &apos; -Reconstruction Committee,6a, Deans Yard,Westminster, SW.1,My. Lord, &apos; . ; 21st June, 1917.With reference to your letter of the 14th instant, I am directed by the Vice-Chairman of the Reconstruction Committee to say that the Resolution of the Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy on the subject of the memorial of the 7th instant, addressed to the President of the Board of Trade by the Departmental Committee on Shipping and Shipbuilding, and a copy of that Memorial have been forwarded to the Prime Minister with a statement that the Reconstruction Committee, having regard to the vital importance to this country after the war, from the point of view of Reconstruction, of the maintenance of its mercantile marine, desire to draw the Governments most serious attention to the considerations urged therein and to express the hope that every practicable step will be taken to develop to their utmost capacity the shipbuilding resources of this country.The Reconstruction Committee think that the case presented would be strengthened if the Shipping Committee could furnish further information as to the basis of the estimate of shipbuilding requirements contained in paragraph 6 of their memorial and the grounds for the view expressed in paragraph 7 that the practical difficulties of carrying out the programme recommended can be overcome in the manner suggested. In particular it would be desirable to know whether the existing shipbuilding yards of this country are at present fully occupied, what amount of steel and numbers of workmen would be required and from what sources the latter might be obtained.I am, my Lord,Your obedient Servant,M. BONHAM CARTER,Assistant Secretary. The Right Hon. Lord Balfour of Burleigh, K.T., G.C.M.G., G.C.V.O.
.1.. Paragraph..6. states that &quot;the situation demands the immediate inception of a &quot; . . -&apos;-. programme of merchant shipbuilding in this country . . . amounting &quot; to not less than 3.000,000 tons a year.&quot; In our view the situation really demands more than 3,000,000 tons, were it found possible to exceed that figure. We. said &quot; not less than 3,000.000 tons &quot;because that was the amount specifically asked for by the Shipping Controller and, as you will know, the present rate of construction is little if at all in excess of 1,000.000 tons. * *2. The facts on which the above estimate is based are the same as those which have been before the War Cabinet, especially in connection with their meeting on Thursday, April 26th, with the Shipbuilding Employers Federation and the Engineering Employers Federation. The Committee are unfortunately only too convinced of their accuracy; but, if Sir M. Bonham Carter has any doubts on the. subject, I would suggest that he be advised to consult the Shipping Controller who will no&apos;doubt be prepared to give him such further information as he may desire. Meanwhile the following facts,! think, speak for themselves :  -(1) Apart altogether from war losses our shipping is depreciating at an enormous . rate through the excessive wear and tear unavoidable during a war of this magnitude, and the necessity of allowing the work of repair to fall ;        behind.(2) As compared with the normal rate of replacement of this country&apos;s mercantile-marine before the war, we were, at the end of 1916, about 1,000,000 tons down through lack of sufficient new construction alone.(3) Up to the end of March last war losses had accounted for a further 3,000,000 tons. -.(4) The present rate of loss cannot be less than 4,000,000 tons a year.. At any rate we seem to be losing on an average some 20 vessels of and above 1,600 tons gross every week or over 1,000 per annum. At the time of the-outbreak of war, although there were some 12,800 steam vessels on the register of the United Kingdom, all except aboxit 3.700 were small vessels, of less than 1,600 tons gross. Those 3,700 vessels accounted for 90 per cent, of the total steam tonnage on the register which then exceeded 18,000,000 tons gross.(5) The result of all these factors will be to reduce the British Mercantile Marine, or such of it as the. enemy has spared, to scrap iron for after-war purposes ; and, apart altogether from the grave war position as to which the - - Shipping Controller is more competent to speak, we shall start the period of reconstruction with a depleted merchant fleet quite unable to meet the demands of trade.3. The Committee are advised that to carry out the Shipping Controller^ pro-gramme of 3,000,000 tons there would be required about 750,000 tons of steel in addition to the amount now available .for merchant shipbuilding and from 90,000 to-100,000 additional men.4. The men can only be obtained from the Army or from the less essential industries. My Committee are convinced that the whole question of labour and labour conditions, including dilution, should receive the most serious consideration, in consultation with the employers, to secure the maximum output from those , employed in the industries. In this connection I would remind you of the Prime Ministers statement in the House of Commons with regard to the possibility of increased output per man.5. I understand that our shipbuilding yards could, without any extensions, absorb about one-half of the additional labour and material above referred to. Extension would, however, be necessary to secure the absorption of the balance.6. Paragraph 7 recognises that a great effort is necessary, and that it can only succeed, firstly, by the full recognition that since success in the war and our existence after the war depend on ships, all else is subordinate to the building of ships to meet our most elementary needs ; and, secondly, by the dullest co-operation and sympathy between the Government and the great industries. In particular, if it is permissible to throw out a suggestion, it would be well to make the fullest use of local effort and initiative. /Yours faithfully,The Right Hon. Lord Balfour of Burleigh, ALFRED BOOTH&apos;   .. &apos;   K.T., G.O.M.G., G.C.V.O.,47, Cadogan Square, S.W. 1.
