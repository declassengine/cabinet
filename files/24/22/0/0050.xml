WAR CABINET FAT TOTAL WAB.Iu13I0RIAL-Aia) MUSEUMI) Memorandum by the First Commissioner of StorksII) Memorandum by the Director-General of the National War Museum.I.I have the honour to submit herewith a Memorandum by the Director-Seneral of tho National War Museum, Sir Martin Conway, which has been approved by the Committee.Since the approval by the Cabinet of my memorandum of the 27th, February last, the Committee then established, has met weekly, and several special sub-committees have been formed.. A stage has now been reached which calls for some further action on the part of the War Cabinets The necessary preliminary investigation into the scope of the National War Museum shows that some decision must be come to as to whether the Committee is to proceed on the lines ff&apos; the aocompanying memorandum, and whetherjhe War^JJ^S^JLlP-J^P.gJie(*- &quot;kQ sanction in^rTnolp&quot;le the creeTSasn of&quot; a War^Mueeum of the size and import&apos;-&apos; efcawwhioh the-&quot; Oommitiv^e^oons ider necessary, and the provision of the funds that are required. Until this decision is given, it is impossible for the Committee to proceed with the work of organising the collection of material, etc, on which   it ia at present engaged.In support of the accompanying memorandum, I wish to print out the following considerations:-1. A very carefully carried   sut in-vestigation by the Sub-Committee as to the . Bpace required by the different sections of the exhibits, disclbsea the fact that t* adequately represent the efforts made during the war by aur British Imperial Forces and our Allies, a floor space of about 278,OO0sq. ft. is needed.   This figure has been arrived at after considerable reduction of the estim-ated space askod for by the different sub-committees and is a  minimum, if the Museum is %o be at -tnce fully representative and popularly attractive.
2.   The Committee are unanimously of opinion that a building will have to-be created for the housing of the Museum,, which must be worthy of the contents-This has led the Committee to the conclusion that the subject should be regarded in a wider aspect than the proposal first outlined in my memorandum of the 27th. February, last.   The War Museum, by. the nature and character of its exhibits forms a Memorial of the War, and it is submitted that it should be adopted as such by the Cabinet and desig-nated the National War Memorial Museum.   A large sum will necessarily be required for this purpose. Details of this proposal are fully stated in the Director-General&apos;s Memorandum.3.   Preliminary estimates of a suitable building, made&apos;by Mr. F. Baines, M.V.O.,  one of the principal architects of my Department, tend to show that the sum of  750,000 will be required to cover the ex-penditure on the scheme.   Although this sum may be considered large, I would like to point out that if the proposal to combine the Museum and the War Memorial is adopted, I do not believe it would be considered as unreasonable, either by the House of Commons,  or by the oountry.   Votes have been granted for Museums and Exhibitions in peace time of very considerable magnitude.   Over  2,000,000 has been spent on the British Museum  602,000 has been spent on the Natural History Museum; and over  1,300,000 has been spent on the Science and Art Buildings.The Committee has also been occupied with the question of a suitable site,  and have gener-ally come to the conclusion that the site for the National War Memorial Museum should be in London, should be worthy of the building to be erected, and should be central.   Of the numerous sites ex-amined by the Committee, and its architectural advisors, there is one which they have unanimously approved of as being- of outstanding merit for the purpose in view.   This is a small section of Hyde Park, between the top of the Serpentine, and Bayswater Road.   While I am aware cf the strong feeling that has always been aroused.against any building being placed in the Royal Parks,  I would point out that this question of a National Memori-al stands on a different footing to that of any other building,  especially if it is to be a great National War Memorial.   The amount of space to be taken from the Park would,  approximately, be only five asrres, and would not affect the amenities of the Park.    In fact, with its fine architectural front at the head of the Serpentine, it would be seen from the Bridge and the Road as a very great improvement compared with the relatively mean and unimportant houses which now form the vista.   The front on the Bayswater Road will, ofgCourse, be a great improvement.   The situation is/very good one from the point of view of communication, being accessible to two tube routes, and numerous bus routes, and is as central as could be wished.   The advantage of this site is that it vail be free of
cost, and it is obvious that- the earing so effected will he very considerable.   Another consideration is that the building operations on- this site cafi be commenced practically immediately, whilst on all other sites that have be^n examined, and which are at all centrally situated, various buildings and land will have to be acquired, and the site cleared, and this will necessarily cause considerable delay. It would appear important that the&apos;Museum should be&apos; commenced aswsopn as possible after the war, and . proceeded.witn/xhe greatest expedition so that it can be oompleted while the memory of the war is sjtil stillfjresh in the minds of the&apos; people.   If the CaMnirt&quot;approve of this suggestion for the site, it will be,  of course, my duty to submit it. to the favour and approval of His Majesty the King.It is only right to point out that this scheme will record not only the British, but the entire efforts of the Empire,  and a Sub-Committee is in formation, on which will be represented the Governments of the Oversea Dominions,and the India Office, will specially deal with this important phfise   of the work.Finally, I respectfully submit that approval be given to the scheme as outlined, more especially the following features1.   The adoption of the National War Museum as the National War Memorial.2.   The sanction of the estimated expenditure.3,.   The approval of the proposed site.j        I wish to explain that the accompanying \plan and elevation are not te be considered as in any way finally decided, but are submitted to show the general scope of the scheme and the proposed site.(Sd.)    ALFRED MOND.H.M. Office of Works. 8th August, 1917.
**..... *.........mmm v.....iniiiwax mt0 N THE SCOPE 0 T t Hi NATIONAL    W A R    li US E U il.The First Commissioner, H.M. Office of Works.The Committee charged with the duty of organising the National.War Museum, understands that the end to be achieved is the provision of a record and memorial of the War by sea and land in all parts of the world, of the raising, equipment, and transportation of armies, of munition manufacture at home and elsewhere, of the medical and other subsidiary services, of the work of women both directly fo*- war purposes and indirectly by substitution, and generally of all the activities called forth by the war at home, in the Dominions, and in India, at all the fronts and on the sea.Such a Museum, if wisely collected and arranged, will be unique in this respect that alone among Museums it will make a direct appeal to the millions of individuals who have taken part in the war or In war-work of any kind.   Thus the sailor and soldier should be able to see models of ships, batteries, trenches  and the like in which they feu ght, the uniforms they wore, and the weapons they used.   Airmen should find actual examples and more numerous models of the aircraft employed whereby to follow and explain the development of flying and the machinery of flight during the years of active warfare. Craftsmen should be able to examine models of some of the great munition works in which they were employed and photographs of machinery they used sb well as actual examples of munitions they helped to produce.    Women should behold commemorated their occupations as nursea, munition workers, hospital supply workers, and generally as substitutes for men on the land, on railways, and elsewhere.   Young people, boys and girls, should not be forgotten.   The Boy Scouts, the Girl Guides, the country post-girls, and all the uniformed workers, when they visit the Museum in years to come, should be able by its aid to revive the i emory of their work for the war, and, pointing to some, exhibit, to say &quot;This thing I did&quot;,A War Museum that did not record an* honour the brave who sacrificed their lives for their country would be constructed on a fundamentally wrong principle.   It is there-fore suggested that the very heart and focus of the building should be of a memorial character.   This might take the form of a Hall of Honour as rich and beautiful in character as artists can devise, and adjacent to it a Gallery devoted to the separate memorials of the Navy and the Army by Ships, Regiments, and. Contingents.   The Hall of Honour could be designed to bear on its walls painted portraits and on its floor pedestals carrying busts or sculptured figures of such-eminent individuals as the people as a whole may delight to single out for special honour.   In the Memorial Gallery the name of every individual who fell in battle, or died of wounds, should be legibly inscribed on bronze plates, suitably framed with the arms, badges, and honours of each regimentj here also the speciil mementoes of particular units would find place in the neighbourhood of the regimental or other collective memorial .
l  It is evident that if the oore of the Museum isI     thus designed and equipped it will bp the very nature of the1 !     case become the National t?ar Memorial, for no pile of sculpture h   wherever set up could possibly vie in public interest or truly memorial character with this Hall and Gallery of Honour in the heart of a great War Museum,   It is therefore suggested that the proposed Museum bo adopted as the War Memorial.   If that step is taken all difficulties connected with finanoe will fall away, neither will there be any impediment to selecting as central and costly a site as may seem desirable, ^he public might resent what could be represented as extravagance in connection with a Museum;   but the same public would insist that the memorial to the countless dead who gave their lives for its salvation should be costly in sacrifice, splendid in character, and central in position.In no case can a War Museum be anything but very large and correspondingly costly If it is to be honourably representative of the gigantic national effort,   tfhen guns wore made of bronze they could be oxposed for an unlimited time in the open air.   Few, if any, modern implements of warfare can stand such exposure.   The guns, tanks, etc., to be exhibited are many and large and will cover a considerable area.To display existing models of all the different types of ship employed by the Wavy in the war would require almost an acre and when every economy in selection and arrangement has been made the minimum space needed cannot be reduced below 30,000 square feet.   Aircraft again must be represented by some actual examples as well as by many models.   Space must also be allotted to the Dominions and India.   Offices, corridors, workshops, store-rooms, etc., will have to be supplied and a submarine tank room (estimated at 17,400 sq. ft.) if an actual submarine is to be included.Every effort has been made to reduce demands of space to the lowest point consistent with lucidity and efficiency of representation, and the Museum Committee hes taken the advice of the following expert Committees, who have closely examined the requirements and have estimated them as here stated and in the schedule set forth in more detail.MIRALTY COMMITTEE. 127,000 square feetCommander Waloott.

Sir Julian Corbett.The question of Records is a difficult one.   It is abso-lutely essential that the Museum should become a fully equipped centre for all future historical research in connection with the War, and that it should ultimately contain (as from time to time necessary restrictions of secreoy are removed) all the official&apos; documents relating-to naval, military and economical matters. This can only be accomplished if a portion of the Museum is designed and set aside as a branch of the Record Office and remains under the control of the Master of the Rolls.   It is under-stood to be the desire of the Record Office Authorities to remove from Chancery Lane all the Viar Office and Naval Records.   Conges-tion at the Record Offioe will involve the erection of further accommodation unless such relief is supplied, and it is suggested that it would toe cheaper to afford the needed eztrs accommodation in connection with the War Museum than toy building in the oostly neighbourhood of Chancery Lane0   The Army and Navy Records now occupy ten miles of shelves.    If sixteen miles of shelves were provided in the \i&apos;ar&quot; Museum the area covered would be some 18,000 square feet, to which the necessary rooms for the accommodation of the Record Office Officials in charge must be added.The Library should contain the 30,000 books, pamphlets, etc. already published in connection with-the.war and a large number of files of newspapers, not neglecting the provincial press which contains a multitude of facts, elsewhere unrecorded, about the doings of individuals and particular regiments.   Neutral and Enemy newspapers must also bo acquired,   Tho Gorman collection of files of newspapers of all countries already numbers upward of 1,700. Provision must be made for future growth, as the issue of war literature will not end with the war.   It is estimated that an area of 6,400. square feet will be wanted for library purposes. In addition it will be necessary to. provide room for an enormous number of photographs.It is far too early to offer anything like a definitive plan of the proposed Museum but certain broad lines of arrangement suggest, themselves as likely to be determined by the nature and-w purpose of the institution to be housed-   Thus two or more large glass-covered courts will almost certainly form part of any acceptable plan, and these must be on the ground level as theywill have to hold the heavy exhibits - the great: guns, tanks, etc.** *      - - ,.............,,, ..... .. *
Other essential elements will be the Memorial Hall above described and the Hall of Sculpture.   About these elemental parts the exhibition galleries will have to be arranged in. tw.:  or three storeys.   Rough outline plans indicating possible arrangements are appended *   In both, the exhibition galleries on two or three floors surround and divide the great courts.  .(Signed)   AiAHTIiJ COF;.AY.Director General.26th June, 1917.
