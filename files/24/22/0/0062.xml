MATERNITY AMD CHILE WELFARE BILL.17.6.1 -;&apos;^hall^^&apos;&apos;    I desire to express my strong dissent from thetismorandum dated the 3nd August, 1917, whioKhas been sent to the War Cabinet by Sir Edwin Cornwall.     The meuoraiidi^seeW in effect(l) To import large, novel, and comple^ machinery into a very small administrative Bill:(S) To set up in local areas new oommittees to exercise functions and expend monies hitherto exercised and spent by the local authorities.It proposes to substitute for the Maternity and Child Welfare Bill which Mr, Long and Lord Rhondda before me have both desired to pass, and to whioh I have no doubt Parliament wou&amp;d readily assent, a measure whioh raises extremely important and controversial issues.A3 is well known, the movement for aiding the nurture of infants and their mo the re has developed widely and wisely during the past 10 years, and at the present tia*e there is a very large amount of munioipal work - often in co-operation with voluntary work - being done throughout the Country by the Local Health Authorities.    Grants towards the expenditure are made by my Department.    This work is of the greatest value and promise.    Up to the present, the powers which the Local Authorities possess have been those derived from the Public Health Acts.    The development of the maternity and infant welfare schemes has led to a demand for rather wider powers and all my Bill has proposed to do is to give to the Local Health Authorities in relation to infants and their mothers the same powers of attending to their health
and physios! welfare as are possessed by Local Health Authorities in Scotland and Ireland, and, in relation to children.,in- attendance at school, have been- poes^seedV-sinoe/ 1907 by every Local EducationJuathority.Sir Edwin Cornwall, acting on behalf of the Approved Sooietise undsr the Insurance Aota, proposes that by the same Bill corresponding powers shall be given to the Insurance Committees under the Ineuranoe Acts and that the whole matter shall be under the joint control of the Local Government Board and the Insuranos Comwiasloners.    I have had the opportunity of hearing the views of the gentlemen who olaim to represent the Insurance world and have re-oeived through Sir Edwin Cornwall a memorandum setting out their views on the subjeot.    In this - an uncompromising dooument - they eat out various points whioh they state are &quot;absolutely essential, and they are bound to resist legisla-tion in which these are not included&quot;.    The Bill whioh 8ir Edwin Cornwall has ciroulated oontaina the points which are urged in the memorandum.The most important is their demand that &quot;the Bill in giving the desired new powers for mat amity and infant welfare work to the Local Authorities must at the same time give extended powers to the Insurance Committees for the same purposes&quot;.    One hears a good deal about overlapping in these days.    Here is a deliberats proposal to empower two local bodies to undertake the same work in the same areas.    It ie to be reme^oered that the Local Authorities are now actively engaged on maternity and infant welfare work. All that they need Is a slight enlargement of their powers so as to enable the... to extend their work in one or two directions, e.g. the provision of milk and other food in necessitous cases, the.establishment of oreohea and of
lying-in-Oiomee/ &quot;the authority for which under the axi s t ing Law ie not quite as clear aa it should be.    The Insurance Committees, en the other&apos;hand, haire never touched, taie-worJc; they have no staff for the purpose and no funds.    The last 1$ a matter of some importance.    Under1the present arrange-meat half of the expenditure incurred by the Local Authorities and approved by the Local Government Board is repaid by a grant;   the other half is borne by the rates.    The activities of the Insurance Committees will have to be wholly financed by the Treasury.It would be oontrary to all prind pies of Govern-ment to allow such boiies as Insurance Committees, whioh do not represent the ratepayers as such, to incur or control expenditure part of whioh is to be met out of rates, and sven if the whole cost of the work were borne, aa suggested in the Memorandum, by the State, it would be wrong to entrust its distribution to a non-elected body which represents insured persons alone.It ia diffioult to imagine any proposal more likely to provoke opposition in Parliament and to lead to trouble if enacted.    It strikes at the root of local government, and I have reason to know that it would be strenuously resisted by the Local Authorities and by other interests besides. On the question of concurrent jurisdiction I will only say that experience in regard to tuberculosis has conclusively shewn that division of responsibility and jurisdiction between the public health authority whether local or osntral, and insurance organisations leads to friction, delay, and inefficiency.The sohecie of maternity and infant welfare work9which hae been in process,of development during the last ten years by local authorities consists in the provision of:-
(a) health visitors;(b) maternity and infant welfare centres;(c) assistance in midwifery;   and(d) the provision of hospital beds and the services of A.doctor in the home in very exdeptional aass4*These eerviose in no way oonfliot with the services whioh insurance oor&amp;itteea ate providing.The eeivioes provided under the Insuranos Act ars of a lti-sited character.    They consist of(a) general practitioner service for insured persona;(b) sanatorium benefit for insured persons sufferingfree tuberculosis;   and(o)  oartain oaah payments. If an insurance committee have any surplus funds (whioh, however, they have not) the Aot allows them to provide a general practitioner service for the dependants.If aft any time the Government should decide to pro-vide a gsneral praotitionar service for the uninsured, it would have to be considered how the oost should be borne and whether the service should be provided in the aauje way and through the same organisation as this service is provided for insured persons.    To provide suoh an extended service would require several million pounds a year, and oareful inquiry would clearly be necessary before any action was taken.The Local Government Board have no intention of using the powers of the proposed Bill for the purpose of , establishing domiciliary medical attendance for the uninsursd, and a parliamentary pledge oould be given to this effect on the introduction of the Bill.The War Cabinet deoided some months ago that the powers of looal authorities in r? ;ard to infant wslfare should be enlarged sq as to enable theu. rt provide oreohes.    There is now urgent demand for wider powers and I may refer to the
Tecondensation of the :Bc^TvKof^Tra4e--^k)^^ dated 23rd September&apos;laet, th*jt local authorities should he authorised, subject to safeguards, to order milk and dinners for expectant and nursing mothere and milk for infante and children under five years of age.Pending any radical change in regard to insurance, proper development of the activities of the elected local authorities in regard to public health muet not be stopped on account of oppoeition from insurance organisations, and the immediate and urgent work of saving the lives of thousands of children must not be made to wait upon the issue of measures of fundamental recon-struction.I must therefore ask that the Government will at once decide that I should introduce very early in the Autumn a Bill giving local authorities in England and Yfeles the same powers as are possessed by local authorities in Scotland and Ireland in regard to Maternity end Infant Welfare.W. H. P.Loca 1^Government Board, / - August, 1917.
