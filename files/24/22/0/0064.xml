SUCRE T:. .T.1664...WAR CABINET. IKDIAfl REFORMS *ftepy of letter from Mr. Austen; Chamberlain, to Secretary of. State for India.Rowfant, Crawley, SUSSEX.8th August, 1917.My dear Montagu,I have read your Memo, on Indian Reforms with great interest and practically with complete agreement - with such complete agreement indeed that I might well stop here but for the possibility that the fuller expression of my agreement may be of some use to you.1.   You are right to press on the Cabinet that a very early pronouncement is necessary to avoid the growth of a most serious and even dangerous movement.   One cannot help seeing that all the Authorities in India are anxious.   They, and our friends outside Government, are puzzled and   hesitating.   There is still time, to take the lead and keep control of the situation, but the Cabinet must aot quickly.2.   I am convinced that it is useless to boggle at the phrase &quot;self government11.   Hardinge and others have countenanced its use.   Moderate opinion adopts it.   The acceptance by you with the necessary limitations would in faot oommit you to less than would ita definite rejection by you; and you must either accept or reject it - you cannot pass it by in silence.3.   I much prefer the alternative (b) of your proposed announcement.   On thi3 point I have changed my mind I think that &apos; Curzon Was right in deprecating the introduction of a third and independent body between the Government of India and the Secretary of State.4.   I have referred under (2) to &quot;necessary limitations&quot;. These to my mind are three-fold;(a) that, as stated by you, the agitation for immediate Home Rule is foolish and mischievous;(b) that the time and nature of each fresh step in advance must be determined by Hie Majeaty*s Government;(c) that in speaking of the gradual development of free institutions with a view to self government and in particular by the use of the term self-government, you do not pretend to define the sxaot course or the exact form which that development will ultimately take. Healthy institutions grow and in their growth adapt themselves to the special circumstances of the country and special conditions of the peoples for whom they are intended.   If and when India possesses a real political sense and widely diffused political aptitudes, she will not slavishly copy, she will adapt andvary in accordance with the genius of her own people, the western institutions which she takes
as her general model. Rigidity is the pitfall in our present system. Elasticity is the first condition of progress.I should be inclined to add (d) growth of power must be accompanied by growth of the 3ense of responsi-bility.   Indeed no great increase of power is possible till an increased sense of responsibility makes itself evident.I wish you would consider whether a few words in the sense of (b) and (c), and perhaps (d) might not usefully be added to your pronouncement without over-loading it.One other point.   I would suggest that you make it quite clear that whilst the primary object of  he Secretary of State&apos;a. visit to   India is to confer with the Viceroy, you will take the opportunity of seeing representatives of different shades of non-official Indian and English opinion.I would lay more stress on this than on the public discussion which may come later.Yours very sincerely,(sgd) Austin Chamberlain.PRIVATE.Of course you did right to use the private correspondence freely. If it would help you to show this letter or any part of it to Curzon or the Cabinet, please use.it as you think best.(Intd.) A.C
