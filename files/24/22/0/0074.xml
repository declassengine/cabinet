CONFIDENTIAL.That having heard the enquiry of the President of the Board of Trade as to what is the attitude of this Society towards agreements made with Railway Companies on behalf of our members:-We desire to say that as a Union we recognise that agreements are binding on both sides and if at any time we consider it necessary to suggest any alteration of an existing agreement on behalf of our members we will act in accordance with the terms and conditions of any agree-ment made.
