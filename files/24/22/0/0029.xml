AIR   BOARD. Report to the Cabinet.A.B.153/27. neral PolicyPly.4th August, 1917.1.    Major Boiling, the hoad of the American Aeronautical Mission In Europe, returned at the request of the Board to this country from France during the week, and had -meetings with the President of the Air Board andv^ the Controller of Aeronautical Supplies,     The result of these was to show that the American Government are pre-pared to carr^y out in substance the agreement, the terms of Tfoich were conveyed in the letter of the 20th July to Major Boiling, of which a copy was annexed to the Report to the Cabinet dated 21st July.     The American Government, however, have introduced certain modifications, chiefly as regards the types of machines and engines to be adopted by the American Air Service.     The nature of these is indicated in the extracts annexed hereto from a draft letter to be addressed by the Controller of Aeronautical Supplies to Major Boiling.2.    Reference was made in the Report for the previous week to a decision of the Board to order 700 long distance bombing machines of the type known as the &quot;De Havilland 9.&quot;     This will be a fast machine with a speed of 112 miles perttiour at 10,000 feet, but carrying only 4 cwt * of bombs with a range of 450 miles.     The question of supplementing light bombers of this type by a certain number of heavy bombers has, for some time, been under the consideration of the Board.     The heavy twin-engined machine of the Handley-Page type carries 5,000 lbs. of bombs, that is to say, six times as much as the De H. 9.    The speed, however, is very much less (about 83 miles per hour).     Its use is chiefly for night bombing.    It is argued that its relative vulnerability and the fact that night bombing is less effective than day bombing, make the provision of machines of this type less advantageous than the provision of the JCaflt light bomber.     On the other hand, it is argued that the R.N.A.S, have used the Randley*Page machine with great success and that not a single one has ever been brought down by the enemy;   while, on the occasion of the recent raid on Constantinople, the Handley-Page machine found its objective on a moonlight night without difficulty.After careful consideration the Board have decided to supplement the order for 700 De H. 9 machines, referred to in the last Report to the Cabinet, by an order for 100 Handley-Page machines,3.     The deliveries of engines and aircraft have been as follows

APPENDIX.Extracts from a draft letter to be addressed by Sir Mill am fieir to Major Boiling.* * *(2)   With reference to the Important question of silver spruce, it is understood that your Aircraft Pro-v duction Board are now developing an extensive scheme for cutting down this timber and for its cutting out in the sawmills.     On account of the necessity of saving shipping space, we will arrange for our timber demands of silver Bpruoo in the United States to be conveyed to your Air-craft production Board in tho form of schedules giving the sections of timber very close to the finished size. It is understood that this work would all be carried out by your Board and we will arrange for the necessary in-spectlon of timber parts required for this country, so that no unsuitable parts will be shipped.(3)   It is agreed that your Aircraft Production Board will adopt a programme of types of aero-engines and aeroplanes from which the American Aerial Fleets will be constructed.     Such types as are now agreed are as followsTraining Engines.Curtiss OX.5.80 H.P. Le Rhone.Service Engines.(a) 150 H.P. Mono Gnome.   (It is fully appreciatedthat this type was not one on the list which wo originally recommended).(b) This class would comprise an engine suitable forfighter reconnaissance and bombing machines, and it is understood that you have not yet decided with regard to it.(c) 200 H.P. Hispano-Sulza.4Aeroplanes.Preliminary training.........   Curtiae.Intermediate training      ...    ...   Bristol ScoutArtillery and Reconnaissance   ...   Bristol Plghter. Fighter reconnaissance and Bombing D.H.9. Single-seater Fighter       ...    ...   Spad.
(9)   It is understood that In addition to your constructional programme in the United States, you are arranging for a preliminary programme of aeroplanes and engines from French sources.     As we have already agreed, the carrying out of this programme should net be allowed to interfere in any way with the very large &apos; Contracts for motors which m have already placed in France and which are considerably overdue.     There is little doubt that your programme in France will tend almost certainly to a quicker execution of our British contracts, as you will be able to rapidly Improve the position as regards raw material.     To avoid any possible conflict which might happen in connection with the Hispanc-Suiza engines from the group in France manufacturing these engines, it is understood between us that the first duty of the group is to bring their deliveries to this country up to a rate of not less than 400 per month, and for this to be main-tained before any deliveries are made to you.     I would point out to ycu that our contracts also cover engines for the French and Kussian Governments and It would appear to me improbable that the group will be In a position to deliver any motors to ycu before our orders are completed in accordance with the promisod rates of delivery.     In connection with this, It- is also agreed that you will do your utmost to help the French manu-facturers to carry out these present commitments.In addition to the above, it is understood between us that after completion of these contracts, we will gtill require deliveries at the rate of 500 motors per month from French manufacturers, the types cf which are not at present specified.(10)   I also wish to confirm the joint demand now made on the French Government for the construction of 1000 80 H.P. Le Rhone engines, these to be all delivered before 51st December, 1917, the first 500 to be delivered to Great Britain and the next 500 to America.(11)   I note from your letter of 26th July that your Aircraft Production Board anticipate no difficulty in supplying us with complete parts of aeroplanes of the types In your programme, in particular, the timber parts and metal fittings.     I hope to arrange for a special representative to go to America shortly with cur requirements of this character.    Your letter of 28th July also contains the following paragraphs&quot;8.   In a cable received to-day, the Aircraft Production Board say that if the United States is to furnish the largest possible quantities of Materials, raw, semi-finished, and finished for the aircraft programme of the Allies, it is of great Importance that the Allies1 require-ments should be co-ordinated and that the Gcv-ernments of the Allied nations should prepare and forward at the earliest possible date the approximate necessary monthly requirements of all classes of materials, including wood, finished and semi-finished aircraft parts, forgings, fit-tings, propellers and in general everything else required.
&quot;9.   The Aircraft Production Board accept and adopt the view expressed in my cables that the supply of materials, raw, semi-finished and finished by the United States to the Allies should be the first con-sideration In the United States Aircraft Production programme.     Therefore it remains only to organise this supply of materials so that it may be made as effective as possible.&quot;With reference to the abovo, I have to confirm Mr. Churchill^ Verbal concurrence.* .4
