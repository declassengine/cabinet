The Government War Risks Insurance Scheme for nails and cargo, which was solvent as a whole till the Autumn of last year, lias since then been steadily losing money, and at the end of June the estimated deficit on hulls was about  13,000,000,and on cargo about  19,000,000.As nearly the whole of the British merchant fleet has now been taken over by the Government and is at the risk of the Government, the insurance of the ships them-selves can, for the moment, be put on one side.    Bit some alteration must be made in the scheme for the insurance of cargo.    The deficit on the cargo scheme increased during the month of June by considerably over  4,000,000, and the rate which is a flat rate for all voyages is at the maximum of the scheme, viz.,  5. 5. q.%.The natural thing is to increase the flat rate, say, to  7. 7. 0.%, and that night perhaps check the rate of loss, but the insurance scheme is not compulsory, and all the better risks will go to the open market, while the bad risks and the big risks v/htoli the market cannot take will be left with the Government.There is also the consideration that if we raise our flat rate the market will also raise their rates so as to keep just under ours, with the result that a heavy additional tax will be placed on the goods, that is, on the consumer, and this additional tas on the consuiaer will probably be greater than the amount which is saved for the taxpayer in reducing the deficit on the insurance fund.The
The same tiling would apply if the flat ratewere abolished end a system of differential rates according to- lie risks in the various trades were Sub-stituted for it.  All the had risks and all the big risks would still remain with the Government, and the losses would be heavy.The only way of meeting the difficulty is, it is suggested, to remove the competition of the outside market altogether.   TThen the insurance scheme was framed, it was thought that the Government scheme and the open market could exist side by side, the Government scheme controlling the market, but preventing the rates from rising to im-possible heights and securing that insurance should be obtainable under any conditions at a reasonable figure.Under present circumstances., this position can no longer be maintained, and the only way to prevent un-necessary loss and waste is for the Government in effect to take over the whole war risk insurance business af the country.!The leaders of the London insurance market have been sounded and recognise that something of this kind is inevitable.   The Committee of Lloyd&apos;s have placed them-selves unreservedly at the disposal of the Government, and there is no doubt the Insurance- ^kMp^nies will do the same.   It is therefore- proposed that the Board- of Trade make an arrangement with the insurance market under which after a certain date no war risks will be writi;enJby-anyone in the United Kingdom except through one central -body
body actingjjoehalf of the Government,    If this principle is agreed to,   the Board of Trade believe that the details can be arranged easily with the leaders of the insurance market, and that the insurance market will work the scheme on behalf of the Government.    A table of rates v/ill then be drawn out corresponding to the real rate of risk in the various trades for the time being, and everything will be insured at these rates.    IThere the real rate of risk is high, as in the Mediterranean, the rate will be above the present flat rate;   where it is low, as, for instance, in the Trade to Ilorth French ports, it will be much less.Some complaint will be made by merchants that they have made contracts ahead in the belief that  5. 5. 0;^ was the maximum of the Government scheme, and that it y/ould not be exceeded.    But no guarantee has been, or could be, given that in a war like this any insurance rates or any freight rates could be maintained indefinitely, and any prudent merchant must have known this.&apos;   Such complaints can be dealt with as and when they arise, and it is not thought that fear of them should prevent the proposed scheme being approved in principle if it is otherwise considered sound.10th August. 1917.A.H.S.
