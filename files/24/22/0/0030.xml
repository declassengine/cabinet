-17   144VJAR OABIM?.1630.  TEE   ST0CZB0IM   COHFBREBCE.Copy of Ilinute to Hr. Balfour by lora Robert Oecil. /-nr.- Balfour.Mr. Gunther spoke to me this afternoon about the Stockholm Conference.   He said that his Government has received applications from iaerican Socialists including a gentleman culled Hillquist, for passport to attend the Stockholm Conference, and he wished to know what was the policy of the British Government on the subject, so that his Govern- ; aent might determine their course of action accordingly.He showed mo and left with me the annexed letter from Mr. Henderson, which seems rather to complicate the situation.I told him that it was a matter for the War Cabinet to decide and that I was therefore unable to reply to him directly.   I hoped, : however, the War Cabinet would come to a decision very soon and I would not fail to let him know what it was.Speaking only for myself I added that I thought attendance by the allies at the Conference was likely to lead to unfortunate complica-tions.   He heartily agreed, particularly endorsing the statement that it was undesirable that private individuals should lay down or discuss in concert with belligerent subjects, terms of peace.4th August 1917. (I.ltd.)   R. C.Annerare to Lord Robert Cecil&apos;s Minute.(Copy of letter dated 26th July 1917 from LIr. G.IS. Hodgson, Private Secretary to Hr. Henderson, to L . Gunther, American Smbassy.)Dear Sir, .   . :I write with reference to your telephone enquiry concerning Morris Hillquist, the American Socialist, and the question of granting him a passport to attend the forthcoming Socialist Conference.   As you are aware the Foreign Office addressed a letter to Hr. G.H. Young, who . accompanied LIr. Henderson to Russia, asking him to obtain the latter1s views on the subject.   I have laid this letter before Hr. Henderson and he requests me to inform you that tho Stockholm Conference will bo held with the full approval of the Provisional Government in Russia, that tho British labour Party have docideo. in principle to support this Confcr-enoe and that a national British labour Conference will be held in August, to select representatives for Stockholm, and give them their mandate.I trust that this letter will furnish Dr. Page with the Informal tion which he requires.Yours faithfully, (3d) G.M. Hodgson.
