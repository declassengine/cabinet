DEPARTMENT OJ1 OTOEHATIOHINTELLIGENCE BUREAU.WEEKLY   REPORT   ON   GERMANY.July 26th to August 2nd, 1917.The German papers have continued to be much occupiedwith the interpretation of the new Chancellor^ inaugural speech and with Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s comments on it.    As a further addition to the controversy, we now have the new speeches by Dr. Miohaelis and Count Czernin.firmation of the point made by Mr. Lloyd George that Miehaelis1speech was one capable of two interpretations;   each Germanpaper, In fact, interprets it in the sense favourable to thepolioy which it advocates, and the Liberal and Socialistpapers frankly acknowledge the justice of Mr. Lloyd George&apos;scriticisms and regret that this opening was given:&quot;A Zurich message (July 29) states that the German Socialist PresB is insistent that Dr. Miohaelis should clear up the uncertainty caused by his opening speech in the Reichstag, especially the unfortunate phrase about securing the German frontiers.&quot;The Munchner Post writes, after referring to the DeutscheTafteszeltung. which interprets the Chancellor&apos;s programme tomean a German victory and the increase of German power :-&quot;When well-informed journalists who are in close touch with leading statesmen hold such views, Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s explanation of Dr. Michaelis1 speech is not surprising. *   Dr. Miohaelis oannot permit the confusion which his speech has occasioned to continue a day longer.   There must he an end to this swamp of obscurity and ambiguity.&quot;In regard to the general situation, it seems necessary to insist, even at the risk of repetition, on certain essential points.     If, in doing so, the result is to bring into greater prominence German strength, this may be justified &quot;because the public comments in the press, wellThere has been in the German press abundant con-
informed as they are, quite naturally and properly lay stress on the points of German weakness.There can he no doubt that the chief cause of the crisis of the last three weeks was the desire to destroy the influence of the reactionary and Pan-German parties.     It was not so much, that iB, a direct attack upon the Government as a joint protest by the cooperating parties in the Reichstag against the influence which the Pan-Germans were attempting to exercise.&quot;Y/hat was the question at issue for the Reichstag?   By the confirmation of a strong and active majority, there was to be established the possibility of a strong and coherent policy, both externally and internally, and especially the Government was to be free thereby from the dangerous ten-dency of paying more and more attention to the Pan-Germans and their noisy press agitation in the matter of war-aims and making concessions to them.&quot;     (Berliner Tageblatt).The point is of importance because, even had the action ofthe Reichstag Majority been, crowned by complete success, itwould not necessarily have led to any weakening of the Govern-ment or diminished influence of the military advisers of theGovernment, regarded purely in their proper function astechnical experts on the conduct of the war;   the effect ofit would have been merely to remove what the Liberals justlyregard as the weakest point in the German defence.It is impossible to read papers such as the Frank-furter 2eitunft and the Berliner Tageblatt without recognising that their real object is a double one, first to establish the point that Germany is fighting in self-defence and not for aggression,. and secondly - as a corollary to this - to bring it about that the whole combined efforts of the nation may be concentrated on conducting this defensive war to a satisfactory conclusion.    This paramount aim they believed would be better achieved if the Government frankly acknowledged the importance of the Reichstag as the expression of the will of the nation,
consulted it and depended upon it.    They desire to bring it about that the Allies should understand that when once the objects of the war hare been satisfactorily defined in the &quot;no annexation&quot; sense, the enemies of Germany, will have to meet the unconquerable resolution of the whole nation.    They desire to get rid of even the appearanoe of Justification for the distinction which is often made between the Geraan Govern-ment and the German nation.They say, and justly say, that it is e weakness of Germany that the Pan-Germans seem to count for so much, and it is also a weakness that there may be some justification in the suggestion that the war is being fought, not for ends common to the whole nation, but to maintain the authority of a small reactionary group which surrounds the l&amp;peror and the seat of Government.    $be liberalisation of German institutions would, according to this view, strengthen the nation in the oonduct of the war just as it strengthens France and England.On the whole it may be said that for the moment the movement seems to have failed.    It has done so for reasons well-known to those who have closely followed recent German party politics, via: the impossibility of getting any permanent cooperation between the National-Liberals, the Centre and the other parties.    The chief point is the defec-tion of the Centre, and now, as always, the action of the Centre which is purely opportunist, is a good guide to general German opinion.    As was pointed out last week, they Have broken away from the demand for Parliamentary government, and now it has become increasingly apparent that it is im-possible to depend on their loyal cooperation even with regard to the Reiohstag resolution for defensive war-aims.
$. This failure has probably been caused chiefly bythe more optimistic feeling arising both in Germany and, to some extent, in Austria, owing to the Russian d^bfccle.     Ho doubt it was the extremity to which Austria was being reduced which had the chief influence in Germany;   had the Russian offensive continued, things would have been very different. We get always to the ultimate truth that everything depends, not on the superficial play of politics, but on the real forces behind: armies, submarines, blockade, food.    Much of the apparent moderation we have heard of recently in Germany, is only the reflex of their anxiety as to the issue of the war;   if they get successes, if our offensive fails, if the French or the Italians show weakness, we shall not hear anything more (except among the Socialists and the Radicals) about the defensive war, but it will only be a German peace. If our offensive succeeds, and if the intense pressure arising from the blockade increases, the forces of moderation will get the upper hand.7. This is v/hat the military Bee.     It is theirstrength that they fix their eyes on the essential things. There is much talk about Hindenburg and Ludendorff. We have no real authentic information as to their views oropinions.    On the other hand, anyone who has given anyattention to the Btudy of military opinion and to the teach-ing of the books and men on whom they have been brought up,can probably form a very just idea of what their views reallyare.    There are certain common-places and truisms which al-ways remain true.   Among these we have - that the object ofwar is to bring about a satisfactory peace;   that a satisfao-tory peace is one that brings about a permanent increase ofpower;   that victories on the battlefield or the occupationof enemy territory are translated into political terms bythe peace.    We also have the comnonplace that when the crisis
of the war is approaching, in this as in any other competition, the victory will come to the side which has the strongest will to victory, the strongest nerves, the strongest endurance. This is the doctrine which the Oerri&amp;n generals have sucked in from their childhood.     It is this that they feel now they have to translate into practice.    However great the strain may he at home, they know that it is their duty to keep always in their minds that the strain is being equally felt elsewhere, and it is their duty also to refuse to let their judgment be perverted or their will weakened by their consciousness of the strain at home.     They will therefore always say &quot;Durchhalteni&quot; Stick to it, as Frederick the Great did, and the;u. we shall win throughI    And they have before their minds many contingencies which may justify this view.     What has happened in Russia will appear as an illustration of the general principle.     In a manner which was quite unexpected, the Russian Revolution, which it might have been anticipated would work out for the benefit of the Allies, has removed from Austria the danger when she was on the point of collapse.    They will therefore say, what has happened once may happen again.   &quot;The alliance of our enemies is less closely knit than our own;   each one of them is probably near the breaking point.   Serbia is on the point of surrender, no-one knows what may happen in Italy and in France.   Therefore no weakness I    Peace indeed at once, if you can get satisfactory peace, that is a peace based on the fact that we are occupying a great extent of enemy country, but no weakness which would lead us to surrender this great advantage except for great permanent corresponding political gains.&quot;Von der Goltz, in a book which probably better than any other expresses the real mentality of the best German officers, quotes with approval &quot;the Roman principle never to
conclude peace in times of disaster, to which that world-wide iibpire owed its rise&quot;, and of course campaigns of Frederick the Great are for every German the classical example of this prin-ciple.     This we can be sure is in the mind3 of the ruling military authorities, and it is in accordance with this prin-ciple that the Chancellor will cooperate with them.It is misleading and dangerous to talk of Hindenburg and Ludendorff merely as partisans of the Pan-Germans;   it is equally misleading to throw contempt on MichaeliB simply as a tool of the military party;   we ought rather to look on him as a man who has to carry out at home in matters of food supply and munitions, everything that is necessary, just as the mili-tary people do in the field, and loyally to cooperate with them for the national defence.The weak point of the situation in Germany is that the military will not confine themselves to the energetic prosecution of the war, but will probably more and more inter-fere with civil government at home, and the notorious blindness and tactlessness of the German officers will tend to alienate even German opinion as it has done that of every other nation of the world.To Prussian soldiers it is Inconceivable that a war should end without the reassertion of German military supremacy. They will therefore use their influence to prevent the formula &quot;a defensive war&quot; or &quot;peace without annexation&quot; being adopted by the Government in such a manner as would bind it to accept terms of peace that would exclude some definite and tangible gain for Germany,    we can see this influence in Michaelis1 speech, and especially in the much debated expression about the security of the German frontier.     In the authorised version this sen-tence reads:   &quot;If we make peace, we must primarily achieve this, that the frontiers of the German Empire are for all times safe-
guarded.&quot;    The question is being debated whether this means merely the maintenance of the present frontiers or the aoqui-Bition of such additional territory, especially strategical points, as will secure them for the future.    There can be little doubt that the latter is the correct interpretation, and that this security is the object which the military people have put before themselves.    As against this it may be pointed out that the only thing that matters is therefore that this war-aim should be defeated and that there should be some definite dlminutio regnl of such a kind that it should be obvious to all that they had failed.     It is not necessary that this should be large;   it is not necessary that it should be one of such a nature as to separate from Germany any district which is un-doubtedly German, but if the military ascendancy in the govern-ment of the country is to be stopped, it must be made clear that the resort to arms has led to a definite and tangible loss.It is often suggested, aometimeB even in Germany itself, that the appointment of Michaelis is a triumph for the &quot;reaction&quot;.    There is no clear justification of this view. The probable truth ie simpler;   that is, that Bethmann-Hollweg had ceased to have control of the situation and that his nerves were beginning to give way.    Whether war was to be continued or negotiations begun, it would be absolutely essential that he should be replaced by a man who was not worn out, who could be trusted to keep a stronger control and to show no signs of weak-ness.In this connection it is necessary to define care-fully what is meant by &quot;reaction&quot;.     A careless use of expres-sions suoh as this may easily lead to fundamental mieinterpre-tation, and thereby to a wrong polloy.    The word properly applies to the policy of the Prussian Geaservative Party who are advocates of the increased power of the King, baaed on
the doctrine of &quot;the Sing by the grace of God&quot;, and, closely associated with this, the wish to retain the supremacy of the Prussian nobility and agrarians.     These men deliberately and consciously separate themselves from the more universal inter-ests of the nation and regard themselves as belonging to a privileged and separate class.     They are a small but very dangerous party, dangerous just because of their great in-herited power.     This is a claim which is repudiated by a great majority of the German nation, and were the Government at this moment to identify themselves with it, i.e. to become reactionary in the real sense of the word, that would quickly lead the nation to disaster.    There is no reason whatever for supposing that Michaelis shares their views.     It is,probable, however, and this is a very different thing, that he is an upholder of Government authority;   that is, he will not, above all in the stress of war, allow the control to be transferred to untried hands.     In this he would probably have the support of large classes in the nation who would claim to be liberals.ThiB report is necessarily occupied with matters concerning the opinion and moral of the German nation, and in this connection it is incumbent to call attention to anything that would tend either to weaken or to strengthen the national coherence and capacity for carrying on the war.    All the latest utterances, including that of the Emperor, show that they de-sire to insist that the war is essentially a defensive one, and anything which will confirm this iB necessarily a great asset to them,     The difficulty they have to meet at home is the constant criticism which is voiced by the Independent Socialist Party, proclaiming that this is not true;   the Independent Socialists themselves represent a not inconsiderable fraction of the German people;   certainly they are relatively far more important that are their counterpart in this country, and they Have a further importance because the constant reiteration of
their views inevitably affects both the Majority Socialists, the Radicals and the Centre Party.     It is of the greatest advantage to the allied cause that the Independent Socialists should be enabled to make a contrast between the annexationist desires of large sections of German people and the claims of the Allies, that they aj*e fighting for the independence of small states, that they are struggling against the rule of violence and that they are maintaining the principle of self-determination of peoples.     Everything which tends to make it appear that these claims are not genuine, that they are merely a hypocritical cloak to designs of conquest and annexation, inevitably has great influence in strengthening German resis-tanee.    This applies in particular to any proposal in the case of an allied victory to separate from Germany any dis-trict which is undoubtedly German, both in character and in feeling, and nothing could be more detrimental to the allied cause than to allow the Germans to believe, or even to give them any excuse for pretending to believe, that a German defeat will be followed by the severance from Germany of por-tions of the left bank of the Rhine, or an attempt to restore the miserable condition of national disunion which prevailed in Germany before 1870.     If it was allowed to be believed that this country was party to any such project, the whole confidence in Great Britain, which is undoubtedly a very real factor in the opinion of a number of Germans, would be des-troyed.    This ia a matter which must be clearly distinguished from the projects of colonial expansion;   loss of the colonies would doubtless be an injury to German preBtige, but it would not affect the German nation as a whole in their most intimate feelings.     we cannot afford to leave without an immediate and decisive answer Miohaelis&apos; speech dealing with peace matters and the German Emperor&apos;s proclamation.
On this point a passage from the Vorwarts may-be quoted:&quot;It is incomprehensible- &quot;that the French Socialists do not oppose annexation in public as in secret session. It is an awkward decision for the allied governments whether they should publish the statements or not. lit (? publication) would disillusion peoples who think they fight for the highest ideals.     The provinces which the French vraht to annex are German by race, speech, tradition.     Such policy of annexation would be criminal to France, for when she stood alone without the present allies, she would be overwhelmed by a German revanche which no Social Democracy could prevent.&quot;The question of Alsace-Lorraine can, even fromthe German point of view, be differentiated from all othersimilar projects.     At any rate, so long as there is put inthe foreground the desire of the population itself, it is amatter which can be pressed without injury to British repu-tation.J. W. H. 2.August 1917.
