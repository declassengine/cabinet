AQRICtn?rtfKXL SBCTIOK,(a) Mitltarv and other Labour on the^Tarms^1. England &amp; Walea^  The difficulties whJLch have arisen with the Board of Agriculture as to the fulfilment of the Agreement between that Board and this Department were reported last week.   During the week the whole of the Commissioners and Sub-Commissioners of this SectioxLisave requested the Director-General to allow them to resign, in consequence of tho issue of the new Army Council Instruction,
which in contravention of the above mentioned agreement hands over the allocation of military labour to the War Agricultural Executive Committees.2*   Scotland.   The position is the same as last week. It is expected that the additional soldiers to be provided for the Corn Harveat will be sfent to Scotland very shortly, and the Commissioners have arrangements completed for the distribution of that labour when it arrives, (b) National Service Volunteers for Agriculture.The number of Volunteers passed for Agriculture (to date) after interview is 2,776, the number of Volunteers asked for is 1,738, and of these 801 have been placed.   The number of soldiers placed on temporary work is 12,869;   on permanent work 6,278.   In addition, 217 men, mainly ploughman, have boon lent by their employers who are not themselves engaged In agriculture.It is to be kept in View that these numbers do not include the lent labour for the Harvest, comprising 9,754 soldiers.(o) Sshool Bfeys and Professional Labour.Suitable modifications have beon made in the arrangements for camps, according as demands from some districts have been reduced, or further demands have arisen; in various Counties tho Agricultural Executive Committees and tho Beard of Agricul-ture have apparently made demands for School Bay Camps where this class of labour is not actually required by tho farmers. It is expected, however, that tho number of workers previously stated to be necessary will be made up by new demands from other quarters. 4*      GENERAL TRADES SECTIOK.(a) Trade Committees.   Uncertainty aa to the present position of ,Nati^kis^^ la* connectionwith Trade Committees both at headquarters and in the
&amp;vinosi.   ??$M the Morth. Eastern dl^t^ct&quot;IJie&quot; Cetmis*loaier states that in his opinion unless roattsre are settled at ones, the sympathies of the Trade Unions will be alienated. Prom ths Yorkshire area it Is stated that the j$i&amp;&amp;a&amp;ig Trades Corvlttoeo are tired of having little op nothing ,&apos;. to do.(b) Other Schemes. . Ten more men have been transferred from the North Wales Slate parries to and the first weekly batch of 5 referred to in a previous report have been transferred from coal mines. 5,   LOCAL NATIONAL SERVICE COMMITTEES SECTION.The number of National Service Committees appointedto date is as under;-\.In England &amp; Wales ,..,   874\In Scotland    ...     ...   150The reports from the various Commissioners show that there is very little activity being displayed by the Local National Service Committees and that this is undoubtedly due to two primary causes, namely, first the uncertainty as to any need for effort bought about by the recent Press Campaign against the Department, and secondly, the faot that owing to the men not being called te the Army there is as yet very little scope for Substitution work. 6.   SUBSTITUTION.general.   The continued uncertainty as to the future of the Department is having an adverse effect on the general work of Substitution and on the Trade Committees.A quotation on this point is given from thg report the A.S.O. Manchester:-
a   4   *&quot;The adverse critiams in the Preas and the rumours that the Department is &quot;in extremis&quot; have engendered in the eyes of the public, in our Committees, and even in our own Officers, a feeling of distrust on the one hand, and of despondency on the other.&quot;(b) Volunteers placed during week.The number of demands for National Service and Substitution Volunteers reaching the Substitution Officers during the week amounted to 1,383;   1,997 men have been submitted and 751 have been placed.   These numbers cannot be regarded as unsatisfactory when all the circumstances are considered. (g) Local Trades Committees.Until the difficulty is settled with regard to the payment of the difference in wages ef Volunteers it is almost impossible to make use of the Substitution Volunteers pro-vided by the Committees.   If the present difficulty con-tinuea there is a grave danger that the Cemmitteea will cease their activities.Extracts from Commissioners reports are given:-Mr. Lauder, Newcastle.   &quot;A small number of Substitution Volunteers have been placed in employment from the Building Trades committee, and as the Employers refuse te pay these Volun-teers at their old rate of wage without authority from this Department and a guarantee that the difference between their present rate and their old rate would be refunded, the position created ia one of serious moment.I have further to report that the Trade Union Representatives en these Committees are much dissatisfied with the position and the manner in which their members whe have been placed in employment have been treated.&quot;Mr. H.J. Wilson, Glasgow. &quot;It would be disastrous ir ail the labour and all the enthusiasm which has beezj put into the organisation of this particular Trades Committee (Buildings) should be mullifled through the lack of an agreement which already works satisfactorily in the case of War Munition Volunteero.&quot;
Mr. Wright. Leeds.   &quot;The Building Trades Committee -nave a number of men available as Substitution Volunteers but nothing yet can be done to utilise these men because no definite method hai yet been furnished for the claiming of difference in wages where a Substitution Volunteer is sent to a job carrying a lower rate of wage than the job he leaves.As an emergency measure, the Director-General has arranged with the Financial Secretary to the Treasury for covering sanction to the payment, out of State funds, of the difference between the former rate and present rate of wages earned by such Substitution Volunteers as have been or may be placed on urgent vrork for Government Departments.   The general position, however, still remains uncertain.(d)   National Service Committees: dealing with unorganised trades The reports do not Indicate any improvement of theprospect of obtaining any considerable number of Volunteersfroro this source; as the minor trades appear to have fewmen left available.Following are some extracts from correspondencereceived by the Walsall A.S.O.Walsall lc District Butchers Trade Association.&quot;i may state that since the commencement of the War upwards of 100 butchers and assistants have joined the Army.   Under the circumstances I do not see how we can spare men for National Service without jeopardising the food supply of the people&quot;.Walsall &amp; District Coal Merchants1 Association. &quot;We regret under the circumstances that there isno possibility of assisting you further, unlesssome of us closed down altogether,&quot;Walsall Master Bakers1 Association.    &quot;We suggestthat it would be very unwise to press for more men at the present juncture from an industry responsible for the feeding of the population of a Munitions producing area such as Walsall.f&apos;Also other extracts from letters to this effect fromthe Walsall Grocery &amp; Provision Trade.Walsall Grocery &amp; Provision Trade, Walsall Drapery k Clothing Trades. Walsall Tobacc-  Association.
Walsall Boot &amp; Shoe Trade.Walsall Branch of Dairymens&apos; Association.Walsall Tradesmens&apos; Association.Bloxwlch Tradesmen&apos;s Associations.   &quot;I am naw In   osse3sIon&quot; of&quot;&quot;&quot;^ report from each member appointed representing Grocery, Baking, Drapery, Clothing, and Boot Trades, etc, andam quite convinced that every branch of trade has been drained, and I reluctantly must confess 1 cannot see any possibility of drawing any further on the resources of this locality.WOMEN fS SECTION,During the past week the Women&apos;s Section have been mainly engaged with the transfer of the work of the Women fs Army Auxiliary Cerps to the Employment Department, and in conferences with the Timber Supplies Department as regards the transfer of timber, and the Ministry of Munitions and the Paper Commission as regards the transfer of waste.Enrolments for the Vvomen&apos;s Land Army to date, are as follows:-England ... 38,958 Scotland   ... 3,214Ireland     ... 43The Director-General has accepted the resignation ef the Director and Deputy Director of this Section.4.8.&apos;17.DIRECTOR-GENERAL OP NATIONAL SERVICE.
