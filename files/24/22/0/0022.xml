St. James&apos;s Park,&apos;f-j* &apos;V London, S.W.1:?a^d^iei.foll6wing number quoted.4th August 1917.Sir,In continuation of my letter of the 28th ultimo,I am directed by the Shipping Controller to report, for the information of the War Cabinet, as follows:-1*    Convoys.    Twelve convoys have been brought in to date, consisting of 205 ships of 1,450,000 tons deadweight. The casualties to convoyed ships to date are as follows one oil carrying ship damaged by torpedo, and 2000 tons of oil lost, and two collisions, one ship being sunk.  Another ship laden with wheat from Ipswich to Montreal lost her convoy two days out from Canada in a fog, failed to rejoin and came on alone, arriving off these Islands twenty-four hours ahead of her convoy.   She was attacked by a submarine and sunk.   The convoy arrived safely on the following day.United Kingdom sailing %5Srf&apos;four days.   It is hoped that the first convoy from West Africa will sail at an early date. The question of internal Mediterranean convoys is being closely investigated and a scheme is in process of being drawn up for discussion with the French and Italian authorities. Lieutenant Morris, Boyal Warwicks,   (late of the Itoyal MailSteam Packet Company) accompanied by two officials of this Department, are going to Malta shortly to assist in running the convoys and to found ,a specialised Ifoditerraneaa card index.Convoys have been started from Gibraltar to the?he Secretary War Cabinet.
2.    Finance.  During the week ended 28th July the sum of  1,066,000 was paid as compensation for ships lost by war peril while on requisition, making the total amount paid on this account in the current financial year  12,485,048.3.    Tonnage for the conveyance of Timber   The question of tho conveyance of timber to this country is again assuming importance.    For the month of August, excluding pitprops for which the estimate of the Tonnage Priority figure is 60,000 tons, roughly 137,000 tons of timber will be brought in, consisting of arrivals from tho Baltic arid the White Sea and of timber from the North American Continent which must be brought for Army and shipbuilding requirements which cannot otherwise be met, and timbor for tho French (details attached).The continued largo importation of pitprops is causing anxiety and the Controller of Timber Supplies has been asked to furnish a statement of the present position and the prospects of increased production at home.A controversy with the French as to our liability to carry timber for them under a Convention entored into between tho Governments in November 1916 is being referred to the Foreign Office for a decision as to the proper interpretation of the agreement.    Meantime it is necessary, in order to avoid stoppage by the French of our wood-cutting in France, to put further tonnage at their disposal - roughly 18,000 tons for August.It will probably be necessary to alter the Convention of November 1916 and revert to a cash basis for the purchase of forests in France instead of a tonnage basis.
4.     Appended are two memoranda which may be of interest to the War Cabinet, the first dealing with the question of speed to which standard ships should be built; and the second with certain aspects of the labour question in connection with the standard ship programme.I am, .

LABOUR ON STANDARD SHIPS      . ,   :$hen the construction of Standard Ships was decided upon., consideration was given to the question of whether they should be built to private account or to Government account.From the labour point of view all were agreed that it was better that they should be built to Government account (a)   in order that, there might be no possible doubt in the miuds of the men as to whether they were . engaged on Government work.Admiralty work - because of increased rates and allowances which had been forced by the men when there was a great rush for accelerated work - was broadly, speaking more remunerative; and while clearly monoy was at the back of their minds, the men always advanced the patriotic reason for preferring Admiralty work; (b)   in order to remove any suspicion on the part of the men that the ships were being built for private ownership -, agd what they called &quot;profiteering&quot;. :.There was at the time evidence of unrest, and demands for increased rates, on the plea,  . openly stated, that they were entitled to a share in - the plunder. It was known that even in non-fighting ships which had been built for Admiralty, account, the men had demanded -and had received - rates in excess of Merchant Ship rates. They always grounded their claim for these rates on the stricter inspection that was required on work for the Admiralty than inordinary
Ordinary merchant practice, and while in some cases it was difficult for them to substantiate such a Claim it sounded plausible.It was felt that sd long as the contracts were placed in the name of the Shipping Controller, this pretext could not be put forward, and there was not likely to be serious trouble in getting the standard shijis constructed at ordinary merchant rates,Experience has completely justified this view.    On the North Sast Coast (e.g.    where there was an up-to-date Biveters&apos; Piecework Merchant List, there Was no difficulty in getting the rivetting work done at the ordinary merchant list rates.On the Clyde the situation was more difficult.    The Herchant Price List for Riveters1 work was being challenged by the men even before the war as being out of date, and investigation has shown that some firms had before the war departed from the List in certain important items of work,    ill merchant work on the Clyde has therefore been a subject of dispute.The rivetting trouble with regard to Standard Ships on \the Clyde arose not from any demand that Admiralty rates should be pa^d - this has never/been suggested by the men - but from the fact tjiat the prices for all merchant work were in dispute.Apparently it is this trouble that has spread to Birkenhoad and the Tees and Hartlepool.    According to the informa-tion available in the Ministry of Shipping, the men in these dis-tricts are demanding not Admiralty rates, but the revised Clyde rates which are higher than the N.B.C.rates.    The building of the Standard Ships to private account would not lessen the trouble but would ratter accents,ta \t.There
There is likewise the danger that building the ships to Admiralty account would make further complications with the men and lead to greatly increased demands.    The safe policy, so far as labour is concerned^ is to continue to build these Standard Ships to the order of the Shipping Controller.Ministry of Shipping.28th July 1917.
THE SPEED OP STANDARD SHIPSThe following notes summarise the   results of a statistical enquiry as to the advisability of building standard shins of 8000 tons dead weight capacity with a speed of 13 knots instead of ll  laiots as at present arranged.     It is assumed that in either case the number of sLips available is the same but that the faster vessels   would occupy 8 months In building as against 6 months taken by the slower vessels.    The faster vessels , on the other hand, are assumed to have the advantages of (a) shorter duration of voyage, (b) lower vulnerability to attack, and these notes attempt to measure the relative values of these advantages and disadvantages.The assumptions made are as follows (a)x That the building programme is so arranged that lllj knot&apos;&apos; dhips can be delivered from 1st January 1918 onwards at the rate of 40 a month or 15 knot ships from 1st March onwards at the average rate of 30 a month (the initial deliveries would be at 40 a month, but the assumed restriction of the number of slips would bring down the average of 30)(b) That all vessels will be put into the North Atlantic trade, and that the average steaming time (taken all the year round) would be, at llj knots 32 days, or at 13 knots 29 days, the average duration of-the round voyage, including time in port being about 60 days, or 57 days, respectively.(c) That if speed be 111 knots one vessel in ten will be sunk onthe* These particular assumptions are relative.     Any other figure bearingthe same proportions to each otfoernTOuTd suffice.* The tonnage completed in the year 1918 on these assumptions Tfould be-for 11-j knot boats, about 2,400,000 tons ojross; for 13 knot   boats, (    aDout 1,500,000 tons gross.M
the round voyage and one vessel in thirty if speed he 13 knots\ These are of course hypothetical assumptions; they would seem to favour the faster boats in assuming them to be subject to only one-third of the risk of successful attack which attends the slower boats.The following is a statement of the estimated work done in the years 1918 and 1919.11-g Jknoit JboatsEstimatedHo, de-No. sur-Viving atYearCargoeslivered   end of year   receivedTo 31 Dec. 1918 11 30 June 1919 &quot;   31 Dec. 1919480240 240 980360*575 575930 &apos; 1,120 1^420 3,500Estimated Im-porta at 7500 tons d.w. per ____vqjage____^7,200,000 8,400,000 10,700,000 2^,300,00011 31 Dec .1918 &quot; 30 June 1919 &quot;   31 Dec 1919x approximate.300 180 180660276 7401,120*550 550 3;3701,5105,500,000 8,400,000 11,300,000 25^20^000It will be seen that in the year 1918 the advantage lies, to a narked extent, with the slower ships which bring in nearly two million more tons of imports than the faster vessels would carry. In the first half of 1919 there is a practical equality of results, as measured by imports.     After June 1919 the advantage is wholly with the faater vessels.     The disparity would grow rapidly, and it is not worth while to extend the figures beyond December 1919.Stress, however, must be laid upon the doubt which is felt as to the possibility of realising one of the assumptions underlyingthese/
these figures namely viz.&apos; that the faster vessels would he subject to only one third of the rate of loss by which the slower vessels would be reduced.     As aboVe^S^^ssumption is quite hypothetical.     It would probably be more reasonable to assume that the faster vessels would suffer two-thirds of the rate of loss sustained by the slower boats; on this basis the respective figures as to imports wbuld be approximately as follows *3y 11-j- knot boats    By 13 knoi boats tons &apos; tonsTo 31st December 191S 7,200,000 5,100,00011   &amp;)th June        1919 3;400,000 :   7,400,000&quot;   31st December 1919 10,700,000 .     9,400,00026,500^000 21,900,000Under the last assumption the advantage would be with the slower vessels throughout the years 1918 and 1919&quot;.     The faster vessels   would probably become the more productive in 1920, but in the critical years that lie immediately before us the slower vessels would supply us with at least four million tons more than the faster boats would bring.3y the end of 1917 we may expect our ships to be reduced to an importing capacity of 2,000,000 tons a month.     To maintain this, if losses by enemy action continue at the rate of 20 vessels a week, will require nev/ ships, either British or Foreign, to be brought into British service at the rate of 4,500,000 tons a year, as has been previously reported.     &quot;Jith this in prospect^ it is open to the gravest doubt whether we can afford deliberately to sacrifice about 2 million tons ofimports/
imports in 1918 and probably a further 2 million tons in 1919 with no other purpose than that of improving the position effectually (a reslilt which would admittedly be secured) from 1920 onwards.     This however would be involved in a substitution of 13 knots for llv knots as the speed Of ihe new standard cihips.A. W. W. W. P. E.[inistry of Shipping, Statistical Branch. 11th July, 1917
