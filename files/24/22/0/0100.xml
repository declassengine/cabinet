SECRET.Department of Information,WEEKLY REPORT ON RUSSIA. XVII.(August 13, 1917).Intelligence Bureau,CRW/017.The National Government.The outstanding event of the past week has been the formation of a National Government under the premiership of M. Kerensky.     This leadership has virtually passed over into a dictatorship as the result of the resignation of M. Kerensky at one stage of the proceedings, which synchronized with the moment of extremect opposition of the two main currents of political thought, that of the bourgeois represented by the Cadets who are afraid of immediate land reform, and that of the mass of the people represented by the C.W.S.D. demanding measures of immediate economic relief for them.     The direct outcome cf the crisis was that the projected &quot;Moscow Conference&quot; was at once summoned by the Provisional Government and held in Petrograd.     The meeting of August 3, attended by representatives of all the political parties as also of the Duma, promises to be historic, if for no other reason than that after most plain and forceful statements of the situation at the front, in the rear, and in the country generally, by different Ministers, a compromise was reached, whereby on the basis of the acceptance of a well-defined condition on either side, it was agreed to sink all other differences for the present and rally round M, Kerensky, whose resignation had not been accepted, for the salvation of Russia.     On the one hand the Socialists agreed that the Government should possess entire liberty of action in all its policy, and be completely independent
2.d*      of the pressure and influence of any political party;    on the other hand the Cadets consented to a statement of continued adherence to the general policy of the Government enunciated in previous declarations, particularly that of July 21.The major share of the credit for clearly focussing the relative issues and responsibilities seems to belong to hi. Milyukoff, who is reported as saying, &quot;Either M. -Kerensky or the Provisional Government must receive full power and unlimited dictatorship without the possible co-operation of the Soviet, or else all power must be transferred to the latter&quot;. &quot;Do you accept power?&quot;   he asked M. Tchkeidze.     The latter in the name of the Soviet replied categorically that it would refuse to accept power,as it refused its consent to the conferring of full dictatorial powers, which would mean the renouncing by the Soviet of the direction of the revolutionary masses.     The following day M, Kerensky withdrew his resignation and issued a statement in which he referred to the task entrusted to him &quot;as an express order of the country to construct a strong Revolutionary Government in the shortest possible time and in spite of all obstacles which might arise&quot;.     Such aims as carrying on the war, sustaining the fighting powers of the army, and re-establishing the economic strength of the State, he considers to be &quot;stern necessities&quot;.The personnel of the Government and the relation of the different members to the various political groups may be gathered from the following statement.4 Social Revolutionaries:   Kerensky, Avksentieff, Tchernoff,Zarudny.iL^Jl^J^^r^s-.:    Prckopovitch, Skcbeleff, Nikitin. kJ^MS^BL   Kokoshkln, Oldenburg, Kartasheff, Yurenieff.
j Popular Socialist:    Pyeshekhonoff. 1 Radical Democrat:   Yephremoff.., 2 non-party;   Terostchenko, Nekrassoff.The first feature about this Cabinet may be said to be its unitary character.    It is much more of a whole, If of a Social-Revolutionary tinge, than the above analysis would seem to imply.   The writer believes It to be essentially a Kerensky Cabinet, i.e. composed of men from different parties who are, however, personally attached to the Premier.     For example, the new Minister of Public Instruction, Dr Oldenburg, who was a Liberal member of the Council of the Empire, and is trusted by men of all parties, Tfas personally Invited by M. Kerensky when Minister of Justice to be a member of the Special Commission appointed to try judicially the members of the old regime who are under arrest. On hesitating to take a post which had such judicial powers over the lives of individuals, Dr Oldenburg was told by M. Kerensky that the purpose of the Committee was primarily investigative -instituted.with the purpose of ascertaining what secret and other relations had recently existed between Germany and Russia with a view to making the repetition of such a state of things impossible -and only judicial in a secondary sense.   He was again pressed to take the post by M. Kerensky as his &quot;friend&quot;, and finally agreed to do so.   This stnong personal attachment is known to exist between tho Premier and other members of the Hew Cabinet. A second feature is the circumstance that on the whole it has the complexion of being slightly more to the Right than its predecessor, even if unlike the previous Cabinet it does not contain members of so extreme a party of the Right as Octobrists have now come to be.   A third feature is the voluntary withdrawal
\   of M. Tseretelli, who hes given as his reason his intention of devoting his energy to the/organisation of democracy in connection with the Soviet of which he *vas formerly President.     It might have &quot;been supposed that he preferred to hunt -vith his fellov-Georgian Tchkheidze, and to continue to embarrass the Government as the Council has undoubtedly done up till recently.   And in this connection it is worthy of notice that, at a Joint Heeting of the Soviet and the Executive Council of the Peasants&apos; Delegates, a resolution entrusting the formation of a new Ministry to Kerensky and inviting the inclusion of representatives of all parties in agreement with the statement outlined on July 21, was only carried by 147 votes to -x6 with 42 abstentions.     Fortunately there would appear to bo no doubt about M, Tseretelli&apos;s real intentions.   He is probably convinced of the necessity of thorough organisation of the democracy in case of any attempted counter-revolutionary stroke, but having only two months ago openly declared his desire to prosecute actively a class struggle, he now boldly tells the Soviet that &quot;our policy must not be a class policy, but we must first call upon oue own classes to make sacrifices, otherwise there will be a still-born coalition. We will not speak of class interests.   The class that cannot at the critical moment rise above its own interests and take a national point of view will be excluded from the Coalition. Formerly we not only controlled the Government, but we exercised its functions.   The Government could not do without the co-operation of -the democratic organisations.   Now the authority must be (!;iven over entirely to the Provisional Government, while the Revolutionary democracy retains only the ri^ht to criticise without interfering in its measures&quot;.     It is evident how strong a support M. TseretelliI   can give in a sincere pursuit of these aims - an attitude which,
if consistently adopted, will make him second only to Kerensky himself.Church and State.Amongst the new appointments is that of Professor Kartasheff as Procurator of the Holy Synod in succession to the Oetobrist Vladimir Lvov.   Professor Kartasheff, who fbmerly occupied a post in a Young TJomenfs Seminary and is now Professor of Canon Law in the Theological Seminary, was, however, gazetted tvo days later as Minister of Public Worship.   It is evident that the -post of Procurator of the Holy Synod, which was one of the innovations introduced under the bureaucratic regime of Peter the Great, has been abolished, and it seems probable that the old office of Patriarch will be re-introduced, which was abolished at the time of the Institution of the Procuratorship.     Only very recently the ex-Procurator carried a reform through the Holy Synod which he described to the writer ac &quot;the greatest within the last 200 years&quot;, whereby the people in the local parishes will have henceforth the ri^ht to elect the village priests themselves, these appointments having hitherto been in the hands of the bishops.   A small Commission is at present engaged in the work of redefining and reconstituting the parishes throughout Russia in view of this ne\* departure. It is probable, however, that the step has been taken with a view to consolidating the ecclesiastical front in case of any depredatory action on the part of the Socialist Government such as befell the Roman Catholic Church in Prance comparatively recently.    In any case these movements point to a now relationship betveen Church and State which may have an important bearing on the political outlook of the future.
Finland.The Russian papers continue full of the situation in Finland.   The Ryetch sees the primary cause of the situation in the &quot;weakness&quot; of the Government.     The Novaya Zhizn also thinks that firmness and precision are absolutely necessary, but adds that the weakness was first shown by Milyukoff. There is, in short, a certain tone of bitterness, even of menace, throughout all the press, the Socialist organs excepted, which is most outspoken, naturally, in the Novoye Vremya:    &quot;It is not worth while to consider the behaviour of the Finnish Government.   The final account will be settled at the conclusion of the war.   The Finnish democracy is unique among democracies in not having contributed a single obol to the cause of freedom&quot;.     The Russkaya Volya quotes the text &quot;He that is not for us is against us&quot;, and the Den finds that the Finns have always looked on Russia as something foreign to them.     &quot;They reason:   we do not know whether the Revolution will triumph in Russia or whether it will fail; we do not know what sort of forces will appear at the head ofRepublican Russia....... For us in every relationship tho mootadvantageous thing to do is to abandon the ship and place our own little boat under the international flag&quot;.     The sudden calling of railway strikes, the refusal to maintain hospitals for the Russian wounded, the demand for the removal of troops, and numerous other actions conceived in a petty and somewhat spiteful spirit, have done much to alienate the finer Russian feeling, and It is obvious that a delicate situation still exists.     Fortunately the latest accounts point to some modification of the extreme Finnish action.   The dissolution
of the Diet has been accepted by that body and the Senate, the Governor-General explaining that the opening of the new Diet will coincide with the meeting of the Constituent Assembly, and that both bodies will be able to pronounce legitimately upon the political future of Finland.General Internal Situation.The internal economic and financial situation naturally remains in a troubled condition, the only satisfactory feature being a renewed spell of contribution to the Liberty Loan. M, Nekrassoff as Minister of Finance has publicly intimated the Intention of the Government to establish a certain number of State commercial monopolies as an extreme measure, a policy which was privately adumbrated by a predecessor In office in a conversation reported in Special Memorandum No. 3. The Russian papers continue to publish considerable accounts of local disturbances under the heading &quot;Anarchy&quot;, and at the Joint Session of the Worlanen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; and Peasants&apos; Delegates held at the time, of the Ministerial crisis, M. Tserotelli referred very directly &quot;to the most alarming news arriving from the provinces&quot;.     Landed proprietors,fearing confiscation of their harvest and even of their land by the peasants, are refraining from expending capital upon it, with the certain result that next year&apos;s harvest will bo a peasant harvest, which, as the result of their more primitive methods of agriculture, will produce roughly one half of the normal.     This inevitably means famine.   Clear complicity of some of the extreme Maximalists with pro-German propaganda and the German spy system has been established, according to a recent statement issued by the Public Crown Prosecutor.   As a result Lenin and certain
others are to be prosecuted criminally for high treason, and for having organised an armed rising against the Government on July 16-18, but It seems to be very doubtful how many of the delinquents named are actually in the Government&apos;s hands. The present Government is faced on every hand with a herculean task, in which it Is yet possible to believe that.it will succeed. Evidently, however, it will be considered as a sort of last chance by many whose minds are occupied with other solutions of the future of Russia.   Thus a letter from General Beklemisheff, Curator of the Naval Museum in Petrograd, concluded with these cryptic words: &quot;As to what will be in the future, read chapters XI and XII of Daniel with regard to what people are thinking about it hero&quot;.    (The references are apparently to Michael, the prince, who will save the kingdom).Military Situation.The military situation continues unfavourable, although the rate of the retreat appears to have slowed down.   General Korniloff has taken immediate steps In connection with the work of saving the armies and restoring order at the front.   General Gurko, suspected of disloyalty to the new regime, has been placed under arrest, and a new Commander has been appointed to the Petrograd Military District in the person of General Vasilkowsky.    It is apparent, however, that the granaries of South Russia continue to attract Germany and developments in that direction may still he considered.13.8.17.J.Y.S.
