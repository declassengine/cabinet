REPORT FROM THE MINISTRY OF LABOUR ON THE LABOUT SITUATION FOR THE WEEK ENDING AUGUST 8TH.



I. STRIKES



The holiday season has attracted the minds of the workers to ? other than strikes and disputes, so that the week has been generally free of new outbreaks of trouble.

The serious strikes among the coal miners at Ebbw Vale and Tredegar which involved more than 12000 men were as reported last week settled by Sir R. Redmayne&apos;s intervention. The men at Tredegar were persuaded to return to work under a promise that their complaints against the non-fulfilment of the Minimum Wage Act should be investigated, while at Ebbw Tale the employers were persuaded to allow an engineer representing the men to take part in the inspection of the unsatisfactory electric winding gear in the Victoria Colliery. Other small strikes have since taken place in the same area the most important of whioh was a one-day strike at Abersyohan (the ? and Llanerch Collieries) in which about 2000 men were involved.

There has been a recrudesence of the trouble whioh occurred at the Crown Tube Works, Wednesbury over the refusal of a manager to reinstate an ex-employee who had been discharged, from the Army. About ? men are on strike and they demand the dismissal of the manager ? is alleged to have manhandled the applicant for work.   In spite of the firm&apos;s offer to go to arbitration and the intervention of the Mayor of Walsall and of the President of the Workers&apos; Union the men remain obstinate. This incident suggests that the workers have a very likely regard for the rights and interests of the discharged soldier.

There have been several small strikes in the Newcastle area. A trike at Swan and Hunters over questions of payment by results and piece rates was quickly followed by others involving some hundreds of rivetters, the trouble this time being the rates of pay for work on standard ships, a matter which is at present under arbitration. The officials of the Boilermakers&apos; Society had no warning and the men&apos;s ? appears to have been due to the Shop Stewards, who expected by these somewhat unscrupulous means to force a quicker decision. The officials have succeeded in getting the men back to work by promising that the Government&apos;s answer will be ready by the 9th August.

According to newspaper reports a strike has taken place at a Munitions works at Smethwick as a protest against the employment of Chinese Labour. Other disputes in connection with the same matter are said to be threatening in the Birmingham and Smethwick district.

A serious strike of coke-oven men, members of the National Union of Cokemen, occurred on July 31st at the Harwick Colliery, Chesterfield as a protest against a recent award. The men however resumed work on promise that the matter would be-investigated. This strike is symptomatic of a rapidly growing feeling that the best way of calling attention to a grievance is to strike at once.



II. DISPUTES



In spite of an increase in the number of disputes reported by the Ministry of Munitions there is no dispute of great moment in progress except that in regard to the rates for standard ships. A stoppage is threatened at Hartlepool on this question among the

 
bollermfefcers and arbitration, which was promptly offered by the Miftisily ;0f&quot;&quot;Labour and accepted by the men, has been delayed by the &quot;refusal of the employers to agree to the tribunal proposed. The employers have also complained to the Admiralty of the recent award on rates for standard ships on the Mersey.-   It has been pointed out to tfasm that if the employers set the example of kioking against awards, the position will become impossible and the whole system of arbitration will break down.   The Ministry of Labour and the Shipyard Labour Department are working together in order to settle the question connected with standard ships.The Army Contracts Department has only one new case of dispute to report, though twelve of those previously reported have not yet been finally settled.   An important statement as regards Government policy and the organisation of the woollen industry has been issued.   A Board of Control consisting of seven representatives of the Department, seven of the employers, and seven of the workers has been set up.   No change has taken place as regards hours of labour and the attitude of the Trade Unionist leaders on this point re-joains satisfactory.Complaints have been received from the United Garment Workers1 Union of delays in dealing with the numerous applications for increased wages and war bonuses which it has put forward.   Such delays are stated to be the cause of general unrest among the workers in the trade.Ho fresh developments have taken&apos;place in the situation in the clothing trade caused by the proposed calling up of Russian subjects for military servioe under the convention with the Russian Government.The Shipyard Labour Department reports 73 oases of dispute as having been In progress during the last week of which a rather high proportion resulted in stoppages of work viz: 19. The area ohlefly affected were the Clyde (37 cases) and Newcastle(22cases).   The trouble on the Clyde is attributed partly to settling down after the holidays, and partly to &quot;a reflex of the general strike of rivetters on the upper reaches on the Clyde&quot;.   Attention is drawn to several cases in w^ich;,rt:he&apos;.Bien have refused,, to -accept awards, one. of them the r!3Qeii&apos;tv 3-/-?,.award.to &quot;EngineersV   A similar state of affairs has , been.&apos; observed&apos; on the Tyne^and^ indeed.- over 7the wholecountry.The Ministry of Munitions reports fifteen -cas^s-of dispute.&apos;&apos; as having occurred during the week; of them six have been successfully settled.   The most important of these disputes has arisen out of the alleged victimisation of CReilly, a shop steward who: was dismissed by Messrs, Firth &amp; Sons at Sheffield and has since been unable to find, employment.    It is stated that the employers have a black list of men who are not to be employed by any of the firms belonging to the federation. At Edinburgh there is ouch complaint of the calling up of skilled men for military servioe and &quot;strong comment is made&quot; on the action of the local dilution officer who is regarded as &quot;mainly responsible for the irregularities complained of&quot;. A mass meeting of the Forth District committee of the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades has demanded his dismissal.The Committee, on Production heard seventeen cases last week. Of these by far the, most important, affecting many thousands of employees (male and female) was heard on August 1st., when the Committee had before them applications for advances of wages for corporation workers made by the General Union of Workers to the corporations of fourteen Lancashire and Cheshire towns.
it serious dispute Is threatened oir^tke Railways by the Locomotive IJrivers, who are demanding the r^ecbgnition. of the principle of an 8 hours1oday*   In effect, this is a demand; that overtime should begin after 8 hours instead of afl^er 10 hours as at present, and it is a departure from the soi&amp;errljafcka^ given by the Union, not to raise general questions as to conditions of employment during the war.   The demand is largely an attempt to outbid the.national Union of Railwaymen to whom a considerable number of engine-drivers belong and who have refused to take any part in the present dispute.   The Board of Trade asR?dealing with the matter in consultation with the Ministry of Labour.
The position of the Clyde seems to be more settled than for some time past though there are several disputes under arK itration which may conceivably lead to to ankle in the future. There is no sign that the attempt to stir up unrest over the reinstatement of the ex-deportees is likely to have much effect.The most notable event of the week however, was the one-day strike demonstration which occurred in Lanarkshire on the 2nd as a protest against the rise in food prices.   The. number of miners who &quot;downed tools&quot; is estimated at 50,000 and a nxanhsr of important meetings were held during the day.   That at Coalhrlin was Significant for a resolution which was passed favouring a &quot;down tools&quot; policy as a means of resisting the combing out of any further men for military service or any attempt to bring them under conscription.The position in the Newcastle district is fairly quiet, though the strike at Swan and Hunters over &quot;payment by results&quot; (referred to in section I) appears to be only one sign of considerable feeling regarding that system.A strong feeling against payment of income tax is reported to exist among the workers and a large number of prosecutions for hoh payment have been observed in the local press. IAt Barrow as elsewhere absorption in the holidays has caused a quiet week, notable only for ascertain activity among the Shop Stewards and a scare over the hew coal arrangement which I it was at first feared would lead to an increase in price of from I 4/- to 8/- per ton.The trouble among the Cumbrian miners has temporarily subsided, IAt Liverpool conditions are normal and it is expected that after the holidays there will be no lack of work.   The men employed engaged on Repair work in the Shipyards are still very restive and if they find that their case,has not to be reheard, which they expect will be known on the lith, threaten to come out again.At Manchester the most notioable activity has been shown in connection with the Soldiers&apos; and Workers1 Councils,   It has however so far proved impossible to obtain a hall for the &quot;Idistrict conference which is to be held on the 11th, no doubt as a result of the events of a fortnight ago - and it is thought   (; possible that no conference will take place.   The Metal, Engineering and Shipbuilding Rank and File Workers have nom-inated Elsmore, a prominent Shop Steward for a executive position on the Council in London.On July 28th a conference representing 200,000 Trade Unions ists ahd before which Mr. J,R. Clynes, M.P. defended his Depart- &apos; If ment passed a resolution against the continued increase in the cost of living.A similar resolution was also passed at the important Textile Jorkers&apos; Conference held at Blackpool during the week and some of the moat responsible leaders openly advocated a down   ]T tools policy as a means of protest.The conditions in the cotton trade are beginning to cause     * marked uneasiness among the textile workers, who are men of high&quot;   1 intelligence and well able to appreciate the critical position./ TheIII. DISTKTCT:REPORTS.
Tho application for a 25$ increase on pre-war wages rates which has been refused once already by the employers is not likely to be tamely dropped,, . The Control Board is also coming in for&apos; a good deal of adverse criticism-.Bbire. At Sheffield, as in some other of the Engineering districts^grumbling at the recent 3/- award has not yet subsided.   It is thought that the great expectations which have been aroused by \^$Td Rhondda have averted serious trouble.&apos;. Both Sheffield and Leeds have been busy over the arrangements for the forthcoming conference of Workers1 and Soldiers1 Councils whidh is to be held at Leeds.   Here again it is proving, almost impossible to;hire a Hall,   A joint meeting of the Leeds Labour Party and Trade Unions has however been held at which it was , resolved to Inform the Government that the proposed conference r*rould he held at all costs.The situation is normal in the Midlands,   The report of the bis.     pommissioners on Unrest has not aroused much interest, though comment: is generally favourable.   The Birmingham Daily Post has collected the opinions of most of the prominent local Labour leaders which are distinctly friendly, though in some cases con-taining the significant criticism that pacifist agitation as a cause of unrest has been omitted.More interest is displayed in the question of food prices, and Lord Rhondda&apos;s promise had been received with evident satis-faction.In the Nottingham district the Workers1 and Soldiers&apos; Councils appear to be attracting little attention, while at Birmingham the Trades Council after a stormy meeting decided by a narrow majority to send delegates to the district conference.bn,-$. The position is quiet, though at Woolwich there has been a recurrence of the discontent about the 3/- award, and this chiefly owing to the fact that an advance of 2/6 has now been granted to the women..A statement has been issued to the effect that the Provisional Committee of the C.W.S.D. has decided to call another conference at an early date.The position in South Wales gives more cause for anxiety than that in any other part of the country0   The unrest seems to be confined to the mining districts and though the most important of the strikes which took place some ten days ago have been settled several other outbreaks of a less extensive character show that the position is by no means improved.Eumerous resolutions of a pacifist nature and the success of the J.L.P, and other similar bodies in the district would appear .fo indicate that the industrial Commissioners took too optimistic a view In declaring their opinion that nothing of an anti-war -character is to be feared.   On the 3rd the South Wales Miners1. Federation passed a resolution that action should be taken with a view to ascertaining the opinion of organised Labour on the question of peace &quot;30 as to offer to the Labour movement of belligerent powers the British working class view of a pejabe -settlement&quot;Further resolutions in regard to -food prices and^l^iedon of5 speech and public assembly were passed.The d&apos;&apos;^&quot;egat;es. attending- the ^Swansea conference of the C .17.S.I which was b^5ken up seem to% have been more representative than, usual.   Twenty^six Trades (Councils and 26 Trade Union branches being represented^&apos;       mml &apos;The, re^ortl;Of&apos;vthe. Cbjplssi oners and Lord Rhonddals statement have bo^hvOvS-p;\afeeedlngl^^avu- .\-bly recei&quot;dd and may have an importaii-j $e sf eot^fe ailagf^g lichen bent,mm
li    iv. press opisioss.The decrease whleli-has already taken  laoe in the prices&quot; of certain commodities, the assurances of the F*od CcmfcrxfiJjsr^ and the cheapness of potatoes and other vegetables appear to he having their effect.   There is a notable diminution in the amount of space devoted to fodd prices and profiteering in the Labour and Socialist papers of the last week, while in ihose which deal with that subject a tone of optimism and Increasing faith in Lord: Rhondda may be hoticed.   The &quot;Clarion&quot; (August gafll commences an article on the subject of profiteering as follows:-rt$he pcor old public I   Maddened by the ever-increasing &quot;evidence of profiteering they have at last insisted on He *arrest in one department of common consumption-food,   Thpy &quot;have found- a man who says he.can and will stop it, even though the methods he has to use do violence io all his &quot;economic principles and knowt&amp;dge&quot;.&quot;Justice&quot; (August 2nd) things that the Food Controller and Mr- Clynea have a difficult problem to face.   It remarkst* &quot;How to eliminate the profiteer without the destruction of &quot;the Capitalst system is also another hard economic nut to &quot;crack&quot;..That extremist socialist taper &quot;The Call&quot; however as usual complains of every step that- is taken, aid the following is from an article headed &quot;The Loaf and the Profiteer&quot; in its issue of 2nd August:-   &quot;The. State-subsidised llinepenny &quot;loaf has now been announced, and all the wo rid is greatful&apos; &quot;and almost enthusiastic..   The poor will &quot;only&apos;,; pay double &quot;the price which they paid for touch better bread before the &quot;war, while the farmers,, the shippers, the importers and- the &quot;wholesale dealers rejoice that their war profits will &quot;henceforth be safe,   The measure, indeed, looks uncommonly &quot;lilts an attempt te protect the food profiteer against the &quot;popular discontent,, at the taxpayer^ expense&quot;.If volume of criticism is a criterion, the Labour and Socialist press is very much opposed to the breaking up of the local conferences which were to have been held cto Saturday July 29th.The &quot;Merthyr pioneer&quot; (August 4th) is characteristic of the effusions in these papers:1 &quot;London, Newcastle, Swansea -three new smears and three of the ugliest, soiled the pages &quot;of English constitutional history last Sunday&quot;. After continuing further on similar lines it concludes:-   &quot;We have &quot;weapons strong enough to compel our position upon the &quot;attention of the authorities; and those weapons we shall &quot;have to wetld in our own defence.   Public opinion is on the &quot;side of the best armed force, and perhaps when we drop our &quot;quiet acceptance of incitement against us, public opinion &quot;will again put on its mask of hypocrisy and concede us the &quot;liberty to know,, to utter and to argue freely according &quot;to consoienoe.&quot;   Great pains are taken to show that these occurences in no sense represent the opinion of the community as a whole and that the crowds which took part in breaking up the Conferences were simply organised mobs of hooligans.The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; (End August) for instance says:-&quot;The disgraceful riot which took place in London on &quot;Saturday last on the occasibh of the holding of the &quot;Conference of the Workers1 and Soldiers1 Council was in &quot;no sense a spontaneous outburst of popular indignation and &quot;opposition.   It was the outcome of a press campaign which &quot;for days before had been trying to excite the worst &quot;passions of the hooligan element in the Community.   The opposition was supported by dertain pblitical influences/ who
who fear the organisation of democratic power. ,The &quot;Gall&quot; (August 2nd) tries to make the most of the    1 fact that three out&apos; of six of the Conferences were not hrnVen Un--   &quot;Of the six Conferehcesthreefflwere complete &quot;sSoeJsies.   Delegates from Trade Unions, Trade Union &quot;Canohls, Trade Councils, the I.L.P. and B.S.P. and other &quot;democratic organisations attended in large numbers1.   It continues:-   &quot;TherSulers of this Country are copying the &quot;methods of the Tsar.,  In their efforts to stifle free &quot;expression they are replying upon, the Black Hundreds.&quot;The &quot;Herald&quot; (August4th) adopts a threatening attitude similar to that of the &quot;Merthyr Pioneer&quot; and attempts to stir up the Trade Unions to adopt a counter policy of Strikes--   &quot;It will be well for the authorities, especially In South ftales and Scotland to realise that it is up to &quot;them to secure to miners and railwaymen, engineers, and ^boilermakers the full right of organisation and free .   &quot;speech.   It is certain these great organisations of&quot;labour will not tolerate mob law.   This week the South, &quot;   &quot;Wales Miners will be asked to inform the authorities that &quot;if they are incapable of preserving law and order the. , &quot;miners will take other means of letting their voice be &quot;heard&quot;.In another place it oontinues:-   &quot;It may, however, be &quot;pointed out to thoee in authority who nay wish to support &quot;this sort of aotioh, or passively to acquiesce in it, &quot;that by doing so they are playing with f ire............ .It&quot;is well for all in authority to bear in mind that mobs are &quot;always dangerous and in the past have often changed sides, &quot;and if unthinking men and women can be worked up by &quot;means of lying statements to attack one set of people, &quot;the very same persons can just as easily be worked up to attack others if occasion arose&quot;.The opinion on the other side shown in most of the daily papers is well represented in the &quot;North WesternDaily Mail&quot; (*hily 31st).   &quot;What the workers and the people &quot;generally think of the action of these traitors to their &quot;country is revealed by the temper displayed in different &quot;localities where these people held neetings on Saturday , &quot;and Sunday last.   Discontent not merely with their policy, but at the reticence of the authorities to put their foot &quot;down and stamp out the pernicious doctrines preached by &quot;the German agents, has been growing more and more bitter &quot;of late&quot;.On the whole it appears probable that the general ,opinion among the workers is turning against these Councils. The &quot;Leicester Pioneer&quot;, usually an organ if pacifism and a .strong supporter of Mr. Ramsey Macdonald says:- &quot;I shall .:. &quot;want to see more definite developments before I make up &quot;my m&amp;nd about what the Workers1, and Soldiers1 Councils is &quot;going to. mean.&quot;   While the &quot;Workers1 Dreadnought (July 28th] oomes out Into the open and shows the feeling of the real forces behind the movement in a Resolution which it is stated.&quot;Will be moved by the Workers&apos; Suffrage Federation at &quot; the Conferences which are being held to form a British &quot;Council of Workers&apos; and Soldiers Delegates&quot;, as follows:-. &quot;This Conference pledges itself to give no further support . to the War, and urges all labour, Socialist and Democratic &quot;bodies to instruct their Members of Parliament to vite &quot;against the War Credits and to demand an immediate truce&quot;.It continues:-   &quot;We believe that the success or &quot;failure of the proposed Councils may easily hinge on the &quot;policy herein laid down.jllist The.,&quot;Yorkshire Factory Times&quot; (August 2nd) welcomed^nces     the Allied Socialist Conferences as &quot;paving the way for -good work to be done when the International Socialist &quot;congress has come&quot;.     1  VI-1 Mxv v /The
The &quot;Call&quot; as representing the B,S.P. opposes it as it is &quot;the duty of socialists to consider the problem of the &quot;,7ar and &quot;its settlement not from the point of view of this or that  group of belligerent nations &quot;but from the standpoint of the &quot;whole international working class movement&quot;.The &quot;HeraldT: wclcomer th? Potion of the Labour Party Executive in advising the I&apos;r: tlsh Labour conference to support the International coiiferor.ce enthusiastically and Lopes &quot;that every Trade Unionist arid Socialist in the country will rally &quot;to their support&quot;0   The visit of the Russian deputation has attracted very little attention though the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; (August 2nd) claims that its members are in entire accord with the I.L,P.&apos;s policy. sUms The Reports of the Commissioners on Industrial Unrest have&apos;Bstrlal.on the whole met with a favourable reception although the nrest,    &quot;numerous articles which have appeared in the Labour papers can hardly be taken as implying a very great interest among the mass of workers nor must their somewhat critical attitude be taken as that ef the people as a whole.&quot;Justice&quot; (August 2nd) thinks that the Reports &quot;have been rushed and scamped.   &apos;,l!hole industries and whole classes of the ?pep$lie have remained, untouched&quot; and that the Reports &quot;have &quot;been officially doctored&quot;,&quot;The Call&quot; (August 2nd) criticises the recommendations of the Commissioners severely:-   &quot;Piddling with food prices, the &quot;formation of industrial councils on the lixias suggested by &quot;the Uhitley Report, cant about &quot;co-partnership&quot;, and all the &quot;other &quot;recommendations&quot; do not mean anything except further &quot;irritation,&quot;The local Labour papers as a rule confine themselves to summaries of the Reports with short comments, which on the whole suggest a very favourable opinion vita regard to them.The &quot;Woolwich Pioneer&apos; (August 3rd) says-- &quot;The &quot;Commissioners and particularly the Labour representative are &quot;to be heartily congratulated oh the bold tackling of the &quot;problem of Industrial Unrest and on the prompt presentation &quot;of their Report&quot;,The &quot;New Age&quot; (August 19th) in a long and intereot ing article fin&amp;s fault with the Commissioners because they have simply represented what was already known -go everyone who has taken any interest in Labour masters, while Engineering&quot; which as a rule represent a somewhat hostile employers1- point of view says that the Reports had been issued in &quot;a spirit of convent-&quot;ional insincerity and neither inform the workers of industry &quot;as to the true situation nor inspire confidence in its &quot;authors,&quot;A great deal of interest has been displayed during the last week in the Question of housing, no dcuVu partly owing to the appearance of the report of the Joint Committee on Labour Problems regarding that subject,   Local Labour papers such as the &quot;Cotton Factory Times&quot;, &quot;Yorkshire Factory Times&quot; and the &quot;Merthyr Pioneer&quot; deal with the question at some length and point out that the conditions in their districts demand urgent attention.The Ministry of Reconstruction seems to find more favour with the Labour than with the General pree-ss though the, appoint-ment of Dr. Addison to the position ox Mlniflfrer co&amp;ee in for hostile criticism../ The
The &quot;British Citizen (August 4th) says:-   &quot;We understandthe reasons which render it eminently desirable that a &quot;Ministry 6f Reconstruction should be called into existence&quot;, but adds that it frankly believes that Dr. Addison is not the man for the duty,Che &quot;Clarion&quot; (August End) thinks that while ?;it ie ^ell to put the brake bn the multiplication of bureaucrats ar,.\ ministers, Reconstruction surely cannot be attempted without a Committee or Minister1&apos;.The &quot;Railway Review1&apos; (August 3rd) is much exercised on the questions of female labour and says that &quot;the position &quot;must be faced at once.   In this connection it is xmleistood &quot;that one of the large trunk lines lays down the principle &quot;that as in the clerical section the weaker sex aie well paid either the^ must,become equally efficient to the males or &quot;resign&quot;, and that this provides &quot;an irrefutable argument &quot;in favour of equal pay for both sexes&quot;.
V. GENERAL REMARKS.SHOP STEWARDS MOVEMENT:   A Shops&apos; Stewards Conference is to take place at Manchester on &quot;the 18th and 19th instant, from which great results are expected from its promoters.   McManus and lirkwood have been very active in preparing the ground by speaking and organizing their supporters in different parts of the country.   The principal item on the agenda is a resolution to the following effect:-&quot;To endeavour to bring about the amalgamation of all Shop &quot;Committees and similar organisations in England and Scotland, &quot;with the object of forging a y/eapoh to strike at the roots of &quot;the Capitalist system, and to hasten the advent of tne &quot;Socialist Republic&quot;.There is n$ doubt that the theoretical basis of ike Shops1 Stewards Movement is the notion of acquiring control of industry for the workers.   Their immediate object is to create one Union in the Engineering Trade, by amalgamating all sections, whether skilled or unskilled, and Borne progress has been made in this direction.   There are, f$r-instance, shops in which a Shop Steward of the Workers Union represents the interests of all workers in the shop, including members of the A.S.E., and vice versa; in fact, one of the most salutary aspects of the Shops&apos; Stewards Movement is its tendency to reconcile the breach between the skilled and unskilled workers, which in some places has reached the pitch of extreme bitterness.It would be a mistake to suppose that all the supporters of the Shops&apos; Stewards are pursuing their ultimate ideals, or agree with their larger schemenof Trade Union re-construotion, although in both these respects they probably have behind them most of the younger and more active forces in the shops.   What has given them their undeniable strength at the present moment, is the fact that they offer a definite means by which the workman can obtain some voice in the control of the conditions of his employment in the shop, and the means by which shop grievances, whioh are after all the most frequent and touch him most closely, oan be promptly, and effectively remedied. As was recognised by most of the Commissions on Industrial Unrest, this is the real burning question in industry at the present moment, and if it oan be satisfactorily solved, it would do more than anything else to allay the prevailing discontent, and to counteract the dangerous possibilities of the Shops1 Stewards Movement.   Most of the Commissions strongly reeocnend that Shop Committees should be set up forthwith, and as far as the experience of this Department, and the Ministry of Munitions has gone, it is proved that the existence of such Camnittees make for better work, and remove the irritation caused by the frequent occurrence of trifling grievances, for whioh there is no means of ventilation, except through the Unions, whose officials are usually too busy to deal with any but the more important questions.It is also worth remarking the&apos; Commissioners for the North West area, laid great Btress on the necessity of beginning the introduction of the Whitley report by dealing first with the question of Shop committees, and working up to Industrial Councils.   In some trades, of course, the oontrary procedure would no doubt have to be adopted, but in the Engineering Tradcc, which are the focus of unrest at the present moment, more is likely to be done in the way of unifying the industry by starting with the shop, than by starting with the Central Organisations.
It is, therefore, suggested that if the Shops1 Stewards Movement is to be prevented from becoming a serious danger, steps should be taken to deal with the question of Shop Committees--at once on a comprehensive basis.The Ministry of Munitions are already collecting material . on the sub eject, and the Ministry of Labour has also a good deal of information. It must of course be recognised that the question needs delicate handling, as it involves matters affecting the constitution of the Trades Unions concerned.    It is fairly certain that the Unions themselves are not likely to do anything in the matter, which will throw the Shops1 Stewards into open opposition to them, and provoke a struggle which would have dangerous possibilities.   The Shops1 Stewards Movement is too strong, and represents legitimate causes of discontent too accurately, to permit of its being ignored by the Government. Mo,st of its promoters would become loyal and useful citizens if they could be recognised, and given responsibility in their owh sphere i.e. the shop.   The problem is therefore, to devise some means of reconciling Trade Union control with Shop Organisation.   This problem is, in any case presented by the Whitley report, and will have to be solved, if that report is to be carried into practice.   Unless it is solved the Shops&apos; Stewards Movement is likely to become increasingly dangerous, and the mere fact, that in spite of the set-back which it suffered during the recent strike, i&apos;t has considerably increased its power since, is sufficient proof that it cannot safely be left to itself.   Although the question is one which can only be solved ultimately by the Unions themselves, the Government by taking the initiative in controlled establishments could probably bring about a solution.L.
