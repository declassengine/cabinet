SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,V/cckly Report on Russia.   XVJ. (Auguut 4th, 1917.)Department of Information.CRU/016.The Government.So far no appointments have &quot;been announced with regard to the formation of a new Coalition Government, such as were expected previous to, rathor than arising out of, the Conference which was Btated to have been called for the first week of August at Moscow. Of the appointments which v/ere intimated consequent on the resignation of the Cadets, that of Mr. Yephremoff, leader of the Progressist party, to the Ministry of Justice was the most important among the new names.     In conversation he gives the impression of being very doctrinaire and is lacking in force as a public speaker.     He ov/es his position partly to his terri-torial connections which are in tho S.L of Russia where he is a recognised leader or Hetman of a Cossack community.     The Con-ference, in which the Russian press continues to place a great trust, was intended to be on a broad basis, representative not merely of the C.V/.S.D. and the Council of Peasants Deputies, but also of the Duma and Unions of Towns and County Councils (Zemtsvos). Like the Constituent Assembly itself, however, its actual convening seems capable of indefinite postponement.     In connection with the antecedent Cabinet rearrangement each representative group tables conditions witnout the recognition of which it will not serve; the interests of the country are made subservient to those of party. The common note in the memoranda prepared by the bourgeois elements in particular is the demand for order at home and agreement on foreign policy with the Allies.     Ho less vital is the insistence that the Government must be absolutely independent of all other
organisations.    The attitude adopted by the Socialists is rather that of concentrating behind, and strengthening the hands of, Hr. Ichernoff, Minister of Agriculture, in his radical land programme. The Socialists are ready with a practical land programme which they wish to carry out no;?: the bourgeois;elements are on the whole adopting a negative attitudej which has been practically their policy since the beginning of May.    At the same time the very haste and insistence of the Socialists are evidence of their fear of that for which the other elements are waiting - a reaction. To what length this may go, or what form it will take, or whether it will come at all, it is idle to speculate.     It is important, however, to realise that an out-come of this sort is rapidly taking shape in many minds as the only possible means of release from the present nightmare.The Moscow Conference, if it ever meets, will not be an elected body, but the intention has obviously been to make it as represent-ative as possible.     Still the mere fact that it should have to be held only confirms what 1 . Gutchkoff, Ex-Hinister of War, declared to the waiter had been the one big mistake in the first days of the Revolution.     &quot;We ought,&quot; he said, &quot;to have conserved the Duma as a Constituent Assembly.    We had only 12 people who were nominated ministers with elusive power, while on the other side was the Council of Soldiers- and Workmen1^ Deputies with the actual power in their hands, because they were the army, and the influence tfith the masses.*    The past week, however, has shown a decided stiffening in the attitude of the Government to the forces of anarchy Leniency and the early abhorrence of all compulsion other than that of words have given place to the suppression of Pravda and other anti-militaristic papers inciting to insubordination, and the re-inforcement of the death penalty.     It is possible that the : anarchistic movement thus driven underground may take- more virulent forms, but it is significant that even the Moderate Socialist press

Basili who recently passed through London on his way to take up the position of Charge d*Affaires at Paris, the expected appoint-ment of M. Maklokoff not having eventuated.     As hearing in a measure upon the above, that opinion may be stated as follows. &quot;The Russian soldier should not be blamed too much as an individual for all that is happening in Russia to-day.     He has been deprived of all the old ideas that meant anything to him - Emperor, relation-ship to the land, and. Constantinople to be redeemed from the Turk; as a result he simply does not know where he is.     Slowly the anarchy of the past weeks is working out certain inevitable results. The peasants are beginning to realise that they cannot manage affairs without the assistance of the Intelligentsia.     Tchemoffs land programme will not be accepted by the other parties; Kerensky has seen his earlier mistakes and is striving with all his might to undo them-     He is a much stronger man than any of the Cadets. The bourgeoisie are organising very rapidly and now have a vast sum at thoir disposal in the event of any attempt to carry the olass war a outrance.&quot;    M. Basili forecasts that the Constituent Assembly will be a failure and that it will be succeeded by reversion to a Constitutional Monarchy.     &quot;Already a sort of halo begins to surround the memory of the Tsar.     If matters come to this pass it will mean civil war, as the artillery, cavalry and Cossacks are predisposed to a Constitutional Monarchy, and the infantry to a RepTn&amp;lic.    The Radical Socialists naturally arc anxious to have the Constituent Assembly meet as soon as possible: the other elements wish to see its session postponed.&quot;The Military Situation.Here the Russi;m soldiers are doing exactly as whole regiments
did towards the close of the Ja$smaee-1to^the field, under-the.Influence of the mood of the time being, resolved not to fight any longer.     But a mood is not a philosophy, and just because every Russian soldier is more or less of a philosopher, it may be taken as certain that there will again be a reaction.     This may be helped by the re-introduction of the death penalty.     The most serious feature of the retreat is that particularly from Tarnopol eastwards (which at any rate in the summer of 1915 was only 18 hours by train from Kiev) the country presents no great difficulties to a successful advance, and the recent agitation in the Ukraine may weaken the defence.     The appointment of General Korniloff in place of General Brusiloff (resigned)is from one point of view simply the replacement of one forceful, popular personality b^P another: but the fact of the resignation is significant. Finland.Of the parts of Russia with separatist tendencies Finland has bulked most prominently during the past week.     There is no doubt that she obtained more from the Revolution than she at first expected.     It was immediately followed by a short.period of rejoicing and fraternisation between the Russian soldiers (as Socialists) and the Finnish Socialists.     Thereafter declarations were made, e.g. by the President of the Diet in ail opening address, to the effect that Finland would be a friend tof Russia.     This was generally understood to imply that Finland desired to be in-dependent, although the degree of that independence was not clearly stated.     It v/as however commonly interpreted: in an extreme sense to the surprise of the Russian Liberals.     Meanwhile the military had not seen any hint in such declarations to put a check on their activities, and, particularly as the result of the incursion of German spies and of Finnish soldiers who had been fighting in the German army, continued to make numerous arrests.     This led to
fc- : ,the Finnish people saying that whilst they got declarations onpaper from the Russian Government, they were still governed byRussian military force.     With the ensuing lack of stability in theRussian Government and the growing tendency to anarchy in thecountry, a logical feeling gradually arose amongst the Finns thatit would be well to break away from the muddle and organise theirown life in complete independence of Russia.     Like other nation-alities (e.g. the Lithuanians) they have no belief that libertyin Russia will fee order, and so they have been increasingly en-deavouring to get special rights against the capricious inter-ference of what they consider to be an uneducated democracy.     Atfirst attempts were made to get rid of the Russian garrison.These certainly have been mutinous and troublesome, but at thesame time they represent a necessity and constitute an emblem ofpatriotism to the Russian people, who say that they must remainthere in order to protect Petrograd.     The Finnish people nervouslyargue that this simply proves that the Russians do not really wantthem to be fime, and that Russia is still in consequence the enemycompletelyof freedom.     Latterly the desire to be/independent has taken most pronounced forms, and has been expressed in terms that must be peculiarly galling to Russian pride.     An autonomy Bill has been passed in the Diet by 136 votes to 55, and a proposal to submit the Bill to the Russian Government was negatived by 104 votes to 86. The national flag of Finland has been hoisted over the Diet and Senate buildings, while a bill providing fpr a loan to Russia of  14,000,000 has been rejected on the third reading (July 29, 1917). During the War the attitude of Finland has been a thinly veiled neutrality, which yet permitted thousands of young Finns to enter the German army for the hundreds of volunteers that fought for the Russians.     (An officer in charge on the frontier at Joroea mentioned &quot;over 30,000&quot; to the writer as a probable estimate of the number of Finns who had served with the Germans.)     Many of
J.Y.S * 4/8/17.these have heen returning latterly and form a considerable factor in promoting the present unrest in the Grand Duchy.     The laterst reply of the Provisional Government has been the dissolution of the Diet with new elections, so as to bring about an appeal to the Finnish people.Russian Socialists and the Stockholm Conference.Recent events at home have redirected attention to this matter in an acute way.     There can he little doubt of the state of mind of even moderate Russian Socialist opinion, and it is certain that in this present state of mind they will meet with tho German Socialists. This is what the latter wish and it is also obvious what use they will make of the absence of British representatives.     Everything v/ould of course depend upon who the latter were, but if the right men could be sent who would be prepared to ask blunt,direct questions - why Liebknecht is not there, etc. - it might be of the greatest service in disillusioning the Russian Socialists with regard to Germany.     This is something that requires to be done; the only question is how best to accomplish it.     In any case, the v/riter does not easily forget the semi-jocular, semi-serious remark of a Russian Liberal University Professor:   &quot;It may be that before the end of the war democratic Russia and democratic Germany will need to act together against imperialistic England.&quot;
