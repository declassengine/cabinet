/5224Is a c a at IL&amp;JL 6, A3X65g COM&amp;ETTHB ON AIR ORGANISATION AHD HQi^.....-   S3FBNC21 AGAIITST AIR RAIDS. (2nd l^ORT) (for First Report, see Cr.T. 1451)1, The War Cabinet at their iSlst meeting held on lithJuly 1917, decided (Minute 3)&quot;That the Prime Minister and General SmutCi in consultation v/ith representatives of the Admiralty, General Staff and Field Marshall Commanding in Chief Home Forces, with such other exports as they may desire should examine:It      The defence arrangements for Home Defence against air raids,2,      The Air organisation generally and the direction of aerial operations&quot;2. Our first report dealt with the defences 6f theLondon area against air-raids.   The recommendatione in that report were approved by the War Cabinet and are now in process of being carried out.   The Army Council have placed at Lord French&apos;s disposal the cervices of General. Aflhmore. to work out schemes of air defence for this area.   We proceed to deal in this report with the second term of reference: the Air organisation generally and the direction of aerial operations.   For the considerations which will appear in the course of this report; we con-Sider the early settlement of this matter of vital importance to the successful prosecution of the war. The three&apos;most important questions which press for -an early answer are:-1. Shall there be instituted a real Air Kinietry responsible for all Air Organisation and &apos; operations?2. Shall there be constituted a unified Air Service, embracing both the present R.N.A.S. andAnd if this second question is answered in the affirmativej the third question arises:*3*      How: shall the relations of the new Air Service to the Navy and the Army be determined so taat the functions at present discharged for them by the R.K.A.S. and R.F.C. respectively shall con-tinue to be efficiently performed by the new Air Service?Si      The Subject o  general Air Organisation has in the .   past formed the subject of acute controversies which are now, in consequence of the match of events, largely obsolete, and to which a brief reference is here made only in so far as they bear on some of the difficulties which we have te consider in this report.   During the initial stages of Air development, and while the role to be performed by an Air Service appeared likely to be merely ancillary to naval and militaryoperations
operations, claima were put forward and pressed with no small warmth, for separate Air services in connection with the two old-established War Services.   These claims even-tuated in the establishment of the R..H.A.3. and R.F.C., organised and operating on separate lines in connection &quot;frith and under the aegis of the Navy and Army respectively, and provision for their necessary supplies and requirements was made separately by the Admiralty and War Office to pro-vide a safeguard against the competition, friction, and waste which we reliable to arise, an Air Committee was instituted to preserve the peace and secure co-operation if possible.   Iflhen war broke out this body ceased to exist, owing to the fact that its Chairman and members nearly all went to the front, but after a time it was replaced by the Joint War Air Committee,.   The career of this body was, however, cut short by an absence of all real power and authority and by political controversies which arose in consequence.   It war? followed by the present Air Board, which has a fairly well defined status and has done admirable work, especially in settling type and patterns of engines and machines and. in co-ordinating and controlling supplies to both the R.N.A.S and R.3\C4.   The utility of the Air Board is however severely limited by its constitution and powers.   It is. not really a Board, but merely a Conference.   Its membership consists almost entirely of representatives of the War Office, Admiralty and Ministry of Munitions, who consult with each other in respect of the claims of the R.N.A.S. and.H.?,C for their supplies.   It has no technical personnel of its own to advise it, and it is dependent on the officers which the departs ments just mentioned place at its disposal for the perfor-manee of its duties.   These officers, especially the Director General of Military Aeronautics, are also responsible for the training of the personnel of the R.F.C. service.   It3 scope is still further limited in that it has nothing to do either with the training of the personnel of the R,17,A.S. or with the supply of li,-/-ter-than-air   craft, both of which the Admiralty has jealously retained a3 its special perquisites. Although it has a nominal authority to discuss questions of policy, it has no real power to do so, because it has not the independent technical personnel to advise it in that respect, and any discussion of policy would simply ventilate the views of its military and naval members.   Under the present constitution and powers of the Air Board, the real directors of war policy are the Army and Navy, and to the Air Board is really allotted the minor role of fulfilling their requirements according to their ideas of war policy. Essentially the Air Service is as subordinated to military and naval direction and conceptions of policy as the artillery is, and, as long as that state of affairs lasts, it is use-less for the Air Board to embark on a policy of its own, which it coulc neither originate nor execute under present conditions.5.   The tine is however rapidly approaching when that subordina-tion of the Air Board and the Air Service could no longer be justifies.   Essentially the position of an Air Service is quite different from that of the Artillery ano, to pursue our comparison:   Artillery could never be Used in war except as a weapon in military or naval or air operations.   It isa
J226a w*ajon6 *a tttstroaeni; s&amp;oillary -t* * Servie*v but e^rold met be an independentService itsolfAir Serrice en the eontr&amp;ry. -can be used as-anindependent meaas of war vopexvtionsv    Bo--body that witnessed the attack on Itondon;.on 11th July could : have any doubt on that point.    Unlike Artillery, an air fleet can conduct extensive operations far from, and independently of, both army and navy.    As far as can at present be foreseen, . there is absolutely no limit to the scale of its future ink dependent war use.     And the day may not be far off. When aerial 1 operations with their devastation ox enemy lands and destruc-   / tion of industrial and populous centres on a vast scale.may;.    I become the principal operations of war, to which the older forms of military and naval operations may become secondary.-and subordinate.     The subjection of the Air Board and Service could only be justified on the score of their infancy.    But that is a disability which time can remove, and in this.respect the march of events has been very rapid during the war. .   In our opinion there is no reason why the Air Board should any longer continue in its present form as practically no more than a -. Conference room between the older Services, and there is every reason why.it should be raised to the status of an independent Ministry in control of its own War Service.The urgency for the ohange will appear from the following facts. Hitherto air-craft production has been insufficient to supply the demands of both Army and Havy, and the chief concern of the Air Board has been to satisfy the necessary, retirements of thoee Services.    But that phase is rapidly passing.   The programme of air-craft production which the War Cabinet has sanctioned for the following ib months is far in excess of Army and Navy requirements.     Next Spring and Summer the pOBi-tion will be that the Army and llavy will have all the Air Service required in connection with their operations;   and over and above that there will be a great surplus available for independent&apos;operations-.    Who is to look after, and direct the activities of this available: surplus?    $either the Army nor the Havy is specially competent to do so;, and for that reason the creation of an Air Staff for planning and directing ; independent Air operations will scon be pressing.    More than . that:   the surplus of engines and machines now being built should have regard to the strategical purpose to which they are going to be put.    And in settling in advance the types to be built the operations for which they are intended apart from naval or military use should be clearly kept in view. This means that the Air Board has already reached the stage where the settlement of future war policy in the Air war has become necessary.     Otherwise engines and machines useless for independent strategical operations may be built.     The necess-ty for an Air Ministry and Air Staff has therefore becomeurgent.The magnitude and significance- of the transformation now in progress are not easily realised..    It requires-some imagina.-tion: to realise that: next Summer, while our Western front may still be moving forward at a snail?s pa$s in Belgium and: France, the Air battle- front will be far behind&quot; on. the Rhine, and that its continuous&quot; and intense pressure against the-chief industrial centres of the enemy as well as on his lines of communication may  orm gn important factor in bringing about peace.-    The enemy is no doubt making,vast plans to deal with us in London if we do not succeed in beating him in the air and carrying the war into the heart of his countryr    The questions of machines, aerdromes, routes and distances, as well as nature and scope of opera-tione require   careful thinking out in advance, and in pro-portion to our foresight and preparations will our success
be in these new and fer-reaohlng developments.   Or take again the case of a subsidiary theatre:   there is no reason why we may not gain snob an overpowering Air superiority in Palestine as to:cut the eremy1s precarious and limited railway communications, prevent the massing of superior numbers against our advance, and finally to wrest victory and peace from him.   But careful Staff work in advance is here in this terra incognita of the Air even more essential than in ordinary militarised naval operations which.follow a routine consecrated by the experience of centuries of warfare on the old lines.The progressive exhaustion of the man-power of the combatant nations will more and more determine tho character of this war as one of arms and machinery rather than of men. And the side that commands industrial superiority and exploits its advantages in that regard to the utmost, ought in the long run to win.    Man-power in its war use will more and more tend to become subsidiary and auxiliary to the full develop-ment and use of mechanical power.   The submarine has already shown what startling developments are possible in naval war-fare.    Aircraft is destined to work an evon more far-reaching change in land warfare.   But to secure the advantages of this new factor.for our side, we must not only make unlimited use of the mechanical genius and productive capacity of ourselves and our American Allies.   We t.mst create the new directing organisation - the new Ministry and Air Staff which could properly handle this.new instrument of offence, and equip it with the best brains at our disposal for the purpose.   The task of planning the new Air Service organisation and thinking out and preparing for schemes of aerial operations next summer must tax our Air experts to the Utmost and no time should be lost in setting the new Ministry and Staff going. Unless this is done, we shall not only lose the great advan-t&amp;ges which the new form of warfare promises, but we shall end in ehaos and confusion, as neither the Army nor Havy nor the Air Board in its present form could possibly cope with the vast developments involved in our new Air-craft programme. Hitherto the creation of an Air uinistry and Air Service has been looked upon as an idea to be kept in view but not to be realised during this war.   Events have however moved so rapidly, our prospective aircraft production will soon be so great, and the possibilities of aerial warfare have grown so far beyond all previous expectations, that the change will brook no further delay and will have to be carried through as soon as all the necessary errangemente for the purpose can be made.There remains the question of the new Air Service and the absorp-tion of the S..St.JL.-S-. and R.J.G. into it,     Should the $avy -  and the Army retain their own special Air Services inaddition to the Air forces which will be controlled by the Air Ministry?   This will make the confusion hopeless and render tho solution of the Air. problem impossible.   The maintenance of three Air Services is out of the question, nor indeed does the i?ar Office make any claim to a soparato Air Service of its 07/n.   But as regards Air work the ilavy is exactly In the same position as the Army;   the intimacy between aerial scouting or observation and naval operations is not greater than that between long range artillery tfork on land and aerial observation or spotting.     If a separate iiir Service ie not necessary in the one case, neither is it necessary In the other.     And the proper and indeed only possible arrangement i3 to establish one unified Air Service which will absorb both the existing services undor arrangements which will fully safeguard the efficiency and secure the closest intimacy between the Army and the Kavy and the portions of the Air Service allotted or seconded to them.
To eeoure itficiency and smooth working of tho Air Service in connection with naval and military operations, it is not only necessary that in the construct;.on of aircraft and the training of, the Air personnel the closest attention shall be given to the special requirement rZ die Navy and the Army. It is neoessary also that all Air units detailed for naval or military work should be t^:pura-r.:.iy socondod to those cervices and come directly nr-der the ord -rs of the naval   -or army oomm&amp;ndcrs of the f^rcos with which they are associated.   The effect of that will be that in actual work-log practically no change will be made in the Air work as it is: conducted to-day, end no friotion could arise between the Navy or Army: oorauiands and the Air Service allotted to them.It ie recognised, however, that for some years to come tho Air Bervioe will, for its efficiency, be. largely depen-dont on. the officers of the iJovy and Array who are. already . employed in this work or   who may in the future elect to Join it permanently or temporarily.   The influence of the:regular officers of both sorylces on the spirit, conduct and discip-line of tho present Air Forces has been most valuable and it is desirable that the Air Bocrd should still be able to draw on the older services for the assistance of trained loaders and administrators,   Further, it is equally necessary that a considerable number, of officers of both iiavy and Army should be attached for a pare of their service to the Air - Service, in order that liaval and Military Commanders and Staff Officars may be trained in the new arm and able to utilise to advantage the contingents of the Air P&apos;orces which will be put at their disposal,.   The organisation of the Air Force, therefore^ should be such as to allow of the. seconding of officers of the Jlavy and Army for definite periods - not less than four or five j3ars - to the Air Service.     Such officers would naturally, aftor their first training, be chiefly employed with the flaval and Military contingents, in order to S3cure eluoe co-operation in &amp;ir work with their own sorvices.   In similar fashion it would be desirable to arrange for tho transfer of expert warrant end. petty or non-commissioned officers fiora the Navy and Army to the new Service.To summarise the above discussion v?o would make the following reooamendatlons:-1.   That an Air Ministry be instituted as soon as possible, consisting of a Minister with a consultative Board on tho lines of the Array Council or Admiralty Board, on which the several departmental activities of the Ministry will bo represented.     This iiinistry to control find administer all matters in connection with aerial warfare of all kinds what-seevor, including lightsr-than-air as well as heavier-then-air oraft.2.   That under tht Alt ilinietry an Air staff be lasti-tutod on the lines of tho Imperial General $taff responsible for the working out of war plans, the direotion of operations, the celltctien of intelligence and the training of the Air personnel;   that this Staff be equipped with the best brains and practical experience&quot;available In our present Air Servicec,&quot; and that by seriodie appointment to the Staff of.of-icers with great praotical experience from the front, due provision be made for the development of the Staff in response to the rapid advanoe of this naw Servioe.
3.    That tho Air Ministry and Staff proceed to workout tho arrangements neoessary for the amal-gamation of the R.N.A.S. and R.F.O. and the legal constitution and discipline of the new Air Ber-t vice, and to prepare tho necessary draft legie-lation and regulations, which could he passed and brought into operation next autumn and winter.4.     That the arrangements referred to shall make pro-vision for the automatic passing of the R.N.A.8. and the R.F.d personnel to the new Air Service, by-consent, with the option to those officers and other ranks who are merely seoonded or lent of reverting to their former,positions. There are legal questions involved in this transfer and the rights of officers and men must be pro-teoted, but no dislocation need be anticipated.5.     That the Air Service remain in intimate touch with the Army and Navy by the closest liaison, or by direct representation of both on the Air . Staff, and that, if necessary, the arrangements for close co-operation between the three Services be reviewed from time to time.6,    That the Air Staff shall from time to time attachto. the Army and the Navy the Air Units necessary for naval or military operations, and suoh units shall, during the period of such attachment, be subject, for the purpose of operations, to the control of the respective naval and military commands.    Air Units not so attaohed to the Army and Navy shall operate under the immediate direo-tion of the Air Staff.The Air units attaohed to the Havy and Army shall be provided with the types of machines whioh these Services respectively desire.7.    That provision be mode for the seconding or loan of regular officers of the Navy and Army to the Air Service for definite periods, suoh officers to be employed, as far as possible, with the naval and military contingents.6.    That provision be made for the permanent transfer, by desire, of officers and other ranks from the Navy and Army to the Air Servioeo.In conclusion we would point out how undesirable it would be to give too much publicity to the magnitude of our Air oonetruo-tion programme and the real significance of the changes in organisation now proposed.    It is important for the winning of the ww that we should not only secure Air predominance, but secure it on a very large scale;   and having secured it in this war we should make every effort and saorifice to maintain it for the future.   Air supremaoy may in the lenr run boooas as important * factor in the defence of the empire m Sea supremacy.    From both these points of view it is nsoessary that not toe much publicity be given to our Plane and intentions whioh wlU only htvt the effect of spurring our opponents to corresponding efforts.    The aeoa&amp;s-ery assures ehould be defended on the grounds of tfcsir inherent and obvious reasonableness and utility, snd the desirability of preventing conflict and securing harmony between naval snd military requirements.
