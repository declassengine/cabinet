EC RET.WAR CABINET.G*T. - 1694.INTER-ALLY COUNCIL IN LONDON TO CO-ORDINATEREQUIREMENTS. FOR AMERICAN SUPPLIES.(Memorandum by the Secretary.)(l)   With references to Lord Korthcliffe1s telegram of August 9th on the subject of ah Inter-Ally Council in London to co-ordinate all requirements for American Supplies, I think it may be convenient to summarise briefly the action already taken by the War Cabinet in the matter, and to examine what further steps are required.(2)   On June 7th the Minister of Munitions:submitted a Memorandum (G.T.966) in which it was proposed that an inter-Ally Council should be set up.     This Memorandum was considered by the War Cabinet on June 8th (War Cabinet 159, Minute 4), and the matter was referred to Lord Curzon for his decision.(3)   On June 30th Lord Curzon submitted his Report (G.T.1228) covering a scheme for a Council for the co-ordination of Allied purchases to be established in London with an independent British Minister as President.Lord Curzonfs Report was approved by the War Cabinet on July 5th (War Cabinet 1?6, Minute 3.)The Representatives of the Admiralty asked, however, that the supply of oils and ships should not be included in the general scheme.The question of the selection of the President of the Council was deferred for consideration at a later date.(4)   On the 11th June the Admiralty submitted a Memorandum (G.T.I433) embodying their views in regard to requiremente of
oil-fuel and ships.   This paper was considered &quot;by the War Cabinet on July 19th (War Cabinet 190, Minute 4.) when it was decided that :-Pending a decision as to the constitution, powers, and habitat of the Conference, the present arrange-ments, under which the Admiralty control the pro-vision of oil-fuel and ships from the United States, should continue.(5)   If the proposals at present under consideration for co-ordination of supplies are carried into effect, it would appear that there will be three pieces of Administrative machinery.: -(a) The American Board in London dealing with British requirements.(b) The Inter-Ally Council above referred to.(c) The United States Government Purchasing Commission in America.The requirements of British Government Departments would go in the first   instance to the American Board; thence to the Inter-Ally Council; thence to the United States Government Purchasing Commission.The question of (a),the American Board, was dealt with by the War Cabinet on August 10th (War Cabinet 210, Minute 16), when it was decided that the work should be entrusted to Mr. C.J. Phillips, who, in cases of difficulty, should refer to Lord Robert Cecil.The question of (c) the Purchasing Commission in America is a matter for the United States Government.(6)     There remains the question of the formation of the Inter-Ally Council referred to in Lord Northcliffe1s telegram of August 9th.   Two outstanding points needing settlement are:-
(a)   The title of the Council.     Mr .McAdoo asksthat it should &quot;be called the &quot;Military Inter-Ally Council&quot; and Lord KorthcXiffe concurs in this, &quot;because &quot;the people and the United States &quot;Congress are asking whether what tney consider &quot;the huge demands of the Allies are military -&quot;necessities or whether they are in part to&apos; &quot;supply domestic needs&quot;, .(b)   Whether the Inter-Ally Council should he Bet&quot; up in London or in:Paris.     It.is understood that the French Government are in-favour of the latter place.     It would therefore seem that we cannot comply with Mr.Crosby1s request, mentioned in Lord ITorthcliffe^s telegram, namely &quot;what we want is to be-able to say that this &quot;Council has been formed&quot; until the question of place has been decided. , . It would be of no use, for instance,.for an independent British Minister to be appointed as .Chairman if, after all, it should be decided that the Council was to sit in Paris.(7)   I therefore submit to the War Cabinet that it is desirable that Lord Curson should be asked to re-assemble his Committee on&apos; the subject to decide these and any other outstand-ing points and to advise the War Cabinet in order.that an answer may be returned to Lord Iorthcliffe&apos;s message at the earliest possible moment.( Initialled)   M.P.A.H..2,. Whi te hall Gar dens, S.W 11th August, 1917.
