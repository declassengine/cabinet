SECRET. Intelligence Bueeau,Department of Information BWP/OllWeekly Beport on Poland.   XI*On July 2 Brigad&amp;er Pilsudski declared that a Polish army could not be formed under present conditions,   $he next day the Council of St&amp;te decided to call upon the legions to take the oath whereby they would become soldiers of the Polish army.     The oath promised &quot;faithful service to the  iagdoa of Poland and its future King&quot; and &quot;faithful brotherhood in arms in the present war to the armies of Germany and Austria-Hungary and of their allies&quot;.     Naturally this oath waa to be taken only by those legionaries  who had originally been Russian subjects but not be, Austrian subjects serving with the Legions.     In our last report, in which we dealt at length with these measures, we described them as a &quot;provocation to Pilsudski and the Left&quot; which consists of Socialists and Radicals, is republican and stands for Polish independence pure and simple.     ITe also expressed the view that these parties Would &apos;*soon be driven into opposition of an extreme characterInformation now to hand showB that the objectionable formula of the oath was made by them the occasion for action which in reality was based on much wider considerations.     The Left, following Pilsudski, declares inadmissible under present circumstances the creation of a Polish army.    Their views may bo summed up as follows:   the Polish State requires the support of a national army, but such an army cannot arise unless there is a representative and responsible Polish govern-(, ment in possession of full control over it.   The answer given by the Central Powers on June 8 proves that it was not their intention to con-cede such ofcntrol to the Poles.    The manner in which the Provisional
ouncil of State, supported by leaders of the late pro-Russians, have ecided to set up a Polish government and a new Council of State &apos;ndicates that it was not their intention to create a representative overnment and to make it responsible to a Diet elected on a democratic asis.    An army created under such circumstances might be used in a ay contrary to the national interest;   it might be sent to the front hough the Poles have no reason^ to fight against revolutionary Russia, he Left therefore opposed the military schemes of the Council and ecommended the Legions to refuse to take the oath.The immediate result was a refusal by all the Russian *oles from he 1st, 4th, 5th and 6th regiments of infantry, the 1st regiment of cavalry, the 1st regiment of artillery and also by a part of the 2nd nd 3rd infantry regiments end the 2nd cavalry regiment.     Pilsudski as thus oompletely won the day.     The Polish Legions consisting now lraost exclusively of Austrian subjects, who have had no choice but to remain in them, can hardly be used as cadres for the army which the Council of State had wished to build up;   nor could they in their present disorganised condition be sent to the front.     Data in our possession enable us to estimate only very roughly the number of men &apos;ho have withdrawn from the Legions.     Early this year the proportion 0? Russian Poles in the Legions was put at about one third, but this )is  a approximate estimate which cannot be vouched for.    The only absolutely reliable figureslwhich we possess date back to October 1, 1915; to to that date 14,216 Russian Poles had enlisted in the Legions, and 0f these 10,319 were then with their regiments, almost half of them in ?ilsudski&apos;a own brigade, which cousisted of the ist and 5th regiments, &quot;since then fresh recruits can hardly have done more than replace css-^alties as, from about the beginning of September, 1915, the Radicals Socialists, the only people who count in Russian Poland when it
mnies to mass action, have opposed any  trther recruiting.     If, there-re, ee assume that there were with the Legions 10,000 Russian Poles, fe might take it that some 8,000 have withdrawn, which would, however, e the extreme limit.     Still it is not the numerical, hut the moral ffect which counts for most in this case.The impression produced in the Council of State seems to have heen tunning,    Archbishop Kakowski and Prince Z. Luhomirski, who happened o be out of Warsaw, were wired for.    On July 14 a proclamation was ublished by the Council of State to the Polish Nation reviewing the ourse of negociations on army-problems between the Counoil of State nd the Central Powers, and trying to justify its latest action.     It lso contains declarations with regard to future action which on the ext day fJuly 15) were summarised in four resolutions carried at the &quot;Iplenary sitting of the Council.     They run as follows:-(1)      &quot;The Provisional Council of State acts temporarily as the Polish government until suos? government is formed.    As such the Jroviaional Council of State called upon the soldiers to take the military oath.     By the mere fact that it received the oath from the Polish army, the Council of State has become for this army the supreme Political authority.    Beginning with this moment the Polish army cannot he used at the front without the consent of the Council of State(2)      &quot;The Legions will be used at present in acoordance withtheir purpose exclusively as oadres for the Polish army.(3)      &quot;The Provisional Council of, State as the political govern-aeat of the Polish Btats will apoeal to the Poles abroad that thePolish military units formed abroad should not have the politicalshouldcharacter of a Polish army and/not be used xin the present war.(4) &quot;The Provisional Council of State will immediately take in.^ hand the organisation of the Polish government in accordance with the
scheme accepted on July 3rd.&quot;Thus the same people who in the  oint Committee had refused to go beyond the limits set to them &quot;by the Central Powers, now in a fit ct panic boldly claim for themselves an authority over army matters such &amp;s had never been conceded to them by these Powers.     Though Pilsudski had failed by persuasion, he has jockeyed them into action.     They further offer to remain neutral in the present war provided that quasi-national Polish armies are not formed abroad.     Clearer even than in the resolutions this point appears in the proclamation to the Polish nation:   &quot;The Council of State, as the only authority entitled to voise the political views of the Polish nation, does not wish to add to the orgy of international hatreds, but wishes to become a factor for peace and to help to conclude the present bloody struggle;   it denies to any   one abroad, outside the borders of Polish lands, the right to dispose of Polish blood.&quot;    Finally, the Council speaks in this proclamation of a &quot;universal and free Diet&quot; which is to meet in Warsaw, though it had recently preserved an eloquent silence on that subject.It was stated at first that the Legionaries who had refused to take the oath would be interned, but it was given out later on that those whose homes are in Poland would shortly be sent home whilst places of residence would be assigned to the others.     Ueantime strong action was taken by the German authorities against the parties of the Left, especially against the more prominent members of the Socialists and the Radical Peasants&apos; Party, and against Pilsudski&apos;s secret mili-tary organisations.     Tho first arrests seem to have been made on July 13 and continued throughout the Gorman sphore of occupation during the following days;   but so far no arrests are reported from the Austrian sphere, which is indeed a significant fact.     On July 16 the house was searched of Lieutenant-Colonel Sosnowski, Pllsudski&apos;s
late   Chief of Sta   ^nd.-4me o-f&quot; his- closest associates;   his passport was taken from him. i.e. he was confined to Warsaw.     But it was not until the night of July 21-22, i.e., until the Russian retreat had . changed into a disaster, that Pilsudski and Sosnkowski were both arrested.It is clear that these arrests are meant to break up the organisa-tion of the Left and that the time was chosen when, in view of the air-anarohy which threatened Petrograd and the rout which had set in at the Hussian front, it was expected that the Poles would be most easily -cowed.     It also seems probable that Pilsudski was planning action on a big scale which, though it could not possibly have broken the German hold on Poland, might have frightened the late pro-Russians from join-ing the &quot;conoiliatories&quot; of the Central Powers, or would have rendered it impossible for the reactionary bloo to carry on their policy of com-oromise with the occupying Powers.     The coming to Warsaw of represen-tatives of the Central Powers to negociate and finally determine the-f-acheme of government for Poland was announced for July 21;   Helferxich and Prince Hatzfeld wsre to represent Germany.     There is so far nc evidence of their having actually gcno to Warsaw or otf the negooiaticns having been started.The attitude of the Inter-Pnrty Union, i.e. of the pnrty machines of the Urvtionel Democrats end Realists, r.s distinguished from their most prominent leaders who have taken part in the Joint Committee, remains obscure.     In view of the popular indignation crused by Hleudskfc arrest on the one hand, end the impression produced by the Russian retreat on the othor, it is impossible to make any forecast cf what decision will finally be arrived at by these uarty organisations. Still tho most prominent mon from their camp, such as Priuoe Lubomirski find M. de Steoki seem personally so deeply involved in the formation of the bloojthat for them personally it will hardly be possiblo to withdraw into &quot;passivity&quot; L.B.K.
