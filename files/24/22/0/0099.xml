Staff of Commissioners and Sub-Commissloners handed in their resignations to the Director-General, who accepted them, with regret.     After the issue of the Army Council Instruction (1155/1917) by which the disposal of all military labour is placed in the hands of the officers of the Pood Production Department, in abrogation of existing agreements entrusting these duties to the officers of the Agricultural Section of the National Service Department, no other course was open to the Agricultural Staff of this Department but tfo resign.It is due to their efficient service that the labourproblems arising out of the sowing and reaping of this yearfs harvest have been solved, with the co-operation of the Military Author-ities, over 3^,000 soldiers and volunteers having been secured for work on the land, and placed to the utmost possible advan-tage, in addition to large numbers of part-time workers.

Special Volunteers secured and placed number 217.. 5.       general TliADSS SECTION,The transference of workers from the less essential trades to the most important national industries, which comprises the principal duty of this section is almost entirely suspended for the time &quot;being, partly owing to the uncertainty as to the future work of the National Service Department, but mainly because of the attitude of the Treasury towards the Departments proposals to indemnify out of state funds such Volunteers as may be so trans-ferred against loss of wages, as a result of transfer.     Every endeavour has been and is being made to meet objections which Treasury have lodged, by the adoption of reasonable limitations to the application of the principle of indemnity in such cases.The general position of this section has not been modified since last week&apos;s report was forwarded, 6*     local national service committees.The number of National Service Committees appointed to date is as under:-.In England &amp; Wales 876In Scotland ,,,       ... 152 Until substantial numbers of vacancies.created by the with-drawal of men for the Army, these Committees have no great incent-ive to take up thfcir allotted task of securing substitutes from the unorganised trades of minor importance from the National ( point of view.They are being encouraged to do all that is within their power to organise bodies of part-time workers on the land, etc., and to arrange co-operation amongst traders to release men.
(b) Recruiting for Women1 s Amy Auxiliary Corps,In consequence of the arrangement made between the War Office, the Ministry of Labour and the Department for the transfer to the Employment Exchanges of the duty of supplying volunteers for the Women1s Army Auxiliary Corps, letters convening the thanks of the DirectoivCene^al ;*or assistance rendered by the National Service Committees in the campaign have been forwarded to all National Service Committees In England, Wales, and Scotland,     These letters also requested the Committees to forward to the Departmenttheir out-standing accounts and to refrain from incurring any further expend;iture*(aJ Volunteers placed during the week.The number of demands for National Service and Substitution Volunteers reaching the Substitution Officers during the week amounted to 1^551;    There have been 1,399 men submitted and 678 have been placed.The difficulty mentioned herein under the heading of GeneralTrades Section51, and also in last weekrs report, with regard tothe indemnity against loss exchanges In the rate of Volunteerswages is still impeding the work of the Substitution Officers andthe trade Committees, as otherwise many more capable workerscould be secured for essential trades.     Although sanction hasbeen received unofficially from the Treasury for the Differenceto be paid by this Department, in cases where Volunteers have al-ready been placed, in emergencies it has not materially relievedthe situation,WOMgl^S SECTION,Rapid progress has been made during the week in the trans-, ference of the duties of this Section to other Government Depart-ments -
principally tho Ministry of Labour and the Board of Agriculture, and this work will probably be completed within the next week. 9,   GENERAL.The resignation of the undersigned is at the diposal-of the new Director-General, to take effect as soon as arrangements can conveniently be made,,(Signed)    ARTHUR   COLLINS.GENERAL SECRETARY: NATIONAL   SERVICEDEPARTMENT.11. 8. 1917.
