A letter has been sent to the Foreign Office on this subject by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and a copy has been communi-cated to the Director-of Llilitary Intelligence.Z. Unless a sufficient force is ready at hand to deal with anyattempt at foul play, a grave situation might easily arise.   The Mesopotamia^ Expeditionary Porce is understood to be dependent on the oilfields for its fuel supply, and it appears conceivable that a tribal rising, engineered by the Germans, may form part of the attempt to recapture Bagdad which is to take place shortly.3. As regards directly Naval interests, the drawings of Persianoil fuel for delivery to H.ii. Ships in the Eastern Mediterranean and to Italy have recently been increased as part of a general schema for saving tonnage.   The maintenance of these supplies and of the large petrol production of the Anglo-Persian Company is imperatively necess-aryo4. In view of the above facts, and of the critical situation inregard to oil fuel supplies generally, My Lords regard the safety of the Persian oilfields as a national interest of the very highest importance, and trust that the military authorities will be able to ensure their adequate protection.5&quot; I am to ask that Their Lordships may recoive such assurancesfrom the Army Council, as may be possible in the circumstances.6.
