THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY * S GOVERNMENT. SECRET.CM.I. (35), CAJBIJFT. COPY NO.__COMMITTEE ON THE ORGANIZATION OF THE OQA.L MINING INDUSTRY,COAL_BILL.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY FOR MINES.I attach a draft Bill, revised on the lines indicated in the Committee1s Report (ChP. 240(37)) and approved by the Cabinet on the 20th October last.I attach also a draft of an explanatory White Paper which I propose should be circulated to Members with the Bill.The two main respects in which Parta L of the Bill has been revised are:(a) that it now leaves the coal-properties in their present ownership during a valuation period of 3-g- years, from 1st January, 1935, tn 1st July, 1942;    and(b) that, broadly speaking, it adopts the valuation scheme proposed by the Royalty Owners, under which the valuations are to be made by the mineral agents of the present owners acting under an &quot;independent&quot;  chairman.Effect is given in the Bill to the two qualifications made by the Cabinet, viz:(i) that any re-arrangement (i,ea consolidation) of leases which the Coal Commission, in agreement with a colliery lessee, may propose to introduce during the valuation period shall not be held up for more than 6 months for the settlement of terms with the present owners;    and(ii) that the Commission shall have power to compel the present owners to accept payments on account of compensation during the valuation period.
I have, however, to report that, whilst the Royalty Owners have no objection to the former, they express themselves fundamentally opposed to the latter.    They say that they have no doubt  that, on a voluntary basis, many millions v/ould be accepted by owners who have mortgages on their properties, but they strongly object to any owner who has no such use for the money being compelled to accept it before the vesting day.    They represent that in settled estates it would be necessary to obtain the directions of the Court as to the disposal of the money and, indeed, would need an amendment of the Settled Land Acts.    But their main point is one of principle, viz,, that it would &quot;pro tanto&quot; impose upon the vendors a risk which, in the nature of the case, must properly be carried by the purchaser, vlza, the risk of the cost of money having risen by the agreed completion-date*- They point out that if interest rates rose during the valuation period a payment of, say,  100,000 during that period would on the agreed completion-day have fallen to a value of less than  100,000;    and in such an event they ask how it could be justifiable that an owner, to whom no payment on account had been made, would receive the full value of his compensation on the agreed completion date, while one who had been forced to accept such a payment would receive something which on the agreed completion date was of less value than the payment then due to him0It is, I suggest, for the consideration of the Committee and the Cabinet whether the power to enforce acceptance of payments on account must nevertheless remain in the Bill.In that event there is also the question what rate of interest should be charged upon such advances0
The draft Bill at present prescri&quot;bes ofo as the rate payable, &quot;both on payments on account and, conversely, on unpaid compensation afber the vesting day5I wish also to call special attention to the valuation scheme contained in the Third ScheduleoIt is an essential feature of the Royalty Owners&apos; Scheme that the total global figure of  66 ,45 million should first be subdivided into district global figures 3They inform me that their Committee have virtually secured an agreement amongst their members as to what this subdivision should be (see the Schedule to the Hastings Scheme?    Ref: CP, 196 (57-)) ;        and their proposal was that this subdivision should be specified in the BillsI do not think that this is acceptable, and the Bill is drawn to provide that this subdivision shall be made, not by Parliament in the Act, but by a Central Valuation . Board set up by the Act for that and other purposes.    The Royalty Owners have no objection to this variation.This Central Board, it is proposed, shall consist of professional mineral agents drawn from each (prospective) district or &quot;valuation region&quot;, with an &quot;independent&quot; chairman and shall reach their decisions by a majority vote.Similarly, the Regional Valuation Boards to be appointed for each &quot;valuation region&quot; (as determined by the Central Board) are to consist of all the mineral agents practising in that region, with an independent chairman.The idea of the Royalty Owners in proposing this scheme is that their mineral agents virtually have already the authority of some seventy-five per cento (in terms of value) of the present owners as to the subdivision of the global figure  into regional figures, and that, similarly, they will provide the best means of arriving at the individual valuations in each region0
As regards the global subdivision, the Royalty Owners&apos; Committee admit that something like twenty-five per cento of the value of coal is not represented by them, but about one half of this minority consists of the colliery-owned freehold coal and the Mining Association definitely favour the Royalty Owners1 proposals on this subject.    There is thu only about 12-gfo outstanding and there seems to be force in the argument that a division which is satisfactory to so large a majority can safely be assumed to be as fair a one as could be made.I ought also to report that, as regards the Regional valuations, the Chief Valuer to the Inland Revenue does not accept the Royalty Owners&apos; -view that their scheme is the most likely to work with expedition and satisfaction, but that it is submitted by the Owners as a condition precedent to their agreement of a 3-g- years&apos; valuation period0Another matter which has nov/ been raised by the Royalty Owners - is one on which representations have previously been made to me by the Chartered Institute of Surveyors, and other professional bodies, viz0, that compensation should be provided for firms or persons, at present engaged in the management of mineral estates, who after the vesting date are deprived of employment, or financially injured, by reason of the Act,    This raises a question v/hich is frequently arising in one form or another in various Bills, and, for purposes of co-ordination,    an informal Interdepartmental Committee of officials has met from time to time at the Board of Trade.    The advice of this Committee is that there is little, if any, precedent for providing by legislation for compensation of this kind to any but salaried and &quot;established&quot; employees of the
undertakings affected, and that the present claim should he resisted - more particularly as the class affected will for some years he provided with a large accretion of remunerative work by reason of the Act, find some proportion of them ma?/ expect to be offered employment by the Goal Commission, afterwardss    It has to be expected, however, that the claim will be pressedoI. have not agreed the Bill with the Royalty Owners in detail, and I expect some criticism from them of certain subjects such as the liability for damage to the surface.; In particular, I expect them to press for an alteration of the present law -in order to make the Goal Commission responsible for the torts of its lessees in this respect, and they will doubtless have other pointsiIn addition to any alterations in the attached draft which may be necessary in consequence of Cabinet decisions on the points already raised there may be certain other amendments and additions still to be made but they are mainly of a technical character and not, I think, of a kind which would affect any decision of this Committee or of the CabinetaAs regards the Colliery Owners, I understand that their main point of criticism on Part L&apos; is still directed to the &quot;forking Proprietors&quot; clause, to which they urge that an addition should be made to give any working proprietor the option, in effect, to waive his compensation and be given a lease at a nominal rent0    This matter has been before the Committee on several occasions,.. Their other main point of attack is likely to be on Part ri0    I understood at first that they would not oppose it in its present form0    They appear, however, to have misunderstood what its form was to be, and they have now written to me to urge the importance of retaining the existing &quot;safeguards&quot; within the jurisdiction of the Court,    In short,
/ &quot;The Amendment will leave it open to the commission, at any time after the Bill is passed, to foster voluntary amalgamations on the one hand, and on the other to make all necessary inquiries and :!n-;esti gat ions to enable them to decide what schemes they propose if they should have to fall back on compulsion^    But within the powers granted by the Bill, they will not be able actually to launch any compulsory schemes before 1st July, 1938, that is to say two years from the present time.   That lapse of two years should give ample time for a large measure of re-organisation by voluntary action if the will to amalgamate is thereo   Failing that will, of course, compulsory powers must be put into operationa&quot;I understand their attitude to he that they do not object to a provision that no scheme can be submitted to the Court without the consent of Parliament , provided that, when it is so submitted, it shall continue to be just as impossible as it now is to get the Court to enforce it0 On that I need not comment0It will be found, however, that in the amended sub-section 2 (in the Seventh Schedule) a safeguard against &quot;financial injury&quot; now appearsaThe present draft also differs from the previous one in that it varies the stage at which compulsory amalgamation proposals are affected by the two years&apos; respite during which the power to launch scnenes is to be inoperativeo/Appended are the exact words of the pledge given by the then President of the Board of Trade on the subject in May, 1956.   The present proposal is&quot;that the statutory respite shall apply to the submission cf schemes to the Board of Trade for reference to the Court and not to references to Parliament, Seeing, however, that the date in the Bill is 31st December, 1939 as against the 1st, July, 1938, specified in the pledge there can be no legitimate ground for criticism-,
Part III. of the Bill and the Eighth Schedule provide (1)  for the extension of Part I. of the Goal Mines Act, 1939, for five years from the end of 1937, and (2) for certain modifications in the powers of Commi committees of. Investigation set up under that Act.The selling -schemes in force in the coal industry derive their statutory authority from Part I. of the Act and the reason for the extension of the Act was given in C.P.  106(36) of 6th April, 1936.The Committees of Investigation are the bodies to which consumers who consider that they are unfairly treated under the selling schemes may refer their complaints.      In June, 1956, before the schemes came into operation, agreement with regard to the future powers of these Committees was reached with the colliery owners and the Conjoint Conference of Public Utility Associations representing the gas, electricity, water and sewage works.      The Conjoint Conference have since informed me that they desired that further amendments should be made in the powers of the Committees of Investigation.      I deemed it wise to take informally into consultation the Association of Chambers of Commerce and the Federation of British Industries in order to secure some expression of the views of consumers generally with regard to the powers of the Committees.    It has not been found possible to reconcile completely the views of all these bodies, nor those of the colliery owners and mineworkers in this matter but the proposals in the Eighth Schedule substantially cover the various representations that have been made to me.    Summarised briefly, these proposals are:-(1) The present constitution of the Committees will be retained, that is to say,  the representatives of the coal industry and of the consumers will continue to serve, but in the event of the members of a Committee not being unanimous on any matter, the decision shall be taken by the Indepsndent Chairman, a member of the legal profession.
(2) The Committees shall meet in public, unless for any special reason they decide to raeex in private.(3) The Committees shall have, power to disclose to the complainants information given to them by the colliery owners in reply to the complaint, provided that the particulars of individual businesses are not disclosed in an identifiable manner.-(4) Any person may arpeal against a decision of aCommittee of Investigation to a Central Appeal Tribunal of three independent persons,  the Chairman of which will be a member of the legal profession.I think myself that these proposals are right and fully defensible, but they have not been formally accepted by the bodies concerned.      I have hopes that they will not raise violent opposition.H.  C.5th November, 1937.

COAL BILL. 4 9 AY/hite -Paper .1.      The Bill is in four parts.    Part I provides for the unification of coal royalties under the ownership and control of a, Coal Commission.   Part II provides for the furtherance of reorganisation in the industry by transferring to the new Coal Commission the functions of the Coal Mines Reorganisation Commission,  and by varying the powers of compulsory amalgamation given to the latter body by the Coal Mines Act,  1930.  -Part III extends to the end of 1942,  the duration of Part I of the Act of 1930 (which is the statutory basis of the organised selling schemes), and includes certain amendments designed to strengthen,  in the interests of consumers, the Committees of Investigation constituted under that Act.   Part IV of the Bill contains miscellaneous and general provisions.The more Important provisions in the Bill are summarized below.Part I.Unification of Goal Mining Royalties. 2.     The Bill eets up a Coal Commission,  in whom the ownership and control of the royalties are to be vested (Clause 1 and First Schedule).     The Commission are not to engage in the operations of coal-mining (other than searching and boring for coal), but are charged with the management and control of the property, by granting mining leases and otherwise, so as best to promote &quot;the interests, efficiency, and better organisation of the coal-mining industryl&apos;      A power to give &quot;general directions&quot; to the Commission, in matters affecting the national interest, including all matters affecting, the safety of coal working,  is to be vested in the Board of Trade.  (Clause 2) 03.      The property and rights to be acquired comprise all coal (whether now being worked or not, and whether now known to&apos; exist or not) together with all rights and servitudes attached to it, as specified in Clause 4 and the Second Schedule (and see also Clause 14).    This property is referred to in the Bill as the
&quot;principal coal hereditaments&quot;,   Minerals other than coal which are comprised in existing coal-mining leases pass with the coal, unless the Commission exercise their right to. exclude them. (Clause 3(4)(b)).    These minerals, together with any &quot;surface servitudes&quot; which may in law he indissoluhly attached to the coal, are referred to as &quot;subsidiary coal hereditaments&quot;. (Clause 6(2)),There is also assigned to the Commission a right to withdraw support from the surface to the extent and subject to the conditions stated in Part II of the Second Schedule. 4.      The existing rights of working lessees of coal are maintained, (Clause 5) while &quot;working proprietors&quot;  (i0e, colliery undertakings owning the freehold of their own coal)  are given the right to a lease of the coal on the terms and conditions ruling in the district (Clause 12).5.     Each owner of &quot;principal coal hereditaments&quot; is to receive in compensation his due proportion of the total sum to he paid for the whole property,,    (Clause 7(7) )a    The sum is specified in the Bill,  (Clause 6(3)) and compensation is to he paid in cash raised &quot;by a loan charged on the property of the Commission and the revenues therefrom0    The loan may he guaranteed by the Treasury.    (Clause 25)    &quot;Subsidiary ooal hereditaments&quot; will he valued and paid for separately out of the proceeds of the loan.Method   of Aoquisltlon, 6.     The Bill prescrihes two dates - a &quot;Valuation Date&quot;, 1st January, 1939, and a &quot;Vesting Date&quot;, 1st July,  1942.      The proposal is that between these dates each present owner shall be placed in the same position as .if he had on the earlier date entered into a contract to sell his ooal property (as defined in the Bill) to the Goal Commission at a pric-,e to he determined &quot;by valuation on the footing that the purchase is to be completed on the &quot;Vesting Date&quot; ..    (Clause 3(2)).7,     During the interim period the valuations of individual holdings for compensation will be made and meanwhile the present owners will continue to receive their royalties and profits, and
to manage their properties, hut in so doing they will have to show the same regard to the eventual interests of the Commission as would the owner of a property which he had contracted to sell. (Clause 8).8.     The Bill contains provisions (in Clause 11) designed to avoid postponement of the practical advantages of unification.    This Clause with the Fifth Schedule, empowers the Commission, at any time after the valuation date, to arrange with colliery undertakings for the consolidation of existing leases in a colliery &quot;take&quot;.   Each individual lessor concerned is guaranteed during the remainder of the valuation period the same receipts as it is estimated that he would have received if the consolidation had not &quot;been made. 9.     On the Vesting Date, the ownership- of the whole of the acquired property will pass to the Commission.    (Clause 3(3)). Clause 9 is designed to secure that during this period the Coal Commission on the one hand shall receive particulars of any new lease or variation or renewal of an existing lease, which is to he granted; and any owner, on the other hand, shall he enabled to ascertain whether anything which he proposes to do in connection with the management of his property would be regarded by the Commission as a breach of Clause 8.It is further proposed that this interim period should be utilised to disintegrate any ooal-mining leases which comprise both property to be acquired by the Commission ar.d property not to be acquired (e.g, surface rights).     Clause 10 and the Fourth Schedule give the Commission power in such cases to have new separate leases prepared, comprising the acquired property and the non-acquired property respectively, on terms which in the new circumstances are equivalent to existing terms, and to come into force on the vesting day.10.     Power is given to the Commission in Clause 14 to grant, subject to certain safeguards, all rights (e.g. wayleaves) in relation to underground strata other than coal which may be required for the purposes of working the coal.
Valuation, for Compensation.11.

The main financial provisions in the Bill are outlined in the Financial Memorandum (q..v.).13.    Clauses 20 and 21 contain provisions for the subsequent administration of the revenues of the Commission.      These may be summarized as follows.     The Commission must establish a Reserve Fund, and at the end of each financial year must credit to that fund the balance of their revenues
for that year, after payment of administration expenses, loan service, and other sums properly chargeable to revenue account. This Fund is to he available to meet any future deficiencies on revenue account;    and the Board of Trade are empowered, with the approval of the Treasury, to fix from time to time the amount to be thus set aside.    (Clause 20(2)). 14.    Clause 21 provides that if the Commission estimate that after providing for these prior statutory charges, they are likely to have, on the average, a surplus in future financial years, they may devote it to certain specified forms of relief, viz:    the reduction of (a) underground wayleaves (b) individual rents which are more onerous than the average rent in the district, (c) rents in a district (or part of a district) which are more onerous than the average in other districts (or other parts cf the same district).15.    If and when the reduction of rents provided for above has been substantially completed, the Board of Trade may, on a report by the Commission, lay an order before Parliament providing for the reduction of rents generally. 16.    Subject to these provisions for granting progressive relief to lessees, as and when finances perrr.it, the Commission are required (Sub-clause (3) of Clause 21)  in granting leases to reserve the best rent that can reasonably he obtained, having regard to all the circumstances.17.    Clause 27 requires the Commission to pay all taxes, local rates, royalties welfare levy, etc. as if they were a -private owner.18.    Clause 26 provides for the submission of annual accounts by the Commission,.through the Board of Trade to the Comptroller and Auditor General who will examine and   certify them, and lay them before Parliament, with his report.

Facilities and Support) Act, 1923, the use of land for the purpose of pithead baths provided by the Miners&apos; Welfare Committee.    (Clause 44.)Coal Mines Reorganisation Commission. 24.     Under this part of the Bill the functions of the Reorganisation Commission are transferred to the Coal Commission and the former Commission ceases to exist.

Compulsory schemes can be put forward only in accordance with the procedure laid down in Sub-clause (2).      Under this provision there are no general compulsory powers, but the Commission is to proceed through the medium of reports to the Board of Trade on the progress made in the voluntary reduction of the number of undertakings.      In
such reports., if- the Commission think that insufficient progress has been made in a certain area or areas, they may recommend that the compulsory amalgamation powers should be made exercisable there.The Board of Trade may then, if they think fit, after considering the Commission&apos;s report, make an order accordingly, declaring that it is expedient that amalgamation should take place in that area, or a specified part of it, and that the compulsory provisions of the i^ct of 1930 may be exercised there.     But before such an order can be made, it must be laid before both Houses of Parliament in draft for 88 sitting days.Sub-clause (3) and the Seventh Schedule amend Part II of the Coal Mines Act, 1930, in regard to the contents of compulsory schemes and their consideration by the Railway and Canal Commission.

Clause 43 extends the duration of Part I    of the 1930 Act until the 31st December, 1942.      The Eighth Schedule amends the constitution and powers of the Committees of Investigation.      These Committees are the tribunals to which consumers, who consider that they are unfairly treated under the organised selling schemes,may refer their complaints.In order to strengthen the protection afforded by these Committees, the amendments provide that:-(a) In the event of the members of a Committee not being unanimous, the decision may be taken by the Independent Chairman - a member of the legal profession.     Provision is also made for substitute members of the Committee and for a panel of reserve Chairmen.
