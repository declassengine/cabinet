SECRET.CP. 875 (37).COPY HQ. ^C A B I N E T.COiJfllTTEE QN AGRICULTURAL POLICY,REPORT OK LEVY SUBSIDIES FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.1. At their Meeting on 10th. November, 1937 (Cabinet41 (37) Conclusion 7) the Cabinet had &quot;before them a Memorandum try the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (Paper CP. 268 (37)) on the subject of levy subsidies for agricultural products, to which was attached the Report of an Inter-Departmental Committee of Officials on the subject,  and agreed that these documents should be examined at once by the Agricultural Policy Committee which should be asked to report in time for a final deoision to be given by the Cabinet on Wednesday, 17th. November.2, The advant ages and disadvantages of a levy subsidysystem for agricultural products are set out in Section VI of the Inter-Departmental Committee&apos;s Report.     We agree with the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries that regarded solely from the point of view of British agricultural interests a policy of levy subsidies has powerful attractions.      The home producer realises that it is impracticable to assist effectively most branches of agriculture by means of a protective tariff, but he sees in a levy subsidy a convenient method of securing fair and reasonable rctumsfor his products without inflicting undue hardship on the consumer.     As pointed out by the Leith-Rose Inter-Departmental Committee &quot;if financial assistance to the home producer is derived in whole or in part from a levy on
imports, this method would tend to reconcile him to acceptance of such imports and. it would in no way preclude arrange-ments for the better regulation of production and marketing &quot;by overseas producers themselves&quot;*      The permanence of a levy subsidy also strongly appeals to the agricultural community. It has, moreover, the further merit of compensating the home producer against subsidised imports, either from the Dominions or from foreign countries.,3. The disadvantages of a levy subsidy policy frem thepoint of view of the consumer,  the Treasury,  and our commer-cial relations with the Dominions and foreign countries will he found in paragraphs 44-60 of the Inter-Departmental Committee&apos;s Reports      Apart from the grave objections and difficulties mentioned in these paragraphs we have reached the conclusion that in present circumstances it would be. politically impracticable for the G-overnment to adopt a levy subsidy policy for the agricultural products discussed in CP.  268 (37).      As pointed out in paragraph 44 of the Inter-Departmental Committee&apos;s Report, the increasing cost of living is giving rise to public criticism and this would &quot;be encouraged by the imposition of a tax, however small, on foreign and Dominion butter and cheese, the retail prices ofwhich have risen substantially since 1st. January last and- are the subject of widespread coinment and complaint.4. We draw attention to the strong objections in principlefelt &quot;by the Treasury to the system of levy subsidy as offending against accepted canons of sound public finance (see paragraphs 45-49 of the Inter-Departmental Committee&apos;s Report) and also to the great difficulties to which the
Q 9 (* dc)0adoption of a levy subsidy policy would give rise in our relations with the Dominions and foreign countries (see paragraphs 5Q-60 of the Inter-Departmental Committee&apos;s Report).     Producers, &quot;both in the Dominions and in &apos; foreign countries object most strongly in principle to &quot;being asked to subsidise their United Kingdom competitors. Trade negotiations &quot;fith the Dominions and foreign countries on the &quot;basis of a levy subsidy would, in any case, be most difficult, and we should certainly have to pay a very high price for any agreement.    It is indeed extremely doubtful whether it would be possible in any event to reach agree-ment on the subject with New Zealand, whose exports of butter and eheese to this country represent over 40 per cent, of her trade to the United Kingdom.5. In view of these considerations we have reached theconclusion that in present circumstances, it would be wholly impracticable for the Government to adopt a levy subsidy policy in the cases of meat and livestock, bacon, milk and other dairy products.6. We have carefully considered the alternative tr alevy subsidy policy in the case of milk products discussed in Sections VIII and IX of the Inter-Departmental Committee&apos;s Report.6. As regards Quality Premiums, we favour the adoptionof the course suggested in paragraph 74 (ii) of the Inter-Departmental Committee1s Report.       We accordingly reoommend the maintenance of the Quality Premiums and Exchequer Contributions as in the White Paper,, with a provision for a review of the White Paper scales by the
Milk Commission during the third year in any case,  and earlier if the Jommission thinks it expedient.      We also recommend the Cabinet to adopt the proposal to give a greater measure of price insurance in respect of milk used for manufacture.    The detailed proposals in regard to this matter will he found in paragraphs 75 to 81 of the inter-Departmental Committee&apos;s Report.8.        We agree with the President of the Board of Trade that it would &quot;be advantageous,  from the point of view of future trade negotiations with the Dominions and foreign countries, if the occasion of the announcement in regard to a levy-subsidy were utilised to put forward an offer to a&quot;ban-don our right to levy a duty on the agricultural products in question during the next three years.    We also agree that it would be desirable to reserve our rights under Schedule TA5  of the Ottawa Agreements and Schedule I of the Canadian Agreement of 1936, to impose a quantitative regulation of imports of butter- and cheese if imports should become such as to lead to instability in the market for milk products in the United Kingdom.    We have invited the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Agriculture, and Fisheries to confer as to the wording of this reservation.9.        We submit the following recommendations to the Cahinet :-(i) That in present circumstances the principle of applying a levy-subsidy policy to the cases of meat and livestock, bacon, milk and other dairy products,  should be definitely a&quot;? undoned.
BHD ^cj0(ii) That as regards milk policy the proposals in the White Paper (Cmd,  5533) should &quot;be modified -(a) &quot;by maintaining the Quality Premiums and Contributions as in the White Paper but providing for a review of the White Paper scales by the Milk Commission during the third year in any case, and earlier if the Commission thinks it expedient;    and(b) giving a greater measure of price insurance in respect of milk used for manufacture.(iii) That the occasion cf the announcement of the decision in regard to levy-subsidy should be used to put forward (in a way most advantageous to us in our trade negotiations) an offer on our part to abandon the right to levy any duty on the agricultural products in question during the next three years; and that the power at present covered by Schedule  &apos;A&apos;&apos;  of the Ottawa Agreements,  and Schedule I &quot;;.f the Canadian Agreement of 1936 to impose a quantitative regulation cf imports of butter and cheese should be reserved fcr use in the event of imports being such as to lead to instability in the market for milk products in the United Kingdom,    The actual wording of this reservation to be settled by the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in consultation.Signed on behalf of the CommitteeNEVILLE CfLAISEELAIN Chairman,2, Whitehall Gardens, S, W, 1. 12th.
