HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. SECRET. COPY NO.        4.O.P. 265 (57).CABINET. Paris Exhibition - Participation in 1958. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.1. The Paris Exhibition, 1937, was, according to the original intention, to close on the 25th November.    There has, however, been a strong body of opinion in France in favour of reopening the Exhibition next year, and at the instance of the French Government the International Exhibitions Bureau in Paris at their recent meeting were invited to consider and report whether s\ich a continuation would be permissible under the terms of the Convention Relating to International Exhibitions signed at Paris in 1928.2. From the report on the proceedings of the Bureau at their meeting, furnished by the United Kingdom representative (Annex A), it v/ill be seen that although the indications were that many foreign countries were against a proposal to reopen, and although the general view had been that such a proposal would be in contravention of the Convention,  in the event, after Monsieur Politis had given a legal opinion to the effect that the Convention did not preclude continuation, the members of the Bureau decided by 17 votes to 2, with 2 abstentions, that the French Government might, if they so desired, reopen the Exhibition in 1938.    it was made clear, however, that every foreign country must be left perfectly free to decide for itself whether it should continue its participation.3. It is probable, having regard to the decision of the Bureau, that His Majesty&apos;s Government will at an early date receive an invitation from the French Government to reopen their Pavilion in May, 1938.    It is a matter of considerable
practical urgency (see para. 5 below) to decide now on th*? answer to be given, if an invitation is received.4. There are weighty reasons against an acceptance by His Majesty&apos;s Government of any such invitation, including the following:-(i) The Empire Exhibition,  Scotland, 1938,  is due to open in Glasgow next May.    The continuance of the Paris Exhibition will almost inevitably damage the attendance at Glasgow.    If His Majesty&apos;s Government have a Pavilion at Paris, the psychological effect on Scotland may, it is to be feared,  &apos; be to add insult to injury.(ii) The cost of continuing the present United Kingdom representation at Paris for another year would be considerable, even should the French Government offer, as in fact they may not, to maintain the building in proper repair during the wintero    It is impossible to make any estimate at this stage, but it is unlikely to be less than  40,000.(iii) In view of criticisms which have been made against this year&apos;s exhibit, it should be emphasised that altogether apart from consideration of cost, which of course would be very considerably in excess of  40,000, the organisation of a new Pavilion and exhibit comparable to the prestige exhibits of the Soviet and German Governments would be impossible for reasons of time alone.(iv) Considerable administrative difficulties would be involved- and a grave strain would be imposed upon the Exhibition staff of the Department of Overseas Trade, whose hands are already more than full with the preparations for His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s participations at the Glasgow Exhibition and at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto (both in 1938) and also at the international Exhibition to be held in Hew York in 1939.    it is unnecessary to emphasise the political importance of a really adequate British
representation at New York, and the work involved to ensure this *5. Since an invitation from.the French Government has not yet actually &quot;been received, the question is at the moment hypothetical.    Nevertheless an immediate decision is required because the Department of Overseas Trade is under contract to return the exhibits in the Pavilion to their owners at the close of the Exhibition i.e. November 25th.    Moreover, under the existing contracts with the Exhibition authorities, steps will have to be taken at an early date to commence the demolition of the present pavilion.O.F.G.S.Board of Trade,5th November, 1937.
10 aANNEX A.1st November, 1937.Sir,I have the honour to report that in accordance with the instructions contained in Mr. St.Quintin Hill&apos;s letter of October 23rd I proceeded to Paris to attend the meeting of the International Exhibitions.Bureau which commenced its sessions on Tuesday, October 26th:On various minor matters which were submitted to the Bureau I shall report separately.      The principal question which came up for discussion was that of the continuation of the Paris Exhibition next year.The result of the meeting was that it was decided by the Council of the Bureau by 17 votes to 2 with 2 abstentions -(secret voting)      that the French Government should be permitted to continue the Paris Exhibition in 1938.      It was made clear, however, that every foreign country would be left perfectly free to decide for itself whether it should continue its participation next year.In the following paragraphs I will set out the various steps which led to this result, a result which was obtained solely by the fact that the French Government attached political significance to the problemoAccording to the Convention questions relating to the registration, duration, etc. of international exhibitions are first discussed by the Commission de Classification on which twelve countries are represented.      The Commission makes its recommendations to the Council which alone has the right to decide,The Commission de Classification was presided over by Count Adrien van der Burch, a distinguished Belgian, Director-General of the Brussels Exhibition of 1935, and one of theRoSoHudson, Esq.o, M.P.,Department of Overseas Trade, 35, Old Queen Street, London, SoVi/Vl.
recognized authorities on the subject of international exhibitions.The meeting was addressed by Monsieur Chapsal,   He was in the unusual position of being able to speak in two capacities. At one moment he was appealing to us as Minister of Commerce and assuring us of the unanimity of the French Government, and at another he adopted the role of President d&apos;Honneur of the Bureau, - father, so-to-speak, of the Convention and a man who would never dream of doing anything which might impair the value of the Bureau.He laid great stress on the various misfortunes such as floods and strikes, which had prevented the Exhibition from being really ready until August 15th.     He somewhat naturally abstained from referring to the fact that if the French Government had adhered to the programme authorized by the Bureau for an Exhibition of Second Category many of these difficulties would never have arisen.     The important parts of M. Chapsal&apos;s speech were:-1.   that the French Government were unanimous in their desire to have the Exhibition re-opened.2.   that foreign countries who had participated in 1937 would be left entirely free to decide what they should do in 1938. 3.   that if they did decide to take part the French Authorities would do what they could to help to meet the necessary expense. 4.    that according to the French Governments interpretation of Article 3 of the Convention the International Bureau had the right to grant permission for the Exhibition to be held next year.The discussion that followed centred on the interpretation of Article 3 which for convenience of reference I quote in extenso. &quot;The duration of any international exhibition should not exceed six months;   provided always that the International Bureau may authorize, in the case of a general exhibition, a. longer period which shall not in any circumstances exceed twelve months&quot;o
0 0Many speakers, amongst them myself, maintained that Article 3 did not entitle the Bureau to grant the necessary permission to the French Government.     We based our arguments on the reasons which had led to the amplification of the original article.     We said that any request for an extension beyond six months must he made at the time of registration of the original request and that the twelve months must be continuous.It will be remembered that Mr. Hill&apos;s despatch said !&apos;It is the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the terms of the Convention which precludes continuation ought to he observed&quot;*    This is the view I naturally put forward.     After much discussion the German delegate finally proposed that as the question was one of legal interpretation we should submit the point to a Committee of Jurists - a recommendation which in order to save time - was reduced to a submission to M.Politis - a jurist of international reputation who happened to he available and who, being one of the signatories of the Convention, would be familiar with its details.A deputation consisting of the Belgian (Chairman) French and Swiss delegates was appointed to wait upon M.Politis.    They were accompanied by M.Isaac, the Director-General of the Bureau.I felt confident that having regard to the circumstances which led to the drafting of Article 3, M.Politis would give an opinion adverse to the French view,I was dismayed therefore to find on Wednesday morning that MoPolitis, a copy of whose opinion is enclosed* with this report, had come down entirely on the side of the French.But just when MoPolitisV opinion had been, read to the meeting, the Dutch delegate produced the opinion of M.de la Fradelle, a distinguished French jurist.     This was contrary to M. Politis&apos; view.*   Not attached.
fiat  -i-It is significant that  M.   Fradelle&apos;s opinion had been in the possession of the Bureau for some months.     M.Isaac, the Director   - a Frenchman   - was well aware of it but he suppressed all knowledge of it during the discussion.The Bureau now found itself in the position of having two reports, one - by a Greek - in support of the French thesis - one - by a Frenchman - in opposition to it.The Chairman decided that we must vote on which opinion to accept - but first we had to settle whether voting should be secret or not.      It was decided by 7 to 5 to have secret voting.      So far, so good - but to my surprise the vote which was taken to decide whether we should adopt the Politis or the Fradelle view was 7 to 5 against us in favour of Politis. I, of course, voted for the Fradelle view.We were compelled therefore as a Bureau to adopt the view that under Article 3 the Bureau could give permission for an Exhibition to continue.The question then arose whether the Bureau should lay down regulations  &apos;en principe&apos; for all cases - or whether we should take the Paris case first.      The latter alternative was adopted.     At this stage we adjourned for lunch and I was approached by the Italian delegate, Senator Puricelli, who asked me whether we could not bring ourselves to help &quot;ces pauvres Francais&quot; in a matter of such great importance to them. As it was lunch time and therefore difficult to get in touch with London, I decided to consult His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, who thought that in view of the political significance to be attached to a demarche of this sort by the Italian representative, I had better refrain for the moment from opposing the French proposals.      The result was that the Commission reached a position of stale-mate.On the following morning, the 28th, the full meeting of the Council took place with M. Dunant, the Swiss Minister in
1&quot; op.the chair.     M.Isaac, at the request of the President read a report of the discussions which had taken place on the previous days.     A copy of this report is enclosed* for convenience of reference.Before entering the Council Chamber I met the German delegate who was in a great state of excitement.     Not only was he disturbed by the presence of the representative of the Valencia Government - who had hitherto not put in an appearance but he informed me that no doubt thanks to the activities of the Soviet delegate, instructions had been received early that morning from Brussels and Stockholm by the Belgian and Swedish delegates respectively telling them not only to vote for France but to cease arguing against heroDuring the previous evening the Exhibition Authorities had entertained the Bureau.      I seized the opportunity to sound such delegates as were present and I found that with the exception of the Swede and Norwegian who were doubtful, the others were going to vote for France.     Even Mr. Roy, the Canadian Minister, said he would vote for France, though Canada was definitely not going to participate next year.With the sudden defection of Belgium and Sweden on Thursday morning the opposition had crumbled away and it was clear that France would get her necessary majority even if I voted against hero      There was no time to communicate with London.     I had to make up my mind there and then whether to risk causing embarrassment to His Majesty&apos;s Government by voting against France on what had become a political issue or voting for her, knowing that in any case an adverse vote would not affect the issue.I therefore decided to vote for France but before voting took place I asked the Presidents permission to address the meeting.      I reminded the Council of the words which the minister of Commerce had used.     He had assured us that in the event of*   Not attached.
Paris being allowed to continue her Exhibition, every participating foreign country would be entirely free to decide what it should do - &quot;sans que la Prance puisse prendre ombrage de cette decision&quot;.I asked M.Barety, the French delegate, to repeat this assurance and to confirm that France would undertake not to use any pressure either direct or indirect either through diplomatic or any other channels in order to influence participation. Every country would have to make its own decision and we for our part would find ourselves in a very difficult position because notwithstanding our affection and admiration for France, we had, as I had already explained, an Inter-Empire Exhibition taking place in Glasgow in 1938 which would call for very special efforts on our part.I repeated that the whole object of the Convention had been to limit the number of international exhibitions and I wondered whether it was in accordance with the spirit of the Convention that France, however perfectly she might organize exhibitions, should have had international exhibitions in 1925, 1931, 1937 and perhaps 1938 while all the rest of the world would have to divide the remaining years between them.I regret that I was unable to. prevent a decision which in my opinion is contrary both to the spirit and letter of the Convention and may therefore in time impair the value of the Bureau but the character of the problem became entirely political instead of technical and I felt therefore that I had to act accordingly.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant, E.F.CROWE.
