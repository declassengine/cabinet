THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  November 1937.152SECRET. CP. 267 (37).Copy No.CABINET.RETIREMENT AND SUPERANNUATION OF MEMBERS OF THESCOTTISH LAND COURT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.THE Scottish Land Court was constituted by Section 3 of the Small Land-holders (Scotland) Act, 1911, for the purpose of fixing fair rents for landholders&apos; holdings, &amp;c. The Court at present consists of a Chairman and 3 Members, appointed by His Majesty on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for Scotland. Under the 1911 Act, as amended by the Statutory Salaries Act, 1937, the Chairman and Members receive such salaries as may be determined by the Treasury.2. The Chairman has the status of a judge of the Court of Session, and is entitled to a retiring allowance proportionate to his salary (at present  2,200 per annum) on the same conditions as a judge of the Court of Session. No provision is made for retiring allowances to members (who at present receive salaries of  1,360 per annum).3. It has hitherto been the practice to make appointments of members subject to a condition of retirement at age 65. This condition has been accepted by each member prior to his appointment and has been embodied in the warrants of appointment. Recently, however, one of the present members, who attained age 65 on the 1st October, 1937, in conjunction with another member who will reach 65 on 9th September, 1940, maintained that this condition was ultra vires, and that as holders of judicial offices they remained members of the Land Court for life, or until removal, under the statutory provisions, for inability or misbehaviour. In July last they raised an action against the Lord Advocate in the Court of Session for declarator accordingly, and the Court decided in their favour. I am advised by the Lord Advocate that there is little chance of obtaining a reversal of this decision on appeal.4. In my view, after consultation with the Lord Advocate, it is necessary, in the interests of efficiency, that the ordinary members of the Land Court should be required to retire at age 65. Although members of the Land Court exercise certain functions of a judicial nature, their duties (unlike those of the Chairman and of judges or sheriffs) frequently involve personal inspections of arable and pastoral subjects in all parts of Scotland, and this requires a considerable measure of physical as well as mental energy. If retirement at 65 is required, some provision should at the same time be made for retiring allowances.5. There are special considerations which make it highly desirable that legislative provision on the above lines should be made at the earliest possible date. For some time past strained relations have existed between the member who attained age 65 on the 1st October and the Chairman and other members of the Court. I am advised that the efficiency of the Courfs work is threatened, and that, while no sufficient grounds exist for the removal of the member m question on statutory grounds, it would be desirable, to secure his retirement as soon as possible, r160981
6.   I accordingly recommend that legislation should be passed to :-jjrovi&amp;e for the ahblica-tion to future members of(1) require members of the Land Court appointed in the future (other thanthe Chairman) to retire at age 65 : (2) sqapdxolx^i^DxhntprosdsiimsK&amp;fSp^^ the Superannua-tion Acts, 1834 to 1935 (if this is done, some reduction will be made in the salaries of members appointed in future): (3) require the retirement, on the date when the Bill becomes law, of any existing member who has then attained age 65, and authorise the payment in any such case of a retiring allowance at the rate of  500 per annum:(4) require any existing member who has not attained age 65 when the Bill becomes law to retire oh reaching that age, and to exercise, within a specified time from the date when the Bill becomes law, an option to receive on retirement either an allowance at the rate of  500 per annum or such allowance as may be payable under the scheme applic-able to future members.7. These proposals have been discussed with the Treasury, who are in agreement with them. I would accordingly be glad to receive the authority of my colleagues for the preparation of a Bill on the foregoing general lines and for its submission to the Home Affairs Committee with a view to early introduc-tion in the House of Commons.W. E. E.Scottish Office, S.W. 1, November 4, 1937.
