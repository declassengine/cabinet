(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BMTAKI-Tffi MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERIljIEI&apos;TT.) EGRET.COPY HO. -.P. 271(57) *^CABINET.Proposals for amending the Education (Scotland) Acts.Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of Sta.te for Scotland.1*     The Departmental Committee on Health Services in Scotland recommended that the powers and duties of Education Authorities in Scotland with regard to the provision of meals and medical treatment for school children should &quot;be extended.     The eighth report of the National Advisory Council for Juvenile &quot;employment (Scotland) suggested legislation to enable Education Authorities to provide medical treatment for juveniles in Authorised Courses and recommended that the powers to be conferred should be wider than those now existing with regard to schools.     It is desirable that effect should be given to these recommendations at an early date, especially in view of the decision to introduce a Bill to amend the Unemployment   Insurance Act to provide inter alia that Education Authorities in Scotland shall be granted powers to provide meals and medical treatment, for juveniles attending Authorised Courses, similar in scope to those exercised in connexion with Day Schools (Cabinet 41(37) Conclusion 11.)2.     I accordingly propose at an early convenient opportunity to introduce a Bill -(a) to require Education Authorities to make adequate arrangements for attending to the health and physical condition of children and young persons enrolled at schools in their area and for the medical (including surgical and dental) treatment of such children;(b) to amend the statutory procedure under which Education Authorities are empowered to provide food or clothing for children attending schools in their area;(c)/
i o 1161(c)   to require the Education Authority to recover from the parent the cost of medical treatment, food or clothing so supplied, unless they are satisfied that he is unable to pay*3.     As the provision under (c) above may raise controversial issues it may be desirable that the provisions indicated in the preceding paragraph should be included in a more comprehensive Bill, e.g., one giving effect to ether recommendations made by the Health Services Committee.4.     I accordingly desire the sanction of my colleagues to an announcement that legislation for the purposes stated in paragraph 2 v.rill be introduced at ah early convenient opportunity, and for the preparation of the necessary Bill, leaving for further consideration the question whether this legislation should form a separate measure or should be part of a more comprehensive Bill.t7.E.E.SCOTTISH OFFICE,12th November, 1937.
