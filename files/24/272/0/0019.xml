Report by Sir DAVID ALLAN. HAY, O.B.E., J.P., C.A., as &quot;Commissioner for the Special Areas in Scotland, from 7th July, X936, to 31st August, 1937.To the Rt. Hon. Walter E. Elliot, M.C., M.P., Secretary of State for Scotland. ,Sir, :Part I.SECTION        INTRODUCTION AND general. I have the honour to submit this my first and final Report containing an account of my stewardship of the office of Com-missioner for the Special Areas in Scotland from the time of my appointment in July, 1936. I was appointed in that month in succession to the late Sir Arthur Rose, whom&apos; failing health had compelled to resign. His untimely death in August, 1937 deprived Scotland of one of &quot;its most distinguished and loyal public servants and I venture to take this opportunity of paying tribute to his memory and to the pioneer work which he did in 1934 as Investigator, and subsequently as first Commissioner for the Special Areas in Scotland.2. It has now become my own regrettable duty to give up this task owing to the calls of my other work. In placing my resignation , in your hands a few weeks ago I thought it right that I should recall that your predecessor, the late Sir Godfrey Collins, had been so good as to agree when I accepted office that I should be relieved in May of this year. I consented, however, at your request, to continue in office for a few more months, long enough to see the first develop-ments under the new Act and to welcome as my successor Lord George Nigel Douglas-Hamilton, without there having been any interruption in the work of the office.3. The past year has been one of progress in the nature and volume of the attack upon the problem of the Special Areas. Its main feature has, naturally, been the emphasis laid upon the industrial side, consequent in part upon the new legislation passed in 1937 and in part upon the formation of the Scottish Industrial Estate near Glasgow. The new legislation has not yet been in operation long enough to judge of its efficacy, but the general revival in Industry and the work created by the armament programme have helped to produce a situation which should give it the best possible chance and I am hopeful of its making a material con-tribution to the problem.x   17244
4. In the pages which follow I make for your consideration certain suggestions and recommendations for the future and while severing my connection with the work I will continue to watch /ts progress with sympathetic interest. With certain aspects of the Special Areas problem I am privileged to continue my interest in an intimate way as at your request I have agreed to act as Chair-man of the Housing Association which is being set up for the Special Areas in Scotland.5. This Report is the fourth of its kind, my predecessor having made three during his term of office to June, 1936, and while it is mainly concerned with bringing the narrative up to date I have had necessarily to refer from time to time to previous Reports to make the story complete.6. The existence. and powers of the Commissioner for Special Areas in Scotland derive from the Special Areas (Development and Improvement) Act, 1934, which was passed on 21st December, 1934 &quot; to provide for the initiation, organisation, prosecution and assistance of measures designed to facilitate the economic development and social improvement of certain areas which have been specially affected by industrial depression.&quot; The &quot; certain areas &quot; so far as Scotland is concerned are denned in Part II of the First Schedule to the Act.7. The City of Glasgow is specifically excluded from the Special Areas but the boundaries of the Areas march with the Glasgow Boundary. In the early part of this year it was brought to my notice that the Corporation of the City of Glasgow were promoting a Provisional Order under the Private Legislation Procedure (Scotland) Act, 1936, to extend the City Boundaries by taking in part of the Counties of Lanark, Renfrew and Dunbarton. I was advised that the effect of the Order as drafted would be that the added areas would cease to be part of the Special Areas. In general I did not consider it necessary to raise objection to the proposed extensions, as, with one exception, the added areas did not include any area in which there had been, or was likely to be, any important activity arising out of inclusion in the Special Areas.8. The one exception was an area forming part of the land at North Hillington, Renfrewshire, acquired by the Scottish Industrial Estates which had been formed by the Commissioner for development as a Trading Estate. In view of the serious legal and other difficul-ties which would result from the inclusion of this area within the City of Glasgow, I felt compelled to report to you against this particular proposal. Petitions against the Order were submitted by the Scottish Industrial Estates Limited and by the County Council of Renfrew. The question was debated fully at the Enquiry and I am glad to say that the Corporation of Glasgow were able to withdraw the area in question from their proposals.
71379. At the time of its being passed, the duration of the Act was limited to 31st March, 1937, but under the Expiring Laws Contin-uanceAct, 1936 its currency was extended to 31st May, 1937. The period was further extended to 31st March 1939 by the Special Areas (Amendment) Act, 1937, which became law on 6th May,&apos;1937. This last named Act not only provided for the continuance of existing powers&apos;but conferred additional powers including:  la) Power of Commissioner to let factories; (6) Financial assistance by way of contributions towards payments in respect of rent, rates or income tax for new undertakings in the Special Areas;(c) Contribution by the Commissioner to road and drainage expenses irf the Special Areas;(d) Financial assistance by the Treasury for provision of factories in certain other areas; and(e) Provision by the Treasury of financial assistance to certain new undertakings in Special and other Areas.In addition to the powers conferred directly on the Commissioner under the Special Areas Acts to assist industrial development in the Areas, provision was included in the Finance Act, 1937 whereby the Treasury may remit in whole or part the tax known as the National Defence Contribution in cases where the Commissioner certifies that it is expedient that relief from the tax should be given.10. For the greater part of the period during which I was Com-missioner, therefore, my efforts were directed towards consolidating and extending the work done by my predecessor. Latterly, much preparatory work was done in anticipation of the passing into law of the most recent Act and although the period that has since elapsed has been short, amounting to about three months, I was able to make appreciable progress in the exercise of my new functions. Particulars of what has been done in various directions over a wide field of activity are given in the appropriate Sections which follow.Summary of Schemes approved and under consideration11. Details of the assistance offered in respect of all schemes approved up to 31st July, 1937 are given in Appendix I. The authorised commitments amounted to  2,488,584, involving a total expenditure of  5,169,497, the latter figure being exclusive of the capital of new undertakings in the Special Areas to whom I have offered inducements. Particulars of schemes under consideration are given in Appendix II.SECTION (2)  POPULATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT Population12. At the 1931 Census, the total population of Scotland was 4,842,980 while that of the Special Areas was 1,146,459, roughly aA 4
quarter of the whole. It is unfortunately not possible to give an estimate of the population in respect of parishes subsequent to 1931, but estimates for later dates are available for Scotland as a whole, and those parts of the Special Areas composed of the Counties of Dun-barton and Renfrew and the County of Lanark (excluding Glasgow). The figures are given in Appendix III. It is to be noted that in each area there has been an increase in the total population between 1931 and 1936. The average percentage increase in population between 1931 and mid 1936 in the three Counties taken together (3-9 per cent.) is much greater than that for Scotland as a whole (2-5 per cent). The percentage increases for Dunbartonshire and Renfrew-shire are respectively about double and treble the increase for Scot-land, but the County of Lanark (excluding Glasgow) is slightly below the average for the whole country, in spite of a higher natural rate of increase in Lanark.13. The birth and death rates, and the natural increases in popula-tion arising from the excess of births over deaths for the same areas, are given in Appendix IV. The percentage increases between 1931 and mid 1936 in the Counties of Dunbarton and Renfrew approxim-ate fairly closely to that for Scotland as a whole but the increase in Lanarkshire (excluding Glasgow) is over 60 per cent, higher than the increase for the whole country. This increase is due in the main to -the higher birth rate in Lanarkshire.14, A comparison between (a) the natural, and (b) the actual estimated increases in population, is given in Appendix V. The difference between these two sets of figures represents the net influx to, or outflow from, the Counties and the whole country. For Scotland as a whole, the actual increase in population exceeded the natural increase by 2,854; that is to say, between 1931 and 1936 there was on balance a net migration into Scotland. Although there has been a regular movement of a few thousands a year, including persons transferred under the Ministry of Labour&apos;s Industrial Transference Scheme (see paragraph 44), from Scotland south of the Border, this reduction has been rather more than counterbalanced by the return of emigrants from overseas. Both Dunbartonshire and Renfrewshire show increases in actual population above the natural increase, but this may be due not so much to a net migration to Scotland as to the tendency, during the past few years, of large numbers of people to remove outwards from Glasgow into these County areas. As regards Lanarkshire, on the other hand, there has been a net outflow of over 13,000 people in the five years.15. The brief outline given above is necessarily incomplete in the absence of recent figures for the parishes in the Special Areas, but it is sufficient to indicate the general trend of population, covering as it does over 80 per cent, of the population of the Areas. Apart from the special reasons for the exceptionally high increases in the counties of Dunbarton and Renfrew, it is significant that the population in the Scottish Special Areas is increasing, whereas that of the Special Areas of England and Wales shows a continuous decline.
Unemployment (General)16. On 17th December, 1934, a few days before the appointment of the first Commissioner for Special Areas, there was a total of 94,998 unemployed in the Scottish Special Areas, made up as follows : Men Boys Women Girls77,556 &quot;4,713 9,053 3,676By 21st June, 1937, the most recent date covering a normal period for which figures are available, the number of unemployed had dropped by 36,680, or 38-6 per cent, to 58,318, as follows :  Men Boys Women Girls45,794 2,267 7,558 2,699A more detailed analysis of the position on various dates is given in Appendices VI and VII. During the same period, the number of unemployed for Scotland as a whole, fell by 118,645 from 333,611 to 214,966, a decrease of 35-6 per cent, compared with 38-6 per cent, for the Special Areas, i.e., the proportionate fall in unemployment in the Special Areas has been slightly greater than that for the whole country.17. The following table gives a comparison of the number of unemployed at the two dates in the six main industries which, on 17th December, 1934, accounted for about 43 per cent, of the whole of the unemployed : 	Number unemployed.		Decrease.	Industry.	17th Dec, 1934	21st June, 1937	Number	Per-centageBuilding Shipbuilding General Engineering . . Marine Engineering . . Iron and Steel Coal Mining	4,946 10,075 4,137 2,091 4,732 14,622	2,479 4,425 1,432 634 2,223 8,631	2,467 5,650 2,705 1,457 2,509 5,991	50 56 65 70 53 41Total	40,603	19,824	20,779	51The reduction in unemployment in each of these industries is proportionately greater than that for the Special Areas taken as a whole. The building figure does not give a true measure of the decrease, since a midsummer is compared with a midwinter figure, but in the other cases the explanation is doubtless that these&quot; industries were the most severely hit by the depression and, on a&apos; revival of trade, would tend to show a greater proportionate im-; provement in employment than the other industries where, generally/
the improvement would lag in point of time behind that of the basic industries.18. Another noticeable feature is a decrease between the two dates of 1 per cent, and 2-1 per cent, respectively in the number of insured Men and Women, due no doubt to transference, deaths and cessation of insurability on account of age and other reasons. The number of insured Boys and Girls aged&quot; 16 and 17, on the other hand, shows an increase of 5,360, which exceeds by 1,600 the decrease in the numbers of insured Men and Women.&quot; On the whole, therefore, the age level of the insured population has tended to fall.19. Between December, 1934 and June, 1937, there was a net increase of 50 factories and extensions opened in Scotland as a whole, of; which 16 were in the Special Areas. This is a further indication that industry in the Special Areas is sharing in the general recovery and is in process of regaining some of its former prosperity.Men20. The improvement which has taken place during the last two or three years has been particularly noticeable in the reduction of the number of unemployed men, by 31,762 from 77,556 to 45,794, as a natural consequence of the increased activity of the basic heavy industries, Iron and Steel, Shipbuilding and Engineering and Coal Mining, on which the Areas depend to so large an extent. It is gratifying to record, not only so high a proportionate reduction in the total number of unemployed, already referred to in para-graph 16, but the fact that the number of men unemployed, and the number of men continuously unemployed for one year or more, were reduced by 41-0 per cent, and 39*1 per cent, respectively, indicating that even those with prolonged experience of unemploy-ment shared, in close proportion, the general improvement in the employment situation.21. A special analysis was undertaken by the Ministry of Labour, of men, aged 18 to 64 years, with no recorded employment during the previous three months, who may be regarded as con-stituting the major portion of the unemployment problem, on the registers of Local Offices within the Special Areas as at 15th March, 1937.22. The test showed that the total number of unemployed men was 51,174, of whom 28,461 or 56 per cent, had had no work for at least three months. Of the 28,461, there were 5,990 over 55 years of age, and 5,367 between 45 and 55, i.e., over 11,000 men who for practical purposes are outside the field of transference. On the other hand there were 3,910 men under 25 years, i.e., 13-7 per cent, which I am informed was a considerably higher proportion than for the Special Areas in England and Wales. The twenty-year age group from 25 to 45, probably constituting the range of highest employability, contained 13,194 men.
23. The Coal Mining industry accounted for 5,892 men who had been continuously unemployed for three months or more, or 21 per cent, of all such men in the areas. The importance of coal mining as a factor in the situation is even greater than the figures indicate, owing to the numerous instances where men who would regard themselves as coal miners, and would normally look to that industry for their livelihood, have after long unemployment secured a spell of work in another industry and have been reclassified to that industry. 2,844, or nearly one-half, were aged 45 and over, and of these 1,912 were classified as unskilled. At the other end of the age scale, there were 466 men under 25 years of age, mostly unskilled.24. Shipbuilding accounted for 2,575 persons with three months or more continuous unemployment. An outstanding feature of the position as regards this industry was the high proportion of men in the lower age groups, there being 365 between 18 and 25, and 667 between 25 and 35; these two groups together formed 40 per cent, of the whole.25. More detailed statistical information regarding this analysis is given in Appendix VIII.26. While all industries have shared in the improvement in the employment position, there are still over eight thousand regis-tered as unemployed in coal mining. Nevertheless I, like my predecessor, have received representations about difficulties ex-ineperienced in securing the services of skilled miners. In an endeavour to reconcile these apparently conflicting statements I have had correspondence with the Ministry of Labour. I understand that the same question had arisen in England and Wales and that the matter has been under review in the Ministry for some time. The position naturally varies from place to place according to the demand for workpeople, the numbers and suitability of the available workpeople, and the willingness of the collieries to consider ex-miners who have been unemployed for some time and who, while they might not be fully efficient at first, might well become useful workpeople after an initial period. The Employment Exchanges are generally in close touch with the colliery managements and are doing everything possible to assist them. In some districts, the Local Employment Committees have appointed special inter-viewing panels of representatives of the local collieries and the local Miners&apos; Lodges to interview all the unemployed workpeople registered for employment in the industry locally and assist the Exchange Manager in assessing their suitability for re-employment in the industry, in their old grades or in other work. Arrangements on these lines for the examination of the local position by the Exchange Manager in consultation with the two sides of the in-dustry locally are, I think, useful and I hope that they will be adopted in many districts.      . -
27. Another problem which has caused me considerable-concern is what is the extent, if any, of the real &quot; hard core &quot; of unemployment, that is to say, the numbers on the register who can no longer be regarded as having a reasonable prospect of a return to employment either in the occupations in which they are registered or otherwise. This problem is one which can only be ascertained by a complete analysis of the live register and until this is done it is difficult to express views or suggest remedies. As indicated in paragraphs 21  24 the Ministry of Labour have made certain tests which throw some light on this problem, but I should strongly welcome a complete enquiry. The view &quot;is widely held that this final unemployment question is no longer an economic problem but a social one of finding useful and attractive activity for persons incapable of finding a livelihood in the ordinary spheres of employment. A matter of such importance, in my opinion, requires to be faced boldly upon the basis of carefully ascertained facts.Women28. The total number of women unemployed on 21st June, 1937 was 7,558 compared with 9,053 on 17th December, 1934, a decrease of 1,495 or 16-5 per cent.29. At my request the Ministry of Labour undertook a test as at 21st September, 1936, of the \vomen&apos;s register to give some informa-tion regarding the problem of women&apos;s unemployment.   The test covered 4,922 or 60 per cent, of the total women&apos;s live register for the whole of the Special Areas.   By far the largest percentage of unem-ployment was found to be amongst the distributive trades which accounted for about 21 per cent, of the total, while the.next highest was hotel service which accounted for about 10 per cent. These trades are peculiarly subject to seasonal fluctuation. For instance, at the beginning of 1936, the number of women unem-ployed was 9,434, but by August the figure had fallen to 7,695 but rose again to 9,162 in March 1937.   I have given due weight to the problem of women&apos;s unemployment in my consideration of schemes for the social and economic improvement of the Special Areas, but in my view the question is part of the national problem which can be dealt with more comprehensively by the Ministry of Labour in the exercise of its normal functions.   It seems clear that, in the absence of a further general improvement in the employment situation, the main outlet for unemployed women is found in domestic service. I refer further to this subject in paragraph 42.J\ veniles30. The total number of juveniles unemployed on 21st June, 1937 : was 4,966, consisting of 2,267 boys and 2,699 girls.   Compared with 17th December, 1934 the number of Boys unemployed shows a

The Ministry of Labour provide in Scotland facilities for training unemployed men for employment at two types of Centre, namely, Government Training Centres and Instructional Centres.Government Training and Instructional Centres34. Government Training Centres provide about six months&apos; training in skilled occupations for younger men in the Special Areasdecrease of 2,446 or 51 -9 per cent., while Girls show a decrease of 977 or 26-6 per cent.31. As in the case of adults, juvenile unemployment varies con-siderably as between one area and another, but statistics relating to juveniles do not convey quite the same broad outline of the position. The registers of unemployed juveniles show considerable increases at the end of the school-leaving periods of which there are from two to five per annum according to the district.   In a number of areas school-leayers find little difficulty in getting work but their absorption is often the accompaniment of dismissal of older boys and girls, par-ticularly in the messenger class of the distributive trades.   The effect is to slow down any tendency for the registers to decline at the same rate as absorption, and to leave in the older age groups a number who have had some work but have lost it through no fault of their own.   The large majority of the boys and girls are fit for immediate employment; many have had work and are not likely to be unemployed very long, including those who move from job to job in an effort to find and settle down into the most suitable work.   In the main, the number of unemployed boys and girls is not a solid block of unemployment but is composed of a much larger number of young people who, so to speak, flow through the unemployment pool at varying speeds.   The measures which have been initiated to improve the employment situation should react favourably on the employment of juveniles while, as noted in paragraphs 145, 165 and 166,1 have given special assistance to a number of organisations who are concerned with the welfare of the young to stimulate the provision of recreative and occupational facilities.32. I have had discussions with a number of those specially interested in the juvenile problem in the West of Scotland as to the desirability of issuing an appeal to employers to take on additional juveniles. I have indicated that the issue of such an appeal by the Chamber of Commerce of Glasgow, or other repre-sentative body, would have my cordial support in general and, in particular, on behalf of the unemployed juveniles of the Special Areas.
and certain other areas who are likely ultimately to become skilled workers.35. There is one Government Training Centre in Scotland at Springburn, Glasgow. It provides courses of training for about 200 men at a time in various trades, including several branches of engineering and turns out between 400 and 500 trained men each year. They come mainly from the districts round Glasgow where unemployment is heavy, and live at home during their training, travelling daily to the Centre. I understand that there has never been any dearth of applicants for this Centre but it has been the policy of the Ministry of Labour only to train as many men as they could expect to find employment for at the end of the course of training and for that reason it has not been found possible to increase.-the size of the Glasgow Centre. During the past twelve months recruits from the Scottish Special Areas and certain other areas of heavy unemployment in Scotland have totalled about 2,500, and something like 75 per cent, were allocated to English Centres.36. The experience of the Ministry is, I am informed, that the most suitable locations for Government Training Centres are in comparatively prosperous areas since these afford the best chance of placing the men in employment after training. It is never easy to persuade an employer to take a man from a distance, where as there is little or no difficulty if the centre is situated fairly close to a prospective employees works, so that he can if necessary visit and see the men in training. For these reasons, most of these Centres are in or near London, and in places such as Birmingham, Bristol and Leicester. I am assured that the Ministry&apos;s experience shows that, in the main, Scotsmen are by no means unwilling to take a course of training, and subsequently employment, in England.37. Instructional Centres are residential centres where a shorter course of 12 weeks is given with the object of restoring physical fitness and manual dexterity for men who have been out of work for some time but are not likely to qualify for skilled employment. There are four Instructional Centres in Scotland three in Argyll-shire at Glenbranter (with an attached Summer Camp at Balla-meanoch) Glenfinart and Knapdale, and one at Glentress, near Peebles. The two latter were opened during my term of office as Commissioner. There are also other Instructional Centres on the borders of England and Scotland which are available for Scotsmen so far as necessary. The facilities for &quot; reconditioning &quot; unemployed men from the Scottish Special Areas appear therefore to be adequate.38. From discussions I have had with the Ministry I understand that they would be prepared to extend the training facilities provided for the Scottish Special Areas subject to the consideration that vocational training as distinct from re-conditioning should be strictly related to the prospect of getting the men into employment
after training. While it seems that the existing facilities for training in Scotland are adequate for present demands, statistics indicate that something like 25 per cent, of the younger men up to 24 years of age are unwilling to undergo a course of training. This I regard as a matter for serious regret, and as I am anxious that no opportunity of usefully extending the present training facilities should be overlooked, standing arrangements have been made for the Commissioners office to keep in close touch with the Ministry on this point.Local Centres39. In this connection my attention has been particularly drawn to the establishment by the Ministry of a number of Local Training Centres in the Special Areas in England and Wales at which unemployed men can attend daily whilst still living at home. The primary object of these Local Centres is to serve as preliminary training centres from which men can after a few weeks be drafted to a Government Training Centre or an Instructional Centre according to their aptitudes. In particular they receive men who are not quite up to the physical standards required at a Training Centre or an Instructional Centre and provide them with minor medical, dental or optical treatment as necessary, and they give preliminary training to men who need it to enable them to reach the standard required for admission to Government Training centres for training in a skilled occupation. They also stimulate the desire for training amongst men who are not in the first instance willing to take the step of going away from home for a full course of training. Up to the present the majority of men in Scotland have shown such readiness to volunteer for training, both at the Training Centres and the Instructional Centres, that the Ministry have not thought it necessary to provide a Local Centre in Scotland with the object of stimulating recruitment to the other centres.40. The Local Training Centres in England and Wales will also aim at producing men for repetitive or manipulative work requiring little skill in so far as there is a demand for such labour in developing industries in the Special Areas. The Local Centres in this connection aim at producing &quot; factory sense &quot; and accustoming the men to factory discipline and routine.41. It seems to me that this type of Centre constitutes an important rung in the ladder leading to satisfactory industrial employment, particularly for men who, in their early years, have been denied the opportunity of instruction as apprentices and learners. I anticipate that the special effort which is now being made to attract industries to the Special Areas will, in some cases, lead to a demand for labour with qualifications of a type which these Centres aim at producing. - The material is there in large numbers in the Areas and the type of instruction given should be of consider-able advantage in connection with the establishment of new under-
takings. I am informed that the Ministry will be willing to consider the establishment of further Local Centres if it becomes clear that developing industries in the Areas require labour of the type which these Centres can produce, and I hope that the position will be carefully watched.Women and Girls42. The Central Committee on Women&apos;s Training and Employ-ment (Scottish Committee) in co-operation with the Ministry of Labour, is responsible for a scheme of training women and girls to enable them to qualify for posts in resident domestic service. In Scotland there is one residential centre at Lenzie, Lanarkshire and three non-residential centres at Glasgow, Coatbridge and Dunferm-line. Training is normally for a period of about three months, the principal subjects taught being cookery, laundry, general house-wifery and needlework. All trainees who complete their course successfully are assured of a good post, all vacancies notified being investigated and every care taken to place the right trainee in the right post. It is therefore a matter for concern that a greater number of unemployed women do not take advantage of these admirable facilities, in view of the large unsatisfied demand in this honourable and useful occupation.Juveniles43. Junior Instruction Centres are conducted by Local Educa-tion Authorities on behalf of the Ministry of Labour, instruction being given to all unemployed under the age of eighteen. The instruction is not of a vocational nature but aims at keeping boys and girls fit in body, active in mind, and adaptable to any type of employment.Industrial Transference44. 1 regard it as of great importance that as many as possible of the unemployed persons in the Special Areas should secure employment in their home districts and my efforts as Commissioner, particularly in the attraction of new industries to the Special Areas, have been directed towards achieving this end. Nevertheless, it is clear that these efforts need to be supplemented by measures to assist the more mobile elements of the population to take up suitable openings available in other districts. One of these measures is the Ministry of Labour&apos;s scheme of Industrial Transference, under which unemployed workpeople in the depressed areas are put in touch with vacancies in other districts through the machinery of the Employ-ment Exchange system, and receive assistance with the expenses of removal, etc. To the extent that transference is necessary, I welcome and support the Ministry&apos;s scheme which seeks to ensure that those who transfer go to the places where they will have the
best prospects. Between August, 1935 and May, 1937, the latest date for which figures have been supplied, 4,199 adults (3,294 men and 905 women) were transferred from the Special Areas in Scotland, 2,463 men and 117 women being transferred to England, and 831 men and 788 women being transferred to non-depressed areas in Scotland. Of the man transferred, 712 were from Training Centres. Between January, 1935 and July, 1937, 1,255 Juveniles (736 boys and 519 girls) were also transferred, of whom 80 boys and 437 girls proceeded to non-depressed areas in Scotland and 656 boys and 82 girls to England. The number of persons both adult and juvenile thus transferred may seem small in relation to the total unemployed but they nevertheless represent, in my opinion, a substantial contribution towards the solution of the problem of unemployment in the Special Areas, and one capable of further development.Part IISUCTION (1)  INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENTScottish Development Council45. The late Commissioner had established close relations with the Scottish Development Council with the object of promoting the industrial development of the Scottish Special Areas. Grants from the Special Areas Fund estimated at  40,500 have been allocated to the Council to enable them to carry out a sustained publicity campaign designed mainly to demonstrate the industrial potentialities-tialities and other amenities of the Areas, and to advertise the wide range of manufactures produced. The publicity has taken several forms, including a series of displays of commercial products held in a Special Scottish Section at British Industries House, London, between July, 1936 and April, 1937 when the Section was closed down owing to the premises being no longer available. I have provided assistance towards an Information Bureau and Contacts Office in the Strand, London, which has already attracted considerable attention and where displays of Special Areas products will be arranged.46. Other forms of publicity have included : -(a) Erection of a house, built and furnished as far as possible of Special Areas materials, at the Housing and Health Exhibition in Glasgow. I performed the formal opening ceremony of this house, which attracted very considerable attention throughout the period of the Exhibition, and demonstrated very effectively the building material resources and the craftsmanship of the Areas.(b) Special Areas Stands at British Industries - Fair, and the &quot; Daily Mail &quot; Ideal Homes Exhibition.      .... .   . :
(c) A Special Areas Supplement of the CounciTs Quarterly Magazine &quot; Scotland &quot; dealing with various important trades carried on in the Special Areas or with the industrial charac-teristics of selected districts in the Areas.(d) Special poster displays in London.47. The resultant effect of these various activities is difficult to assess, but I am satisfied that the cumulative effect has been con-siderable and I feel that this publicity, aiming to attract industry to the Special Areas, has been productive.48. The Council also set up an Industrial Contacts and Industrial Information Department in their office at Glasgow, where a register of vacant factory sites in the Special Areas is maintained. This Department has been useful to firms contemplating starting a new business and it is now co-operating with the Industrial Officers in the work of attracting new industries to the Special Areas.Scottish Economic Committee49. The Economic Committee of the Scottish Development Council was formed in March, 1936 by the Council in consultation with the late Secretary of State for Scotland following a suggestion made by my predecessor. The members are representative of Scottish industry, finance, transport, travel and labour.Sir James Lithgow, Bt., the first chairman, has since been obliged, owing to his many business engagements, to resign the Chairmanship of the Committee, but his deep interest in the work of the Committee and the time and attention which he devoted to its problems were of the greatest value in the initial period of enquiry. Sir Steven Bilsland, Bt., succeeded as Chairman and is giving a strong lead to the Committee&apos;s activities. Sir William Goodchild acts as Secretary General of this Committee.50. The general function of the Committee is the examination of the possibilities of improving economic conditions in Scotland, including questions affecting the extension of existing, or the creation of new, industries, and it suggests measures for economic development that might usefully be taken through the Scottish Development Council. The activities of the Committee are directed towards the economic development of Scotland as a whole, but particular attention has been given to the problems of the Special Areas. I regard these activities as a helpful contribution towards the re-establishment of prosperity in the Areas and I have therefore provided financial assistance towards the expenses in so far as the work relates to the Areas.51. The Committee has considered a number of questions on the economic and industrial conditions in the Special Areas and was actively concerned in the preliminary investigations and negotiations for the estabhshinent of an Industrial Estate at North Hillington,
Renfrewshire, to which reference is made in paragraphs 52 to 55. An account of the work during the first year of existence was given in the &quot; Report by the Economic Committee of the Scottish Develop-ment Council 1936-1937 &quot; published in June, 1937.Scottish Industrial Estate52. In the industrial development of Great Britain in post-war years the emphasis has been on the lighter industries which have been attracted to the South and Midlands of England rather than to Scotland. It has frequently been contended that this trend has been due to the presence in the South of a large consuming population, but the success of Industrial Estates such as Slough or VVelwyn Garden City suggests that a more important factor may have been the provision of suitable factories available on lease which have obviated for new undertakings the difficulties and heavy initial expenditure involved in factory construction or purchase. The factories in the Special Areas of Scotland which are empty are, generally speaking, old buildings built to take heavy machinery driven by steam power, and not easily adapted to modern factory methods. Such sub-stantial buildings are not needed for the production of light articles when electricity, oil or gas is used for power, and the layout is frequently inconvenient.53. Light industries are to a considerable extent carried on by small firms who wish to use their money as working capital and who are not prepared to sink their resources in the purchase or renting of large unsuitable buildings which require expensive adaptations. They normally prefer to lease factories ready equipped with light, heating and power, on estates where roads and railway sidings are laid out and sewerage and drainage services provided, and the relatively small development of the lighter industries in Scotland has been regarded both by my predecessor and myself as in some measure attributable to the lack of provision of suitable factories. Scotland&apos;s urgent need for such light industries led my predecessor to suggest the possibility of a scheme for the provision of an Industrial Estate in the Special Areas. Particular reference was also made to this subject by the late Secretary of State at the inaugural meeting of the Scottish Economic Committee, and the task of investigating the suggestion was sub-sequently undertaken at the request of the late Commissioner by that Committee. A Sub-Committee for the purpose was appointed, and after exhaustive preliminary investigations the Sub-Committee recommended the establishment of an Estate on a site at North Hillington, near Renfrew Aerodrome. I accepted this recommenda-tion and made arrangements for the formation of a Company to enter into definite undertakings to acquire the site, extending to about 320 acres, and to proceed with the formation of a scheme for its development. The Company, called the &quot; Scottish Industrial Estates Limited,&quot; is one limited by guarantee and not having a share
capital. The Memorandum and Articles of Association have been so drawn as to establish the Company on a non-profit making basis. The necessary funds to enable the Company to develop the Estate come from the Special Areas Fund. I am indebted to the following gentlemen who have agreed to act as Directors of the Company :  Sir Steven Bilsland, Bt., M.C. (Chairman), William Gallacher, Esq., J.P., Sir William Goodchild, C.M.G., A. C. Murray, Esq., M.C., R. G. Simpson, Esq., C.A. (appointed as a Government Director), and Colonel Hugh Spens, D.S.O. The registered offices of the Company are at 41 St. Vincent Place, Glasgow, C.l.54. Negotiations for the acquisition of the site have been com-pleted and the Company has recently submitted to me a scheme for the development of the initial section of the Estate, which includes the provision of single-storey factories of standard design, together with such services as light, power, heating, water, roads, railway sidings, sewerage, etc. In general the factories will be offered on lease, but, in addition, sites on the estate will be available to industrialists who may wish to erect factories of their own design whilst taking advantage of the various services which the Estate will offer.55. The Company is arranging to proceed as quickly as possible with the development of the first-25 acres and has already com-pleted agreements for renting factories in thirteen cases, while another seventy proposals are under discussion. The remainder of the Estate will be developed during the next few years according to the demand for sites or factories, and I am confidently hoping that the establishment of this Estate will prove to be one of the outstanding projects initiated under the Special Areas Acts to bring back prosperity to the West of Scotland.General56. A number of Associations, Local Authorities, firms and individuals approached me from time to time asking that in particular cases I should make representations to Government Departments on various matters affecting their interests. In any cases in which it appeared that I might take any useful action I made representations in the appropriate quarter, and invariably met with sympathetic consideration. In some cases I was able to ensure that Special Areas firms had an opportunity of tendering for contracts, and in others I was able to have adjustments made to the specifications of Contracting Departments which increased the range of Special Areas products which could be used. The Economic Committee has also maintained touch with the Government Departments concerned and has done much useful work in this respect.
Gas Supplies in the West of Scotland57. The Board of Trade set up, at my predecessors suggestion, a Departmental Committee to consider the possibility of co-ordinating the manufacture and distribution of gas in the West of Scotland, with particular reference to the problem of the utilisation of surplus coke-oven gas produced as a by-product by iron works in this area. This Committee reported in October, 1936. The Com-mittee had before it the Report prepared for my predecessor by Dr. Birkett Wylam and also took other evidence from a wide variety of interests. The majority reported that they had come to the conclusion that a scheme for co-ordinating supplies in any con-siderable area in the West of Scotland is not practicable at the present time and recommended that- (a) Glasgow Corporation should enter into negotiations with a view to the purchase of the total quantity of coke-oven gas available or in prospect (18J million cu. ft. per day) less quantities proposed to be purchased by the Coatbridge Gas Company and the Airdrie Town Council.(b) Airdrie Town Council should enter into an Agreement with the Coatbridge Gas Company on lines indicated to purchase all their requirements of gas by means of a bulk supply of coke-oven gas proposed to be available to the Company from Messrs. Baird &amp; Co., Ltd., Coatbridge.(c) Coatbridge Gas Company, in addition to supplying gas to Airdrie Town Council, should investigate the possibility of (1) purchasing supplies of coke-oven gas to meet their present load, and (2) creating a new industrial load at certain works indicated, to be met by the purchase and sale of coke-oven gas.58. I concur in these recommendations and am supported in my view by the Import Duties Advisory Committee on the Present Position and Future Development of the Iron and Steel Industry, who in a Report, dated 21st June, 1937, point out that a contributory cause of delay in the development of both coke-oven and blast-furnace equipment has been the difficulty of finding an outlet for the surplus coke-oven and blast-furnace gases, and say : -&quot; This particular problem has been exhaustively examined by the Departmental Committee on Gas Supplies in the West of Scotland, and we desire to record our complete concurrence in the conclusions of that Committee so far as they are relevant to the subject-matter of our own Inquiry. It is in our opinion highly desirable for the economic well-being of the West .of Scotland and for the maintenance and enlargement of an efficient iron and steel industry there that the difficulty of finding an outlet for the much enlarged supplies of coke-oven gas should be overcome without further
delay; and we share the hope of the Departmental Committee that with goodwill and co-operation between all the parties concerned this will be done.&quot;59. I have made use of every suitable opportunity of referring publicly to the matter and of urging the importance to the Special Areas of this development. My interest in the matter is the retention-tion in Scotland of as much of the pig-iron industry as possible, and the increase, so far as possible, of the number of men employed in that industry. Moreover, I have been interested from the point of view of the attractiveness of the Special Areas in the matter of cheaper gas for industrial purposes, and this subject has therefore been of immediate and long-dated interest to me in my work as Commissioner. I trust that it may yet be found possible to devise a satisfactory scheme for the utilisation of industrial gases by municipalities.Coal Exploratory Bore Hamilton District60. It was suggested to me that I should provide assistance towards the cost of further exploratory boring to ascertain if coal exists in workable quantities in the Lanarkshire coalfield at greater, depths than those at which it is being worked at present. After consultation with the Mines Department I reached the conclusion that I could not assist such an enterprise, the two main reasons for this decision being (a) that there is plenty of coal in the country at less depth to meet all anticipated requirements for a very lengthy period;(b) that deep boring is being discouraged by the Mines Department because working in deep pits is said to be unsatisfactory from the health point of view.Proposed Scheme lor the Dewatering of Coal Mines in North-WestLanarkshire61. Frequent representations were made to the late Commissioner as to the desirability of promoting a scheme for the dewatering of the flooded coal area in the North West of Lanarkshire, extending from Glasgow and Rutherglen on the West to Coatbridge on the East, and towards the end of 1935, he offered a Grant to the Scottish Development Council to meet the cost of a comprehensive expert survey of the practicability of. such a scheme. This survey was carried out for the Council by two well-known West of Scotland Mining Engineers, and their Report was submitted to me in December, 1936.62. The Report states that the coal reserves in this area, which have become waterlogged by the abandonment of uneconomic collieries and the cessation of pumping during the past few years,
is estimated to amount to 25,000,000 tons, but that much of this coal occurs in patches and is of doubtful quality. It is shown that any general resumption of coal production would involve such heavy overhead charges for pumping, etc., as to remove any possibility of economic working and might also result in considerable surface damage. The conclusion is reached that special action to dewater the drowned measures with a view to coal production could not be justified while large coal reserves are available, both in other parts of the Lanarkshire Field and of the country.63. The situation has also been examined in connection with the questions of possible menace from the present water to working collieries in adjacent areas, and of the possible utilisation of under-ground water for surface use, as an addition or alternative to present methods of supply. I was informed by my advisory engineers that the flooded area is virtually sealed by a number of impervious faults which prevent the free flow of water from one area to another and that the total expense involved in installing pumping machinery and in providing purification and storage facilities, together with pipe-lines, precludes any likelihood of a supply at rates comparing favour-ably with those offered by existing supplies, which, generaUy, appear to be adequate.64. These enquiries were carried out with the assistance and advice of a number of authorities, and I reached the general con-clusion that, beyond such steps as are within the province of the industry itself in the normal course, no special action to deal with these matters could be justified. Owing to the highly --technical nature of the report and the expense which would have been involved in reproducing the relevant maps and plans, the Report of the Survey was not published. Instead, I issued a statement to the Press setting out the conclusions reached and a copy of the Report, together with relevant plans, have been made available for perusal by interested parties at the office of the Scottish Development Council in Glasgow.Oil from Coal Committee.  The Cancel Enquiry Sub-Committee65. The &quot; Oil from Coal &quot; Committee of the Scottish Development Council appointed a Sub-Committee in March, 1935, to study and report on the resources, nature and possibilities of the utilisation of cannel coal and kindred minerals for the production of oil, and at the request of the Council, my predecessor made a grant to enable two qualified investigators to carry out the examination of the resources of these minerals within the Special Areas. The work was begun under the direction and supervision of the late Prof. Henry Briggs of Edinburgh University, and after his death Prof. W. M. Cumming, Professor of Technical Chemistry at the Royal Technical College, Glasgow, and Chairman of the Cannel Enquiry Sub-Committee carried on the work with the assistance of Dr. Hugh B- Nisbet,
Lecturer in Chemistry at Heriot-Watt College, Edinburgh, and Honorary Secretary of the Sub-Committee. Assistance in the investigation has been given by Scottish Oils, Ltd. I have received monthly reports of the work done by the investigators.66. In December, 1936, the Scottish Development Council published their Report on this subject under the title of the &quot; Second Report of the &apos; Oil from Coal&apos; Committee.&quot; This embraced the detailed findings of the sub-Committee, and included covering recommendations by the parent Committee. The sub-Committee reported that the principal reserves of cannel in Scotland existed in Fife and the Lothians, and, to illustrate the progress which has been made recently in the utilisation of cannels they referred to the work of Messrs. Jamieson (Edinburgh Gas Works Manager) and King (Fuel Research Board) carried out at the Granton Gas Works of the Edinburgh Corporation.The sub-Committee made the following recommendations : (a) That the search for such minerals should be continued, to prove reserves and trace new sources of cannel.(b) That the chemical tests of the cannels and the oils obtained by the distillation of these should be continued.(c) That where the laboratory tests prove promising these should be extended to large scale tests.(d) That during the prosecution of the above tests efforts should be made to encourage the use of suitable cannels by by the Gas Industry.(e) That as soon as may be the economic possibilities of the carbonisation of cannel and the treatment of its primary products by all suitable processes should be considered and schemes for such plants drawn up.67. The Oil from Coal Committee endorsed the recommendations of the Sub-Committee and expressed the following views : (a) The Cannel problem cannot be divorced from the bigger question of the utilisation of coal as a source of home-produced oil.     -(b) Low temperature carbonisation cannot hope to add materially to our requirements of oil, because its success necessarily depends on the marketing of a product which must inevitably displace coal.(c) The Committee agreed with the view expressed by the Commissioner for the Special Areas (England and Wales) published in his Report of November, 1936, that &quot; particular attention should be paid to processes which produce no fuel to displace ordinary coal.&quot;(d) The investigation should apply to coal as well as to - &apos; cannel in so far as complete conversion to oil is concerned.-
The Committee also made the following recommendation :-&quot; That the best method of carrying its suggestions into effect and of providing the necessary finance for future developments should be the subject of a conference of (I) The Commissioner for the Special Areas in Scotland.(II) Representatives of the Oil from Coal Committee, the Coalmasters of Scotland, the Gas Industry, the Ministry for the Co-ordination of National Defence, the Mines Depart-ment, the Fuel Research Board and H.M. Geological Survey.&quot;68. I have considered the Report and have discussed it with the Mines Department, who, while pointing out that the Report in its references to reserves of cannel makes it clear that in many cases cannel occurs associated with considerable quantities of coal, often of inferior quality, and ironstone, which may make working of the cannel more costly and its preparation more difficult, have undertaken to examine the position further. Meanwhile the question of convening a conference as suggested was deferred.69. Should the conclusion be reached that there are possibilities of commercial exploitation on a scale sufficiently large to justify careful&apos; consideration by private enterprise, and while the Com-missioners interest is only an indirect one, since the main reserves are outwith the Special Areas, it seems to me that a conference on the lines of that suggested by the Oil from Coal Committee would be useful. The possibility is clearly one of importance to Scotland as a whole.70. On the general Oil from Coal question I have noted that a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence has been appointed, and I assume that this Committee will examine in due course the Reports of the Oil from Coal Committee, and I have considered further action on my part at the present stage unneces-sary. I content myself with the observation that with unemploy-ment in the coal industry continuing to present the most intractable problem in the Areas it is of paramount importance that no oppor-tunity should be lost of establishing in the Scottish Special Areas any carbonisation or similar enterprise which will hold out a reasonable prospect of ultimate economic development.Dredging of River Leven between its entrance to the River Clyde andDumbarton Harbour71. Early in 1936; the Board of Trustees controlling Dumbarton Harbour applied to my predecessor for assistance towards the cost of a scheme for the dredging of the River Leven. The Board Were confronted with the fact that the River Leven between its entrance to the River Clyde and Dumbarton Harbour was becoming so full of silt that it was only a question of time until ships of any considerable size would be unable to enter or leave the Leven, and in 1935 they
were advised that negotiations then in progress for the sale of the closed shipyard were likely to be abandoned as a clear passage from Dumbarton Harbour to the River Clyde was essential to the interests of the probable purchasers of the yard. They also stated that upon completion of the scheme, systematic dredging would be undertaken in future and indicated that it was proposed to deposit the silt removed from the River on adjoining low lying ground belonging to Dumbarton Burgh Council thus facilitating a scheme of land reclama-tion which the Council intended to carry out in this area.72. My predecessor was very much impressed by the case sub-mitted by the Harbour Board, and in the knowledge that the sewage purification scheme which he had assisted Dumbarton Burgh Council to undertake would result in effecting a considerable reduction in the volume of silt forming in the Leven, he decided to offer assistance to the Board of an amount equal to 80 per cent, of the verified capital cost of the works. Work on the scheme was begun on 14th July, 1936, and completed on 18th November, 1936. I am pleased to record that as a direct result of the scheme a new undertaking which will provide very considerable employment and which is to bring the materials required for its purposes to Dumbarton by ship is to be established in the derelict shipyard to which reference has already been made.Straightening of two bends in the River Clyde73. An application for assistance towards improving the navigable channel of the River Clyde by straightening two bends near Dalmuir and Erskine, at an estimated cost of  69,500 was submitted to me by the Clyde Navigation Trust. The Trust stated that owing to recent heavy financial commitments incurred in constructing the King George V Dock and to further works which they will have to under-take on the Dock at an early date, they were unable to carry out unaided the work involved in straightening the River. From the technical reports submitted and from personal enquiry I satisfied myself that the straightening of the two bends would facilitate the passage of ships on the River and that the scheme would constitute a substantial contribution to the economic development of Clydeside. I therefore intimated to the Trust that I was prepared to provide substantial assistance towards the cost of the scheme.Greenock Harbour Trust.  Princes Pier and Dry Dock74. A proposal has been made by the Greenock Harbour Trust that Princes Pier, Greenock, should be reconstructed at a cost estimated to amount to approximately  100,000. I also received an application for assistance in the improvement of the Dry Dock and harbour entrance. These proposals raise a number of difficult questions which are being explored.
Attraction of New Industries75. The Special Areas (Amendment) Act, 1937, empowers the Commissioners to let factories and provide financial assistance by means of contributions to rent, rates, and income tax, to induce persons to establish new industrial undertakings in the Special Areas.76. I arranged with Sir George Gillett, Commissioner for the Special Areas in England and Wales, for the co-ordination of this work and made arrangements which, while preserving the individual discretion of the two Commissioners, ensures that applications relating to the various Special Areas will be. considered on the basis of a common principle.77. I was very fortunate in obtaining the services of Lord Portal as Chief Industrial Adviser, in which capacity he already acted for Sir George Gillett. Lord Portal, whose interest in the Special Areas in Scotland has been freely displayed has the benefit of a Consulta-tive Committee consisting of Sir Frederick Marquis, Mr. Roberts and Mr. Frank Hodges. These Consultants represent different phases of the work, but I felt it advisable to have someone in addition who would be available to co-operate with Lord Portal as a Consultant to act in the capacity of Scottish Adviser. Accordingly in agreement with him, I invited Sir Nigel Campbell to undertake that duty and I am very pleased to have been able to secure his services. To assist these advisers, I agreed with Sir George Gillett that two Industrial Officers with business experience and technical qualifications should be jointly appointed to conduct negotiations with organisations and persons contemplating new industrial developments, to canvass for new industries on behalf of all Special Areas and to act as Executive Officers to Lord Portal and the other voluntary advisers. Their duties also involve the maintenance of close contact with the other agencies set up to assist the establish-ment of new industries in the Special Areas.78. In the application of Section 2 of the new Act I have arranged to acquire a site for the erection of a factory at Barrhead, Renfrew-shire. In addition one or two inquiries for other factories are being considered.79. I have offered assistance by way of contributions to rent, rates or income tax under Section 3 of the Act in respect of six new undertakings to be established for the manufacture of bricks, shoe polishes and dressings, drawn steel wire, and pre-cast cement blocks and non-ferrous tubes. The total capital represented by these undertakings is approximately  167,600 and it is expected that employment will be provided for about 300 additional persons.. Thirty-eight other applications are being examined. In twelve of these, consideration has reached an advanced stage and I anticipate that in those twelve cases it will be possible for my. successor to
offer assistance at an early date to enable further new undertakings, with a total capital of approximately  700,000, providing employ-ment for about 1,000 additional persons, to be established in the Special Areas.80. Another inducement for new industries to open in the Special Areas is contained in the Finance Act, 1937, which makes provision for the Commissioners to make a recommendation in respect of an undertaking set up in the Special Areas whereupon the Treasury may remit any amounts which might otherwise be payable by way of tax to the National Defence Contribution. This provision applies mainly to large industrial undertakings, and during my term of office I did not receive many applications, but it will undoubtedly provide in appropriate cases a useful addition to the inducements which the Commissioner can offer.81. I have collaborated with the Commissioner for England and Wales in the production of a brochure entitled &quot; New Fields for Industry the Special Areas and the opportunities they offer for Industrial Development.&quot; This booklet is addressed to the man who contemplates the development of a new industry or the extension of his manufacturing business. Its object is to acquaint him with certain very important advantages which are offered to him to set up in the Special Areas-advantages which arise out of the schemes of assistance to those Areas. The publication of this brochure will, I hope, provide another impetus to the establishment of further industrial undertakings in the Areas.Nuffield Trust82. In February, 1937, I had a most valuable visit from Lord Portal, Sir Nigel Campbell and Mr. B. Seebohm Rowntree, the Trustees responsible for the administration of the Nuffield Trust Fund of  2,000,000 which was provided by the unexampled generosity of Lord Nuffield to assist the development of the Special Areas. I took the opportunity of showing them something of the Scottish Special Areas and of discussing very fully with them arrangements for collaboration in our common effort to attract new industries to the Areas. I should like to record my great appreciation of the valuable assistance which is being provided in the promotion of economic development and of the benefits accruing from the co-operation of the Trustees.SECTION   (2)  PUBLIC   WORKS,   HEALTH  SERVICES   AND AMENITY SCHEMESCo-operation with Local Authorities83. Towards the end of last year, I addressed a letter to all Local Authorities in the Special Areas asking them to review con-ditions in their districts and to submit for my consideration any
proposals which they considered would facilitate the economic development and social improvement of the Areas. Many Authorities had already taken advantage of the assistance made available by the Special Areas Act to recover ground which had been lost in the field of health and public utility services, but, as two years had elapsed since the passing of the Act, I considered that a further invitation might induce Local Authorities to take stock of the position afresh and encourage them to continue their efforts in effecting essential improvements with my assistance.84. The response to the letter was gratifying and showed that, generally, Local Authorities are alive to the importance to industry and &quot;the community of up-to-date medical, sanitary and other public utility services. The applications for grant which the Local Authorities submitted to me have all related to schemes which they wished to carry out but were unable to undertake wholly out of their own financial resources. My grants towards approved schemes have, therefore, been a percentage of the capital costs involved, and while I realise that a material balance of cost has to be found by Authorities, I consider it equitable that they should make a reasonable contribution towards the cost of schemes which they sponsor, because every scheme adds to the capital assets of the community, and most, if not all, of the benefits accruing from schemes are secured to the community. I have, however, in determining the percentage figure taken into account a number of factors, including the level of rating and the additional rate to be levied if the scheme were undertaken without assistance, and I have been able to graduate my assistance in favour of those districts with the greatest local burdens.Sanitary Services Water Supply85. The comparatively small number of proposals for the improvement of the Water Supply which have been submitted for my consideration might suggest that the water supply for present needs in the Special Areas is, in general, satisfactory. As a plentiful water supply may, in the case of certain industries, be the deter-mining factor in their decision to set up their works in some special part of the Special Areas, it appears to me that local Water Authori-ties supplying such suitable areas should take a long view of develop-ment possibilities and prepare their plans now instead of waiting till enquiries for large supplies are made. The time taken to increase storage reservoirs may cause new industries to go elsewhere. That kind of development might well be considered for assistance from the Special Areas Fund. There is already evidence that important undertakings may be lost through lack of water for industrial purposes:
Stirlingshire and Falkirk Water Board86. A feature of this scheme is that while the locus of works lies wholly outside the Special Areas, most of the benefit resulting from the scheme will accrue to the parishes of Muiravonside and Slamannan, both within the Special Areas. These parishes are capable of considerable industrial expansion as they contain rich coalfields and are well situated in regard to transport both by road and by rail. For a number of years they have, however, suffered from a shortage of water which has tended to retard developments, and the scheme which has been approved for assistance will ensure an adequate supply of water to both parishes. It will link up with the water supply of the County of Lanark, thus, in fact, forming part of a regional water supply for a wide area. I have made my assistance conditional on the Board recruiting most of the labour required for the works from the Special Areas.Paisley Burgh Council Water Supply87. An application for assistance in connection with a large scheme of water supply, estimated to cost  250,000, was submitted to me recently by Paisley Burgh Council. While in course of examining the technical aspects of the proposed works, having previously assured myself of the value of the scheme to a wide industrial area, I was informed by the Burgh Council that the War Office had decided to provide considerable assistance towards the cost of the scheme in connection with the supply of water to certain War Department factories in the area of the proposed works. Section 1 (5) (ii) of the Special Areas Act debars the Commissioner from assisting schemes within the field of grants from a Government Department and I accordingly advised the Council that I was unable to assist the scheme.Sewerage and Sewage Disposal88. Like my predecessor, I attach great importance to the improvement of sewerage and sewage disposal works, and the greater part of the assistance given to Local Authorities has been in respect of these works which frequently enhance the attractiveness of an area for industry and invariably conduce to an improvement in public health. Each scheme assisted has had to pass the test of urgency on public health grounds and, accordingly, no expenditure has been incurred on works which afford merely a temporary reduction in unemployment. In a number of cases, I have made my assistance conditional on the works being carried out at an accelerated rate of progress in order to ensure that the maximum value of the works is secured at the earliest possible date.
89. On the question of sewerage and sewage disposal three points particularly impress me (a) the pollution and menace to public health caused by the discharge of untreated sewage and industrial waste into rivers;(6) the somewhat primitive systems of sewage disposal in operation in certain districts of the Special Areas;   and,(c) the almost complete absence of any cordial attempt at combination by Local Authorities.River Pollution Prevention90. The discharge of untreated sewage and industrial waste in streams and rivers constitutes a distinct menace to public health and detracts from natural amenities. I have accordingly encouraged a considerable number of Local Authorities to undertake schemes designed to deal with river pollution. The efforts which have been made with my assistance to free the River Clyde of all risk of pollution in its narrower reaches are mentioned in paragraph 98. My ex-perience prompts me to suggest that the Department of Health should be given adequate powers to deal with the question of pollution of both tidal and non-tidal rivers.Sewage disposal in industrialised villages91. The construction of sewerage and sewage disposal works in industrialised villages frequently involves heavy expenditure and the imposition of high rates. These have to be borne by the people for whose direct benefit the works are undertaken unless the County Council agree to make use of their powers under Section 33 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1929, and assist the Special Drainage District (which, as a rule, has to be formed before schemes can proceed) by contributing a part of the costs of the works from the consolidated rate for the whole County.92. Assistance has been provided to a number of Local Authorities for the purpose of carrying out drainage schemes in areas of the type mentioned in the preceding paragraph, but although many schemes have been carried out or are in progress, I feel sure that much still remains to be done before the position can be regarded as satisfactory.Co-operation among Local Authorities93. The almost complete absence of co-operation among Local Authorities has impressed me strongly in dealing with drainage proposals submitted for my consideration. Under existing laws, special drainage districts, small and large burghs, may all undertake drainage works designed to deal solely with their particular areas, and, although certain Authorities in the Special Areas appear to be
well placed in regard to. centralisation of sewage disposal by the link-ing of trunk sewers, few attempts to examine the question of possible combination appear to have been made despite the fact that, in general, the cost of sewage disposal in any schemegreatly exceeds the cost of laying the drains. This absence of combination must, I think, frequently involve Local Authorities in unnecessary expenditure apart from considerations of efficiency. In certain cases the problem of mineral subsidence may constitute a special danger in the possi-bility of serious breakdown in a large co-ordinated sewage system, but I think that there are many cases in which the risk would not be such as to render the general proposition undesirable.94. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the time is now opportune for H.M. Government to take such steps as will ensure that any scheme for the construction of main trunk sewers and sewage purification works is not proceeded with until the Department of Health for Scotland have had the opportunity of examining the scheme and enquiring into the practicability of linking it up or combining it with similar works for a wider area than that covered by the particular proposal submitted by the Authority.Sewerage and Sewage Disposal in the County of Lanark95. The greatest concentration of industry and population in Scotland occurs in the County of Lanark, and, accordingly, it is essential not only on industrial but also on public health grounds that the sewerage and sewage disposal systems throughout the County, including the burghs, should be as comprehensive and efficient as possible. Twelve schemes estimated to cost  1,220,700 have been approved for assistance and further works estimated, so far as is known, to cost from  300,000 to  400,000 are to be submitted by the County Council and certain Burgh Councils for consideration at an early date.Renfrew Burgh Council Sewerage and Sewage Disposal96. The sewage from the Burgh of Renfrew is, at present, dis-charged untreated into the River Clyde at two points of outfall. I have approved a grant which will enable the Council to undertake the construction of sewage disposal works and a comprehensive scheme of sewerage improvements throughout the Burgh including an area which is to be developed by Scottish Industrial Estates Limited. I have made my grant conditional on the Council advancing the date of completion of the works by two years.Paisley Burgh Council Sewerage and Sewage Purification Works97. The scheme of sewerage and sewage purification which is being carried out by Paisley Burgh Council with the assistance of a
grant which I have approved from the Special Areas Fund is the largest and costliest individual drainage scheme to be undertaken in the Scottish Special Areas since the inception of the Special Areas Act. The sewage of the burgh was discharged untreated into the River Cart, a tributary of the River Clyde, and it was not unusual for raw sewage to drift in the Clyde as far east as Glasgow. The scheme in progress provides for the construction of intercepting sewers and sewage purification works which, when completed, will eliminate all risk of pollution of the Rivers Cart and Clyde in so far as Paisley is concerned.Prevention of Pollution of the River Clyde98. I am pleased to report that in collaboration with a number of Local Authorities I have been able to carry substantially further the work begun by my predecessor to free the River Clyde, particu-larly in its narrower reaches, of all risk of pollution by sewage and industrial waste. The Clyde is first and foremost an industrial river, but it has also great natural beauty. The drainage schemes undertaken throughout its course will not only tend to attract industrial development and safeguard public health, but contribute in large measure to the enjoyment of the amenities of the river by the public. I accordingly regard the heavy expenditure incurred in carrying out the drainage schemes as fully justified and of permanent value.Roads99. Except as stated in the next paragraph road schemes do not fall within the Commissioners province, as grants for road works are payable by the Ministry of Transport. Section 1 (3) (b) of the Act, however, empowers the Commissioner to make representations to Government Departments for the removal of difficulties which appear to prevent or hinder measures which, in his opinion, should be carried out. This power proved of benefit to the Airdrie Burgh Council who submitted a proposal to me for the construction of a road from Victoria Place to Rochsolloch Road. It appeared that the proposed road would facilitate industrial development in the burgh and, accordingly, I made representations to the Ministry of Transport who later informed me that they had examined the proposal and were prepared to regard it as eligible for Grant from the Road Fund.100. Section 4 (1) of the Special Areas (Amendment) Act, 1937, gives the Commissioner power to assist Local Authorities with schemes for the repair of streets certified by the Ministry of Transport as unimportant for purposes of through traffic. I am aware that the condition of the streets in certain districts of the Special Areas may constitute a handicap to industrial development, and I have taken appropriate steps with a view to the preparation and submission of a Report on the question.c 17244 B
Housing101. Representations have been made to me from time to time that localised shortages of labour are being experienced in certain industries and, in particular, in the coalmining industry. It is suggested that this difficulty is accentuated by shortages of housing in a number of the districts affected. I have given consideration to the question of whether I could assist ih solving this difficulty, either by meeting exceptional costs of transference or travelling to employment, or by the provision of housing to meet the housing shortage. These questions come within the province of the Ministry of Labour and the Department of Health for Scotland, and I am informed that they already have the subject under consideration. The matter is therefore being considered with them to ascertain whether there may be any desirable action which could not be undertaken with the funds at their disposal and which could be assisted from the Special Areas Fund.Burgh of Hamilton102. There was brought to my notice a short time ago an exceptional housing difficulty which had arisen in the Burgh of Hamilton owing to the illegal occupation of condemned properties by about 70 squatters. Having regard to the prior claims to new housing of legitimate slum and over-crowded families, it appeared that the Local Authority&apos;s housing programme could not be utilised for rehousing in this case or accelerated to the extent called for by the circumstances of the case. In view of the urgency of the problem, I informed the Second Scottish National Housing Company that 1 was prepared to make the necessary funds available to enable it to undertake an emergency scheme involving the purchase and adapta-tion of a number of properties sufficient to rehouse the squatters for a temporary period.Special Areas Housing Association 103. I recently had impressed uponme your concern at the present difficulties with operations in Scotland under the Housing Acts, 1930 and 1935 and that they regarded the housing problem in the Special Areas as particularly acute as, for various reasons, housing pro-grammes are not proceeding with the expedition considered necessary if rehousing of slum and overcrowded families is to be effected within a reasonable period.104. The provision of adequate and suitable housing for the working classes is a matter of first importance and in order to assist Local Authorities in overcoming their housing difficulties at the earliest possible date, and following upon discussions with the Department I decided to form a Housing Association under Section 26 of the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1935, and, at your request, I
agreed to become its Chairman. The Association will erect houses free of cost to Local Authorities and will conduct experiments in alternative methods of construction, such as concrete and pre-fabricated timber. It will not enter into competition with Autho-rities for labour and materials in short supply, but will endeavour to secure the closest co-operation with Authorities and will consult with them on such matters as the selection of tenants and fixing of rents.105. In connection with the formation of the Association I have addressed a communication to all Local Authorities in the Special Areas asking for their co-operation. If, as I hope, this is forthcoming, I am certain that the Association can make an impor-tant contribution to the solution of the housing problem. It will aim in the first instance at the provision of between 2,000 and 3,000 houses and if the experiment succeeds the programme can no doubt be extended.Hospitals Lanarkshire General, Infectious Diseases and Maternity Hospital Scheme.   Grermock Municipal Hospital Scheme.106. Mention is made in paragraph 25 of my predecessors final Report of Hospital schemes to be undertaken by Lanark County Council and Greenock Corporation, towards the cost of which he had offered substantial assistance. In offering grants to these Authorities the late Commissioner took the view, in which he was supported by the Department of Health for Scotland, that Regional Hospitals were likely to provide a more highly skilled and comprehensive service than smaller units. He accordingly made it a condition of assistance in the case of the Lanarkshire scheme that the Hospital should be available on an agreed basis to the inhabitants of the large burghs of the County and, in the case of the Greenock scheme, to the surrounding districts of the County of Renfrew. Negotiations with a view to reaching agreement on a basis of co-operation have been conducted by the Authorities concerned in both schemes, and on several occasions officials of the Department of Health for Scotland and of my office have attended conferences in an advisory and mediatorial capacity. I am happy to say that there are now indica-tions that both schemes, will proceed largely on the lines originally contemplated.Clydebank Joint General Hospital107. I recently received an application from Clydebank Burgh Council for assistance towards the cost of the erection of a Joint General Hospital to serve that Burgh, and the Burgh and County of Dumbarton. The proposal is only in its preliminary stages, but I advised Clydebank Burgh Council of my interest in the scheme, as it appears to be designed on sound lines. Consideration of the details is proceeding.b 2
Maternity and Child Welfare Centres108. I have received proposals from Lanark County Council, Stirling County Council and Rutherglen Burgh Council for the establishment of Maternity and Child Welfare Centres, and have been in consultation with the Department of Health for Scotland on&apos; the question of the need for these Centres in the Special Areas. From the information furnished by the Department coupled with my own enquiries, I have approved in principle the provision of assistance towards the cost of establishing a number of Centres in selected districts.Village of West Quarter, County of Stirling109. The Stirling County Council informed me that they were in course of rehousing the inhabitants of Standburn, a particularly depressed and semi-derelict village, on a new housing scheme at West Quarter, and that they proposed to make this a model village equipped with Recreation Ground, Social Service Centre and Maternity and Child Welfare Clinic. Standburn is in the Special Areas but West Quarter is just outside and the Council asked whether, in these circumstances, I would be prepared to provide assistance towards the cost of the proposed schemes at West Quarter. The scheme is an attractive one which for many reasons I should have been happy to assist but the Commissioners powers were in doubt in two respects and I was, with regret, compelled to intimate that I could not assist.Recreation Ground and Amenity or Site Improvement Schemes(Paid Labour)110. A large number of applications have been received for assistance towards the lay-out of recreation grounds, and amenity or site improvement schemes. The question of whether or not these types of schemes could be regarded as suitable for grant has given me considerable thought. While well aware of the advantages to be gained from the provision of facilities for outdoor recre-ation, I had doubts whether the payfnent of wages to men employed on such works could, in general, be justified. I decided, however, that I should be justified in regarding the labour costs involved in both types of schemes as eligible for grant within the undernoted broad lines : (a) that the area concerned was urbanised and lacking infacilities for outdoor recreation and that the works would bean economic asset to the district;(6) that the schemes would remove eyesores and enhancematerially the industrial potentialities as well as the socialamenities of the area.
111. Action on the proposals received was continued until the passing of the Physical Training and Recreation Act, on 12th July, 1937, which sets up a Committee with powers to assist with schemes related to active physical exercise. From the date on which the Bill became law, I have been debarred under Section 1 (5) (ii) of the Special Areas Act, from assisting Local Authorities with the layout of recreation grounds and schemes of similar type. I have, however, entered into an arrangement with the Scottish Grants Committee in regard to the disposal of applications for assistance which were outstanding in my office at the date upon which the Physical Training and Recreation Act became operative.Amenity Schemes (Voluntary Labour)112. A number of applications for assistance towards the cost of constructing football and cricket pitches, bowling greens, tennis courts and similar amenities in small towns and villages have been received. While I have every sympathy with the desire of Local Authorities in small towns and villages to provide facilities for outdoor recreation my examination of the proposals, particularly those submitted by District Councils, led me to conclude that as the amenities referred to were to be of exclusive benefit to the inhabi-tants of circumscribed and comparatively sparsely peopled areas, I could not justify assistance to such schemes unless the works were undertaken by voluntary labour. The Unemployment Assistance Board assured me that they would continue payment of unemploy-ment allowances to men who might be prepared to work on these schemes without wages. I informed the Local Authorities con-cerned that if they could obtain volunteers to carry out the works, I would defray the full cost of any land, materials, and equipment required for the works and the provision of working trousers and boots and a mid-day meal to the volunteers. I regret to record that no Local Authority in the Special Areas has been able to promote an amenity scheme on these conditions owing to difficulty in securing volunteers.Public Eaths and Swinrrriing Pools113. I have received a few applications for assistance towards the cost of public baths and covered and open air swimming pools. My assistance has, however, been confined to schemes for the construction of covered pools, as I regarded schemes for the con-struction of open air pools as unsuitable for grant owing to the fact that they would not, as a rule, be made full use of for more than a few months of the year on account of adverse weather conditions. Assistance has been offered to the two schemes referred to in paragraphs 114 and 115 but the operation of the Physical Training and Recreation Act prevents the Commissioner assisting any further similar schemes.x   17244 B 3
Kilmarnock Public Baths and Swimming Pool114. This scheme, towards the cost of which I have offered assistance, will serve a wide industrial area with a population of over 100,000 including depressed villages on the outskirts of Kilmarnock. I have made my grant conditional on the Burgh Council so planning the baths as to make them suitable and available for school children, if possible under a definite arrangement with the various Education Committees in the district.Coatbridge Burgh Council115. The scheme for the construction of public baths and swimming pool in Coatbridge approved by my predecessor is proceeding satisfactorily.SECTION (3)   LAND DEVELOPMENTSArterial Drainage.  Land Drainage (Scotland) Acts, 1930-1935116. Following representations made by my predecessor, the Land Drainage (Scotland) Act, 1935, was passed, receiving the Royal Assent on 12th April, and extending for a further period of two years (now expired) the powers conferred on the Department of Agriculture for Scotland by the Act of 1930 to prepare and settle Schemes for the execution and maintenance of arterial drainage works in any case where they are of opinion that agricultural land is capable of improvement or that land in a landward area is being injured or in danger of injury by flooding which can be prevented or remedied by carrying out such works.River Kelvin Drainage Scheme117. The possibilities of initiating a scheme for a large-scale area development in the Kelvin Valley, involving arterial drainage and other public works over an area of approximately 12,000 acres at an initial capital outlay estimated at  2,865,000 have been examined at considerable length in conjunction with the Departments of Agriculture and Health but found to be impracticable. A smaller scheme, estimated to cost  2S.450, for remedying flooding in the Kelvin Valley, which was suspended in 1931 owing to the financial situation and the observations of the Committee on National Expenditure, is, however, in course of active consideration with a view to being put in hand at an early date by the Department of Agriculture under the Land Drainage (Scotland) Acts.River Clyde (Hyndford Bridge) Drainage scheme IS. This scheme, estimated to cost  10,000, and consisting mainly of the demolition and removal of rock at the barrier known
as the Sills, and the improvement of the bed, etc., of the Clyde near Hyndford Bridge, is designed to check flooding of the River Clyde in the Carstairs district of Lanarkshire, and to improve the drainage of agricultural land extending to 945 acres. It has lain before Parlia-ment as required by Section 3 (9) of the Act of 1930 and the execution of the works has been put in hand by the Department of Agriculture.Land Reclamation119. Arrangements were made with the Macaulay Institute for Soil Research, Aberdeen, to undertake an experimental reclamation of peat and waste land, consisting of 550 acres of peat moss forming part of the Woodend Farm. The peat is, on an average, about 20 feet deep. The experiment is designed to explore the possibility of improving for agricultural purposes peat land of which, unfortunately, there are very large areas in Scotland which are at present entirely worthless, or, at any rate, poorly utilised.120. Part of the land is being drained with covered drains while the remainder is being improved at a lower cost as grazing land. Valuable information will thus be obtained in respect of both forms of improve-ment. It is hoped to use the area with covered drains for hay and pasture chiefly, but pasture which could be completely renewed when required, and the possibility of using it for silage or other crops if this proves desirable is not excluded.121. Work was commenced in May, 1936 and the drainage ditches have been excavated and drain boxes laid or made ready for laying, while liming, manuring, cultivation and some cropping will be carried out this year. Certain sections comprising about 200 acres have already been limed, while approximately 120 acres have been cultivated with a rotary cultivator. After manuring with basic slag and potash salts and cross cultivation, part of the land should be in crop in the autumn. Ten men, all of whom, with the exception of the foreman, were local unemployed, have been employed continuously on the scheme, while during the summer of 1936 as many as 27 were employed.122. Apart from the employment and the actual improvement of the land afforded by this experiment, the information and experience gained will unquestionably be of great benefit to the agricultural community as a whole, as at present little information exists as to the cost of reclamation of peat by modern methods. While the work has every prospect of achieving the desired aims, it cannot be too strongly emphasised that it is an experiment, the ultimate results of which will not be known for some time.Land Settlement Small-holdings123. The Land Settlement Authority in Scotland is the Depart-ment of Agriculture who have had a long and continuous experienceSi
of the settlement of men on small-holdings, so much so indeed that from the 1st April, 1912, to 31st December, 1936, 7,307 applicants had been settled, being 5,295 on new holdings and 2,012 on enlarge-ments. The scope for the initiation of any large-scale scheme of land settlement by me has, therefore, been somewhat restricted, and my functions in this respect have been limited to filling in gaps in the Departments programme, f have at all times acted in the closest collaboration with the Department, whose assistance and advice has been most freely given.124. As a measure of what has been done in the way of settlement on small-holdings in recent years, it may be stated that from the end of 1933 until the end of 1936 the Department had effected 821 actual settlements in the industrial belt, stretching roughly from Dundee to Ayr, and that land has been acquired for about another 100 holdings. Of these, 424 settlements were in the Special Areas and about one-half of the new holdings will also be in the Special Areas. The number of families from the Special Areas settled on schemes in those Areas is 266, while another 66 families from the Special Areas have been settled outside those Areas.125. My function has been to assist men from the Special Areas who are unable, without both training and financial assistance, to undertake the full responsibilities of tenants of small-holdings. Suitable unemployed men are selected by the Department of Agriculture in conjunction with the Unemployment Assistance Board and they, with their families, take up residence on the holdings and undertake training, which normally lasts for fifteen months, in the working-and management of the holdings under the supervision and direction of the Departments Land Officers assisted by the Advisory Officers of the College of Agriculture. During the training period the trainees continue to receive their Unemployment Allow-ances and are free to take up other employment in preference to continuing training.126. My assistance takes the form of making available a sum up to  250 per trainee for the purpose of (a) stocking and working the holdings and (b) meeting charges for rent, rates and other expendi-ture. fncome and produce from the holdings during the period of training are applied to further development, and at the end of the training period the trainee, if his work and conduct have been satisfactory, is accepted as the Departments tenant. The expendi-ture under (a) is repayable, free of interest, over a period of 10 years, while that under (b) is treated as a free grant. As regards the Stonebyres and West Cochno schemes referred to in paragraph 128, experience has shown that the expenditure under (a) has averaged about  190. As, however, the Department of Agriculture have recommended that  125 is the maximum which each holder should be called upon to repay over the period of 10 years, I have agreed to
make a free grant of the balance within a maximum of  125 including the grant under (b), leaving any excess to be met out of trading receipts from the holding.127. When this scheme was introduced, it was considered that 70 settlements was the maximum number which could be attempted having regard to the Departments own programme and the in-creasing difficulty of obtaining suitable land within reasonable distance of consuming markets. A grant of  17,500 was therefore allocated for this purpose.128. At the moment three schemes are in operation, at Stone-byres (Lanark), Cochno (Dumbarton) and Greenhill (Kilmarnock). The holdings average in size from about 6 to 8 acres and have been developed for intensive production of poultry and pigs, and market gardening, with the addition of fruit growing at Stonebyres. Altogether, 27 trainees, comprising households of 139 persons have been installed on individual holdings. The training period at Stonebyres and Cochno has been completed, and all the trainees, except one whose case is still under consideration, have been accepted as tenants of their holdings. An additional scheme for 10 trainees will be commenced in the Autumn this year on the Departments East Fulton Estate near Johnstone, Renfrewshire, and the period of training will last until Martinmas 1938. It is too early yet to say with certainty whether the men I have assisted will succeed as smallholders, but I am satisfied that the experiment will throw much valuable light on the problem.129. In addition to the assistance given to the^ trainees the salaries and expenses of six of the additional Instructors from the staffs of the East and West of Scotland Agricultural Colleges who give instruction in horticulture and pig and poultry breeding to small-holders and plot holders in the Special Areas, are being paid out of the Special Areas Fund.130. At the moment the possibilities of not only accelerating the completion of the original programme of settlement on 70 holdings, but an extension of the programme to embrace an additional number of holdings, are being explored with the Department of Agriculture.131. I have also given very serious consideration to the possi-bilities of establishing in Scotland Cottage Homesteads on lines similar to those which, I understand, are being established, with the assistance of the Commissioner, in England by the Land Settlement Association, but, owing to the absence of any large industrial area with a prosperity comparable with that of certain towns in England, I have reluctantly decided that such a scheme of settlement is not practicable in Scotland.
Plots132. Arrangements have been made through the Joint Com-mittee of the Scottish National Union of Allotment Holders and Society of Friends for the assistance of unemployed men in the cultivation of plots which vary in areas from a quarter to one acre and are provided by the Department of Agriculture. Up to the end of 1936, the Department had provided 1,975 plots, of which 959, or nearly one-half were in the Special Areas. A loan of 30s. is made by the Department to the holder and he is relieved of rent during the first year, after which he pays a rent on an average of about Is. a week per acre. Further assistance is given through the Joint Committee in two ways, namely : (a) Seeds, lime and fertilizers are provided. Each plot-holder receives about 37s. 6d. worth of those goods for 25s. and makes repayment by instalments spread over 20 weeks;(b) In the second or subsequent year of cultivation, a suitable plotholder may be granted a loan which takes the form of stock and equipment up to the value of  10 and is repayable by instalments in the second and third years of the loan.133. In the case of men in the Special Areas, assistance under (b) is provided from the Special Areas Fund, and a grant of  5,000 has been allocated for the purpose. The total number assisted in this way up to the end of July, 1937 was 369. The plot holders also receive instruction from the &quot;staffs of the East and West of Scotland Agricultural Colleges towards whose salaries and expenses I have contributed as stated in paragraph 129.Allotments134. Assistance is provided by the Joint Committee from their own funds, assisted by a grant from the Development Commission, and takes the form of a supply of seeds and tools at reduced prices. My assistance has taken the form of earmarking a grant of  2,000 to enable the Joint Committee to pay the salaries and expenses of additional organisers, whose functions are to assist in the formation and extension of Local Associations and in finding land for allot-ments in the Special Area. While the number of allotments in the whole of Scotland decreased between 1934 and 1936 by 2-2 per cent, from 22,177 to 21,682, allotments in the Special Areas, on the other hand, increased in the same period by 3 per cent, from 8,632 to 8,888. This percentage is not large but it has to be remembered that it represents a net increase after all wastages arising from men surrendering their allotments have been made good, and, while it is not possible to give the number of wastages, it is probably now the case that with a general improvement in the employment situation, it is appreciable.  Perhaps a more reliable measure of the progress
which has been made with regard to the stimulation of allotment cultivation in the Special Areas, is the fact that the number of Associations increased from 88 in 1935 to 117 in 1936, an increase of about 33 per cent. A further ten new Associations have come into the scheme during the 1937 season.135. A further effort to increase allotments was made by my predecessor in June, 1936 by the offer to all local authorities in the Special Areas who are statutorily empowered to acquire land for allotments, of a grant up to 25 per cent, of the total liability (including rent) incurred in leasing land for allotments. I regret to say that there has been practically no response to this offer. It may be that in Scotland there is not the same enthusiasm for allotments as prevails south of the Border, and I appreciate that it is difficult in many cases to obtain suitable land near to large towns, but I cannot help feeling that something further could be done if local authorities were sufficiently interested and active in the matter. Allotment cultivation, particularly to the middle-aged ex-industrial worker whose prospects of re-employment may be somewhat remote, provides a healthy and beneficial recreation, and not only improves his physique and morale but affords a higher standard of living for him and his family by the supply, without deduction from his Unemployment Allowances, of fresh vegetables and eggs. I feel, therefore, that everything that can, ought to be done to encourage an increase of allotments in the Special Areas.Experimental Farm Development *136. The Calderwood Estate, a farm property of about 850 acres situated between High Blantyre and East Kilbride, was acquired in November, 1935. On the 31st October, 1936 the Scottish Land Development Company Limited, which is a Company limited by guarantee and not having a share capital, was incorporated. The objects for which the Company is established are : &quot; To promote and encourage the employment or occupation on the land in Scotland of persons in and from those portions of Scotland which are included in the area for the time being designated as Special Areas within the meaning of the Special Areas (Development and Improvement) Act, 1934.&quot;137. I was fortunate in securing the following gentlemen as Directors of the new Company: Sir Hugh Arthur Rose, Bt., D.S.O., D.L., LL.D., Sir Robert Blyth Greig, M.C., D.Sc, LL.D., William Alexander Collins, Esq., D.S.O., and James Keith, Esq.I had with very great regret received the resignation of the Chairman, Sir Arthur Rose, shortly before his death. Mr. Collins has been good enough to assume the Chairmanship and I am glad to be able to report that Professor W. G. R. Paterson, Principal of the West of Scotland Agricultural College, has joined the Board.
138. I entered into an agreement with the Comapny on the 1st of December 1936 under which the Calderwood Estate was transferred to the Company for the purposes of management and development. This Estate is being developed for dairy farming, grass production and artificial drying, poultry production, and vegetable and fruit growing, including tomatoes. Sixteen ex-industrial workers are already employed at ordinary agricultural rates of wages and it is hoped that such men will ultimately be employed as farm workers, residing on the Estate with their families. I have recently concluded a further Agreement with the Company providing for advances up to  30,000 to be made to provide for the erection of a total of 44 new houses on the Estate and for the repair and reconditioning of a number of others, and they intend to proceed in the first instance with the building of 14 houses.139. The experience of the first year&apos;s working has indicated the necessity for some modification in the layout and scope of the farm and in the type of labour employed. The matter is under the review of the Board, from whom it is hoped to receive certain recommendations in due course.140. Normal farming operations have continued at the Woodend Farm, Carstairs, on that part of it other than the area of peat moss, which is at present being reclaimed under the direction of the Macaulay Institute for Soil Research. Negotiations are proceeding with the Company for the management by it of the farm pending the conclusion of the reclamation experiment in 1938.Group Occupational Scheme 141. The home craft Demonstration Centre, Lampits Farm, Carstairs, was closed down, owing to the shortage of recruits, on 25th June, 1936 after having been in existence for 39 weeks. The dearth of recruits seems to have been due in part to the novelty of the scheme, and partly to domestic objections to living away from home for a protracted &quot;period.142. Of the 108 men who entered training, 54 completed the course, of whom 22 were from Wishaw. It was accordingly decided to start an experimental Group Occupational Scheme at Wishaw to test the possibilities of success of this form of activity. Land to a total of about 21 acres was leased and operations were commenced at the end of March, 1936 with ten members. Subse-quently other members joined and the nominal strength is now nineteen. The members remain available for any employment which may eventualise. Buildings, including piggeries, cow shed, store and craft rooms and office have been erected and the activities of the members have comprised pig-breeding, poultry, milking, production of mixed vegetables and a certain amount of craft work consisting of boot repairing, woodwork and sock making.
143. Remuneration of the members is in the form of time-unit vouchers, realisable only in the products of the Centre, e.g., milk, eggs, vegetables, etc., which the men obtain for home consumption. The Unemployment Assistance Board agreed to continue to pay the men their full unemployment allowances without any deduction on account of the products thus obtained by them, for an initial period of a year and have recentfy agreed to extend this arrangement for another year. It only confirms anticipations that in the early stages of the Centre&apos;s life the running costs have proved to be proportionately rather heavy. I feel that it is still too early to say with certainty whether or not it will be able to be run without a continuous subsidy from the Special Areas Fund. On the other hand there is no doubt that the physique, morale and general health of the men has considerably improved and rendered them, after prolonged unemployment, more able physically to undertake ordinary employment, fndeed a number of the men have had spells of work since joining the Centre and it is legitimate to claim that the healthful occupations afforded have increased their general employability. I have accordingly agreed to continue the experi-ment for another year by which time sufficient data should be available to enable it to be decided whether any practical extensions of the idea are justifiable.Mission for Deaf and Dumb 144. I was approached by the Mission for Deaf and Dumb for Glasgow and the West of Scotland, whose activities cover, inter alia, the Counties of Dunbarton and Lanark, for assistance towards a scheme for training deaf and dumb persons, particularly the younger ones up to 30 years of age, in horticulture with a view to helping them to find employment in that form of occupation. It was represented very strongly that it was very difficult, if not impossible, in view of their affliction, for the persons for whom the Mission cater, a number of whom had had no employment at all, to find employment without some form of such training. The Mission purchased Mauldslie Castle Gardens, just over nine acres in extent, to establish a residential training centre, with the intention of starting the training of twelve of the younger persons, with possibilities of extensions later. I have made a grant up to 50 per cent, of the capital cost of the scheme on condition that not less than one half of the trainees are from the Special Areas. The Mission has obtained entry to the site and at the end of July, 1937 there were eight trainees in occupation.The Scottish Training Farm for Boys 145. Towards the end of last year I was approached by the Scottish Labour Colony Association Limited who conduct a scheme lor training boys in farm work at Todhill Training Farm, Stevenston,
Ayrshire. During 1936, parts of the premises used to house the boys were burned down and the Association asked me for assistance towards the cost of construction of larger and more modern buildings, and, also, the acquisition of a neighbouring farm of about 80 acres which they required in order to enable them to extend their scheme. I found that the Ministry of Labour were proposing to offer the Association a per capita grant to assist towards the cost of maintain-ing boys during their training, but were unable to offer any assistance towards capital expenditure. I therefore offered the Association a grant of one half of the cost of the reconstruction of the premises and the purchase of the adjoining farm up to a limit of  4,000.Afforestation146. Like my predecessor, I have considered the possibilities of a specially accelerated programme of afforestation in or within a 15 miles radius of the Special Areas. The scope for such a scheme is limited by the fact that the land which could be regarded as suitable is restricted in extent; it is largely either arable land, which is too good for afforestation, or is within radii of industrial centres where the risk of damage by fire and smoke is too great. I also felt some doubt as to whether the somewhat arduous and remote life on a forest holding is altogether suitable for the type of person with whom my problems were mainly concerned, i.e., the ex-industrial worker, particularly, the middle-aged. I therefore concurred in the view of my predecessor that it would be preferable to await the results of the special scheme approved for England and Wales, but I think the time is now ripe for a reconsideration of the question. I accordingly made certain preliminary enquiries of the Forestry Commission for their expert views and advice with a view to subsequent consultation with them.Beautifying Bings&apos; 147. I have received one or two suggestions that I should provide assistance to enable coal and iron slag pit mounds, i.e., &quot; bings &quot; to be beautified by means of afforestation or otherwise, the cost of their removal being quite prohibitive. I am assured that afforestation of bings gives no promise of commercial success but that the work is wholly amenity in character and provides employment and it seems eminently appropriate to my functions to finance some experimental work to see what can be done to render these bings more aesthetically attractive. I have, therefore, after consultation with the Forestry Commission, given approval in principle to a suggestion to beautif3&apos; a particularly unattractive iron-slag bing, which overshadows the houses in the neighbourhood, by planting it with hawthorn bushes and grass.
SECTION (4)   SOCIAL SERVICESModel Occupational Centres148. Considerable progress has been made with the experiment introduced by my predecessor in providing occupational centres which would serve as models for other districts. The utilisation of leisure is a matter affecting employed, as well as unemployed, persons, and I agree that the provision of a number of such centres to enable leisure hours to be profitably employed is an experiment well worth making.149. A grant estimated at  58,000 has been allocated to the Scot-tish Council for Community Service during Unemployment to enable them to provide and equip sixteen of these model occupational centres. For various reasons the grant has proved inadequate to enable the full number of centres to be provided and equipped, and I have therefore agreed that the number of centres should be reduced by one. I have had under consideration proposals from the Council for assistance to enable them to provide one or two further centres. While I indicated that I would be prepared to give consideration to a proposal that I should meet the cost of one other centre, I have felt that the centres which they have succeeded in establishing might be regarded as sufficient to form the experiment which was their primary purpose and that any expansion other than on the most limited scale should await further experience. s150. Eight of the centres have already been opened, six are in an advanced stage of construction, while the plans for the remaining centre have been approved. Further particulars are given in Appendix IX. Although the centres have only been in operation for a short time, and further experience is needed, it has been clearly shown that the facilities which they afford are worth while and are, indeed, appreciated by the persons whom they are intended to benefit. Much valuable work has been done by the Council in persuading people to avail themselves freely of the facilities afforded, but it is in my opinion essential that efforts should be continued to stress the purpose of the centres with a view to obtaining the support and active participation of a much larger proportion of the community in each district concerned.Minor Cormnunity Service Schemes151. The centres which have been provided are intended only as models which, it is hoped, will inspire other communities to make similar provision. Many of the smaller communities cannot achieve a centre on such an ambitious scale and as I did not wish such communities to be overlooked, I arranged for the matter to be pursued as opportunity offered. In my view all labour in connection wjth, community service schemes should be performed by unpaid.
volunteers and I departed from this principle in the case of the model occupational centres only because of the technical difficulties involved in large scale permanent construction and the necessity for speedy progress. For the small community schemes, however, I made the condition that any assistance which I offered should, in the main, be limited towards the supply of material and that the necessary labour should be done voluntarily by members of the communities concerned.Pirrie Park, Greenock152. I have also offered a grant of  10,400 to assist a scheme promoted by the Greenock Council for Community Service and the Town Council acting in co-operation with the Scottish Council for Community Service. The scheme will provide not only a large scale community service centre, but also much needed facilities for outdoor recreational activities.Nursing Services153. Further progress has been made in instituting nursing services in districts which were without them and in improving the facilities elsewhere which had been curtailed owing to the falling off of sub-prescriptions due to heavy and prolonged unemployment. The Queen&apos;s Institute of District Nursing have administered, on my behalf, a grant to encourage the provision of efficient nursing services through-out the Special Areas. The grant has enabled the Institute to secure the employment of nine nurses in districts where nursing services were non-existent or inadequate and, also, to help a considerable number of local associations to carry on their work which was in danger of being curtailed or discontinued through lack of funds. This assistance has had a marked effect in encouraging local associations to improve their services.Ambulance Associations154. Enquiries made by the Department of Health on my behalf established that there was no widespread need for assistance to voluntary ambulance associations. I could not agree that the funds at my disposal should be used to enable associations to make up annual deficiencies, but indicated that I was prepared to assist any association whose services were in danger of breaking down partly or entirely, or to assist the establishment of a service in districts where this could not be achieved by local effort. I made a grant of  350 to assist one Association to purchase an ambulance wagon to replace one which was thirteen years old and in offering it suggested to the Association that they should set aside an annual sum to form a sinking fund to meet depreciation and future capital charges.
Physical Culture Schemes155. The Ministry of Labour have continued to conduct on my behalf the physical training classes for unemployed men and women, under skilled instructors. Gymnastics and various sports have been introduced to add variety to the curriculum and the necessary kit and equipment have been supplied. Wherever possible the use of gymnasia and swimming baths has been obtained. Inter-team football matches have been played and public displays of physical training have also been given. Further details of the classes are given in Appendix X.156. There is ample evidence that the classes have been of great benefit to the physique and morale of the persons who have attended them, and have greatly increased their employability. I am happy to think that the sucess of the classes contributed materially to the introduction of the Physical Training and Recreation legislation.Cheap Milk Schemes157. I have followed closely the results of the experimental schemes for encouraging the consumption of milk by necessitous consumers in the Special Areas in England and Wales and one in Aberdeen operated by the Aberdeen and District Milk Marketing Board. I have carefully considered whether I should be justified in introducing an experiment on similar lines in the Special Areas. I understand that the results have so far been disappointing and that there seems to be in all schemes of this kind a tendency to use the cheap milk to substitute rather than supplement the normal supply. I feel therefore that there is not sufficient justification for introducing such an experiment until the results of those now in operation prove more encouraging.Athletic and Recreational Clubs158. Applications for assistance have been made by one or two small athletic and recreational clubs lacking funds owing to the prevalence of unemployment in their districts. In one case in which I gave assistance towards the cost of tools and materials, the club members are voluntarily constructing a cinder running track which is now almost completed. My satutory powers with regard to the assistance of voluntary bodies concerned with the promotion of physical training and recreational facilities are not affected by the Physical Training and Recreation Act, 1937, but to avoid dupli-cation of assistance from public funds, I have consulted the Physical Training and Recreation, Scottish Grants Committee, and agreed that, in general, the further assistance of athletic and recreational clubs is a master with which; they might. RIOTS, appropriately 4eaL;
159. A movement has been started under the aegis of the Scottish Athletic Federation, Former Pupils&apos; Union, to establish former pupils&apos; clubs in connection with Education Department schools which have playing grounds. I made a small grant to enable the Federation to make enquiries to ascertain which schools in the County of Lanark would be able and willing to co-operate in the Scheme. The results were encouraging but it was clear that the clubs would need assistance for equipment. I accordingly made a further grant to enable the Federation to proceed with the formation and equipment of the clubs, and they have already succeeded in establishing 17 clubs, five of which have women&apos;s sections, at the very modest figure of about  9 each club.160. The Federation are now exploring the possibilities of the formation of clubs in the other parts of the Special Areas, and when the results of these enquiries are available, the question of giving additional assistance will be considered.CarfinHaU161. The land and premises at Carfin Hall, New Stevenston, acquired by my predecessor for the establishment of an occupational centre for the use of local residents and a residential centre where suitable persons might receive training as leaders in social welfare work, have been let at a nominal rent to a representative body which has been registered, under the name &quot; Carfin Hall,&quot; as a company limited by guarantee and not having a share capital. The Governing Body of the Company consists of four ex-officio Governors, viz., the Lord Lieutenant of the County of Lanark or his nominee, the Sheriff of the County of Lanark or his nominee and two representatives nominated by the Commissioner; and of Governors elected or co-opted to represent civic, educational, industrial and social interests, under the able Chairmanship of Colonel S. MacDonald, Sheriff-Substitute of the County of Lanark, who was elected by the Board at its first meeting. The Company is responsible for the general finances of the centre, including the expenditure of grants from the Special Areas Fund, and has assumed responsibility for planning the development of the centre.162. One of the chief difficulties which is encountered in the promotion of social welfare work in any community is the lack of efficient voluntary leaders, and I am hopeful that it will prove practicable to establish a leadership training centre at Carfin Hall which will play a very important part not only in the betterment of social conditions throughout the Special Areas but also in influencing and inspiring communities outwith those Areas. It is hoped that if it thus proves possible for the centre to exert a wider influence, there will be a more generous response to any appeal for voluntary funds which the Company may launch to supplement my grants to assist the development of the centre in its initial&quot; stages.......
163. The local occupational centre at Carfin Hall is now well established and the Company has for some time past been actively considering plans for the development of the leadership centre. The Governing Body is making a comprehensive study of the prob-lems of leadership and has been in touch with various Government Departments and Organisations concerned to ensure that the centre will be so designed as to provide facilities for leadership training in the various phases of social welfare work where a need for trained leaders is apparent. I recently had the opportunity of meeting the Governing Body and discussing with the members their future plans and policy.164. I am grateful for the assistance which has been so generously given by members of the community in the development of the centre. Lectures and entertainments have been given without charge by numerous voluntary workers from various parts of-Scotland and a paddling pool for children has been constructed by a party of students from Edinburgh University under the leadership and guidance of Colonel R. B. Campbell, D.S.O., M.A., Director of Physical Education. I have also received two very welcome and substantial cash donations,  100 from a donor who wishes to remain anonymous and  61 from the students at Edinburgh University who raised the money in connection with their Assault at Arms.Welfare Work for Adolescents, Juvenile Organisations 165. It has not been possible in many districts in the Special Areas to secure the funds necessary .to provide a local club with even the most modest premises and equipment and some of the organisations have experienced great difficulty in obtaining adequate club leaders. It has therefore been necessary for them to employ salaried organisers in order to secure the efficient handling of the clubs. My assistance has in the main been directed towards the provision of local premises and the salaries and expenses of organisers employed in connection with Special Areas clubs and associations, although I have also assisted by providing camping equipment and encouraging Scout and Guide Troops and Boys Brigade Battalions to take to their camps the sons of unemployed parents. Details of the assistance which I have given to the various Juvenile Organisa-tions are given in Appendix XI.166. In an attempt to solve the difficulty experienced by the Juvenile Organisations in securing suitable premises at reasonable rents, I had plans prepared of a building designed to meet the joint requirements of several organisations, and asked them to consider whether it would be possible for them to co-operate with each other in the joint use of the building and responsibility for its care and maintenance. Unfortunately, this has not so far proved practicable and should any of the organisations now approach the Commissioner in the matter, it will be necessary to consider what action can be taken in consultation with the Physical. Training ao4 Recreation, Scottish Grants Corornittee.
Holiday Camps167. A further grant was made to the Scottish Council for Community Service during Unemployment to enable them to continue their programme of summer camps for 1936 and meet any deficiency which might be incurred. Two camps were run for a period of 20 weeks from 15th May to 1st October, 1936, at &quot; The Healtheries,&quot; Rothesay, and &quot; Butlaw,&quot; South Queensferry, and 3,343 families, comprising 17,739 individuals were able to enjoy a week&apos;s holiday. Each family paid 15s. for the week, which covered the actual cost of attendance at camp of the unemployed member of the family and left a margin towards the expenses of the other members of the family. The scheme has proved a great success and I was pleased to grant further assistance to enable the Council to organise similar camps for this summer on an extended scale. I visited one of the camps this summer and was impressed with the smooth and efficient organisation and the obviously beneficial results to the campers.Camping Facilities for School Children and Pupils from Junior Instruction Centres168. Another proposal for holiday camps for school children and Junior Instruction Centre students was made by the Educa-tionai Institute of Scotland. I was satisfied that there was ample scope for this project and I approved a grant of  6,000 to cover the provision of the camp and to make up any deficiency incurred in respect of children from the Special Areas whose parents were unable to meet the full cost of their maintenance at the camp. Unfortunately it proved impracticable to acquire suitable accom-modation to enable arrangements to be put into operation this season and I had to withdraw my offer, but I hope this disappointment will not discourage the Institute from undertaking the establishment of other camps. I have also given a small grant to the West Lothian Camping Association to enable them to provide the necessary tents to accommodate 200 school children.Toddlers&apos; Playgrounds, Day Nurseries and Play Centres for Children169. Some time ago a conference was convened of representatives of certain local authorities in the Special Areas, the Department of Health for Scotland, the Scottish Education Department and the Scottish Juvenile Welfare and After Care Office, to inquire into the possibility and desirability of establishing toddlers&apos; playgrounds, day nurseries and play centres for children in the Special Areas. A number of local authorities evinced interest in the project but the consensus of opinion was that the time was inopportune for the inauguration of schemes of this type. As it was not possible to frame a general scheme it was decided to consider on their merits v-any-individual schemes which might be. submitted.
Hugh Smiley Day Nursery, Paisley170. The Hugh Smiley Day Nursery, Paisley, has for many years been supported by voluntary funds, and, for the most part, workers at the Nursery give their services free of charge. Owing to the increasing use being made of the Nursery by the inhabitants of Paisley, the Committee in 1936 submitted an application for assistance towards the cost of erecting a new hut. My predecessor offered to defray the whole cost of the extension scheme then estimated at  300, but as this has proved to be too low I have agreed to increase the grant to the revised estimate of  420.Children&apos;s Playground at Craigieknowes171. After consulting the Department of Health and the Scottish Education Department I approved a grant to the Corporation of Greenock of  438, the estimated capital cost of constructing a toddlers&apos; playground and a hut to accommodate about 50 children on ground owned by the Corporation, who agreed to undertake full responsibility for the control and maintenance of the scheme. The work of construction has now reached an advanced stage and it seems probable that the total cost will amount to about  700. I indicated that the question of further assistance will be considered when the verified cost of the scheme has been ascertained.National Union of Townswomen&apos;s Guilds172. A grant of  120, for administration through the Scottish Council for Community Service during Unemployment, was made by my predecessor to the National Union of Townswomens Guilds. This grant has enabled the Union to establish Guilds in several towns in the Special Areas providing social, recreational and edu-cational facilities for unemployed women and the wives of unemployed men. A request for further assistance which has recently been submitted by the Scottish Council on behalf of the Union is under consideration.Part III. CONCLUSIONS173. Before ending this Report it is right that I should recapitu-late briefly the main conclusions at which I have arrived after the study of the problem which it has been my privilege to undertake during the past twelve months. In giving up the work while it remains uncompleted and in some respects only in its early stages I, would not willingly express any opinion which might embarrass my successor in its continuance, and, I make the QQrrmaenjs. and.
suggestions which follow in the hope that they will help rather than hinder the energetic pursuance of what will remain for many months an exceptionally difficult task.174. The problem of the Scottish Special Areas is essentially different from those of either the English or the Welsh Areas. Transference from the Areas is more difficult because there is in Scotland no busy expanding industrial centre like the Midlands or South of England and the time has not yet come when transference to England will become a normal outlet for Scottish youths. It is not entirely clear whether such a development is wholly desirable but I have noted with interest the extent to which young men are finding their way to employment in England via the Training Centres of the Ministry of Labour and it may be that such a move-ment may continue to be necessary for some years. It is certain at any rate that transference out will not conflict with efforts to bring fresh industry to the Areas, until much greater progress in both directions has been made than has so far proved practicable.175. The Scottish problem differs also from that elsewhere in that the unemployment stated statistically is less severe. The striking percentages displayed by some of the areas of Wales and Durham are not now to be found in Scotland since the reduction by about one-third in the numbers unemployed has been distributed fairly generally. Moreover, there are few districts which can in any sense be described as derelict; there is practically everywhere the will and capacity to regain former prosperity. There is still, however, a large area in the industrial north of Lanarkshire where the problem is more severe than the figures would suggest because of the long duration of much of the unemployment and it is in that area that remedial measures are most necessary and most difficult to devise.176. A close study of the industrial possibilities of the Special Areas in Scotland has made it very clear that here there are con-siderable numbers of towns and communities which have every local service, labour suitable for training and employment, attractive amenities and a robust civic and social sense. Further, though these towns and centres are largely engaged in mining and in the heavier industries, the surroundings are attractive and, from the point of view of the workpeople engaged in new or expanding industries, they are pleasant places in which to work and live.177. What more then can be done in or for the Scottish Special Areas for the future to promote their industrial development ? In paragraph 70 I have said that the most intractable problem is the continuing unemployment in the coal industry. I welcome the steps which I hope will be taken towards a better understanding of the nature of this problem by a further analysis of the &quot; hard core &quot; and&apos; by the contemplated classification of the unemployed work-people registered at the Exchanges as normally engaged in the industry.   For tfre rest there are two important ways in which
progress may still be possible. The first is in the establishment in the Scottish Special Areas of one or other of the processes for the extraction of oil from coal to which I make reference in paragraphs 65 to 70. Whether anything of the kind will prove practicable still remains uncertain. The other is in the use by municipalities of surplus coke oven gas. I had hoped that more progress would have been made with regard to the utilisation of coke oven gas, produced in the surrounding district, by Glasgow Corporation and other local authorities. Progress in this direction would, in my opinion, make for cheaper gas for industrial purposes as well as increasing the consumption of coal. I have not yet abandoned hope that the widespread advantages of a development of this kind will be realised and quickly followed by practical steps.178. As to the general industrial development which the 1937 Act was designed to induce, the expression of a definite opinion upon a few months working would be premature. That the Act is proving and will prove useful is already certain. The fullest possible use of the new powers is essential and later experience may suggest the need for their extension. In particular the induce-ments which the Commissioner is empowered to offer to new under-takings may have to be extended to existing undertakings which are willing but otherwise unable to expand. The difficulties of such an extension of the Commissioners powers are serious but the question is one which in due course may merit careful consideration.179. I should welcome also anything that can be done through private enterprise to provide a source of loan capital for small undertakings who can at present borrow from the Special Areas Reconstruction Association up to half of the money required to finance a new business. This is a gap in the existing provision, the filling of which might be of considerable importance.180. While expressing my thanks to various Government Departments for what they have already done I feel that more may yet be possible in the way of placing Government contracts in the Areas, a matter to which I refer briefly in paragraph 56, and I commend to your serious notice the continued need for seizing every opportunity of helping the Areas by this means.181. So much for direct methods of restoring industrial pros-perity. Among the indirect methods housing, in my opinion, is of primary importance. I hope that the Association which is being formed may find much useful work and secure the full co-operation of the local authorities who have nothing to lose and everything to gain.182. Other housing developments may also be desirable and possible. In particular if it were established that developments in the coal mining industry were being prejudiced by housing shortages, whether outwith or within the Areas, I should consider it desirable to examine the possibility of making some provision t,o pyercome.
such an impediment. The difficulty of subsidising a local authority to provide houses for newcomers where almost ex hypothesi its existing residents need better accommodation is obvious, but the importance of reducing the unemployment in the mining industry is such that only insuperable difficulties should be allowed to stand in the way.183. Another indirect method of inducing industrial recovery which retains its importance is the assistance which can be given for schemes to improve water supplies, sewerage and sewage disposal, drainage and the like. No town which has unsatisfactory or out-of-date facilities can hope to recover its prosperity or attract new concerns. In paragraph 85 I venture to draw your attention to a most important consideration affecting water supply services. In the matter of sewage disposal, much, I am happy to think, has been done. To a large extent the River Clyde, for instance, is now free from risk of pollution. More, however, is still possible. In par-ticular I make two suggestions in paragraphs 90 and 94 with regard to pollution of rivers and centralisation of purification works which would encourage certain improvements on lines which circumstances sometimes render impracticable under the existing powers of the Government.184. For like reasons the improvement of social amenities retains its importance and I consider that it would be unfortunate if the emphasis laid by the 1937 Act upon the industrial side of the problem were to overshadow the need for continued assistance in such matters as the provision of social welfare centres and other opportunities for the useful utilisation of leisure such as the making available of land for allotments.   I refer to this last point in paragraph 135.185. It was also my intention to pursue further the question oi land settlement on the lines adopted in England. Experience has shown that the opportunities for land settlement within the Areas are limited but it may be that something would be possible either in Scotland outwith the Areas or even in England.186. There is one other point on which I wish to touch in a few-words. I have watched with sympathetic interest the passage of the new legislation with regard to physical training and its auxiliary activities, even if in some respects it involved my relegating to a new authority powers to which 1 attach importance. I am confident, however, that the new authority will be as appreciative as I have tried to be of the importance of this method of assisting the Areas, and I hope further that this development may ultimately and indirectly-lead to the furtherance of an object of prime importance namely, the creation in Scotland of an autonomous body corresponding to the National Council of Social Service in England. The lack of such a body in Scotland has been seriously felt. I say this with -full realisation and appreciation of the splendid work done by the various existing bodies in spite of the serious difficulties with which they Jjave-bad to contend.
187. And now I cannot end without some indication, however inadequately expressed, of the debt of gratitude which I owe to those who have made my task possible. Difficult as it has been, it would have been quite insuperable without the help which I hav.e received without stint from the many Departments of State, both from those dealing with Scottish problems only and from those whose activities cover the United Kingdom; from the many organi-sations, associations, companies and other bodies, some of which already existed and some of which my predecessor and I have been able to create; from the many individuals who have willingly given their voluntary services; and from my own staff. To one and all I offer my grateful thanks.188. Shortly after taking up office, I appointed Mr. T. Howe, O.B.E., as Assistant Commissioner. His special experience and line, sympathetic interest in the work proved of the greatest assist-ance to me. His untimely death in January, 1937, was deeply felt by me, as, in his passing, I lost the services and advice of a very fine colleague and friend. To Mr. A. B. Valentine, who succeeded Mr. Howe as Assistant Commissioner, I also owe much. His loyal co-operation with me, and his grasp of the problems involved have been of inestimable help, and I consider myself fortunate to have secured his assistance. Since the Commissionership for the Special Areas was set up, Mr. Leslie G. Bullock has acted as Secretary. His knowledge of the work and his loyal service and close collaboration at all times will remain with me as a very pleasant memory of my period of office.189. Finally I wish to express my sincere appreciation of the encouragement and help which I invariably received from the late Sir Godfrey Collins and from yourself. The Commissioners position as the instrument of Government policy but yet with a considerable measure of independence is not easy, and I have always found that the general control which under the Act you have had to maintain, has been so sympathetic that my task, if sometimes onerous, has invariably been pleasant.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Signed)   David Allan Hay.13, Carlton Terrace,Edinburgh, 7. 3rd November, 1937.
