Situation,  oj the Government of India,  dated 26th October,  1937.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political situation in India,  dated.&quot; the 26th October 1937,  issued on. the authority of the Secretary of State for India.1.    the Forth West Frontier.    There is little change in the situation in Waziristan.    Road construction progresses and the tribesmen as a whole are peaceful, though small parties, encouraged by the Faqir of Ipi and other hostile leaders, continue to give trouble.    Operations were undertaken in the middle of September against the Mulla Sher All and his followers in the Upper Baddsr Valley end Shakai.   Ho serious opposition was encountered and operations resulted in the dispersal of Sher Ali&apos;s followers.    The Faqir of Ipi has remained in Shswal, refusing to he persuaded by other religious leaders to make peace.    Although he has failed to collect any large tribal force, he succeeded in raising a body of 300 men, mostly Wazirs, who gave a certain amount of trouble in the vicinity of Razmak in the latter half of September.    This body was engaged by the Bannu Brigade on 27th September and suffered considerable casualties.In this engagement two Indian other ranks were hilled and one British officer and 20 Indian other ranks wounded. As a result of this action and of subsequent bombing,  the hostile body scattered,  though a remnant were again engaged on October 5th when a few casualties were suffered,  including one British officer killed.    Towards the end of September a hostile gang was formed in the Wan a area, which attacked certain IChassadar posts.    This gang was dispersed by the Wane Brigade.    On September 27th the range piquets at Sarwekai were attacked &quot;by a gang of about fifty Mahsuds,  one Indian officer and three Indian other ranks being killed,  and four Indian
other ranks mounded.    Air action in the Bhi tennis.&apos; country has resulted in the release of some of the kidnapped Hindus.   Since however ell have not yet been released end some further kidnapping has taken place,  air action is being continued.    The peace terms announced to the Tori Khel Wazirs end Dowers have been accepted by them and the Tori Khels have alrecdy surrendered all the rifles deman ded.2-    The Central Goyernment and the Legislature.   The Government of India ere in the process- of moving from Simla to their winter headquarters in Delhi aid the summer session of the Legislature has been   prorogued.    Although in some degree public interest in the Central Legislature has diminished with the formation of autonomous Governments in the provinces (the Premiers of a number of which were till a few months ago members of the Central Assembly) and the first session of the Provincial Legislatures under the new constitution, the legislative output of the session has been important and discussions have covered a wide field. The Insurance Bill,  of -which mention w;.3 made  in the-last appreciation has been passed by the Lower-House after long and laborious consideration;    the division of opinion on some of the clauses followed unconventional lines end,  in general, the Bill is considered to represent a fair compromise between the various commercial interests concerned;    it will come before the Council of State in a special session to be held later in the year.Discussion on a resolution condemning the Government of India Act and demanding the formulrtion of a new constitution through a constituent assembly got no further
than was in&amp;icrted in the last appreciation;.    it is due to continue during the next session.    The tone of the session was markedly restrained but at the end of it Nationalist feeling found vent in two adjournment motions censuring the Government for the  appointment of two British experts to Government posts.3.    The T?ederal Courtv   The Federal Court was inaugurated on the 1st October when the Chief Justice  and Puisne Judges were sworn in before Eis Excellency the Governor-General.    Though criticised here and there as a forerunner of federation the  institution ox the Court has had a generally good press.    Its jurisdiction will for the present be confined on the original- side to disputes between provinces and on the  appellate side to  appeals from High Courts in the provinces in which constitutional issues are involved.4.    The Congress Party and Congress provincial Governments.Jaw all ar Lai Nehru,  the Congress President, has been touring north and west India.    In a series of uncompromising speeches he has emphasised the ultimate aim of the Congress Party as the overthrow of the present constitution end its replacement by a constitution framed by a &quot;constituent assembly&quot; based on adult suffrage and severance of the British connection.    Ee continues to attach the scheme of federation embodied in the Government of India Act and has stressed the impact of world events upon the situation in India and the opportunity which a European war (which he professes to regard as inevitable) would give to the Congress fight for independence.    He continues also to emphasise the view,  that office acceptance is but a small part and a part with, which he personally would willingly dispense,  of the
Congress revolutionary programme,  and that a more important aspect of the Congress struggle is the organising of the masses and the instilling of &quot;mass contact&quot; and &quot;mass revolutionary mentality&quot;  ideas into the populace,  and the recruitment of the Muslim community to Congress ranks.Among the Provinces visited was the Punjab where in public he vigorously attacked the ministry and in private found plenty to.criticise in the local Congress organisation. Meanwhile, the Congress ministries are engaged with some success in working the constitution.    Central Congress control still at times requires ministers to obtain permission for what they want to do;    and.some features of&apos; the central programme,  such as prohibition in some Provinces, do not appear to arouse much enthusiasm.    In a few days the All-India Congress Committee and Working Committee meeting at Calcutta will take stock of the quarter&apos;s work, and interesting discussions and decisions may be expected.    It is not likely that the extreme sections will refrain from the condemnation of the  increasing entanglement of the party in constitutional activity.    In the field of law and order, the conflict between policy end practice is developing. The policy of Congress requires the release of all &quot;political prisoners&quot; (included in the term are persons convicted of violence, however heinous) the removal of restrictions upon subversive organisations and the repeal of the so-colled repressive legislation.Pressure to implement that policy is impelling ministries to relax restrictions and control sometimes to an extent which they themselves know to be dangerous.    At the same time  a sense of responsibility is growing.    For instance, in Madras, the Premier ( already under criticism for daring
to speak of the C.I.D.   as a necessary port of the Administration), has sanctioned the prosecution of an agitator for sedition.The incongruity of the present position is reflected in the attitude of the rank and file of Congress towards their ministries.    Congressmen have for years been opposed to the established Government,  and-many of them still fail to appreciate the change which has come about. They are impatient at the slowness with which the Congress programme is being carried out and critical of the employment of the machinery of a Government which they have been taught to regard &quot;as a target of abuse.    The task of the ministries unable- to disown their followers,  even if they may make  an honest attempt to control them,  is thus rendered more difficult and this indiscipline is not unnaturally encouraged by the extreme left. 5*    Provincial legis1sturss.    The budget sessions of the provincial legislatures have ended and generally have shown the strength of the ministries in power including the new predominantly Congress ministry in the North -Test Frontier Province.    Besides the budgets some provincial legislatures found time to pass a number of important bills.    In introducing &quot;prohibition&quot; Madras has led the way to revivin the experiment with the accompaniment of loud evangelical propaganda in a district where it was- tried &quot;and failed a few years ago.   Madras has also passed a sale of cloth bill designed to encourage the indigenous hand loom industry.    These measures ere typical of a ministry led oy a devoted follower of Mr. Gandhi;    In the same province a bill providing for a moratorium for agricultural debtors has provoked vigorous criticism and has been
6.-shelved.    In Bengal a bill was passed to emend the tenancy law.    In a number of provinces the &quot;constituent assembly&quot; resolution was passed, not, however, without opposition in the main from Moslem parties.In Bombay an important resolution was adopted in favour of the return of what are known as the &quot;Gujarat; Lands&quot;.    These lands were forfeited to the Government during the civil disobedience movement,  and were in due course sold to other proprietors.    The return of these lands to their original owners has bean a cardinal item of congress policy in the province,  and steps whereby effect can be given to the resolution without inflicting injustice on the present proprietors are now under the. consideration of the Bombay Government.s-        &quot;Political11 prisoners.   with the cessation of the hunger-strikes in the Andaman Islands and elsewhere agitation has for the time being subsided.    In accordance with their undertaking the Bengal Government since the cessation of the strike, have been examining the question of repatriation of terrorist prisoners to Bengal,  and a first instalment has been received from the Andamans end other.jails outside the province.    All the terrorist prisoners sent to the Andamans from other provinces have been repatriated to jails in their own provinces.In Bengal the firm attitude of the Provincial Government during the strike has raised the prestige of the Government and of the forces of law and order,  but it is unlikely that the agitation there and elsewhere will be allowed to cease.    Already demands are being advanced for the immediate release of the repatriated prisoners end The
threat of a renewal of the hunger-strike is a weapon of which the Provincial Government have good reason to he apprehensive.7.   Moslems and Congress.    The communal situation.   While the Congress President has been insisting upon the necessity of drawing the Moslem community into the Congress fold,  the Moslem attitude towards Congress is hardening and the increasing tension between the communities has been manifested in outbreaks of communal violence.    In the Punjab, where a coalition ministry, consisting of 3 Moslems,  2 Hindus end a S.ikh, represents a predominantly Moslem majority party, the Moslems show signs of restiveness at what they consider undue c o n s i de r at ion of m inority c o mmun ities.The-opposition parties,  in the main Hindus and Sikhs of the Congress party,  aware that a coalition ministry, otherwise stable,  is handicapped in dealing with communal trouble, have not hesitated to exploit communal differences to embarrass their political opponents.    The firm action taken by the Punjab Government against sedition has been bitterly attacked.It is, perhaps, no coincidence that very recently a, meeting of the Moslem league at Lucknow has witnessed an avowal of support to the League from the Mohamedan Premiers.of both the Punjab, and Bengal.    It is too soon to assess the results of a session which has produced this ostentatious closing of ranks against Congress (as a Hindu organisation)  and,  at the seme time,  a leftward political tendency shown, for instance, in the adoption of &quot;Independence&quot; as ths ultimate aim of the League.    For the moment, the result appesns to be to accentuate the
communal division of political India.    Communal tension is reported from a number of provinces.    An outbreak of communal rioting has recently occurred at Jubbulpore in the Central Provinces;    while, in the Punjab, incidents occurred in a number of districts resulting in 3 deaths and a number of injuries.8*    Labour and Communism.    The withdrawal of restrictions upon individuals and organisations, and the belief that central control will not permit Congress ministries to deal firmly with subversive movements-, hove encouraged, the forces of disorder and,  in particular,  communistic activities.    At present, Congress ministers tend to trust in their personal influence rather than the arm of the la?.&apos;.   Where, however,  as in Bombay (the most favourable field for communistic agitation),   all restrictions have been removed - except that imposed by the Government of India on the communist party of India - the danger is that the gesture will be construed as an invitation to licence.In Cawnpore the authority of the Government was so openly challenged during the recent labour troubles that the Congress President himself had to intervene to control the communist union.    The issues between employers and labour are still under enquiry;    it will remain to be seen whether labour will accept the findings.    There are signs of labour trouble  also in Madras and Bengal.    Disorder has been noticeable lately among students;    and the Agra agitation is almost entirely under extremist control. 9.    Economic.    Following partial drought, mentioned in the last appreciation, good rain fell in mosf parts of the country where it was needful,  and general economic conditions are satisfactory.
10.    C Iain a and - Palest ine^   The 26th September, by order of the Congress President, was observed in Congress circles in most provinces as &quot;China day&quot;.    Resolutions condemning Japanese aggression and the sending of Indian-troops to China were passed,  and a boycott of Japanese-goods advocated.Hows of the recent arrests of Arab leaders and of other action taken to suppress terrorism in Palestine has caused genuine concern among the Muslim political leaders in India, but there has been hitherto little active agitation.    Press comment on the situation, however, is becoming less restrained,  and,  although the problem of Palestine is of little genuine concern to India,,  and has received no consideration on its merits,  it has been e:eploiied for communal and anti-British purposes. &quot;Palestine Day&quot; was observed twice in August and once in September,   and in certain places wss accompanied by intemperate speeches and scenes of disorder.    With Congress and the Muslim League bidding against each other for Muslim support,  the temptation in both political camps to make capital out of the situation is strong.The behaviour of other powers elsewhere in the world, however,  is a lesson that &quot;British Imperialism&quot;  is to be preferred to some other variety.
