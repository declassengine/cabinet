CONFIDENTIAL. as u..BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL. STATE OF TRADE - SEPTEMBER 1957. Summary of reports submitted by members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some cases with statistical information from other sources).OVERSEAS TRADE.    Imports, in September at  87.8 m. were 15.9 m. more than in September 1936.    Over 60f, of the rise wasin food and raw materials.    Of the increase of  5.4 m. inmanufactured goods,  2.2 rn. related to non-ferrous metals and manufactures,  1.1 in. to iron and steel manufactures and 795,000 to oils, fats and resins.    Exports of United Kingdomproducts,  44.5 m., were  7.5 iru more and re-exports,  5.2 m.,were  1.5 m, more than in September 1956.EMPLOYMENT.    The total number of unemployed persons on the registers at 15th September - 1,559,204 - was 29,979 more thanat 25rd August;    the changes in the various divisions were:-London . 4- 1,718       North Eastern.. 4-     528South Eastern. 4- 6,096       North Western.. 4- 8,792Southwestern. 4- 2,126       Northern......&apos; 4- 2,156Midlands  .....  - 1,584       Scotland...... 4- 6,943Wales  ......... 4- 3,204The estimated number of insured workers aged 16 - 64 inemployment (excluding agricultural workers) was 11,599,000 -7)000 less than in August but 473,000 more than in September 1936.Employment improved between August and September in coal mining,motor vehicle and pottery manufacture and dressmaking.    Therewere declines in the building industry, hotel etc. service,  the distributive trades, stove and grate manufacture, shipbuilding,etc and the cotton, wool, tailoring, fishing and certain foodmanufacturing industries.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.    In the four weeks ended 26th Septemberrailway traffic receipts increased by  495,000 (3*9^.) as comparedwith the corresponding period of 19360    The value of passenger traffic increased by 2,48^, merchandise, minerals and livestockby 3,28$* and coal,  coke and patent fuel by 8.77^1.
BANKING..   Money was extremely easy throughout September.    The Treasury Bill rate fell from 10/2.53d.  to 9/10.83d., the lowest for two and a half years.    There were signs of a demand for gold by hoarders and the price rose from 140/--gd.  to 140/7id.    The under-tone of the silver market was firm.    At the beginning of September the French Bank Rate was reduced from 4^ to 3ifi, and the spot franc was fairly steady around 1321;    but towards the middle of the month the fall of the tourist demand for francs and the uneasiness as to the French financial position resulted in a sudden fall to 147-g-.    Subsequently the rate improved to 144-g-, but the three months forward rate of 12 francs discount showed the real weakness of the position at the end of the month.    Sterling was depressed in New York;    the dollar fluctuated between 4^.96x and 4.94-g, with the three months forward rate at a small premium. FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ABROAD.Belgium.    Government securities remained steady but shares were weak in sympathy with the leading international stock exchanges.    Short term money rates remained low.    The belga was subject to some pressure under the influence of internal political dissensions and the depreciation of the French franc and there war. a discount on forward belgas.France. The franc was subject to downward pressure owing to the political outlook at home and abroad, to the budget deficit,  the adverse balance of payments of current account and the reported reluctance of exporters to repatriate proceeds of their sales. Quotations for rentes deteriorated, but French industrial securities remained firm on the whole.    Wholesale prices rose.Holland. The abundance of funds seeking investment continued to be reflected in low short term money rates.    High grade bonds remained steady, but shares of Dutch and Dutch East Indies concerns succumbed to international influences in spite of sustained domestic progress.    The florin appreciated in terms of both the dollar and sterling and forward guilders continued to command a premium against sterling,
Sweden.  The accumulation, of kronor &quot;balances in Sweden by foreign hanks was responsible for a premium throughout the month on three months forward kronor.      Share prices in the middle of September fell hack to about the level of mid-May. The bond market was undecided and rather dull though with a somewhat firm tendency.Switzerland.,   The Swiss franc was firm on balance.U.S.A.      Money rates continued easy.      The movement of gold to U.S.A. continued considerably below the June volume.    The amount of new securities offered publicly was comparatively small and actual sales of securities offered to stockholders were restricted by the unsettlement of the stock market, which was also reported to have caused the abandonment or postponement of several prospective issues.      Representative rail and industrial share prices declined sharply, but recovered somewhat towards the end of the month.      The dollar-sterling exchange moved within narrow limits and there was a tendency for the &apos; premium on forward dollars to decline.SHIPPING.    The Chamber of Shipping Index number of freights (1913 s 100) was 183.03 as compared with 163.2   in   August and 103.76 in september,  1936.      Owing to international complications there has of late been a pause in many trades .and the volume of business has contracted.      If tonnage had not been in short supply rates would have fallen,     At the 1st October  99,000      net tons Of shipping were laid up in Great Britain and Ireland, as compared with 61,000 at the 1st July and 403,000 a year ago.S PI IPBUILDIITG-.    There was little change in activity during September.      The month was the busiest of the year as regards launchings and trial trips, but few new contracts were placed. The amount of tonnage under construction in Great Britain and Ireland at 30th September was 1,185,000 tons gross as against 1,200,000 at 30th June and 929,000 a year ago.
Ship-repairers were busy on the Clyde and fairly active in South Wales and at Leith but conditions were somewhat quieter in the repair establishments shmonts of the Tyne and Mersey.COAL.      Inland demand for house coal was&apos;normal;    industrial demand continued active, particularly for coking coals. Output for the four weeks ended 18th September (18.88 n.tons) was 1.33 in.  tons more than in the corresponding period a year before. Exports in September amounted to 3,66 ra.  tons as compared with 3.03 in.  tons a year before.      The main increases were for Italy, France, Sweden and Argentina.      Prospects in the home market continue favourable, but in foreign trade are uncertain.IRON AND STEEL.      The daily rate of pig iron output was the highest since September, 1930;    production in September (726,000 tons) was 75,000 tons more than a year before.    Two more furnaces went into blast and one furnace temporarily stopped.      Crude steel output (1,165,000 tons) reached a new record, as a result of the use of new plant and arrangements for securing larger supplies of pig iron and scrap;    the whole output was rapidly absorbed.      Finished steel output continued to expand.      Prices on the home market were well below the world level.      Exports of iron and steel (194,000 tons) were 6% more than in September, 1955.      Imports (226,000 tons) were 57% greater.In Scotland the industry was fully employed except in the light castings section.      On the North East Coast new business in both iron and steel was booked for delivery in 1938;    cancellation of a number of Far Eastern orders did not affect activity.      In the Sheffield area hematite pig iron was somewhat scarce but supplies of other grades and of scrap were said to be adequate.      In South Wales the tinplate industry operated at the end of September at 79^ of capacity (the highest figure for a long: time), and the demand for heavy finished steel was also strong.      It is expected that
one of the two new &quot;blast furnaces in Ebbw Vale will begin operations shortly and. the other by the end of the year.ENGINEERING-.    Following the slight recession during July and August; expansion in activity was resumed.      The volume of new &quot;business received was large and the rise in exports continued;      Exports of machinery amounted to  4.3 m. as compared with  3.4 in.  in September 1936.      Imports ( 2.0 m. ) were  484,000 more, largely because of increased imports of machine tools.MOTOR INDUSTRY..    The number of motor vehicles newly registered in August was 23,517 - 2,354 more than a year before;    the increase in private cars was 2,084.      The production of private cars in July was 33,905 (13.8% more than a year before) end of commercial vehicles 10,305 (2.6% more).      Exports of new private cars and chassis in September amounted to 5,295 and of new commercial vehicles and chassis to 1,764 - 10*3;.-o and 17.870 respectively more than in September 1936.      1,264 complete new private cars were imported as compared with 169 a year ago.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY...      The strong position of the industry was maintained.      On the heavy engineering side, difficulty in securing raw material supplies has recently tended to check production but there is little indication of a slackening of orders.      Exports of electrical apparatus and machinery ( 1.6 m. ) were 28;b more than a year before. Electricity generated was 13^/5 more.NON-FERROUS METALS.      The decline in the metal markets continued in September and became more pronounced at the end of the month.      The trade recession in the U.S.A.  greatly affected the markets.     Actual consumption outside the U.S.A. was probably maintained but falling prices tended to hold up new manufacturing orders and demand for the metals.      In the United Kingdom, trade demand for copper and spelter was quiet and for tin moderate, while pipe etc. and cable makers bought good tonnages of lead.
CHEMICALS.,,     Both home and export trade in alkalis and. heavy chemicals showed an increase as compared with August.      Home sales of dyestuffs showed a small advance and foreign sales a considerable improvement over September 1936.      Home sales of sulphate of ammonia were about the same as a year ago and export sales (excluding Spain and the Canary Islands) were greater, due mainly to increased takings in Empire markets.      Business in coal tar products was moderate.      Trade in wood distillation products continued good but in pharmaceutical chemicals was rather below normal.COTTOOT.,     Activity in the spinning section increased somewhat but (partly on account of holidays) remained lower than in the first half of the year.      In weaving and finishing activity appeared to decline.      The daily yarn output index (1935 ^ 100) was 109    as compared with 108 in August and 106 in September, 1936.      The fall in raw cotton prices continued.      The improved demand for yarn diminished the difficulties of maintaining spinners&apos; margins.      Yarn exports at 11.9 m. lbs.  were 1.7 m. less than in August last but slightly more than in September, 1936. Exports of piece goods at 156.8 in.  sq. yds. were 5.2 m. less than in.August but 3.5 m. more than in September, 1936;      Compared with August, the chief decreases were to British India, British West Africa, Canada and Egypt.      There were substantial increases to Australia, Denmark and South Africa.WOOL.      General activity tended to decline.      Raw wool prices fell considerably.      Exports of tops, yarns and tissiics wore all considerably less than in September, 1936.      Reports suggest that the immediate outlook is unsatisfactory;    the fall in wool prices and the uncertain international situation arc restraining customers from placing any but- small orders for urgent needs. The reports received indicated continued activity in textile dyeing and bleaching.
9 oSILK AMD ARTIFICIAL. SILK.     Rayon.    The general position in the weaving trade continued satisfactory.    The improvement in the dress goods section was maintained.    Sales of crepe yams increased.    Business in staple fibre remained steady.    In the printed piece goods section, a good season is expected.   Exports of yarns and all-rayon fabrics showed large increases over September 1936;, but exports of rayon mixtures declined.Si lie.    The trade in plain silks was very poor, although there was considerable &quot;business in certain other kinds.HIDES .AItD. LEATHER.    Hide values showed a declining tendency in most parts of the world;   but in certain instances markets were steady or firm, largely as a result of demands from Japan.     Turnover in most sections of the leather industry was on a restricted scale.POTTERY.    The general level of employment in August was higher than a year before.   Demand for general earthenware was normal.    Tile factories continued to be employed to capacity.    Home sales of sanitary earthenware and orders for electrical fittings were lower than a year before, though the demand for the latter was still good.BUILDING c.   There was a tendency for building activity, other than that connected with Government projects, to diminish, Reluctance to adopt new projects is attributed -Jp uncertainty as to the time and cost of completion, arising largely from the inability of suppliers of certain materials to guarantee delivery within specified periods at pre-arranged prices. ,-Returas received by the Ministry of Labour from 143 local authorities show that the estimated cost of buildings for which plans were approved was  9.1 m. - slightly more -than the figure for September, 1935.     There were decreases of 9% for factories and 3% for dwelling houses and an increase of 14% for all other buildings and alterations to existing buildings.
RETAIL TRADE.    The money value of retail sales in August was 6o7^ higher than in August 1936.    Sales of food and perishables rose by 8.3^ and of other merchandise by 4.6$. Preliminary returns for September indicate a substantial increase over September 1936.C0-OPBRATIVE TRADE (SCOTLAND),..    The autumn drapery season opened well and demand for fashion goods was very satisfactory. Demand for furniture and furnishings has been good.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.    463,000 bales of wool were received into store from 1st July to 31st August as compared with 371,000 a year before, the quantity sold or shipped being 28,000 and 11,000 respectively.    Wheat and flour shipments from 1st December, 1936 to 28th September were equivalent to 86.1 m. bushels as compared with 85.8 ni. bushels a year before. Butter shipments from 1st July to 25th September were 8,500 tons as compared with 11,300 tons a year before.    Imports of merchandise during August amounted to  11.25 m.  (Australian currency) as compared with  9C24 m.  in August, 1936.CANADIAN TRADE.    Economic conditions were well maintained during August.    Total exports increased.    Gold shipments were greater than in any previous month, asbestos exports were greater than in any previous August, and nickel exports were a post-war record for August.    Newsprint production established a further record.  .Exports of shingles rose appreciably.    The iron and steel industry continued active. Motor car production was greater than in any August since 1929.SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE.    There are indications that further expansion of economic activity in the Union will be at as lower rate   .than during the past four years.    Imports inJuly were 21,5$ greater than in July 1936.    Exports (excludinggold) were 58$ more, due mainly to increased shipments of maizesugar, hides and skins and fruit.      Gold exports were 27$ moreand the tonnage of ore crushed reached a new record.    The maisemarket was weak in August but improved slightly towards the end of the month. R
COLONIAL TRADE continues to be satisfactory.      in almost all Dependencies imports this year have been substantially above those in 1936;    this increased, purchasing power is due to the rise in prices of Colonial products and consequently of the value of exports.      In general, prospects are satisfactory:    the exceptions are Uganda,   which is suffering from the break in cotton prices;    Palestine (owing to the political situation and the possibility of unremunerative Citrus fruit prices) and Hong Kong (owing to the Par Eastern crisis).SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.Argentina.    The export sxirplus for the first eight months of 1937 was 749 m. pesos as compared with 247 m. pesos a year before.      Increased purchasing power is rapidly making itself felt;    in July and August imports reached a higher level than at any time since May, 1950,,while retail business is steadily improving.      Imports from the United Kingdom during August were valued at 28 m. pesos - 8 m. more than in August, 1936.      The agricultural oxitlook was regarded in September as at least normally favourable;    and despite improved weather conditions, cereal prices advanced.Brazil.    The position of the   coffee indtistry further deteriorated and seems likely to continue to do so until the procedure of destroying surplus stocks is superseded by that of destroying the loss productive trees.     Exports of coffee declined in quantity during the first half of 1937, but increased in value.      Weather conditions have unfavourably affected the prospects of the 1937/8 crop.      The quota of Brazilian coal which coal importers are compelled to purchase has been increased from 10% to 20%.Chile,.     Although the question of restriction is unsettled, it is expected that Chile&apos;s 1937 copper output will be well above 1936 level;    prices are also higher.     Shipments of mining products (Chile&apos;s chief exports) aggregated 505 m. pesos during
January/duly as compared with 256 m. pesos a year before. Exports of agricultural products were also greater.      Chile1s production of textiles is rapidly increasing.Uruguay.      Imports in the first half of 1937 were valued at 37 m. pesos - 7 m. pesos more than a year before.      Exports rose from 51 to 65 m. pesos.      Imports from the United Kingdom, while slightly less than last year, are still higher than from any other country.      The United Kingdom continues to be Uruguay&apos;s principal customer, but exports to Japan have increased remarkably and exports to U.S.A. have also risen.
