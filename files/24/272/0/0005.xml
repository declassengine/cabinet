THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   October 1937.SECRET Copy No136^B.(Also Paper No. C.O.S. 635.)COMMITTEE   OF   IMPERIAL   DEFENCE.SITUATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN AND THE MIDDLE EAST.(Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 1350-B.)Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.ON the 16th October, 1937, the Chief of Naval Staff received two telegrams from the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, reporting that the local Commanders of the three Forces (who had assembled in Egypt under instruc-tions from the Chiefs of Staff to examine certain plans) were concerned at the deterioration in the international situation, and, in particular, at the despatch of Italian troops to Libya, and the intention of the Italian Government to appoint Signor Parini as the Italian Minister in Egypt.2. We met, as a matter of urgency, on the 18th October, 1937, and submitted a Report (Annex I) in which we summarised our conclusions as follows : (i) The provision of fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft defences in Egypt isin itself eminently desirable and would be a valuable factor in estab-lishing confidence in Egypt and stabilising the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean, but in present conditions cannot be considered independently of the international situation as a whole.(ii) From a purely military point of view, we are aware of no new factor inthe situation which leads us to consider that the military situation is such as to justify a change in our existing instructions that no obtrusive measures should be taken in connection with the defence of Egypt or in the projected movements of the Fleet.(iii) We note the opinion of the Foreign Office that the political situation inthe Mediterranean at the present time is such as to justify further measures to increase the security of Egypt against Italian aggression. But we presume that the position is likely to develop one way or the other as the result of the meetings of the Committee on Non-intervention in Spain now in progress.(iv) Italy&apos;s present commitments and pre-occupatipns in Abyssinia and in. Spain, her adverse economic and financial position and the unpreparedness of her ground forces in Libya, at the present time, for offensive operations in the Western Desert, make it improbable that she would embark single-handed on offensive action directed against Egypt.(v) The despatch of any forces from this country must inevitably weaken our position vis-a-vis Germany, and we have always considered that we should take no action which would result in a diversion of our limited resources from our main objective, which is the security of this country against German aggression.
&apos;(vi) We have despatched an interim reply to the Local Commander-in-Chief in Egypt (Enclosure No. 4), but a decision of the Cabinet is now-required on the following points : (a) Has the political situation vis-a-vis Italy deteriorated at thepresent time, or is it likely to do so in the immediate future as a result of a breakdown in the negotiations of the Committee of Non-intervention in Spain, to such an extent as to warrant a departure from our present instructions for taking no obtrusive measures for the additional security of Egypt 1(b) If the above is the case (1) should authority be given to the Local Commanders to take all the measures possible with the existing resources in or near Egjrpt, i.e., those referred to in paragraph 2 (ii) to (vi) above;(2) should forces be despatched from the United Kingdom at the cost of weakening our anti-aircraft defence at home in the event of German aggression or an extension of trouble in the Mediterranean to northern Europe in such degree as to menace the United Kingdom?(vii) From the time when a decision is taken to despatch reinforcements from this country to the time when their presence will become effective in Egypt, a period, in time of peace, of about six weeks must be allowed.3. The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence circulated the above Report to the Cabinet, and it was considered by the Cabinet at its meeting on the 20th October.4.   The Cabinet agreed* &quot; (a) That the answer to the question in the conclusion (vi) (a)t of the Chiefs of Staff Report should be in the negative, that is to say, that the political situation vis-a-vis Italy had not deteriorated at the present-time to such an extent as to warrant a departure from present instructions for taking no obtrusive measures for the additional security of Egypt; the questions raised in (vi) (b) therefore did not arise.(b) That the Committee of Imperial Defence should be asked to consider whether any steps of a military character, and, if so, what steps, could be taken at the present time in view of all the circumstances, with a view to increasing our prestige in the Near and Middle East.&quot;5. By the instructions of the Prime Minister we have examined conclusion (b) above, with a view to submitting our recommendations to the Committee of Imperial Defence.6. Despite the assurance quoted in paragraph 4 (a) above, we should be failing in our duty if we did not emphasise that our military position in Egypt is extremely unsatisfactory, particularly as far as defensive arrangements against air attack and the protection of the Port of Alexandria as the fleet base are concerned. There are no anti-aircraft guns or searchlights, and no fighter aircraft. In the event of a sudden deterioration in the international situation, no reinforcements of this nature could arrive in under six weeks. Although if an aircraft carrier could be made available fighter aircraft could be conveyed to Egypt in about a fortnight, as already provided for in Part I of the Middle East Appreciation (Paper No. CCS. 603 (J-P.)). In these circumstances, we sympathise with the concern which has been expressed by the local Commanders charged with the responsibility for the security of Egypt.Nevertheless, as stated in paragraph 2 (v) above, the despatch of any forces from this country must inevitably weaken our position vis-a-vis Germany, and disturb military training.  We have been guided by the principle that we should* Cabinet 38 (37), Conclusion 6. f See paragraph 2 (vi) (a) above.
take no action not absolutely avoidable which would result in a diversion of our limited resources from our main objective, which is the security of this country against German aggression.7. Turning now to the specific problem referred to us (see paragraph 5), we would point out that &quot; any steps of a military character &quot; which &quot; could be taken at the present time, in view of all the circumstances, with a view to increasing our prestige in the Near and Middle East&quot; must be limited by two conditions. In the first place, they must not be liable to be construed by the Italian Government as provocative; in the second place, they must not appreciably weaken our position vis-a-vis Germany.8. In view of these limitations, it is clear that nothing very spectacular can be done. Nevertheless, there are certain measures which are at present contem-plated and, in addition, certain other measures, which we suggest might now be taken, which, in their cumulative effect, will tend to strengthen our position in Egypt both morally and materially. These we set out in the following paragraphs.9. At the present time our air forces in the Middle East are equipped with aircraft whose performance is notoriously inferior to that of the aircraft with which the Italian air forces are equipped. The Chief of the Air Staff has informed us, however, that re-equipment of three of our bomber squadrons in the Middle East and Iraq with the latest type of aircraft is already in hand, and that the first instalment of eight of these aircraft is being despatched to Egypt on the 27th October. Further consignments are to follow at regular intervals. The knowledge of this re-equipment is bound to become public property in Egypt and throughout the Middle East generally, and should have a good effect in that part of the world.10. The local Commanders in Egypt are clearly apprehensive lest the situation in Palestine should make demands on their exiguous forces. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff has assured us, however, that arrangements have been made to ensure that any troops that may be despatched to Palestine from Egypt will be immediately replaced from elsewhere. If this were announced, it should have a reassuring effect.11. In addition, it will be recalled that the Committee of Imperial Defence at its last meeting before the Recess* agreed &quot; to invite the Secretary of State for India to inform the Government of India that, for the time being, reinforce-ments for Egypt should be given priority over all other reinforcement commitments which the Government of India have conditionally accepted.&quot; This information, if communicated to the local Commanders, should at least be of some comfort to them.12. We have been informed that the Egyptian authorities themselves favour the early reoccupation of Mersa Matruh with Egyptian troops. We cannot conceive that there can be the slightest political objection to this move of Egyptian troops within their own country. We have therefore instructed, in anticipation of Ministerial approval, the General Officer Commanding British troops in Egypt that, although he should not himself broach the subject, he should encourage the Egyptian authorities to make this move if they themselves should propose it.13. The Air Officer Commanding, Middle East, has suggested. that petrol and bomb dumps should be established in the Western Desert. We think that this would be a sound precaution, and we recommend that the suggestion should be sanctioned on the understanding that local Commanders are satisfied that the dumps in question can be properly safeguarded.14. The S.S. Thistlegarth is at present lying at Alexandria with anti-torpedo nets and 6-inch,. 4-inch and 2-pdr. guns in her hold, which could be used for the defence of Alexandria in an emergency. We recommend that the nets should be disembarked and stored ashore at Alexandria, if possible.* C.I.D. 298th Meeting, Minute 1.
15. As regards the 6-inch guns, there are: at present no coast defences at Alexandria, but the hold-fasts for two 6-inch guns, mounted there during the 1935 crisis, still remain, and platforms for the other two guns are in S.S. Thistle garth. At their 275th Meeting* the Committee of Imperial Defence agreed that &quot; It is in the general interest that Alexandria should be a defended port, and if a treaty is negotiated under which we continue to maintain a garrison in or near Alexandria, the defences would well be manned by the Egyptians.&quot;16. We are concerned at the continued lack of any form of coast defences at Alexandria, and we have considered whether it would not be advisable to enter into immediate negotiations with the Egyptian Government as to the transfer to them for mounting at Alexandria of the &quot;guns and lights now in the .S.S. Thistlegarth.17. We understand, however, that it has been suggested that the handing over of guns for Alexandria might form a useful bargaining factor in connection with the forthcoming negotiations with the Egyptian Government concerning the improvement of harbour facilities and provision of a dock at Alexandria.18. If this is the case (and on this point we suggest that the local authorities should be consulted), we suggest that the guns and lights in Thistlegarth should in any case be disembarked and stored at Alexandria pending the outcome of the negotiations. We point out that, in the meanwhile, the S.S. Thistlegarth is incurring heavy demurrage charges while she remains at Alexandria.19. Four six-inch guns, six searchlights and ammunition for the defence of the Canal terminal ports are at present stored at Malta. We recommend that arrangements should be made for their storage in Egypt. Since no part of the Suez Canal Defence Plan has yet been divulged to the Egyptian Government, no indication of the intended use of this equipment should be given at this juncture, and it should be alluded to as reserve equipment for British Forces in Egypt. For a similar reason, it would be more appropriate for the equipment to be stored at Alexandria than in the otherwise more satisfactory Canal Zone Area.20. S.S. Churruca is at present in the Eastern Mediterranean with ammunition in her holds for the gun defences of Alexandria. We recommend that this ammunition could be disembarked and stored in Egypt.21. The interim telegram which has been despatched to General Officer Commanding British troops in Egypt for communication to his colleagues, is attached as Annex II.22. The question of propaganda is hardly within the category of military measures. We suggest, however, that any action which could be taken to expedite the arrangements which, we understand are already under consideration for establishing an effective British Propaganda Service in the Middle East, would have a beneficial effect on our prestige in that area.Summary of Conclusions.23.   Our conclusions and recommendations are as follows :-(a) We reaffirm and invite particular attention to the following extract from the Report which was submitted to the Cabinet on the 18th October, 1937 (see paragraph 2 (i) above) : The provision of fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft defences in Egypt is in itself eminently desirable, and would be a valuable factor in establishing confidence in Egypt and stabilising the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean, but in present conditions cannot be considered independently of the international situation as a whole.* C.I.D. 275th Meeting, Minute 4 (i) (a).
(b) In view of the Cabinet decision quoted in paragraph 4 (a) above, any stepsof a military character which could be taken at the present time in view of all the circumstances, with a view to increasing our prestige in the Near and Middle East must be limited by two conditions : first, that they must not be liable to be construed by the Italian Government as provocative; and, secondly, they must not appreciably weaken our position vis-a-vis Germany.(c) In view of the above limitations nothing very spectacular can be.done,but the measures summarised in conclusions id) and (e) below should, in their cumulative effect, tend to strengthen our position in Egypt both morally and materially.(d) The following measures are already in hand or contemplated : (i) the re-equipment of certain bomber squadrons in Egypt, kenya and Iraq with modern aircraft, (ii) arrangements have been made tq^ensure that any troops which may be despatched to Palestine ^? Egypt will be immediately replaced from elsewhere. In addition, the Government of India have been requested to treat the despatch of a brigade to Egypt as having first priority over all other reinforcement commitments which they have provisionally accepted, (iii) the General Officer Commanding British Troops in Egypt has been authorised to encourage any proposal which may be put to him by the Egyptian Government to re-occupy Mersa Matruh with Egyptian troops.(e) We recommend that the following additional measures should be taken : (i) The Air Officer Commanding, Middle East, should be authorised to establish petrol and bomb dumps in the Western Desert on the under-standing that he and the General Officer Commanding are satisfied as to their security.(ii) The anti-torpedo nets now in S.S. Thistlegarth at Alexandria should be disembarked and stored ashore at Alexandria if this can be arranged.(iii) That in principle it is very desirable that the guns and lights now inS.S. Thistlegarth should be transferred to the Egyptian authorities as soon as possible and mounted at Alexandria. If, however, in the opinion of the local authorities, we should by such action lose a valuable bargaining factor in connection with negotiations concerning harbour improvements and the provision of a dock at Alexandria, the guns should in any case be landed and stored at Alexandria.(iv) The guns and lights for the defence of Canal Terminal ports now storedat Malta should be stored in Egypt if this can be arranged, (v) The   ammunition   for   the  gun   defences   of   Alexandria   now  in S.S. Churruca should be disembarked and stored in Egypt.(Signed) CHATFIELD.C. J. DEVERELL. C. L. NEW ALL.2 Whitehall Gardens, S. W. 1, October 26, 1937.
ANNEX I. [CCS. 631.] --Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.SITUATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN AND MIDDLE EAST.(Previous Paper No. CCS. 630.)Report.AT our 218th Meeting on the 18th October, 1937, we had under consideration two telegrams from the Naval Commander-in-chief, Mediterranean, dated the 16th October, 1937, addressed to the Chief of Naval Staff, and a telegram from. His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires, Egypt, addressed to the Foreign Office of the same date (attached as Enclosures Nos. 1, 2 and 3).The local Commanders of the three Services (who are at present assembled in Egypt under instructions of the Chiefs of Staff to examine detailed plans, based on the assumption of a single-handed war with Italy), have expressed concern at the deterioration in the international situation, and, in particular, at the despatch of Italian troops to Libya, and the intention of the Italian Government to appoint Signor Parini as the Italian Minister in Egypt. They propose certain immediate measures to strengthen our position in Egypt, which may be briefly summarised as follows : (i) The despatch of a complete anti-aircraft brigade, and preferably of a fighter squadron in addition, from the United Kingdom.(ii) The despatch of the aircraft carrier H.M.S. Glorious to Alexandria orthe retention of her aircraft there.(iii) To approach the Egyptian Government with a view to an immediatemove of Egyptian troops to Mersa Matruh, and the establishment of net defences and the mounting of guns at Alexandria.(iv) The authorisation of the General Officer Commanding to move Britishtroops to Mersa Matruh and Suez at his discretion, and the placing of Mersa Matruh in a state of defence by the building-up of reserves of stores and the supply of anti-gas and water supply equipment.(v) The establishment of dumps of petrol and bombs for Air forces operating in the Western Desert.(vi) The placing of a squadron in Iraq at short notice to reinforce Egypt.We are sympathetic towards the anxieties of the local Commanders charged with the responsibility of the security of Egypt in view of the existing paucity of resources available in that country. In particular, the provision of anti-aircraft defences and fighter aircraft, all of which are at present deficient, appears to us to be eminently desirable in principle with a view to the establishment of confidence in Egypt and the stabilisation of the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean.In this connection the proposal of the Commander-in-chief, Mediterranean, to land aircraft from Glorious in Egypt is not recommended as apart from administrative objections it is most undesirable to use up these ship-based aircraft against much faster and more heavily armed land-based aircraft. Glorious is also due for refit and recommissioning. The dockyard programme has been adjusted to take her in hand shortly, and the crew, having completed their term of foreign service, are expecting to return to the United Kingdom this month. Her retention could only be justified on the grounds that it was necessary for the Mediterranean Fleet to be at more immediate state of readiness for war against Italy.It will be observed that the recommendations of the local Commanders are based on their assumption that the international situation has considerably deteriorated during the last few days.From the purely strategic point of view we do not consider that the military situation has greatly changed from that which existed at the end of July. It will be recalled that at the 4th Meeting of the Defence Plans (Policy) Sub-Com-mittee on the 23rd July, 1937, the Prime Minister emphasised the importance of doing &quot;nothing which could arouse Italian suspicions, or be construed as
provocative.&quot; It was on this account that the Admiralty were authorised to despatch to the Mediterranean the nets, which would be required at Alexandria in the event of an emergency, and an ammunition ship, on the distinct under-standing that these steps were to be taken as unobtrusively as possible. At the 298th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 29th July, 1937, the War Office were similarly authorised to take immediate but unobtrusive steps to build up their reserves of supplies and stores so as to enable the garrison of Egypt to operate for a period of two months.These measures were taken largely as a result of the announced intention of the Italians to despatch three Metropolitan Divisions to Libya as part of its permanent garrison. This anouncement by Italy had been made as long ago as the 10th April last. The only new factor which has arisen is that instead of the permanent garrison of Libya being one white corps of three Divisions, it now appears, that it is to consist of two Corps, each of two Divisions. The total numbers of white troops in Libya, however, will not greatly exceed the combined total of the three Divisions whose despatch was originally announced, and the white troops which were already present in the country.There are two more reasons why it appears to us unnecessary to view with undue alarm this divergence from Italy&apos;s original announcement as to her inten-tions regarding the strength of the garrison in Libya. In the first place it has been stated that the troops in Libya, owing to the favourable training facilities afforded by the colony, are to be considered in future as part of the Metropolitan Army, and we see no reason for not accepting this statement. In the second place, as far as our information goes, the formations now arriving in Libya are not up to strength nor equipped for major operations over a difficult terrain such as would be involved in a land attack upon Egypt. The only forces immediately available for attack upon Egypt would therefore be air forces, which are not at present stationed in Libya in sufficient force for the purpose, though they could be flown there very rapidly and aerodromes exist for their accommodation. Aggression by air forces unsupported by ground troops seems to us extremely unlikely.As regards the political situation, we are informed that the Foreign Office consider that a general increase in tension in the Mediterranean has taken place during the last two months, due to developments in connection with the Spanish situation. The purely political aspects of this question are not matters which are within our province, but we presume that the situation in the Mediterranean is likely to develop one way or the other as the result of meetings of the Committee on Non-intervention in Spain, which are now taking place.If the negotiations in that Committee proceed satisfactorily, it appears to us that there may be a considerable relaxation in the tension between ourselves and Italy. If, on the other hand, the negotiations break down, Italy may become apprehensive of stronger and more positive action on the part of ourselves, acting in co-operation with the French. . In this case she might conceivably take anticipatory counter-measures by playing upon our fears for the security of Egypt. Indications have not been lacking that she is well aware of our sensitiveness in this quarter since any sign of an intention to increase the garrison of Libya has always provoked an immediate reaction on our part.In this connection it must be remembered that the despatch of Italian troops to Libya is a cause of anxiety to the French no less than to ourselves, since their colony of Tunis no less than Egypt can be threatened from Libya. The recent transfer of Italian troops from the Yugoslav to the French frontier may well have been part of the same policy.At the same time, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that Italy herself has her own anxieties and difficulties. Serious disturbances have recently taken place in Abyssinia where she has at the present time some 70,000 troops at the end of a very vulnerable line of communication. In Spain she has some 45,000 troops committed at the present time. Her internal economic and financial situation must give rise to serious, concern. In these circumstances, from a military point of view, it seems improbable that she would embark single-handed on offensive action directed against Egypt, particularly in view of the fact that her ground forces in Libya are at present unprepared for an operation of such magnitude and that the only immediate action which she could take would be from the air.So far we have been considering only the siutation as it is affected by our direct relations with Italy and the immediate defence of Egypt against Italian
aggression. These considerations, however, cannot be dissociated from the general international situation. The transfer of any forces from this country must inevitably weaken our position vis-a-vis Germany. . The despatch of 24 guns and 24 searchlights to Egypt would at this moment reduce the number of guns and lights available for the anti-aircraft defence of the United Kingdom to 188 guns and 806 lights. If by any action on our part we should provoke an act of sudden aggression against us by Italy in the Mediterranean we should have to face the possibility of Germany (whether by preconcerted collusion or otherwise) seizing the opportunity to pursue her ambitions in other parts of Europe, thus possibly precipitating a world-wide war. This possibility must always remain our greatest danger, and we have always considered that we should take no action which would result in a diversion of our limited resources from our main objective, which is the security of this country against German aggression. This consideration applies with especial force at the present time when our total defensive resources are still far below the level required for fulfil-ment of our defensive liabilities. Consequently the decision whether or not to strengthen our anti-aircraft defences in Egypt depends largely on whether the Government consider that the risk of an extension of trouble from the Mediterranean to Northern Europe can be disregarded.It is for this reason that we have frequently referred to the desirability, from the military point of view, of the restoration of our former friendly relations with Italy.  In July 1936, for example, we reported* as follows :  &quot;From the strategical point of view the first desideratum is a secure Mediterranean. This involves, as the primary consideration, the restoration of our former friendly relations with Italy.&quot;Again, the Review of Imperial Defencet which we prepared in February 1937, for use at the Imperial Conference, included the following passages :  TP *n* &quot;A&quot; ^ &quot;7?&quot; Better relations with Italy should be our constant aim.&quot; and later in the Review : -TV -7V If -77 &quot;TV&quot; Thus, our sea communication through the Mediterranean can only be made really secure, either by maintaining friendship with Italy, or by establishing ourselves in such military strength in the Mediterranean as as would permanently deter Italy from embax*king on war against us.&quot;J4. &quot;       Ji. -it&quot;&quot;TV&quot; &quot;7\&quot; TV&quot; TV&quot; &quot;TV&quot;In a recent report on Anglo-Italian relations:): we stated with regard to the above quotations :  &quot; We have been reinforced in the convictions expressed in the above quotations by the detailed examinations which we have recently conducted into plans for possible wars. The result of these examinations has been to make it abundantly clear that the embarrassments and dangers to which we should be exposed, in the event of war with either Germany or Japan, will be multiplied by the possibility of a hostile Italy.&quot;We have despatched an interim reply to the telegrams from the Naval Commander-in-Chief dated the 16th October, a copy of which is attached as Enclosure 4 to this Report.We now ask for an early decision as to whether any action should be taken to carry out the recommendation of the local Commanders. In this connection the time factor is all important. From the time when a decision is taken to despatch reinforcements from this country to the time when their presence will become effective in Egypt, a period of about six weeks must be allowed. This factor particularly affects the first of the recommendations of the local Commanders that an anti-aircraft brigade should be despatched from this country. The other measures proposed are concerned with forces and resources available in or near Egypt at the present time, and could be implemented more rapidly.* Enclosure 2 to C.I.D.

Summary and Conclusions.Our conclusions may be summed up as follows :-(i) The provision of fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft defences in Egypt isin itself eminently desirable and would be a valuable factor in estab-lishing confidence in Egypt and stabilising the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean, but in present conditions cannot be considered independently of the international situation as a whole.(ii) From a purely military point of view, we are aware of no new factor inthe situation which leads us to consider that the military situation is such as to justify a change in our existing instructions that no obtrusive measures should be taken in connection with the defence of Egypt or in the projected movements of the Fleet.(iii) We note the opinion of the Foreign Office that the political situation inthe Mediterranean at the present time is such as to justify further measures to increase the security of Egypt against Italian aggression.

Enclosure No. 1 to Annex I.Copy of a Telegram from the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean (No. 127), dated October 16, 1937, to the Admiralty.PERSONAL for First Sea Lord and for C.I.G.S. and C.A.S.2. Local Commanders held their first meeting this Saturday forenoon and were in agreement that as international situation appeared to have deteriorated considerably during last few days it was desirable that a report should be made now on steps which should be taken immediately to strengthen armament position vis-a-vis Italy should His Majesty&apos;s Government be in agreement with our appreciation of the situation.3. We are aware that the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government has been that German menace has been considered greater than that from Italy, but it is for consideration whether Italian attitude generally, the massing of troops in Libya and information contained in telegrams Nos. 552 and 555 from British Minister to Mr. Eden do not at least temporarily call for special measures being Undertaken for the defence of Egypt.4. The outstanding deficiency is the total absence of anti-aircraft guns and searchlights in either Egypt or Palestine, and we would urge most strongly that a complete anti-aircraft brigade should be sent out now.5. Naval Situation. The present distribution of ships is generally favourable for opening moves as set forth in Interim appreciation J.P. 233. If H.M.S. Repidse were sent to Gibraltar the two Battle Cruisers, one Mediter-ranean and one Home Fleet Flotilla would be available for escorting H.M.S. Furious with fighter aircraft for Egypt. The remaining forces in ^SLgean could be.moved to Egypt for protection of Canal and Alexandria. Net defences in British ship Thistlegarth and H.M.S. Protector and ammunition in A.S.I.S. Churruca are now in Eastern Mediterranean.6. The question of H.M.S. Glorious requires immediate consideration. The present arrangement is that H.M.S. Glorious should leave Malta for United Kingdom on the 25th October with three Torpedo Spotter Reconnaissance and all her fighter aircraft, the remainder being disembarked at Malta. If the situation is considered serious, it is recommended that H.M.S. Gloriotis should proceed to Alexandria forthwith, which would allow two alternatives, according to develop-ment of the situation, (a) If delay in arrival of H.M.S. Glorious in United Kingdom can be accepted, then H.M.S. Glorious should retain her aircraft on board, (b) If H.M.S. Glorious must adhere to her present programme, then all her aircraft to be disembarked in Egypt. If the latter course were adopted the air situation might be further strengthened by sending out H.M.S. Courageous to replace H.M.S. Glorious.7. Military Situation. As regards precautionary measures on land the General Officer Commanding is of opinion that, in view of changed situation in Italian preparations in Libya, paragraph 26 of Appendix A to General Staff War Office Note No. 1 on the situation in the Middle East in the event of a unilateral war with Italy and importance of forestalling the Italians at Matruh, the following immediate action should be taken.8. Firstly, he should be given authority to approach Egyptian Government in conjunction&apos;with Embassy with a view to (a) moving forthwith Egyptian troops as garrison to Matruh in order to restore and maintain defences at that place, (b) obtain their agreement to establishment of coast defences ex Thistlegarth at Alexandria. Secondly, he should be given authority to move British troops to Matruh and Suez at his discretion and to establish at once at former place a depot to contain approximately 14 days&apos; supplies and stores of all natures. Thirdly, he considered immediate despatch of anti-gas stores and of at least one portable distilling plant for use at Matruh to be essential.9. Air Situation. An essential emergency precaution is to lay down supplies of petrol and bombs in western desert. Air Officer Commanding Middle East requests authority to proceed at once with construction of dumps, starting at Mersa Matruh.
10. In view of deterioration in the Palestine situation with the possibility of having to reinforce that country by numbers 6 and 33 squadrons Air Officer Commanding Middle East considers one Vincent Squadron in Iraq should now be placed at short notice to reinforce Egypt.11. Concerning proposal to garrison searchlights and anti-aircraft guns referred to in paragraph 4 above, it would be most advantageous to have one fighter squadron sent to Egypt before outbreak of hostilities.12. A copy of this telegram has been handed to British Minister, who is telegraphing his views to Foreign Office.   1603/16.Enclosure No. 2 to Annex I.Copy of a telegram from the Commander-in-chief, Mediterranean (2Vo./30), dated october 16, 1937, to the Admiralty.PERSONAL for First Sea Lord.When we commenced our discussion this morning there was a general feeling that international situation might develop unfavourably in the near future, and it soon became apparent that there was a considerable state of unpreparedness in certain directions. I therefore suggested, and General Officer Commanding and Air Officer Commanding concurred, that it was- desirable to suggest certain immediate action as contained in my 1603 16th October. We are now considering interim appreciation J.P. 233, but it was immediately apparent that it was essential to have much more detailed information than that available here as to what fast and slow convoy transports contain. General Officer Commanding has wired to War Office for the information which I hope will be sent immediately, as otherwise our deliberations will be held up. First Lord has seen my 1603 16th October.-0003/17.Enclosure No. 3 to Annex I.Copy of a Telegram from Mr. Kelly (Alexandria) (No. 568), dated October 16, 1937, to the Foreign Office.COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF&apos;S most secret telegram to Chiefs of Staff, the 16th October.I very strongly support general principle underlying service recommenda-tions, namely, that any measures contemplated for serious emergency should be anticipated as far as possible and as soon as possible.2. I consider specific proposals in Commander-in-chief&apos;s telegram should present no local political difficulty, though I understand proposed anti-aircraft units and pilots for additional aircraft might increase total personnel of land and air forces respectively above treaty limits.3. Should this be so, there are two courses open : (a) if excess is very small, say nothing to Egyptians; (b) if excess is important, inform the Egyptian Government of measures in progress, stating if circumstances require that, in opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, apprehended international emergency exists.4. From various recent conversations with Makram and Nahas Pasha I feel they are in a mood in which they are unlikely to raise objections. If we adopt course (a) and the Egyptian Government themselves enquire what is numerical effect of reinforcements when they arrive, I. should admit the fact after verification, but say excess was so trifling that it had not been realised.5. As regards movement of Egyptian troops to Mersa Matruh referred to in paragraph 8, Nahas Pasha informed me at lunch to-day that head of military mission had this morning advised the Minister of War in the same sense. Prime Minister said . he  approved,   but  desired  opinion  of  the  General  Officer
Enclosure No. 4 to Annex I.Addressed to Commander-in-chief, Mediterranean (and for General Officer Commanding and Air Officer Commanding).(Immediate.)PERSONAL from First Sea Lord.Your 1603/16 and 0003/17. Chiefs of Staff do not consider military situation has become more serious during the last two months. Movement of troops to Libya has been long foreseen and is not considered to have brought about new situation. Political situation remains uncertain pending result of international discussions now taking place. No immediate action such as proposed in your telegram therefore considered necessary due to existing military situation. You will receive early instructions informing you whether anticipated developments in near future justify reinforcements being sent you. Meanwhile, no action on your proposals in paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 of your 1603/16 should be taken.ANNEX II.Telegram Addressed to General Officer Commanding, Egypt (and /or Commander-in-chief, Mediterranean, and Air Officer Commanding).(Immediate.)PERSONAL from the C.I.G.S.In continuation of First Sea Lord&apos;s telegram in reply to Commander-in-chief, Mediterranean, telegrams Nos. 1603/16 and 0003/17 of the 16th October, the Chiefs of Staff sympathise with your anxieties resulting from the weakness of forces available for the defence of Egypt. They recognise that the provision of fighter aircraft and A.A. defences for Egypt is eminently desirable, and would be a valuable factor in establishing confidence in Egypt and stabilising the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean. In present conditions, however, while our forces are still in course of development, their distribution has to be considered in the light of the international situation as a whole.2. The Cabinet has decided that the political situation vis-a-vis Italy has not deteriorated at the present time to such an extent as to warrant a departure from the present policy.3. In these circumstances, the Chiefs of Staff cannot at the moment send you the anti-aircraft guns and searchlights asked for in paragraph 4 of the Commander-in-chief, Mediterranean, telegram No. 1603/16.4. With reference to paragraphs 5 and 6 of the above telegram, the Chiefs of Staff do not consider that any change in the fleet movements, or as regards Glorious need take place, and that the programme of that ship should proceed as arranged.5. As regards paragraph 8 (a), if General Officer Commanding is consulted by Egyptian Government with a view to sending Egyptian troops and suppliesCommanding. As regards coast defences, I understand heads of services will propose Egyptians should be asked to take over coast defences, Alexandria and Mersa Matruh, and that they should be lent guns now with naval mobile base in Alexandria harbour on lines proposed in your telegram No. 459.6. If, as I hope, discretion for movement of British troops to Matruh and Suez be given the General Officer Commanding, it will clearly be advisable to keep the Egyptian Government fully informed beforehand, although under strict terms of treaty there is no limitation on movement of British forces pending move to Canal Zone.
to Mersa Matruh, he should give every encouragement to the proposal, but the movements of British troops suggested in this paragraph should not take place without further reference to the War Office.6. As regards paragraph 8 (&amp;), no action should be taken to approach the Egyptian Government regarding coast defences ex Thistle garth, since these may be a useful bargaining counter in negotiations for dock at Alexandria.7. Reference paragraphs 10 and 11 of Commander-in-chief&apos;s telegram, the Chiefs of Staff cannot authorise the proposals of Air Officer Commanding, Middle East.8. Further consideration is being given by the Committee of Imperial Defence to the remaining proposals contained in Commander-in-chief&apos;s telegram, and a further telegram will be sent in due course.
THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENT: Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   October 1937.? SECRET. Copy No.    4j[COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the DRAFT Minutes of the SOOth Meeting, held on October- 28, 1937-******(6)-SITUATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN AND MIDDLE EAST-Egypt, Cyprus, Malta (Proposed Battalions).(C.I.D. Paper No. 1364-B.)i (Previous Reference : OLD. Minutes of the 299th Meeting, Minute 6 : also for Egypt, 298th Meeting Minute 1; for Cyprus, 294th Meeting, Minute 4.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on the situation in the Mediterranean and the Middle East (OLD-Paper No. 1364-B).LORD CHATFIELD, introducing the Report at the request of the Chairman, began by recalling the course of events which had led up to its preparation.The Chiefs of Staff had been instructed by the Cabinet to consider what step&amp; &apos;of a military character could be taken with a view to increasing our prestige in the Near and Middle East, and their views were summarised in paragraph 23 of the Report under consideration. As stated in paragraph 6, the Chiefs of Staff emphasised the deplorable military position existing in Egypt at the present time. There were no anti-aircraft defences or fighter aircraft at present in that country and no reinforcements could reach Egypt in under six weeks after the outbreak of war, and very few even then within that period. The measures which the Chiefs of Staff now recommended should be taken were referred to in paragraphs 13 to 20 of the Report and summarised in paragraph 23 (e).THE CHAIRMAN said that the Cabinet, at their meeting the previous day, had reached the following conclusion* regarding certain of the measures referred to in the Report of the Chiefs of Staff : &apos;&apos;&apos; that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should be authorised to instruct the Charge d&apos;Affaires in Egypt to express his concurrence in proposals by the Egyptian Government for military defensive precautions inside Egypt such as moving Egyptian (but not British) troops and stores to Mersa Metruh and the formation of dumps of stores and munitions at convenient points.&quot;Mr. DUFF COOPER said that, as a result of his recent visit to the Mediterranean, he had returned with similar feelings as his predecessor had expressed after a similar visit, regarding the deficiencies in our military preparations in that area. It would be noted that in their telegram dated the 16th October, 1937 (Enclosure No. 1 to Annex No. 1) the Local Commanders considered that the situation had deteriorated and that certain steps should be taken immediately to strengthen our position vis-a-vis Italy.  In paragraph 2 (iii)* Cabinet 39 (37), Minute 5. [16061-1] b
of the Report by the Chiefs of Staff note was taken of the opinion of the Foreign Office that the political situation in the Mediterranean at the present time was such as to justify further measures to increase the security of Egypt against Italian aggression- The proposals by the Chiefs of Staff now before the Committee hardly seemed in keeping with the views on the situation expressed by the Local Commanders and by the Foreign Office. It seemed unsound to allow day-to-day changes in our relations vis-a-vis Italy to affect our policy. It had been suggested that there were only two alternatives open to us, either to make friends with Italy and to take no obtrusive steps for improving our defences or to abandon our attempts to improve our relations with Italy, but to strengthen our military position as rapidly as possible. A more satisfactory course seemed to be for us to make friends with Italy and at the same time to do everything we could to strengthen our military position in the Mediterranean. In this connection unobtrusive measures would have little value, and we should be far more likely to impress Italy by taking overt measures for improving our military position. It appeared, moreover, that a unilateral war with Italy was unlikely since it was most improbable that Mussolini would venture on hostilities unless certain of the support of Germany. It seemed, therefore, a mistaken policy to conclude that we must do nothing which would weaken our position at Home vis-a-vis Germany, since anything which we could do to improve our military strength in the Mediterranean would also, indirectly, improve our position against Germany. The Egyptian Authorities had shown themselves particularly well disposed towards us at the present time and were keenly alive to the Italian menace. Nahas Pasha and Makram Pasha, in the course of conversation, had intimated that no reasonable financial considerations would debar the Egyptian Government from improving the defence of their country once they knew what was required of them. In addition to the measures proposed by the Chiefs of Staff in the Report it seemed desirable that we should hasten negotiations with the Egyptian Government regarding the establishment of a Naval Base at Alexandria. An early decision on the future of Cyprus was also required. We might, moreover, request the Governor and Commander-in-chief at Malta to give the views of the three Service Commanders as to the requirements for the defence of that fortress, including the cost involved. There was at present complete agreement between the three Services on the spot on this question and, if requested, the Governor would render a Report at very short notice.THE CHAIRMAN observed that an Inter-Service Report on the defence requirements of Malta had already been received and was now under considera-tion by the Joint Overseas and Home Defence Sub-Committee.LORD S WIN TON said that important political issues had been raised by the First Lord of the Admiralty.It was, of course, true that all three Services were anxious to have complete security both at Home and in the Mediterranean. As far as Air Forces were concerned, and apart from a programme of aircraft re-equipment in the Middle East now in progress, it would be impossible materially to strengthen our position in Egypt without weakening the Air Forces available at Home for defence against Germany. The Chiefs of Staff had recommended that any increase which might be made to our military strength in Egypt should be limited to what could be done without weakening ourselves at Home vis-a-vis Germany. He (Lord Swinton) could not share the view expressed by the First Lord that by strengthening our forces in the Mediterranean we should at the same time be strengthening ourselves against Germany. The Prime Minister had laid down that our main preoccupation should be the building up of our defensive position at Home. The stronger we were against Germany, the less likelihood there was of Italy embarking in war against us.SIR ROBERT VANSITTART agreed and said that opinions in some quarters inclined to the view that it would be to the interest of Germany to embroil us with Italy in the Mediterranean, and then seize the opportunity of embarking on some venture in Central Europe.SIR JOHN SIMON said that the political aspect of the Mediterranean situation had recently been brought before the Cabinet. The Local Commanders, in their telegram dated the 16th October, had expiration^essed the view that the political
situation &apos;&apos; appeared to have deteriorated considerably during the last few days.&apos;&apos; These views, and the measures which they had proposed to improve our military position, had been considered by the Chiefs of Staff, who had meanwhile sent a reassuring telegram to the Local Commanders (Enclosure No. 4 to Annex I), in which they stated : &apos;&apos; The Chiefs of Staff do not consider military situation has become more serious during the last two months.&quot;LORD CBATFIELD recalled that before the Recess the Prime Minister had called for an investigation as to what measures it would be necessary to take in the Mediterranean in anticipation of a possible rapid deterioration of the situation during the holidays. The decision then taken had been that nothing obtrusive was to be done. The Admiralty and the War Office had, however, been authorised to take certain steps, and these, in fact, had been carried out. Although the Chiefs of Staff viewed with concern the existing lack of defences in Egypt, nothing had occurred since the examination of the position in July to warrant the opinion that the military situation had deteriorated.THE CHAIRMAN remarked that the Cabinet were now asking the Chiefs of Staff what steps, if any, could be taken which would demonstrate that we, as well as other countries, could make a show of military strength. The recommen-dations by the Chiefs of Staff now before the Committee were not related to the general question of strengthening our position in the Mediterranean and Middle East. To say that by strengthening our position in the Mediterranean we were, at the same time, also improving our position at Home against Germany was true only if we had sufficient resources to meet our commitments in both these areas. This was unfortunately not the case.SIR ROBERT VANSITTART suggested that the Foreign Office should consult His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires in Egypt as to the advisability of using the proposal for transferring 6-inch guns to the Egyptian Authorities as a bargaining factor in connection with negotiations concerning harbour improve-ments and the provision of a dock at Alexandria, as referred to in para-graph 23 (iii). Having in mind the present accommodating attitude of the Egyptian Authorities towards us, this line of approach might be deemed by the Charge d&apos;Affaires to be inappropriate at the present moment and liable to cause offence to the Egyptians.LORD CHATFIELD said that the provision of a dock at Alexandria was a most important question, upon which a decision regarding the establishment of docking and i-epair facilities at Cyprus would depend.Mr. DUFF COOPER suggested that the present attitude of the Egyptian Government afforded a favourable opportunity for pressing on with these important negotiations.SIR ROBERT VANSITTART suggested that authority might be given to the General Officer Commanding to move British Troops to Mersa Matruh at his discretion.SIR CYRIL DEVERELL said that the movement of British Troops to the Western Desert was not favoured by the Egyptian Authorities. Mersa Matruh, where British Troops had been stationed in great discomfort during the Abyssinian crisis for nearly a year, was an unsatisfactory place for our Troops. In emergency these could be moved there very quickly either by railway or motor transport.LORD SWINTON suggested that the present time might be favourable for re-opening with the Egyptian Authorities the question of the strength of our garrison and air forces now limited by the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. The situation might arise when we might have to despatch one or even two battalions from Egypt. Moreover, we were at present debarred from establishing a strategical air reserve in that country. It might now be possible to induce the Egyptian Government to offer us more facilities.SIR ROBERT VANSITTART was inclined to favour the proposal. Referring to paragraph 8 of the telegram from the Local Commanders (Enclosure No. 1 to Annex I); he suggested that authority should be given to establish at Mersa Matruh a depot containing approximately 14 days&apos; supplies.[16061-1]     - b 2
SIR CYRIL DEVERELL said that there were no objections to the establish-ment of 14 days&apos; supplies at Mersa Matruh as suggested. If the proposals now put forward were approved, the intention was to build up Mersa Matruh as a defended base which would be manned by Egyptian Troops, who would probably welcome the opportunity of doing something on their own account.LORD ZETLAND said that he wished to sound a note of caution regarding the question of the reinforcement of Egypt from India. It would be recalled that the Committee of Imperial Defence at their Meeting^ held on the 29th July, had agreed &apos;&apos; To invite the Secretary of State for India to inform the Government of India that, for the time being, reinforcements for Egypt should be given priority over all other reinforcement commitments which the Government of India have conditionally accepted.&quot;The Government of India had been duly informed accordingly, but since then the first priority accorded to Egypt had gone by the board, and Indian reinforcements had been sent to the Far East. Provided that no further demands arose from that direction and the situation in India itself did not deteriorate, it would still be possible to despatch the reinforcements to Egypt as originally contemplated. If, however, further demands were made for the despatch of troops to the Far East, or there were trouble in India, it might not be possible to meet a sudden commit-ment in Egypt.SIR MAURICE HANKEY enquired whether the anti-gas stores and distilling plant for use at Mersa Matruh, referred to in paragraph 8 of the Local Commanders&apos; telegram of the 16th October, had been despatched.Mr. HORE-BELISHA replied that some of these stores had already been despatched, and the remainder were now being sent.SIR MAURICE HANKEY asked whether the. decision regarding the measures to be taken should be communicated to the Local Commanders in the form of an order, or as giving the latter authority to take, the necessary steps at their own discretion..THE CHAIRMAN replied that instructions should be made permissive within the discretion of the Local Commanders.Mr. HORE-BELISHA said that, while he appreciated that it would be unsound to denude Great Britain of anti-aircraft defences for the benefit of Egypt, &quot;the anti-aircraft position in that country remained most unsatisfactory. In reviewing our general position regarding defence against air attack, it might be possible to include consideration of the position in Egypt.SIR COSMO PARKINSON said that the Secretary of State for the Colonies much regretted his inability to be present at the meeting. The Secretary of State had wished to put forward a proposal regarding Cyprus apart from that of the establishment of a naval base. The question of raising a Cypriot battalion had first been put forward in 1936 and although the War Office had at that time not favoured the project, it had been raised again and the War Office were now re-examining the question. Although the Colony would not be able to sustain the cost, any local battalion which might be raised would be available for service outside Cyprus in an emergency. Moreover, Cyprus offered a good potential recruiting ground.Mr. HORE-BELISHA said that the question raised by Sir Cosmo Parkinson and also the question of raising a Maltese battalion were now under consideration by the Army Council. It was most desirable in principle to use all the available man-power in the Empire. Moreover, such a measure as now proposed would prevent young Cypriots and Maltese from joining Fascist or Communist Organisations. Since the Army Council now had the matter under consideration, it did not seem that anything further could be usefully done at the present time within the Committee of Imperial Defence.* c.I.D. 298th Meeting, Minute 1 (iii).
Conclusions. The Committee oe Imperial Defence agreed (a) To accord general approval to the Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on the military measures which might be taken at the present time with a view to increasing our prestige in the Near and Middle East (C.I.D. Paper No. 1364-B);(b) To take note of the following conclusion recorded by the Cabinet at their meeting* held on the 27th October : &quot; That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should be authorised to instruct the Charge d&apos;Affaires in Egypt to express his concurrence with proposals by the Egyptian Government for military defensive precautions inside Egypt, such as moving Egyptian (but not British) troops and stores to Mersa Matruh and the formation of dumps of stores and munitions at convenient points &apos;&apos;;(c) To request the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to instruct theCharge d&apos;Affaires in Egypt to take up the following specific questions with the Egyptian Government as soon as possible : (i) The disembarkation and storage ashore at Alexandria of the anti-torpedo nets now in S.S. Thistlegarth;(ii) The transfer of the coast defence guns and searchlights now inS.S. Thistlegarth to the Egyptian Authorities with a view to their installation in due course at Alexandria and ultimate manning by Egyptian personnel as soon as the latter can be trained. In this connection His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires should also be requested to advise whether or not it would be appropriate at the present time, in view of the existing accommodating attitude of the Egyptian Government, to use the transfer of the guns and searchlights as a bargaining factor in connection with negotiations concerning harbour improvements and the provision of a dock at Alexandria; (iii) The storage in Egypt of 4 6-inch guns, 6 searchlights, and the necessary ammunition at present held at Malta for the defence of the Canal terminal ports. Since no part of the Suez Canal Defence Plan has yet been divulged to the Egyptian Govern-ment, no indication of the intending use of this equipment should be given at this juncture, and it should be alluded to as reserve equipment for British Forces in Egypt. For a similar reason, it would be more appropriate for the equipment to be stored at Alexandria than the otherwise more satisfactory Suez Canal area.(iv) The disembarkation and storage in Egypt of ammunition for thegun defences of Alexandria now in S.S. Churrucha; (v) The restoration of the defences at Mersa Matruh, including the repair of the harbour facilities.(d) To invite the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to consider whetherthe present time was favourable for re-opening with the Egyptian Authorities the question of the strength of our garrison in Egypt, with a view to requesting the Egyptian Government to offer us more facilities than we at present enjoy under the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty;(e) With regard to paragraphs 8 and 9 of the telegram from the local commanders in Egypt, dated the 16th October, 1937 (Enclosure No. 1 to Annex I) (i) The War Office should give the General Officer Commanding British Troops in Egypt discretion to establish at Mersa Matruh a depot containing approximately 14 days&apos; supplies and stores of all natures;* Cabinet, 39 (37), Minute 5.
(ii) The Air Ministry should give the Air Officer Commanding, Middle East, discretion to establish petrol and bomb dumps in the Western Desert, on the understanding that he and the General Officer Commanding are satisfied as to their security,(/) To take note that the anti-gas stores and portable distilling plant for use at Mersa Matruh, referred to in paragraph 8 of the telegram from the Local Commanders, dated the 16th October, 1937, have been despatched by the War Office;(g) To take note that the questions of raising Cypriot and Maltese &quot;battalionsare under consideration by the Army Council;(h) To take note that the existing unsatisfactory situation arising from the lack of any anti-aircraft defences in Egypt at the present time would be taken into consideration when our AA. defences as a whole are reviewed;(i) To take note of the caveat by the Secretary of State for India that thedespatch of reinforcements to Egypt, to the extent originally agreed upon,* i.e., one brigade, was now conditional on there being no further demand for reinforcements for the Far East, and no deterioration of the situation in India itself; (j) That the Chiefs of Staffs Report (C.I.D. Paper No. 1364-B), together with the foregoing record of the discussion thereon, should be submitted to the Cabinet.******2 Whitehall Gardens, S. W. 1, October 28, 1937.* C.I.D. 298th Meeting, Minute 1 (ii).
