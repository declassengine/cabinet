THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERRENT&quot;.SECRET COPY NO.C .P. 272(37)CABINET.Proposed. Conveyancing Amendment  (Scotland) Bill. MEMORANDUM by the Secretary ef State for Scotland.1,     I desire authority to prepare and submit to the Committee of Home Affairs a Bill making certain amendments in the law relating to Conveyancing in Scotland.2,     I have had under consideration, in consultation with theLord Advocate, the question of legislation to meet a number of suggestions which have&apos; been put forward by various legal bodies in Scotland with a view to the making of certain improvements in the law relating to Conveyancing.     The Conveyancing (Scotland) Act, 1924, was passed with the object of simplifying and modernising various branches of the Scottish law of Heritable Property.     The experience gained during the last thirteen years has disclosed various matters of detail in which improvement is highly desirable in^the interests of simplicity and economy, and various minor defects have emerged in connection with decisions of the Courts. The proposed Bill will embody the recommendations of the pro-fession in Scotland, and it is anticipated that it will be possible to present it with their unanimous approval. Opposition is highly improbable in view of the technical character of the subject matter.3.     In my opinion the proposed Bill might properly be introduced in the House of Lords.W, E, E.Scottish Office.12th November, 1937.
