THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1937.SECRET. Copy No. 4CP. 269 (37).CABINET.POLICY IN PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.IN a recent paper (OP. 232 (37)) I referred to the necessity for framing proposals for a constructive policy in Palestine based upon (1) the Cabinets acceptance in principle of the main recommendations of the Royal Commission, and (2) the authority obtained from the Council of the League of Nations to proceed with the further investigation of the question of partition. -2. It will be remembered that the recent Statement of Policy (Command 5513) contained no reference to the action which it was intended to take in the event of failure to secure the active co-operation of either Jews or Arabs or both and that the terms of the resolution passed in the House of Commons last July were not free from ambiguity. The resolutions passed by the Zionist Congress, the Jewish Agency Council, the Permanent Mandates Commission and the Council and Assembly of the League of Nations were equally indefinite. Extracts from recent statements and resolutions are appended for convenience of reference (Appendix II).3. These facts together with the obvious difficulties inherent in the details of the Royal Commission^ partition plan and the impossibility, pending further investigations, of demonstrating that partition is a practicable proposition have created in the minds not only of the Arabs but also of some Jews and in the world at large an atmosphere of uncertainty and obscurity which can only encourage false hopes in the minds of the opponents of partition and greatly prejudice the prospects of successful consultations.4. I suggest, therefore, that it is urgently necessary to impress upon the world at large certain implications of the acceptance in principle by His Majesty&apos;s Government of Part III of the Report of the Royal Commission. Moreover, Parliament is sitting, and questions are constantly being put to me; for this reason also it is desirable that our policy should be clarified in a public statement at an early date.5. As regards procedure, I would suggest that any statement which it may be decided to issue might be embodied most conveniently in an open despatch to the High Commissioner, which could be given early publicity in Palestine and simultaneously published in this country in the form of a Command Paper. I append to this memorandum (Appendix I) the draft of a despatch which embodies my own views and which is, I hope, sufficiently self-explanatory. A few points, however, call for special comment.6. So far as the Jews are concerned, it is reasonable to expect that their co-operation will be forthcoming in the course of the investigations of the proposed new Commission, although, in view of the attitude of the Zionist Congress and the Jewish Agency Council, there can be no certainty of their agreement to any particular scheme that may be evolved.7. With the exception of the Amir Abdulla, Arabs in Palestine and surrounding countries have rejected the partition proposal in vehement if not violent terms, and there are at present no signs of the development of moderate Arab opinion, though there have been some slight indications recently, e.g., the[161171 b*
comparative failure of the Bludan Conference and the more moderate attitude of the new Iraqi Government, that enthusiasm for the cause of the Palestine Arabs in surrounding- Arab countries may be tending to wane. Ibn Saud, though known to be opposed to partition, has maintained a &apos;&apos; correct&apos;&apos; attitude in spite of embarrassing pressure.Those Arabs who do not demand the expulsion of the Jews from Palestine or their extermination in a Holy War demand an independent Arab Palestine (either standing alone or federated with surrounding Arab countries) in which the Jews would be tolerated as a minority of the population of Palestine. They are unwilling to recognise the continuance of British rule in the Holy Cities or in any part of Palestine and demand an independent Arab Government over the whole of Palestine.8. The demands of the Arab Higher Committee were summarised as follows in a memorandum which was submitted to the Permanent Mandates Commission last July :  &quot; The Arab Higher Committee, therefore, urges that the only solution compatible with justice and a true desire for peace in the land must be based on the following principles : (1) The recognition of the right of the Arabs to complete independence in their own land. (2) The cessation of the experiment of the Jewish National Home. (3) The cessation of the British mandate and its replacement by a treatysimilar to treaties existing between Britain and Iraq, Britain and egypt, and between France and Syria, creating in Palestine a sovereign State.(4) The immediate cessation of all Jewish immigration and of land-sales to Jews pending the negotiation and conclusion of the Treaty.The Arabs are prepared to negotiate, in a reasonable spirit, the conditions under which reasonable British interests shall be safeguarded; to approve the necessary guarantees for the preservation and right of access to all Holy Places and for the protection of all legitimate rights of the Jewish population or other minorities in Palestine.&quot;At the same time, the National Defence Party, representing more moderate views, submitted a memorandum which concluded with the following proposal:  &apos;&apos; The Party wishes to assert once again that maintenance of peace and tranquillity in this Holy Land cannot be realized unless the natural rights of the Arabs in their country are fully realized by the termination of the Mandate, which the Royal Commission has found on enquiry to be impracticable-able, and by the setting up of an independent Sovereign State in which the whole Palestinian population would be adequately represented, insuring at the same time all lawful rights of the minority by constitutional guarantees. This Sovereign State will be bound with the British Government through a Treaty in accordance with the precedent set in Iraq on the understanding that the ratio which at present exists between the Arab and Jewish population will not be altered.&quot;It is clear to me that there is no prospect of acceptance by the Jews of the demands of either of these bodies and that they could not possibly be entertained by His Majesty&apos;s Government. Nor would they stand much chance of being accepted by the League of Nations.9. So far as the Arabs of Palestine are concerned, recent occurrences have ,. resulted in a complete severance of relations between those who have acted hitherto as political leaders and the Palestine Government. The firm action which has recently been taken will, it is hoped, at least convince the Arabs that His Majesty&apos;s Government are not to be shaken from their policy by a campaign of terrorism and assassination; and, assuming that a body of moderate Arab opinion exists in Palestine, we need not dismiss the possibility of securing its co-operation in the work of the Commission, if the false hopes nursed by the Arabs can be dispelled by a clear declaration of the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and if they no longer fear the activities of the Mufti and the terrorist organization.
10. Before the publication of the Report of the Royal Commission the possibility was entertained of associating representatives of neighbouring Arab countries in future negotiations with a view to counteracting the influence of the extremist leaders in Palestine. The Governments and peoples of those countries have, however, shown themselves to be no less hostile to our policy or any policy likely to be acceptable either to His Majesty&apos;s Government or to the League, than the Palestinian Arabs, and recent events in Palestine have necessitated the suppression of the leading local political organization. In the circumstances, I suggest that there is nothing to be gained by inviting the co-operation of Arabs outside Palestine (with the exception of the Amir Abdulla) and that in the working out of the scheme of partition we should make it clear that we shall deal with the Arabs of Palestine and Trans-Jordan alone, and, if their co-operation is not forthcoming, settle the matter over their heads. We are committed to receiving any representations or suggestions which the Rulers of Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the Yemen may see fit to make, but this does not involve their continuous association in the work of the Commission.11. I appreciate the risk that the adoption of the definite attitude outlined in the draft despatch may temporarily accentuate Arab hostility in the countries surrounding Palestine. I am, however, convinced that our acceptance of the arguments contained in the Report of the Royal Commission and of the conclusion that partition is the best and most hopeful solution of the problem absolutely precludes us from any compromise with the demands of the Arab world within and without Palestine which involve at the.best the toleration of the Jews in Palestine as a permanent minority. The present uncertainty as to the implications-tions of our policy and as to our ultimate intentions can only tend, in my opinion, to increase Arab intransigeance, and it is at least permissible to hope that this clearer definition of policy which I propose may lead them to realise the strict limitations of any settlement acceptable either to His Majesty&apos;s Government or to the League of Nations.12. I need only add that as regards the proposed new Commission I would propose to take up the. question of personnel and procedure when it is clear that the conditions in Palestine are such as to enable the Commission to discharge its functions.W. O. G.Colonial Office, November 9. 1937.[16117]
APPENDIX I.Draft of Proposed Despatch to A cting High Commissioner for Palestine.Sir,I HAVE the honour to inform you that His Majesty&apos;s Government have had under consideration the Statement of Policy in Palestine issued in July last (Command 5513) and the conclusions to be drawn from the resolutions on the subject which have been passed first by the House of Commons and more recently by the Permanent Mandates Commission and the Council and Assembly of the League of Nations. A memorandum containing relevant extracts from the State-ment of Policy and the resolutions in question, and containing also extracts from recent Ministerial statements is enclosed for convenience of referenced2. In the first place, I desire to make it clear that the resolutions mentioned above involve no modification of the policy expressed in the Command Paper. That policy still stands, and, as a result of the discussions at Geneva, His Majesty&apos;s Government now feel justified in undertaking the investigations required for the preparation of a scheme of partition on the general lines recom-mended in Part III of the Report of the Royal Commission, on the understanding that any such scheme, if regarded as equitable and practicable by His Majesty&apos;s Government, will be referred to the League of Nations for confirmation.3. In the second place, I feel that it is necessary to emphasise certain implications of the acceptance in principle by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the recommendations contained in Part III of the Report of the Royal Commission, and to dispel, if possible, the uncertainty which appears to exist in some quarters with regard to the course of action which His Majesty&apos;s Government have in view.4. The first point I desire to emphasise is that it follows from their acceptance in principle of the recommendations contained in Part III of the Report that His Majesty&apos;s Government have no intention of enforcing any solution which would involve now or in future the assignment either to the Jewish com-munity in Palestine of a permanent minority position under an Arab Government in an independent Arab Palestine, or to the Arabs in Palestine of a permanent minority position under a Jewish Government in an independent Jewish Palestine.In the circumstances, His Majesty&apos;s Government regard a scheme of tripartite division on the lines recommended by the Royal Commission as the best and! most hopeful solution of the problem indeed, ultimately, the only possible solution and if, as a result of the investigations which are now to take place, a scheme of partition on those lines is regarded as equitable and practicable by His Majesty&apos;s Government and is confirmed by the Council of the League, it will be put into force.5. Secondly, I must make it clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government do not regard the recommendations of the Royal Commission (a) for partition and (b) for the setting up of independent Arab and Jewish States as indissolubly connected and necessarily synchronous. Quite apart from the possibility, on which emphasis has been laid by the Permanent Mandates Commission, that either or both of the communities, when separately organised, may require a period of political apprenticeship before undertaking the full responsibilities of self-government, it is obvious that the establishment of independent States presupposes the willing co-operation of the peoples concerned.If a scheme of partition is approved and the co-operation of Arabs or Jews or both is not forthcoming, the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government will be to proceed nevertheless with the partition of the country, and to administer separately under mandatory control the area or areas in which it is not found possible to establish independent States.6. As regards immediate procedure, you are already aware of the proposal to appoint a further Commission to visit Palestine for the purpose of conducting enquiries on the spot and of submitting to Plis Majesty&apos;s Government proposals* Appendix II.
for a detailed scheme of partition. I wish to lay emphasis on the point that the functions of the new Commission will be confined to working out a scheme of partition and that it will not be within its province to consider evidence or representations which are not relevant to that proposal.7.   The terms of reference of the Commission will be as follows :  &apos;&apos; Taking into account the plan of partition outlined in Part III of the Report of the Royal Commission, but with full liberty to suggest modifica-tions of that plan, including variation of the areas recommended for temporary retention under British Mandate,And taking into account any representations of the communities in Palestine and Trans-Jordan (i) to recommend boundaries for the proposed Arab and Jewish areas and the enclaves to be retained permanently or temporarily under British Mandate, which will-(a) afford a reasonable prospect of the establishment of self-supporting Arab and Jewish States,(b) necessitate the inclusion of the fewest possible Arabs andArab enterprises in the Jewish area and vice versa, and(c) enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to carry out the Mandatoryresponsibilities the assumption of which is recommended in the Report of the Royal Commission, including the obligations imposed by Article 28 of the Mandate as regards the Holy Places;(ii) to make recommendations with regard to the economic and financialadjustments which are involved in partition, including (a) the allocation of the public debt of Palestine and the mannerin which any other &apos; financial obligations legitimately incurred by the Administration of Palestine during the period of the Mandate &apos; should be honoured in accordance with Article 28 thereof;(b) the administration of the railways, ports, postal, telegraphand telephone services;(c) currency arrangements;(d) Customs administration and tariffs;(e) the amount of any inter-State subventions or subventions fromthe British Exchequer which may be required; (/) the preservation of the rights of Civil Servants in accordance with the provisions of Article 28 of the Mandate;(g) the treatment of industrial concessions;(h) exchange of land and population;(i) the provision of effective safeguards for the rights of religious or racial minorities in the areas to be allocated to Arabs and Jews respectively, including the protection of religious rights and properties.&quot;8. I will communicate with you further in due course on the subject of the personnel of the Commission and its procedure.I have, &amp;c.APPENDIX II.Summary of recent Statements and Resolutions.1. Statement of Policy.In the Statement of Policy of July 1937 (Command 5513) it was stated that His Majesty&apos;s Government had been driven to the conclusion &quot; that a scheme of partition on the general lines recommended by the Commission represents the best and most hopeful solution of the deadlock.....&quot;[16117] b 3
&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government, therefore, propose to take such steps as are necessary and appropriate .... to obtain freedom to give effect to a scheme of partition, to which they earnestly hope that it may be possible to secure an effective measure of consent on the part of the communities concerned.&quot;2. Parliament.The House of Commons passed a resolution to the following effect:  &quot; That the proposals contained in Command Paper No. 5513 relating to Palestine should be brought before the League of Nations with a view to enabling His Majesty&apos;s Government, after adequate enquiry, to present to Parliament a definite scheme taking into full account all the recommendations of the Command Paper.&quot;3. Statements by Mr. Ormsby Gore before Permanent Mandates Commission.&quot; What I ask is that you should advise the Council that, in the light of our experience and our knowledge of Palestine, a solution on the lines of partition should be explored as the best and most hopeful solution of what the mandatory Power is itself convinced is, in fact, a deadlock. I do not ask you to approve a scheme of partition, or to settle these questions of defence, minorities, &amp;c. All I ask you is to recommend that the door should not be closed to a solution by partition. I ask you to open the door and not to close it. I do not ask the Mandates Commission to commit itself finally, but to allow the mandatory Power to explore the solution which it thinks best in the circumstances, and to produce for the League in due course a more definite scheme for your later consideration.. ...&quot; It was his belief that, in view of the actual wording of the Royal Commission^ report, and in view of the mandatory Power&apos;s declaration, that a deadlock had arisen, and that its hopes of seeing Palestine evolve into a self-governing State, where Jews and Arabs would have reconciled their differences, had not been fulfilled, and in view of the fact that neighbouring Arab States had intervened, and in view of all the efforts sincerely made to work the mandate as drafted, he was satisfied that no British Government could administer Palestine on the basis of the existing mandate without considerable alterations.....&apos;&apos; The idea that it would be open to the United Kingdom or any other Power to carry on the existing mandate was an idea in which he hoped the Mandates Commission would not take refuge. He said frankly, not speaking for himself, but speaking on behalf of the United Kingdom Government, that the prospects of carrying on indefinitely on the terms of the existing mandate seemed to His Majesty&apos;s Government to be a commitment involving repression, involving continual friction and hostility between each of the two races, on the one hand, and the Administration on the other, as well as between the two races themselves, in a manner which could not inure to the advantage of any one of the three parties concerned, or, for that matter, to the credit of the mandate system or of the Leagup itself.&apos;&apos; Mr. Ormsby Gore was satisfied that a new solution a political solution, as he had described it of the problem of Palestine must be explored in the interests of the future peace of Palestine, and, further, in the wider interest of the future relations between the Jews and the world of Islam, for the benefit of the suffering Jews in Europe, as well as for the benefit of the peace of the world. It was in the light of these broad political considerations that he came before the Mandates Commission, not as an administrator, but quite frankly as a politician, to say that, in his opinion, and in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, it was essential that a solution of what they regarded quite definitely as a deadlock should be explored. ....&apos;&apos; Mr. Ormsby Gore had certainly had no intention of conveying the impression that the Balfour Declaration was not still a binding obligation on both the League and the United Kingdom. Obviously, like the mandate, it was still a binding obligation, and would remain so until replaced by an independent Jewish State. It was only if the suggested plan of partition were accepted, and eventuated in the creation of a Jewish State, that the Balfour Declaration would reach its fruition and cease to be binding. Similarly, the mandate was binding until it was replaced by another regime in Palestine. ....A
&quot; The Mandates Commission would see that the solution recommended by the Arab Higher Committee implied : first, the retention by the Arabs of the right to complete independence in their own land, which they described as the whole of Palestine; second, the cessation (whatever that meant) of the experiment of the Jewish National Home; third, the cessation of the British mandate and its replacement by a treaty similar to those existing between the United Kingdom and Iraq, the United Kingdom and Egypt, and France and Syria, constituting Palestine a sovereign State; and, fourth, the immediate cessation of all Jewish immigration and of land sales to Jews pending the conclusion of the treaty. That solution, Mr. Ormsby Gore wished to say, quite frankly, was unacceptable to the United Kingdom Government if it were for the whole of Palestine.....&quot; I take it that the basic principle of any partition scheme would be to leave as few Jews as possible in the Arab State; indeed, even under the proposals of the Royal Commission, that seems to be the main basis upon which it has acted, and would, I believe, be the only possible basis on which a frontier could be drawn. But, however you draw that frontier, it is inevitable that there will be a large Arab minority in the Jewish State, and it is therefore politically wise, and indeed necessary, that special provisions should be made for the legitimate safeguarding of the interests of that minority. And again, on the other side, though an appreciable number of the Christians will be in the proposed British mandatory enclave, there will be, in the proposed Arab State, however you draw that frontier, a considerable number of Christians.....&quot; Therefore, I grant that provisions for safeguarding minorities will have to be made over and above the ordinary provisions which are made in the ordinary minorities treaties operating under League auspices in many countries inEurope.....I see no reason why, in the case of Palestine, we should be strictly limited to the kind of procedure which operates in those European States.&quot;4. Permanent Mandates Commission.The Report of the Permanent Mandates Commission to the Council of the League contains the following conclusions : &quot; The Commission therefore considers that it is worth continuing the examination of the advantages and drawbacks of a new territorial solution. It appears quite natural and legitimate that the mandatory Power, rightly anxious to give satisfaction to the conflicting aspirations of Arabs and Jews in Palestine, and having failed to do so by the institution of a common administration for the whole territory, should be empowered to contemplate in some form or other the establishment of a regime in which these aspirations would each be satisfied in a part of the territory.&quot; This satisfaction cannot, of course, be complete. For the Arabs, any partition must necessarily involve the abandonment of a fraction of what they consider to be their hereditary patrimony. For the Jews, it could involve, together with a restriction of the scope of their national home, already limited, as they allege, by the exclusion of Trans-Jordan in 1922, a fresh reduction in its capacity of absorbing population.&quot;Any solution to prove acceptable should therefore deprive the Arabs of as small a number as possible of the places to which they attach particular value, either because they are their present homes or for reasons of religion. And, further, the areas allotted to the Jews should be sufficiently extensive, fertile and well situated from the point of view of communications by sea and land to be capable of intensive economic development, and consequently of dense and rapid settlement.....&quot; The Commission would be failing in its duty if it did not draw the Councils attention to the delicate problem of the transfer of populations from one territory to the other which might be necessary if there was a partition. In order to guarantee that the advantages of such a transfer should outweigh the disadvantages, particular care would have to be given to ensure that it was carried out with the greatest fairness.&apos;&apos; As regards the proposal to withdraw the Holy Places from the domination of Arabs and Jews and place them under a special regime, the Commission thinks that such a step could not but be of advantage to general peace, provided that this regime was based on Article 28 of the present mandate. . . .
&quot; While declaring itself favourable in principle to an examination of a solution involving the partition of Palestine, the Commission is, nevertheless, opposed to the idea of the immediate creation of two new independent States. . . .&quot; The Commission therefore considers that a prolongation of the period of political apprenticeship constituted by the Mandate would be absolutely essential 30th to the new Arab State and to the new Jewish State. This apprenticeship might be carried on in one of two forms.&quot;&quot;Provisional canton ization&quot; and &quot;Two Mandates&quot; are then discussed.5. Extracts from the Speech of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at the 98th Session of the Council of the League of Nations.&quot; I would remind the Council that the Balfour Declaration itself had a dual character. On the one hand, it provided for the Jewish national home, on the other it laid down the condition that nothing should be done which might prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine or the rights or political status enjoyed by Jews elsewhere.&quot;It is clear that under these provisions a twofold task was imposed upon the mandatory Power. It was under an obligation to further the establishment of the Jewish national home, and at the same time it was bound to do its best to guide the country as a whole along the path towards full nationhood. Indeed, the development of self-governing institutions is one of the objects specifically prescribed in article 2 of the mandate.&quot; At the time when the mandate was drawn up by our predecessors it was clearly not contemplated that these two obligations would prove mutually incompatible. . . . No one, least of all the mandatory Power itself, or the Council of the League, who approved the form of the mandate, anticipated that the future would be entirely free from difficulties. But it was hoped that tihe two races in Palestine would so adjust their national aspirations as to render possible the establishment of a single self-governing commonwealth under a unitary Government. This hope has, unfortunately, not been fulfilled. The reasons for its non-fulfilment are admirably set forth in Chapter 20 of the report of the Royal Commission. . . . Stated briefly, their conclusion is that the attempt has failed, not from any fault on the part of the Administration, or from any hesitation in applying the mandate, but because the conflict between Arab and Jewish political aspirations, which was inherent in the situation from the first, has tended to be confirmed by certain provisions of the mandate itself. It has, moreover, been intensified, not only by the estranging forces of conditions inside Palestine, but perhaps even more by external factors beyond the control of the British Administration in Palestine.&quot; These external factors fall into two main sections. Firstly, there has been a growth of anti-semitism, and the development of new economic and social conditions, in certain European countries, which have resulted in increased desire on the part of the Jews, and increased pressure on His Majesty&apos;s Govern -ment to find room in Palestine for largely increased numbers of Jewish refugees. Secondly, there has been the growth of Arab nationalism throughout the Arabic-speaking countries and their increasing concern in the future political destiny of Palestine.&quot;I am anxious to avoid over-statement, but I do wish to say, with all the emphasis in my power, that these new factors, which no one could have foreseen wheD the mandate was drawn up and approved by the Council, have transformed the Avhole situation and have created a new set of conditions under which the policy which was contemplated some two decades ago, and which we have done our utmost to carry out ever since, has become definitely unworkable.....&quot;That is the situation in which His Majesty&apos;s Government come to the Council to-day. Palestine is a mandated territory administered by Great Britain on behalf of the League. The Palestine problem is not merely one that concerns Arabs and Jews, or one for which His Majesty&apos;s Government alone is required to find a solution. It is a problem that concerns the League as a whole. The man-datory Power can take no steps towards the modification of the mandatory regime without the authority of the League. His Majesty&apos;s Government clearly cannot proceed to work out the details of any scheme of partition, such as has been suggested by the Royal Commission, unless they are assured that they have the
general approval of the Council in embarking on this task. It is for that general approval that I ask to-day.&quot; My colleagues will have seen the statement of policy issued by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom at the time of the publication of the Royal Commission^ report. In that statement the opinion was recorded &apos; that a scheme of partition on the general lines recommended by the commission represents thebest and most hopeful solution of the deadlock.&apos;    To that opinion we adhere.....All I ask at this stage is that His Majesty&apos;s Government shall be given authority to proceed forthwith to work out the details of such a scheme, if possible in co-operation with representatives of both Jews and Arabs, it being understood that no scheme will be put into effect without further reference to, and approval by, the Council.&quot; The procedure that His Majesty&apos;s Government have in mind, if the Council give their general approval to the policy which I have outlined, is to appoint a further special body to visit Palestine, to negotiate with Arabs and Jews and to submit to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom proposals for a detailed scheme of partition. It would be the task of this body to advise, in due course, as to the provisional boundaries of the proposed Arab and Jewish States and of the new British mandated area, and also to undertake the financial and other enquiries for which the Royal Commission recommended that a financial commission should be appointed.&quot;At a later stage, a final and detailed boundary demarcation commission would need to be appointed.....&quot; In the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, partition is the only ultimate solution. It alone admits of the fulfilment both of article 22 of the Covenant, which contemplates independence as the goal of all territories in the category of &apos; A&apos; mandates, and of the obligation to establish in Palestine a national home for the Jewish people.&quot;What His Majesty&apos;s Government contemplate is not a dual but a tripartite division of the country, for they take it from the terms of article 28 of the existing mandate that it is the intention and wish of the League that the Holy Places, including the Christian Holy Places, should remain permanently under League supervision and control. The vast majority of the Christian Holy Places are in the three cities of Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Nazareth. The two latter are almost entirely Christian towns. In the old city of Jerusalem and its immediate environs are not only many historic religious sites, but the religious settlements of many faiths. We think it will be in accordance with the wishes of the vast majority of States Members of the League that, when contemplating the ultimate establishment of Jewish and Arab States in the Holy Land sacred to all three religions, these religious sites and institutions should be placed permanently in the care of a Power acting on behalf of and responsible to the League as a whole for what must always be a sacred trust.....&quot;6. Council of the League.The Council of the League adopted the following resolution : &quot;In view of the United Kingdom Governments statement of July 1937 concerning the conclusions of the Royal Commission on Palestine,  &apos;&quot; In view of the preliminary opinion given to the Council by the Mandates Commission,&apos;&apos; In view of the statement made by the Representative of the United Kingdom at the Council meeting of the 14th September, 1937, and the discussion on the status of Palestine which took place at the same meeting,&quot; Having regard to the intention expressed by the United Kingdom Govern-ment of - pursuing the study of the problem of the status of Palestine while concentrating on a solution involving partition of the territory,&quot; Recalling the assurances given in that connection by the Representative of the United Kingdom on the subject of immigration,&quot; The Council:&quot;Agrees to the United Kingdom Governments carrying out the aforesaid study and taking such steps as it may entail,&quot; And, while pointing out that the Mandate of the 24th July, 1922, remains in force until such time as it may be otherwise decided, defers consideration of the substance of the question until the Council is in a position to deal with it as a whole and in the meantime entirely reserves its opinion and its decision.&quot;
7. Assembly of the League.The resolution of the Assembly reads as follows :-&quot;The Assembly:&quot;Having noted the activity of the mandatory Powers, the Permanent Mandates Commission and the Council concerning the application of the prin-ciples laid down in Article 22 of the Covenant and in the texts of the mandates : &apos;&apos; (a) Renews the expression of confidence in them voted by previous sessions of the Assembly, and pays a tribute to the results they have achieved, thanks to a close and frank co-operation which it is essential to maintain;&apos;&apos; (6) Expresses its conviction that the problem of Palestine, which is at present before the Council, will be equitably settled, account being-taken to the fullest possible extent of all the legitimate interests at stake.&quot;
