felS DOCUMENT IS^THE^PRQPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) SECRET.CoP. 255 (57)q COPY NO..,C A B I N E T.ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL.. :Memorandum &quot;by the Lord Chancellor.The Bill (H.Ao 40 (37)) which I put forward with this Memorandum for the consideration of my colleagues is designed to carry into effect a number of recommendations for the &quot;better administration of justice made &quot;by the Royal Commission presided over &quot;by the late Lord Peel.According to the recommendations made by t hat Commission, I appointed three Committees, whose task was to work out in detail the recommendations on points of principle made &quot;by the Commission.The first of these, presided over by Mr Justice Atkinson, worked out a scheme for giving effect to the recommendation that a system of note-taking by shorthand should be instituted at the Law Courts..    This matter did not require any legislation or the making of any Rules.     The scheme was prepared accordingly by the Committee and brought into operation at the commencement of the present Legal Term.Of the other two Committees, the one presided over by Lord Finlay was concerned with Circuit arrangements;    the other, presided over by Sir Archibald Bodkin, dealt.with Quarter Sessions.At a later stage of this Memorandum I set out those matters on which I propose that legislative effect should be
given to t he recommendations of the Commission and Committees taken conjointly, and those to which effect can^ and I hope will, &quot;be given &quot;by Rules of the Supreme Court.    Those which require Rule have been for some time under consideration by the Lord Chief Justice and his colleagues.,  and until I learn the result of their deliberations, I cannot state with certainty what course will be followed with regard to them..    But before going into these matters, I think it right to draw&apos; attention to those recommendations of the Commission or Committees on which I do not propose to take any action.    It appears probable that the provisions of the present draft Bill are more likely to receive hostile comment for what it does not, than for what it does, contain.Two of the principal recommendations of the Peel Commission were(l)    that a business manager should be appointed to assist the Lord Chief Justice in the arrangement of the work of the King?s 3ench Division.    This would appear not to be a matter onvhich legislation would be needed, but it is likely that some Members of Parliament at least will press to know the Government&apos;s intentions with regard to this question. I approve the recommendation of the Commission, and I feel some apprehension that, if effect is not given to it, some of the more detailed recommendations of the Commission may fail in their effect, but it appears to me that such an official could only perform useful work in the discharge of the functions proposed to be committed to him if he were appointed with the goodwill, and received the support, of the Lord Chief Justice.    The Lord Chief Justice has informed me that he gave evidence against the proposal, that he resents the recommendation, and that he objects to the appointment of such an official, and it appears to me useless in the face of this statement.to pursue the matter further at the present time.
G(2) The Commission recommended that an age limit of 72 should he imposed on Judges of the King&apos;s Bench Division,  without retrospective effect-    The terms of reference to the Commission restricted them to the King&apos;s Bench Divisions hut there is no reason to suppose that an age limit5  if applieds would not he equally-applicable to Judges of the Chancery Division and the Probates Divorce and Admiralty Division-    It, is possible that other considerations would have to be borne in mind before an age limit were imposed on Lords Justices of the Court of Appeal or Lords of Appeal In OrdinaryoI am very sensible of the weight of the argument which led the Commission to this conclusions and I recognise also that the proposal would probably attract support in Parliament and elsewhereo    On the face of its the proposition that an age limits which is already imposed on County Court Judgess  should apply also to the High Court appears logical--    It cannot be denied that Judgess  like other peoples  suffers  as age progressess  from physical infirmities which may deteriorate their judicial capacity..   But there is much to be said on the other side    In actual experiences  the cases in which an age limit of 725  if in operations would have removed from the Bench Judges who remained upon it after their faculties had become impaired are very few-    On the other hand  those casess which9 in the pasts have given anxiety to my predecessors and to myselfs  of men remaining on the Bench when not fully
!&apos;1 tcapable, have in fact almost all been cases of men on whom the age limit would not have operated.Apart from this there can be no doubt that the judicial faculty is less liable to deteriorationfrom the effects of age than the faculty ofadministration, and that the faculty of administeringjustice has actually improved at an age at which men engaged on more active occupations have begun to fail, or at least have ceased to become better.If an age limit of 78 had been in operation,  say?during the 3-ast twenty years and had been applicableto Appellate Judges, as well as to Judges of FirstInstance,  it would have removed from the Benchmany of those whose services have been highlyvalued and could have been ill spared.   This is also -true, though in less degree,  of Judges of FirstInstance.If an age limit is imposed on puisne Judges it seems inevitable that an age limit must also be imposed on Appellate Judges,  though a case may be made out for imposing a higher limit in the latter case.   That higher limit, however, could not without absurdity be fixed at a higher age than 75, and even such an age is so high that when applied generally it appears ridiculous.   In some cases, age begins to tell at a very much younger age.   Some men are unfitted to sit at 65 and these would not be touched by any age limit which could in practice be imposed.    Others retain their faculties to a far greater age.
o oI must also draw attention to the difficulties in connection with the arrangements for pension which would arise from the imposition of an age limits  and the Consequent difficulties in finding fit men to fill the office in the first place.   Under the present law, a Judge on completing 15 years service or on becoming incapable., from whatever causes  of discharging his duties is entitled to a pension of  39500 per annum.   Most men when appointed to the Bench suffer a considerable loss of income and their difficulties are increased at present by the laws relating to Super Taxs which in many cases leave them during their first year of office without any income.    One of the attractions of an office9 which is by no means now so attractive as it was some years before the Wars  is the security of a fixed income during services followed by the certainty   of a fixed pension after a stated time9 or upon disablement by illness.   Any age limit must necessarily involve a sliding scale of pensions and. if the scale is to slide5  the amount to be allotted, where retirement takes place in the first few years of service? must necessarily be small.   Men who only after hesitations partly in response to a call of public duty and partly as a relief from the laborious life of the Bars  are prepared to accept the certainty, may be expected to hesitate much longer when invited to occupy a position with no certainty attached to itoThere is another argument which appeals more   to   Lord   Chancellors   than   to   those
who consider the question from a position of less responsi-bility.     The supply of persons adequately equipped for judicial office is at all times very strictly limited.      In present circumstances the effect of the war years and the loss of many who might &quot;be expected to have &quot;become suitable candidates for the Bench is making itself felt, and the Lord Chancellor&apos;s difficulties would be greatly increased if, while, on the one hand, the position is made less attractive, on the other, he was compelled to lose Judges who still re-tain every faculty necessary to the office.I should add that the Commission necessarily pointed out that such a provision could not be retrospective.     Liany years, therefore, would elapse before it came into effective operation if it were now imposed.      It would, therefore, afford no relief from our present difficulties.On one further matter I do not propose to take any further- action.      The Peel Commission, following the example of many Commissions and Committees which have sat in past years, proposed that the number of Circuit towns should be reduced - the smaller ones being eliminated.     Here again I recognise the strength of the argument which impelled the Commission to its conclusion.      It seems indefensible that work in London should be allowed to fall into arrears, and work in some of the big Provincial cities should be done in undue haste,  in order that Judges may go on Circuit to towns which have long ceased to be centres of population or industry.     But the history of the recommendations of previous Commissions and Committees, to which I have alluded, shows what great political difficulties stand in
the way of this reform.      If any towns are to he suppressed, the weight of the change must fall almost wholly upon V/ales.     Three English towns - Appleby, Oakham, and Huntingdon - seem marked for abolition.     But when the matter is considered in detail it becomes apparent that the saving   of time which would be effected by the suppression of these three towns, if any, is so small as to be negligence-gible.     Certainly the saving is not so great as to jus-tify their suppression, unless Wales were treated on an equal footing.     But in Wales other, besides economical considerations, come into play.     The position has been greatly aggravated, since Lord Finlay&apos;s Committee dealt with the matter, by the proceedings in connection with the trial of those who &quot;burnt the Aerodrome at Caernarvon.      It may be that the spirit of nationalist particularism in the Principality is factitious.     But I have no doubt that an attempt to make any such re-arrangement of the Welsh Circuits, as would afford any substantial saving, would result in an outbreak of nationalist sentiment which would have effects far more harmful than any good resulting from the change.Lastly, there is a proposal in paragraphs 230-233 of the Peel Report to alter the law of evidence.     This is a difficult matter which would require a separate Bill. It is one on which legal opinion is by no means unanimous and it needs further consideration.      I propose, therefore, to take no action on it at the present moment.\
I now come to those recommendations of the Royal Commission which I approve and to which I am endeavouring to give effect.     I propose to take them in the order in which they appear in the Summary on pages 103 to 106 of the Report;I.    Circuits.An improved system of orrrjiging the circuits is recommended in paragraphs-97-115 and in Appendix 1* This could he carried out in the main by 0rc&quot;er in Council and the action of the judges themselves, but a necessary preliminary is to amend two existing enactments.     The judge must have power to cancel assizes when there is no substantial business (paragraphs 100 and 102) and the restriction on the power to commit to assizes outside the county must be slightly modified (paragraph; 103).     Clauses 4 and 5 of the Bill are intended to effect these changes.11*    Improvement in the, organization of the King&apos;s Bench Division.(l)    The extension of the system of fixing dates for trial and the introduction of a short non-jury list is a matter for Rules of Court, a draft of which is under c ons i der at i on.(2) The appointment of judges to take charge of the lists is within the power of the judges without legislation or Rules of Court.IV.    County Courts.(2)    Clause 14 of the Bill is intended to enable a plaintiff to initiate proceedings in the cotinty court where the sums involved are not less than  100 and not mox^e than  300, with an absolute right in the defendant to transfer to the High Court.
v&quot;3    Quarter SessionSoThe recommendations in paragraphs 212-225 of the Report are,, shortly, to relieve assizes by increasing the jurisdiction of quarter sessions, but subject to a condition that quarter sessions should be presided over by a legally qualified chairman.      I propose to carry out this recommen-dation in substance by Clauses 1-3 of the Bill and the First Schedule,      The of fences to be added to the jurisdiction of quarter sessions were revised by the Bodkin Committee,. Appendix I follows the Bodkin Committee.      In detail Clauses 1 and 2 depart from the Report in some respects. The scheme in the Bill enables the reform to be brought into force in some counties   without waiting till there is a qualified chairman in every count y;V   as recommended by the Royal Commissions      Secondly the qualification suggested by the Royal Commission (not less than ten years&apos;&apos; practice at the English Bar) has been modified so as to give a wider choices .   At the same time it is proposed that not only the paid chairman (as suggested by the Royal Commission) but also the unpaid chairman should have to be approved by the Lord Chancellor if the court is to have the increased jurisdiction.VI.    Reforms in Procedure and Jurisdiction,.The recommendations under this heading (except that relating to evidence mentioned above) can be carried out by Rules of Court or by the administrative action of the judges.      Some have been carried out already,      For the others,  the most important of which is the fixing of a day (or period) for trial, the necessary Rules have been drafted and are under consideration.This brings me to the end of the Summary of Recommendations in the Report of the Royal Commission.The remaining Clauses in the Bill relate to other matters.
1 3- JL -JClauses 6-12 of the Bill are intended to carry out the recommendation in Part I (headed Crown Office Rules) of the Third and Final Report of the Business of Courts Couaittee (1936, cmnd   5066)*,      The object is to simplify the procedure of what is now known as the Crown Side of the King&apos;s Bench Division partly by enabling the procedure to be modernised and partly to eliminate obsolete proceedings altogether.Clause 13 is included at the request of the President of the Board of Trade in order to enable proceedings to be brought in this country against a foreign sovereign or state which has, by becoming a high contracting party to a Convention,  implicitly submitted to the jurisdiction of the English Courts.,      The Clause is required for the purpose of the International Convention on the Immunity of State-owned Ships, but on the suggestion of the Law Officers it has been made of more general application^Clause 15 restores to the Chancery Division a power to transfer an action or matter to a county court without the consent of the partieSo      This power was omitted by a slip from the consolidation effected by the County Courts Act, 1934.Clause 16 is introduced to enable a Chancery Master to act as deputy for a Registrar in Bankruptcy,      The object is to supply a need which has been felt in practice.Clause 17 extends to the offices of the Supreme Court generally a provision in the Judicature Act which is now confined to the Central Office-      The provision enables documents In the custody of the court to be produced for use in another court without the attendance of the officer in charge of the document on subpoena,-    The need for such a provision has been felt particularly in respect of &quot;bankruptcy files.u ^ (initialled)    H.House of Lords.22nd October, 1937, ..10-
