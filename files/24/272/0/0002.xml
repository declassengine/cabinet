For convenience of reference, they are now printed as a single paper. Each return takes the form of tabular statements, and a short explanatory memorandum.[15972]B
NAVY.Explanatory Memorandum.1. IN accordance with the desire expressed by the Chancellor in his letter of the 12th July, 1937, to the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Admiralty have considered in the present connection both (a) the expansion programme necessary on the basis of what is generally known as the D.R.C. Fleet, and also (b) that required for the proposed New Standard of Naval strength, which forms the subject of the recent Admiralty Memorandum D.P. (P) 3.2. The origin of the proposed New Standard of strength, and the differences between the Fleet required for that standard and the D.R.C. Fleet, are fully set , out in Paper No. D.P. (P) 3. It is important to bear in mind that, while the D.R.C. Fleet has been used as a convenient basis of comparison, it cannot, since the lapse of quantitative limitation, be regarded as in any way representing an existing approved standard which, in the absence of a fresh Governmental decision, holds the field.3. The Admiralty estimate that, if there is no important disturbing factor, the expansion programme based on the D.R.C. Fleet could, from a financial standpoint, be completed by the end of the financial year 1940. On a similar hypothesis, they estimate that the expansion programme required for the New Standard Fleet, if it is approved, can, from a financial standpoint, be substantially completed by the end of the financial year 1944.4. The Admiralty have recently prepared forecasts of the expenditure which at present seems likely to be required for the Navy (a) on the basis of the D.R.C. Fleet, and (b) on that of the New Standard Fleet, during each of the financial years 1938 to 1946 inclusive, and also of the &quot;stabilised&quot; annua] expenditure which seems likely to be necessary, on each of the two alternative bases, when complete normality is reached.5. These forecasts do not include any expenditure in respect of ships to be maintained by the Dominions, and, as stated in paragraph 22 of D.P. (P) 3, it was assumed, in preparing them, that the Dominions would in future maintain a substantially larger number of ships than they maintain at the present time.6. So far as prices are concerned, the forecasts were prepared on the basis of the prices taken for the purposes of the Navy Estimates, 1937. Increased prices will, of course, to some extent affect the validity of the forecasts, but with the information at present available, the Admiralty do not feel themselves in a position to apply any reliable corrective either in respect of the present upward trend or in respect of any further variation which may occur in future. A note on the present upward tendencies, however, is appended.7. No allowance was made, in preparing the forecasts, for any additional cost which might fall upon Navy Votes through the transfer of the Fleet Air Arm to Admiralty control. It should also be pointed out that, as regards expenditure on works and buildings, no allowance was made for (a) the provision of under-ground storage for oil fuel, which is estimated to cost about  16,000,000 if the full scheme is ultimately approved; (b) the construction of underground magazines, estimated at  5,000,000; or (c) various other large works, such as the duplication of the Royal Naval Cordite Factory, the construction of a new harbour at Famagusta (or, alternatively, new harbour works at Alexandria), dockyard and other development at Hong Kong, harbour dredging and defences at Aden, &amp;c, which may be necessary and which, if approved, may involve additional expenditure of some  9,000,000. Finally, it should be stated that the forecasts were prepared on the assumption that the general standards of maintenance would remain unaltered.8. The forecasts showed only the expenditure which is estimated to be required: they did not attempt to show how the money is to be obtained
(i.e., whether from revenue or from loan) during the period of re-armament; nor did the later and &quot;stabilised&quot; figures include any allowance for interest and sinking fund charges.9. As regards the &apos;&apos; stabilised&apos;&apos; costs, it must be realised that a &quot; stabilised &quot; Fleet does not mean &quot; stabilised &quot; Estimates. Even when the Fleet is &quot; stabilised,&quot; the cost of necessary new construction year by year may vary by  5,000,000 upwards or downwards from the average figure, according to the programme the crucial factor, of course, being the inclusion or non-inclusion of capital ships or aircraft carriers. Again, owing to the disturbance caused by the large entries of personnel during the period of expansion, a periodic variation above and below the &quot;stabilised&quot; figure for Vote 1, amounting to perhaps  500,000 for the New Standard Fleet, may be expected for a considerable time to come.10. Subject to these remarks, the Admiralty submit the attached tables showing the personnel and the cash provision required, according to the forecasts, for the D.R.C. Fleet and the New Standard Fleet respectively, during each of the years covered by the period 1938-46, and also the ultimate &quot; stabilised &quot; figures. The tables are preceded, for convenience of comparison, by figures showing the corresponding provision in the Navy Estimates for 1935, 1936 and 1937 respectively, and they show separately the provision estimated to be necessary (a) during the expansion period, and (6) after that period, the expenditure being divided under a few main headings.11. As intimated in paragraph 24 of D.P. (P) 3, the Admiralty have considered a possible reduction of the cost of the New Standard Fleet, as shown in the forecast, by means of (i) Reduced replacement costs, by assuming a slightly longer &quot;life&quot; for-   certain categories of ships; (ii) Reduced expenditure on the forecast standard of maintenance and replacement of Fleet Air Arm aircraft;(iii) Increased reliance on reserves of man power, permitting a reduction inthe numbers of active service personnel;(iv) Economies in the dockyards, armament supply, and works and buildingsVotes, if. a somewhat lower standard of maintenance were found to be practicable.Further, as stated in paragraph 25 of D.P. (P) 3, the Admiralty are prepared to eliminate certain of the ships upon which the forecast for the New Standard Fleet was based. The elimination of these ships would save on an average  2,500,000 a year, and the combined effect of this saving and the other possible economies mentioned may, as&quot; stated in paragraph 26 of D.P. (P) 3, be ultimately of the order of  7,000,000 a year. It will be clear, however, that the realisation of this reduction must necessarily be gradual: the full reduction cannot certainly be effected for a number of years. According to the forecast, the total cost of the New Standard Fleet, for the period 1938-44 inclusive, amounts to  829,000,000. The Admiralty doubt whether the saving that could be effected during the period mentioned, by the various economies contemplated, would exceed  29,000,000, leaving the total cost (as stated in paragraph 42 of D.P. (P) 3) about  800,000,000. Thereafter, the economies should enable the annual expenditure shown in the forecast to be reduced to the full extent contemplated.August 18, 1937.Note by Admiralty on Increases in Rates and Prices.1. Industrial Wages.An increase by two progressive stages in the wages of all male industrial employees of the Admiralty has recently been approved, the final effect of which will be to increase the pre-1937 standard rates by.3s. a week. The number of men at present affected is nearly 57,000.[15972] b 2
2. Stores and Materials.(a) Clothing and Provisions.Since the 1937 Estimates were prepared, prices of clothing and provisions, have risen by approximately 30 per cent, and 5 per cent, respectively, the effect of. which is to increase expenditure on Vote 2. Stores as a whole by some 13-14 per cent.  Present indications are that further increases in prices are to be expected.(b) Naval Stores and Fuel.There has been a rise in prices of approximately 2 per cent, for Naval stores as a whole since the forecasts were prepared. For certain raw materials the increase has been substantial, e.g., copper (50 per cent.), tin (20 per cent.), zinc (100 per cent.).For oil fuel and Welsh coal there has been no substantial change in prices since the Estimates were prepared.(c) Naval Armament Stores.There has been a definite increase in the prices tendered by the trade since March last, but it is difficult to express the aggregate increase as a percentage. The increase is due mainly to the rise of prices for raw materials.3. Works.Since March last the increased cost of an ordinary building job may be assumed to be 4 per cent., principally due to rises in prices of materials.It is impossible to say what further increases (or decreases) there may be in materials prices, but wages will certainly go up in February next, possibly adding another 3 per cent, to building costs.4. Contract Shipbuilding.As a result of increases in wages and prices of materials (particularly metals), contract shipbuilding costs have during recent months advanced by about 15 per cent., and, on similar grounds, the present tendency is for further rises to occur, though probably not on so high a scale.August 18, 1937.

ARMY (including Royal Ordnance Factories).Explanatory Memorandum.1. Attached are forecasts of Estimates for 1938 to 1942 inclusive in the form of- Table    I. (i) A summary of Army Votes, divided between normal and d.R.C. expenditure, (ii) Royal Ordnance Factories expenditure, in so far as it is not covered by receipts from customers. Table   II. &quot; Normal &quot; expenditure under the various votes. Table III. D.R.C. expenditure under the various objective headings underwhich it has been customary to classify it.*2. It must be emphasized that the figures, though necessarily based on detailed calculations, are at best very rough approximations given on the best data available.3. In the figures for 1938-42 (and those for 1937 added for comparison) no allowance has been made for receipts from Issues from the Consolidated Fund, or for interest and sinking fund payments on such Issues.4. It has been assumed that the D.R. programme in CP. 115 (37) (except for war equipment and reserves for a four division contingent of Territorial Army) will be completed by the 31st March, 1943 (apart from some expenditure on the less important defences at home and abroad).5. The average strengths of the Regular Army, Supplementary Reserve and Territorial Army are assumed to increase progressively during the period till they approximate to Establishment in 1942.6. Prices have been dealt with broadly in the following manner; for supplies and works, calculations have been based on current prices : for stores and clothing and Royal Ordnance Factories expenditure, prices have been taken as those on which 1937 Estimates were calculated, so far as &quot;normal&quot; expenditure is concerned, and as those on which the figures in CP. 115 (37) were based, so far as D.R.C. expenditure is concerned, except in those cases in which experience has required, and given information for, a recalculation. No attempt has been made to forecast the future trend of prices.* In a personal letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer dated the 6th October, the Secretary of State for War states that he has experienced some difficulty in dealing with the Chancellors suggestion that the War Office figures should show the cost of possible additions to the programme already approved, but that the following gives as true a picture as can be furnished at this stage : (1) In CP. 115 (37)  43,381,000 was asked for to provide war equipment and reserves for four Territorial Army Divisions. This demand was not approved, and the figures submitted in the returns exclude this amount.(2) It is inevitable that as the reorganisation and re-equipment of the Army proceed and new developments take place in the design and manufacture of armaments, new or alternative requirements will come to light, but it is impossible to speak with any certainty of the probabilities under this head. Proposals designed to improve recruiting will shortly be made. -v3) Many commitments are dependent on the requirements of other Departments or decisions of Government, and in regard to such matters as the further&quot; expansion of A.D.G.B. or the improvement of the defences of ports abroad, the Army Council may have, to meet demands which are outside the provisions of CP. 115 (37). For example, expansions of A.D.G.B. have been proposed which are estimated to cost  15 millions, and various defended port schemes which have been mooted (but not necessarily examined) have been roughly evaluated at  20 millions.(4) In these circumstances it is impossible to give any useful figure of additional expenditure resulting from (2) and (3), and the Secretary of State for War is reluctant to attempt to do so. If, however, the Chancellor presses for figures,  100 millions to cover Cl), (2) and (3) would be as good a round sum to take as any other. The Secretary of State for War emphasises that the effect of any additions to the approved programme would result mainly in an extension of the period during which the programme would run and not in an increase in the Estimates of the next few years.
7. No allowance has been made for improvements in conditions of service, which it may be found necessary to propose, such as, for example, increases in the rates of pay of soldiers or retired pay of officers, for increased expenditure on the Territorial Army (other than that covered for training equipment in CP. 115 (37), and the normal growth of the force), for far-reaching changes in organization or in the distribution of troops between Indian and Imperial estab-lishments, or, as regards D.R.C. expenditure, for possible additional commitments not covered by CP. 115 (37). The increased cost of Colonial Allowance covered by the proposals now before the Treasury is included in the figures.8. The increase in the total under D.R.C expenditure of  204,609,000 in CP. 115 (37) to  219,841,100 is due partly to the carry over of expenditure from 1936 and 1937 to future years (which involves its being counted twice over in the tables), partly to increased prices and partly to revised scales of stores and building requirements.9. It is estimated that the &quot; normal &quot; estimates when the defence require-ments programme is complete, assuming that full provision is made for the proportionate replacement of equipment, &amp;c, provided under the defence require-ments programme, excluding interest and Sinking Fund in respect of issues from the Consolidated Fund, would amount to approximately  65 millions for the Army and Royal Ordnance Factories. In the years immediately after the completion of the programme, however, estimates should be appreciably below &quot; normal &quot; estimates, since replacement on the normal scale will not be involved. The  65,000,000 excludes any provision for services such as those mentioned in paragraph 7 above.October 1937.

ROYAL AIR FORCE.Explanatory Memorandum.1. The attached table shows the forecast of Air Estimates for the years 1938-43, on two alternative assumptions :-(a) Scheme F, that is to say the present approved programme, includingcertain preliminary measures which have been authorised so as to facilitate a further expansion (Scheme H) outlined in CP. 18 (37) if it were decided to proceed with that scheme.(b) Scheme J, that is to say the revised plan to deal with the present situation,which is being submitted to the D.P. (P) Committee.2. These forecasts (which make no allowance for the effects of the Defence Loans Act) have been based upon a rapid survey of the whole field of expenditure, and not upon a careful calculation of the liabilities likely to accrue under each Air Vote in each year. Indeed, with so many elements of uncertainty, exact estimating is impossible, and the forecasts cannot be regarded as more than rough approximations. The global totals of Air Votes for each year have accordingly been rounded to the nearest  5 millions.3.   The estimated dates of completion of the programmes are as(a) Scheme F (without full reserves): Early in 1939.(b) Scheme F (with full reserves) : End of 1939 or early 1940.(c) Scheme J (without full reserves) : March 1941.(d) Scheme J (with full reserves) : March 1942.4. Price Level. Generally speaking, the forecasts have been based on current wages and prices. It is assumed that there will be no very marked rise in wage rates, no increase in the present pay of the Royal Air Force, but some further small increase in the price of materials.It may be taken that any rise in the cost of raw materials, petrol and oil will be reflected in full in expenditure; that a rise of 10 per cent, in labour costs would add approximately 7\ per cent, to the cost of technical equipment and between 4 per cent, and 5 per cent, to the cost of works; and that a similar all-round rise in the cost of raw materials would add about 3 per cent, to the cost of technical equipment and between 5 per cent, and 6 per cent, to the cost of works. The effect of the recently announced rise in the charges for railway transport cannot be calculated.5. The personnel expenditure under Scheme F is calculated on an intake during 1937-38 of trainees for skilled trades, apprentices and pilots at the Scheme H level (see paragraph 1 (a) above), but it has been assumed that after that year these establishments would revert to a Scheme F level. (A decision to authorise recruitment of these classes on the Scheme J basis in 1938-39 and subsequently would entail some increase in the estimate for Scheme F.)6. Explanatory and Other Notes. In an examination of these forecasts the following points require to be borne in mind : (a) The forecast for Scheme F includes no provision for -(i) Additional training schools beyond those already authorised, (ii) Increased cost of high octane fuel reserves.    Expenditure amounting to  1,468,000 over the six years 1938-43 has now been authorised by the Treasury Inter-Service Committee.(iii) Radio directional finding schemes beyond experimental stationsauthorised when the forecast was prepared. Fifteen extra R.D.F. stations have now been approved at a capital cost of  1,237,000 and an annual recurrent charge of  150,000.(iv) Silhouette Lighting.   Expenditure on the experimental schemerecently sanctioned is estimated at  400,000. If the scheme is extended to cover the London area another  2 millions would be necessary, and, for the searchlight belt, yet a further  10 millions; but these estimates are highly conjectural.[15972] &apos;      &apos; cfollows : -Permanent -   buildings by 1943.
(v) Increased expenditure recommended as part of the Ideal Defence Scheme for A.D.G.B. If that scheme were approved it would mean an addition to the figures of Scheme F of a capital sum of  5,100,000 and an annual maintenance charge of about  1,100,000.(b) The forecast for Scheme J contains no provision for additional reserves of raw materials beyond those required for Scheme F. It does, however, contain provision for expenditure already approved under items (ii), (iii), and (iv) of (a) above and so much of that under item (v) as is necessary to cover revised, and rather smaller, requirements now considered essential by the Air Staff.(c) Neither forecast contains any provision for (i) Construction of four additional hospitals at home, proposals for which are under consideration. These would cost about  1 million to erect and about  100,000 a year to maintain.(ii) Reinforced surfacing of aerodromes, the cost of which cannotbe estimated, but would undoubtedly amount to several million pounds.(iii) Extension of balloon barrages beyond  the barrage already approved for the London Area.(d) Both forecasts are based on the following assumptions (i) That re-equipment, after expansion is completed, is based on a five-year period.(ii) That overseas squadrons are re-equipped, so far as types permit, from aircraft displaced from the Metropolitan Air Force.(iii) That no provision for war production is undertaken beyondshadow schemes and capital extensions already in hand.(iv) That no  provision  is  required  to  meet  the  liability  for compensation assumed under the capital clause.(v) That training requirements of, and shore accommodation for,the Fleet Air Arm are borne on Air Votes, but that all equipment (including war reserves) required for the embarkable units, as well as the maintenance of the personnel of such units, is borne on Navy Votes. Provision in Scheme F is based on the approved programme of 504 first-line aircraft by 1942; for Scheme J it has been assumed that 650 first-line aircraft will be required by the end of that year.-(e) Bomb Reserves. The provision under Scheme F is made for 6 months&apos; war requirements, one half of which consists of filled bombs, and the other half of all components ready for filling. Under Scheme J provision is made on the same basis, except that the bulk of the overseas requirements will be filled. It is, however, considered that if the whole reserve is not held ready filled, provision must be made for filling the unfilled part immediately on the outbreak of war. This will necessitate the erection of further factories (which will in any case be needed in the event of war) estimated to cost about  20 millions to construct and  4 millions a year to maintain, and provision accordingly has been made in the Scheme J forecast.(f) Civil Aviation. A long period review of expenditure has not been undertaken, and the 1937 estimate (rounded to  2 millions) has been maintained for the whole period covered.October 1937.

HOME OFFICE.Explanatory Memorandum.1. Date for Completion of Programme. As regards air raid precautions generally, the Department has hitherto been working to completion of plans by March 1939.In respect of the accumulation of * certain types of equipment, notably respirators, authority was obtained to complete preparations by an earlier date, and it was hoped that the necessary stocks of respirators for war use would be accumulated by March 1938.It is, however, unlikely that preparations can be completed by 1938 or 1939. The development of the air raid precautions organisation and increases in the estimated scale of air attack result in increases in the amount of equipment which will be required. Further, in the case of works to be undertaken by local authorities under any scheme of Government assistance, grants in aid of capital expenditure will fall to be paid for in at least the next four financial years.2. In the case of the emergency fire brigade measures, also, it does not at present appear possible to contemplate the provision of the necessary equipment by 1939, and it is assumed that the main expenditure on appliances will be spread over the three years 1938-41. Expenditure on training, uniforms and other items under the head of personnel, and on maintenance of appliances, will be lower in 1938-39 than in the succeeding years.It follows that substantial expenditure on air raid precautions will be incurred until at least March 1942.3. Estimates for the next four years. On several items the amounts likely to be expended are highly speculative. They often depend upon decisions which have not yet been taken on matters of policy; and the items relating to local schemes are based on the assumption that emergency schemes are, in fact, carried out by the local authorities on the lines now contemplated, whereas at present there can be no certainty that this assumption will be realized. For the purpose of the present forecast, it has been assumed that the scheme of graded grants to local authorities, rising from 60 per cent, to 75 per cent., may be taken as broadly equivalent to a flat Exchequer grant of 67^ per cent, of approved local authority expenditure.The following figures of estimated expenditure to be borne by the Exchequer are accordingly very provisional:  1937-38 1938-39 1939-40 1940-41 1941-42The details are set out in the tables.5,215,500 11,345,000 9,683,000 9,618.000 5,577,0004. Continuing Expenditure after 1941-42. It is to be anticipated that grants in aid of capital expenditure by local authorities and also the provision of various forms of equipment (e,g., sandbags) will continue after March 1942. No sudden drop to a care and maintenance basis is to be expected.It is thought, however, that after the main capital expenditure has been incurred, the amount of voted moneys likely to be required to maintain in being the Government and local authority organisations is of the order of  2,000,000 to  2,500,000 a year, of which  500,000 is in respect of the emergency fire-fighting organisation.
