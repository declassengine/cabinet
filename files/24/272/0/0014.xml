THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1937.SECRET. Copy No. 4 9CP. 268 (37).CABINET.LEVY-SUBSIDIES FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.Memorandum by the Minister of A griculture and Fisheries.I HAVE to draw the attention of my colleagues to a serious political agitation which is in danger of developing in agricultural constituencies.2. The reception given by farmers to the milk policy announced last July in the White Paper has been more hostile vthan was perhaps to be anticipated. Extravagant hopes had been entertained in regard to the Governments long-term policy for milk and some disappointment and criticism was inevitable. The National Farmers&apos; Union have, however, taken the line that the White Paper proposals are a definite breach of pledges given to the dairy farmers and of declarations made by Ministers in favour of the application of the levy-subsidy system to agricultural products in general and to dairy products in particular as an alternative to tariff protection. The rejection by the Import Duties Advisory Committee of the applications made by the National Farmers&apos; Union for increased duties on eggs and poultry, following the previous rejection of an application for increased protection for dairy products, has further exacerbated the situation.3. On returning to London in September, I found that the National Farmers&apos; Union was not merely engaged in criticising the White Paper policy, but was contemplating raising the treatment of agriculture under our present protectionist system as a definite political issue. They had drafted a Manifesto accusing the Government of having broken its pledges to agriculture, and were preparing to take political action in the constituencies (they have a political fund of about  60,000) to demand either effective tariff protection or levy subsidies for agricultural products. Meantime, they have asked me to receive a deputation at which they wish to put to me the following questions : (1) In view of the failure of the Union&apos;s applications to the Import Duties Advisory Committee in respect to meat and livestock, milk products and eggs and poultry, what action, if any, does the Government propose to take (bearing in mind the incidence of import duties on commodities consumed in agriculture) to secure to agricultural interests treatment comparable to that accorded to manufacturing industries under the Import Duties Act ?(2) If it be the view of the Government that a &quot;straight&quot; tariff on imports from all sources is not applicable as a protective instrument in the cases of meat and livestock, bacon and milk products, does the Govern-ment still accept the principle of the levy-subsidy as being applicable in these cases ?(3) If the Government is not prepared to apply either &quot;straight&quot; tariffs or levy-subsidy in the cases of the commodities above mentioned, how is it proposed to safeguard agricultural producers against increased costs of production due to import duties on commodities which they consume ?
4. Before framing my answer to the National Farmers&apos; Union, it is necessary for me to obtain the views of my colleagues on the line which we are to adopt in the light of the developments which I have described above, and, in particular, upon the question of the levy-subsidy, on which no definite or final decision has ever been taken.5. After consulting the Prime Minister, arrangements were made for the issues involved to be examined by an Inter-Departmental Committee, under the chairmanship of Sir Horace Wilson. The Committee was asked to set out for the consideration of Ministers a statement of the position in regard to the levy-subsidy and of the issues involved as they appeared to officials of the Departments con-cerned (the Treasury, Board of Trade, Dominions Office, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries) with a view to decisions being reached as to the attitude to adopt (a) in regard to the demand for a levy-subsidy, and (b) in the event of the Cabinet deciding against the levy-subsidy proposal, as to the line which might be taken in order to meet the case put forward by the National Farmers&apos; Union.6. I circulate herewith a copy of the report of this Inter-Departmental Committee, and I suggest that in the first instance the Agricultural Policy Com-mittee of the Cabinet, which was set up last July to draw up the long-term proposals for milk which were subsequently embodied in the White Paper, should De asked to consider it. I should add that I am being pressed to receive the deputation from the National Farmers&apos; Union at an early date, and Members for agricultural constituencies are anxious for a lead from the Government as to the line to be taken in answer to the agitation which is developing among the county branches of the N.F.U. In these circumstances I would ask that the Agricultural Policy Committee should consider the attached report at once with a view to the matter being brought before the Cabinet for a final decision, if possible, on Wednesday, the 17th November.W.

Memorandum by an Inter-Departmental Committee of Officials.Part 1. I. Introduction.1. THE National Farmers&apos; Union have charged the Government with a departure from previous pledges in the policies for milk and bacon announced by the Minister of Agriculture in the House of Commons on the 29th July, 1937. They feel very strongly that agriculture is not receiving the same protection as other industries have obtained by means of tariffs, and in particular they consider that the milk policy as set out in the White Paper (copy attached as Appendix II) is an inadequate alternative. The point which they especially stress is the contrast between (a) the diminishing assistance proposed for the milk producer, and the uncertainty of his future position; and (b) the security and permanence of the assistance afforded to manufacturing industry by the tariff. They recognise that the straight tariff applied to imports from all sources is not a politically practic-able instrument for protecting the main branches of agriculture; but they claim that a levy-subsidy is practicable, and that it is the best means of giving to the farmer a fair equivalent of the tariff protection accorded to other industries. They also contend that it was promised by responsible Ministers at an earlier date. As a result they are threatening a political campaign against the Govern-ment.2. The purpose of this memorandum is to set out for the consideration of Ministers a statement Of the position and of the issues involved as they appear to officials of the Departments primarily concerned (namely, Treasury, the Board of Trade, Dominions Office, Ministry of Agriculture and Department of Agriculture for Scotland) with a view to decisions being reached as to the attitude which the Government should adopt (a) in regard to the demand for a levy-subsidy, and (b) in the event of the Cabinet deciding against the levy-subsidy proposal, as to the line to be taken in order to meet the case put forward by the National Farmers&apos; Union, including the question whether some other form of financial assistance is needed.3. Although the grievances of the farming industry have been brought to a head by the White Paper on Milk Policy issued on the 29th July last, the farmers are also seriously concerned as to the position of certain other branches of agricul-ture, in particular pig and poultry keeping.II. Ministerial Declarations.4. No definite or final decision has ever been taken by the Government on the application of a levy-subsidy to agricultural commodities in general and to milk products in particular, but the matter has frequently been under considera-tion, and a number of ministerial declarations have been made in regard to it.5. The idea of a levy-subsidy scheme for the dairying industry was first put forward by Mr. Elliot (then Minister of Agriculture) in December 1933, and following reference of the proposal to an Inter-Departmental Committee (Chair-man, Sir Horace Wilson), which reported in February 1934, it was decided that while a levy-subsidy policy had substantial advantages, it would be necessary to secure the consent of the Dominions and Denmark having regard to existing trade agreements, and that there were tactical disadvantages in putting forward such a proposal at that time. It should be remembered in this connection that the Danish and other Scandinavian Trade Agreements had only been negotiated earlier in 1933, and that under Schedule A of the Ottawa Agreements the Dominions had been guaranteed free entry for milk products at least until August 1935. Upon the recommendation of this Committee the Government adopted as a temporary measure the plan of repayable Exchequer advances, with subsidies for increasing the liquid milk consumption, embodied in the Milk Act, 1934, and since continued by the amending Acts of 1936 and 1937. At this time the levy-subsidy idea as a policy to replace the quantitative regulation of imports for agricultural commodities, particularly meat and bacon, was undoubtedly in the minds of Ministers, and the White Paper on Meat Policy issued in July, 1934,
contemplated the introduction, in agreement with overseas countries, of a levy upon imports, the proceeds of which would be available for the assistance of the home industry.6. The levy-subsidy system continued to find favour with Ministers as a suitable policy in regard to certain agricultural commodities during 1935, and the levy-subsidy as a policy for meat was repeated in the White Paper issued in March, 1935.7. On the 25th July, 1935, a considered statement was made on behalf.of the Government by Mr. Elliot in the House of Commons with regard to milk policy, in which he said : &apos;&quot;&apos; The Government are of opinion that if conditions should warrant continued assistance to the home industry, such assistance could best be afforded by a system of duties or levies &quot; (on butter and cheese). &quot; The possibility cannot be excluded that, in addition, some regulation of the market may be desirable in the general interests of producers in certain cases or at particular times, but, as in the case of meat, the Government would not regard as a satisfactory permanent arrangement a system under which the responsibility for the regulation of the market would rest on them alone.&quot;8. It might also be suggested that the. opening part of the statement of agricultural policy made by Mr. Morrison (the Minister of Agriculture) in the House of Commons on the 27th May, 1937, could be considered as indicating that the Government had not at that date departed from the levy-subsidy idea in regard to milk and pig products. In that statement, which was approved by the Cabinet after consideration by the Agricultural Policy Committee, the Minister of Agriculture used these words *: &apos;&apos; The Government have very carefully considered the position of agriculture from the points of view of the welfare of agriculture itself, national defence, and the importance of maintaining continuity in our agricultural policy that is designed to ensure, maximum supplies for the consumer consistent with reasonable remuneration for the producer. The Government have in the past initiated proposals for dealing with particular agricultural products. This side of the Government&apos;s policy will continue, and I hope shortly to announce proposals for the future of the milk and pig industries.&quot;III. Other Statements on Levy-subsidy.9. The application of the levy-subsidy system to agriculture as the most suitable form of giving any necessary assistance to the industry without unduly raising prices of foodstuffs has been preferred, by comparison with the alternative of quantitative regulation of imports, by two authoritative Committees appointed by the Government.(a) The Committee on Economic Information of the Economic Advisory Council, under the Chairmanship of Sir Josiah Stamp, was invited to enquire into the co-ordination of different industrial and agricultural considerations in formulating trade policy. In its 13th Report on the Co-ordination of Trade Policy, issued in October 1934, the Committee suggested certain broad principles which should govern our commercial and agricultural policy, and recommended that we should avoid measures calculated to raise materially prices of essential foodstuffs above the level which would otherwise prevail or to entail a progressive reduction in the volume of food imports, and that we should contrive, in times of severe depression of world agricultural prices, to secure reasonable prices for our farmers sufficient to maintain financial solvency, and to avert exhaustion of capital, impairment of equipment or curtailment of production. They criticised the expedient of the quantitative limitation of imports as being prejudicial to the maintenance of our export trade, and expressed a preference instead for the system that had been successfully adopted in the case of wheat, whereby, through a comparatively small levy on home-milled and imported flour, United Kingdom wheat growers had been able to secure for their wheat, in times of depression, a reasonable price far in excess of the ruling world price and with only a negligible burden on the consumers which had merely served to withhold from them part of the windfall benefit they would otherwise have derived from abnormally low
prices. The Committee suggested that, with suitable variations and with safe-guards against unduly expanding domestic output, this method might be adopted for other commodities, particularly those, such as milk, eggs, poultry, meat and vegetables, which this country is especially well fitted to produce.(b) The Leith-Ross Inter-Departmental Committee, which, on the instruc-tions of the Cabinet, examined the Stamp Committee&apos;s Report, also pronounced in favour of the levy-subsidy system, and, in particular, its application to those branches of agriculture for which this country has natural advantages. This Committee recommended the replacement of the system of quantitative restriction on imports by a system involving less cost to the consumer, which, in practice, involves a direct subsidy financed, where possible, under trade agreements, by a levy on imports. They pointed out that, if financial assistance to the home producer is derived in whole or in part from a levy on imports, this method would tend to reconcile him to acceptance of such imports and that it would in no way preclude arrangements for the better regulation of production and marketing by overseas producers themselves. The Committee endorsed the view expressed in the Stamp Report that, in general, the system adopted in the Wheat Act should, with suitable variations, be applied to other commodities. They also suggested that any such measures adopted should be devised so as to encourage the maximum efficiency in domestic production and marketing, should contain safeguards against undue increases of production, and should include provision for automatic adjustment if the level of world prices should rise adequately. Where existing trade agreements precluded the imposition of levies on imports of commodities the home production of which it was desired to assist, the Committee urged that every effort should be made to obtain by negotiation the modification of such agreements. Though the levy-subsidy system was endorsed by the Committee as being preferable at that time to alternative indirect methods of assisting agriculture, there is nothing in their Report to show that they considered the general objections to this system, as an instrument of public finance, which are developed later in this paper.10. More recently considerable prominence has been given in agricultural circles to the Report issued in March 1937 by the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. This Report also endorsed the levy-subsidy system as one of the suitable methods of assisting home agriculture. They pointed out the importance of maintaining a prosperous and progressive agricultural industry in this country and suggested that the large financial gain accruing to United Kingdom Industry because the United Kingdom public was enabled to buy food at the lowest world-prices, often below cost of production, should be used in part to prevent distress to our own agriculture. The farming industry read this as indicating that the Chambers of Commerce were sympathetic to the principle of levy-subsidy.11. It will thus be seen that the levy-subsidy system has been a good deal canvassed in recent years, and that Ministers, Departmental Committees and unofficial interests have been disposed to endorse it as providing a suitable means of helping agriculture, and Ministers have made public statements to this effect. It is fair to say, however, that this disposition has been due less to consideration of any inherent merits that the system may have than to realisation of the difficulties involved in assisting agriculture by the alternative methods of protective duties and quantitative regulation of imports. There is, however, a third alternative, viz., direct Exchequer subsidies, and this alternative is the basis of the Milk Policy announced in the White Paper issued in July.IV. The Farmers&apos; claim for equal treatment with Industry.12. Broken pledges are only a part of the farmers&apos; complaint. The contrast with the treatment accorded to manufacturing industry by way of fiscal protection is of equal importance in their charges against the Government. They assert that manufacturing industry has the advantage of duty-free raw materials, e.g., cotton, flax, wool, hides and skins, rubber, metallic ores, wood pulp, &amp;c, while competing manufactured articles from foreign countries, from which the bulk of such goods arrive, are subject to duties sufficient to give reasonable protection to the home manufacturer and equivalent on the average to 20 per cent, ad valorem for all goods in Class III (articles wholly or mainly manufactured). By contrast the raw materials of agricultural production are often dutiable in the interests of
the home manufacturer. Thus, substantial duties have been.imposed on nitro-genous and other fertilisers, and in this connection price agreements have been arranged including provision for raising prices if the costs of raw materials and labour should rise. Such a rise in price has recently taken place, with the con-currence of the Import Duties Advisory Committee, in the case of nitrogenous fertilisers. Similarly, imported tractors, farm implements and certain oil cakes and seeds are dutiable either in the interests of the home manufacturer or for the benefit of producers in oversea British countries. From the farmers&apos; point of view, bad is made worse by the fact that many agricultural commodities are on the Free List and as regards others the duty is comparatively low. They assert that in practically all cases the protective effect is rendered negligible by the continued free entry of Dominion products, and that it is only in the horticultural group in the main that effective tariff protection has been provided.13. Farming in Great Britain, as in other European countries, has in general to take the form of mixed farming, i.e., the production of a number of products on the same holding, and the fundamental difficulty of the United Kingdom farmer is that in each one of these products he has to face the competition of the specialist oversea producer working under the most favourable conditions and with the lowest costs. The severity of such competition is shown by the fact that in other European countries, e.g., France and Germany, where it is the policy of ,Governments to protect domestic agriculture by tariffs, duties of a very high order have to be imposed upon imports from the low cost producing countries in order to give effective protection to the domestic producer. The difficulties of the home farmer are, moreover, greatly increased by reason of this high agrarian protection in Europe, since the United Kingdom thus becomes the principal and in some cases (e.g., meat) virtually the only market for the produce of the exporting agricultural countries, and in many cases the home farmer has to face the dumping, sometimes subsidised dumping, of world surpluses in this market.14. Imports of food-stuffs into this country amounted in 1935 to  287 million, and of this  125 million enter from British countries, mainly free of duty.* It is contended that, so long as Dominion free entry continues, the duties ; on those foreign products which the Dominions also export to us are of negligible protective value to the home farmer. For example, the duty on foreign butter was devised, not for the purpose of giving the home farmer protection against the foreign producer, but to give protection in this market to the Dominion producer against the foreign producer, and that, in fact, is what it has done. Moreover, the Dominions not only enjoy free entry into this market but claim an expanding share of it. If it is desirable to allow a large volume of cheap food-stuffs to be imported into this country and if, therefore, it is undesirable to impose a protective tariff to keep them out, the home farmer claims that he must at least ; be enabled to retain his due share of the market, and that the best means to achieve this end is the levy-subsidy. Quantitative regulation, while it may be used to give a certain stability to the market by preventing abnormal dumping of imports, cannot normally be applied to raise or restore prices in cases, such as dairy products, where home production forms only a small percentage of the total supplies coming on to the market.15. Ever since the change in the fiscal policy of this country in 1931, Ministers have publicly subscribed to the doctrine of home producer first, Dominion producer second and the foreigner third, both for manufactured and agricultural products. In a number of cases, the home farmer claims that this very reasonable doctrine has not in fact been applied, particularly where, as with , dairy products, Dominion supplies form a large part of total consumption. A moderate levy applicable to supplies from all overseas sources, the proceeds of which are devoted to assisting home producers, affords, in the farmers&apos; opinion, the best method of carrying out this principle.16. It is recognised that agriculture has been assisted in many ways. Statutory power has, for example, been given to enable the industry to organise itself on large-scale lines so that the home producer may stand on an equal footing* These figures exclude feeding-stuffs for animals and beverages. The dutiable goods from Empire sources consist of sugar and goods from the Irish Free State and are valued at about .- 18,000,000.
with the organised distributive trades. In this respect, agriculture enjoys similar facilities to those granted to the coal-mining industry and already enjoyed through voluntary combination by other important industries, such as the chemical industry. Internal marketing reorganisation alone, however, cannot solve farmers&apos; problems, if nothing is done to safeguard the home market against the competition of cheap imported supplies. It is an important part of the farmers&apos; case that if they take steps to promote the organisation and development of their industry and the orderly marketing of their products, they are entitled and Parliament has recognised their claim in the Agricultural Marketing Act, 1933, and in the Livestock Industry Act, 1937 to expect that some degree of control will be applied to supplies entering the market from abroad.17. Farmers have also been assisted by means of subsidies. In certain cases, however, e.g., wheat, the subsidy has dropped pro tanto as prices have risen, and in the result the farmer is left to bear the higher costs with no improvement in his returns. In fact the return which farmers on an average are making on their capital and the wages which agricultural labourers are receiving are both very low compared with the average profits made and wages paid in industry.V. Industry v. Agriculture A possible reply to Farmers&apos; claims.18. The majority of the raw materials of agriculture (feeding stuffs and fertilisers) pay either no duty or a low one, the principal exceptions being the duties on certain important fertilisers, caterpillar tractors and the duty on oats which was imposed in the interest of producers of oats. In the case of oats, as of some other products, most of the imports come in duty free from the Dominions. As regards what may be called the machinery of agriculture, such as tractors, milking machines, &amp;c, the general level of duties on these products is if anything below the level of the duties on machinery, commercial vehicles, &amp;c, used by industry. For example, the duty on most agricultural machinery is 15 per cent, ad valorem, while on industrial machinery generally it is 20 per cent. It must also be borne in mind that, in the case of industry as well as in the case of agriculture, the prices of raw materials and costs of production (including wages) have increased and may largely offset the advantage to manufacturers of higher prices for finished goods. The recent increase in the price of nitrogenous fertilisers, which it may be noted was approved by the Import Duties Advisory Committee, is entirely due to this cause.19. It is difficult, indeed impossible, to attempt to compare at all closely the extent of Government assistance given to industry with that given to agriculture. The protection of agriculture has necessarily taken a different form from that of industry. Protection has been given mainly though not entirely  there are also duties on agricultural products,* some of which (the horticultural duties) are highly protective by (1) a control of imports, and (2) subsidies. In some cases, notably beef, mutton and lamb, sugar, bacon and wheat, it is arguable that a much greater measure of assistance has been given by one or both of these methods than could ever have been given by a protective tariff.20. The claim of the farmers that, even when import duties have been applied to foreign goods, their effect has been seriously undermined by free entry from the Dominions must be qualified. While the duties on butter, cheese and perhaps oats have benefited the Dominions more than the home producer, the duties on the other products referred to by the Minister of Agriculture* have largely benefited the home producer.21. In the case of manufactured goods, tariff protection is, in most of the staple industries, designed to encourage the manufacture here of goods which can be made at home about as cheaply as they can be imported. It is just because this consideration does not apply to agriculture and no substantial increase in home production of staple foodstuffs could be achieved without a very substantial rise in costs and prices, that tariff protection is inappropriate to many important agricultural products. Other methods have had to be employed and industry has not received these other forms of assistance given to agriculture there is no* In a recent speech, the Minister of Agriculture pointed out that there were import duties &apos; on foreign beef, butter, cheese, processed milk, eggs, fruit, flowers, honey, hops, oats, sugar, veal and vegetables.
parallel case in industry to the subsidies enjoyed by agriculture with the possible exception of the tramp shipping subsidy. ;22. It is argued that the farmer has not participated to the same extent as the industrialist in the increased prosperity of the last year. The conclusion to be drawn from this is by no means obvious. Agriculture in common with industry has shown a noticeable recovery from the depression of 1931-32. The recent increase in industrial prosperity has given rise to a large increase in the demand and prices for English beef and mutton, the price of certain classes of wool is nearly double what it was a few years ago and liquid milk sales have increased compared with the sales of milk for manufacture, while the price of liquid milk has also been increased. But in any case agriculture cannot expect to reach quite the same peaks as industry in that the Governments policy has aimed at avoiding for it the low troughs. Industry&apos;s returns may go up higher, but they are also liable to go down lower.23. The Governments aim for agriculture is not so much a standard level of protection (though that also is given in some cases) as a stable market and remunerative returns for efficient producers. The control of imports which in one form or another is applied to meat, to bacon, to potatoes, to processed milks, may well be a more certain and effective instrument of protection than any customs duty.24. The policy of tariff protection can do little or nothing for certain major industries, such as cotton and ship-building, which are necessarily mainly dependent on external conditions. The cotton industry in particular has on a number of occasions complained that the assistance given by the Government to agriculture, whether in the form of subsidies or machinery of reorganisation, has been much more effective than anything the Government has done for cotton, in spite of the worse plight of the cotton industry due to the fact that the market of the cotton industry has been very greatly reduced in recent years. It is probable that a number of industries would gladly exchange their tariff protection for the privileges enjoyed by certain branches of agriculture.25. The farmers may be looking jealously at the prosperity of the steel industry. But it is clear that at the moment this is due in the main to world conditions in regard to steel supplies and not to tariffs. For some months efforts have been directed to persuading foreign countries to send steel here, and as a help in this direction our tariffs on nearly all our imports of steel have been reduced to 2\ per cent. Here, as in the case of wheat, the measure of Government assistance (in this case the tariff) has been decreased with the rise in demand and price, though it is true that the farmer has not received compensation in the matter of the subsidy on wheat for the increase in his costs.26. Some farmers at the present time are suffering from the increased cost of feeding stuffs which is admittedly due to an increase in the world price. In so far as their competitors have to contend with similar increases in their materials, they have no more claim to increased protection than, for example, the tyre industry would have for an increase in the price of rubber, or the woollen industry for an increase in the price of raw wool, and, meantime, the farmers who produce feeding stuffs, e.g., barley and oats, are benefiting proportionately..27. If the main products of agriculture are taken separately it will be seen that one way or another they have a very large measure of assistance. It is at least arguable that they get more effective assistance than does the general run of industry with duties of the. order of 20 per cent.Livestock.28. Supplies are regulated on the basis that the whole of the United Kingdom production must first be provided for. There are duties amounting in their incidence to 20 per cent, on all kinds of foreign beef (which, rather than Dominion supplies, is the principal competitor with home-killed beef), and, in addition, a subsidy payable on home-bred fat cattle which has just been raised from 5s. to 7s. 6^. per cwt. for quality cattle (i.e., equivalent in all to about another 12^ per cent, on the price received for his cattle), 5s. remaining the figure for other home-bred cattle. There is also a restriction of imports of pork and Irish cattle.
Milk.29. The sale of liquid milk benefits by a natural monopoly and, now that home producers are organised, this allows them to charge for liquid milk whatever they can get the consumer to pay without seriously reducing the consumption; in the last five years the wholesale price of liquid milk has increased from 14s. per 12 gallons in London and 13s. in the provinces to 15s. \%d. The price of milk which goes for making butter, cheese and other milk products is, however, low, owing mainly to the fact that New Zealand and other countries can produce milk much more cheaply, but there is a duty of about 15 per cent, on foreign butter and cheese, which if it helps the Dominions, as it is meant to do, also helps the home producer; while, in addition, the home producer has had the benefit of a Government subsidy on milk sold for manufacturing below a certain figure. Though under the White Paper proposals this figure is to be reduced, the producer will get instead a new temporary subsidy for clean milk with the object of promoting the consumption of liquid milk. Moreover, special steps have been taken to reduce drastically the imports of processed milks, in particular condensed skimmed milk, which is a bye-product of the butter industry.Bacon.30. Since 1933 there has been a regulation of foreign imports on a fixed level of total supplies, making room out of foreign imports for all the bacon the home industry likes to produce, at a price artificially maintained at a standard level by the control of supplies. To this is now to be added a temporary subsidy to tide the industry over the period when it is reorganising itself and lowering its costs.Eggs and poultry.31. In the case of eggs there are duties on foreign imports amounting in 1936 to about 17 per cent. These duties are protective as imports from the Dominions remain small. The duties on poultry are also substantial. The advantages which many producers have of a market for eggs, &amp;c, practically at their doors should not be forgotten. In addition the possibility is being explored of guarding against the recurrence of the abnormal imports of last winter.Cereals.32. The Wheat Act gives the producer a guaranteed price on a standard production and this production is now to be increased by one-third. An insurance against unduly low prices is also to be given to producers of barley and oats. In addition barley producers benefit by an undertaking from the brewers to purchase 70 per cent, of English barley obtained for them by the Import Duties Advisory Committee in lieu of an increased import duty (the present duty is 10 per cent.), and oat producers have a prohibitive duty on foreign oats.Horticultural products.33. The protective duties on most of these products admittedly give &quot; effective &quot; protection. In addition there is the regulation of imports of potatoes under which imports are only admitted so far as home production falls short of the amount needed to satisfy the normal demand.Miscellaneous.34. Farmers are further being assisted under the Agriculture Act, 1937, by cheap supplies of lime and basic slag and there is also the sugar beet subsidy and the monopolistic powers granted to producers of hops coupled with a high protective duty. Under the income-tax and de-rating laws, the farmer is also in a privileged position compared with manufacturing industry.VI.-A advantages and Disadvantages of Levy-Subsidies.35. In its application the levy-subsidy system is generally understood to mean an earmarked levy, the proceeds of which are paid into a special fund from which home producers are subsidised. This is the method adopted in the Wheat Act, 1932, and in that case it has proved remarkably successful.   The
farmers prefer this method because the administration can be entrusted to an independent statutory body without the necessity for the subsidy appearing on Annual Votes of Parliament and thus being exposed to yearly criticism in the House of Commons. In the Wheat Act form the subsidy and the levy can be readily adjusted to price movements and the return to the farmer on his product is fully safeguarded. It is also possible, however, to have a fixed levy as well as to earmark only a part of either a fixed or variable levy to the subsidy. Once the levy-subsidy has been embodied in legislation the question is largely removed from the political and parliamentary arena and is, therefore, less embarrassing to Ministers because the day-to-day administration is out of their hands and there is no necessity for Annual Votes by Parliament.36. Apart from the considerations advanced by the three Committees mentioned above, the question of levy-subsidies and their relative advantages and disadvantages can be most conveniently considered from the point of view of (a) the producer, (&amp;) the consumer, (c) the Treasury, and (d) commercial relations, generally. x(a) The Producer.37. It is not possible to assist effectively most branches of agriculture by a protective tariff. In the case of most agricultural products the Dominions have the right of free entry, and this neutralises the protective effect of duties on most foreign imports. Even where, as in the case of milk products, there is power to impose duties on Dominion products, the Dominions&apos; right to a substantial preferential margin means that effective tariffs cannot be imposed without raising duties on foreign products to. unreasonable levels. It was largely for reasons of this character that the Import Duties Advisory Committee rejected, in July last, applications for increased duties on butter and cheese.38. From the point of view of the producer, the levy-subsidy is an alternative to the protective tariff which is suited to his particular needs. It is an important feature of the levy-subsidy that the revenue available for assign-ment would normally vary directly with the volume of imports, and, therefore, bears some relation to the needs of the home industry at any given time. Thus, from the standpoint of the producer, a rising revenue is comparable in effect to an increase in the rate of import duty, such as would be demanded in the event of an increase in imports of manufactured goods, and it achieves these results without interfering with the volume of imported supplies. It obviously does not-handicap the foreign or Dominion producer or affect internal prices to anything like the same extent as the alternative of a protective tariff. Indeed, in many cases the effect on prices would be negligible, and it is difficult to see how the rights reserved at Ottawa in the interests of the home producer under Schedule A of the Ottawa Agreements and again reserved under Schedule I of the new Canadian Agreement could be used in a way that would affect so little either the Dominions or home consumers as would a small levy of the order of 5 per cent, earmarked for the benefit of the home industry. Whether or not the burden were borne by the home consumer or by the exporting country, the effect would be small in comparison with the normal fluctuations in prices.39. The last-named consideration applies particularly in the case of dairy products because the Wnite Paper Policy, with its encouragement of milk production for liquid consumption and not for manufacturing, purposes, accords with the strong desire expressed by Mr. Nash during the New Zealand negotia-tions that encouragement should not be given to the manufacture of butter and cheese in the United Kingdom to the detriment of the Dominions.40. The levy-subsidy would give the producer some compensation for the fact that, unlike duties on manufactured.products generally, the existing duties on imports from foreign countries of a number of agricultural products, among which butter and cheese are conspicuous examples, were designed not for the benefit of the home farmer, but for the benefit of the Dominion producer and to assist the Dominions against foreign competition in the United Kingdom market.41. The first and admittedly very successful application of the levy-subsidy principle to home Agriculture was in the Wheat Act, which was passed in 1932 before the Imperial Economic Conference at Ottawa took place.   The Ottawa
agreements, with their guarantee of free entry for most agricultural products from the Dominions, effectually stopped the application of the Wheat Act principle to other commodities for at least three years, but this obstacle no longer exists.42. There is an atmosphere of permanence about a levy-subsidy, just as there is with the protective tariff, so long as we remain under a system of fiscal protection, and this appeals to the agricultural community. They also feel that the proceeds of the levy are their money, and in consequence are much more likely to be satisfied than in the case of a straightforward Exchequer subsidy, for the annual renewal of which the Government must seek the approval of Parliament.43. The levy-subsidy has the further merit that it gives the home producer compensation against subsidised imports either from the Dominions or from foreign countries.(b) The consumer.44. The levy-subsidy is less objectionable than a high protective tariff, although still open to objection from the consumers&apos; angle. It is particularly important in these days of rising prices to avoid doing anything which will still further increase the cost of living, and it is important to remember from this point of view that this country has always been a large consumer of cheap butter, and that nine-tenths of our supplies of butter are imported. There is evidence of growing public restiveness in face of the increasing cost of living, and this would be encouraged by the imposition of a tax, however small, on foreign and Dominion butter and cheese; however small the levy, any concurrent rise in retail prices would-be attributed to it, and were a levy-subsidy system in force now the consumer would undoubtedly be laying the blame on the Government for the increase in the price of butter, which has been very considerable recently. The Ministry of Labour index figures for the 1st October, 1937, show the following increases over the corresponding figures for the 1st January last: Per cent. 4-6 5 1 6 1 11-5 15-6The above arguments apply almost equally both to a levy or a moderate duty.(c) The Treasury aspect.45. The Treasury have strong objections in principle to the system of levy-subsidy as offending against accepted canons of sound public finance. It is unnecessary to set out in detail, the reasons that led to the complete abolition, in the last century, of the system of assigned revenues, which had formerly been widespread; but it is in point to recall that the only substantial revival of the system in recent years, viz., the Road Fund, Avas discontinued by the Finance Act of last year.46. In the Treasury view it is entirely wrong that the proceeds of a particular tax, instead of becoming part of the general revenue of the Exchequer, should be hypothecated to a particular service or for-the benefit of a particular section of the community. The limitations which such a system, if at all extensive, would impose on the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in regard both to the raising of revenue and the distribution of expenditure, are obvious.47. Furthermore, the levy-subsidy is objectionable on the ground that, once established, the subsidy is effectively removed from Parliamentary review. It is known that the Public Accounts Committee are restive about the existence of separate funds, such as the Wheat Fund, and any proposal to follow that prece-dent would almost certainly lead to strong criticism on the part of the Committee. In the opinion of the Treasury, the correct view is that any proposal to subsidise a particular industry ought to be considered on its merits in relation to the needs of the industry, and the amount of any subsidy to be given should be voted in the annual Estimates in the ordinary way.   Similarly any proposal to impose a levyCost of living (all items)...Food .........CheeseButter (fresh) Butter (salt)
or tax on particular imports should be considered on its merits, either as a protec-tive duty (whether protective of United Kingdom interests or protective in the sense of assisting Dominion producers as against the foreigner in the United Kingdom market) or as a revenue duty.48. The only existing precedent for the levy-subsidy is the wheat quota levy imposed on millers and flour importers in order to provide a guaranteed price for the United Kingdom wheat growers. That scheme has worked well, and the National Farmers&apos; Union would like to see its principles extended to other branches of agriculture. It is arguable, on the one hand, that there were special reasons for adopting exceptional measures in the case of wheat, while on the other hand it might be maintained that most of the features of the wheat scheme exist or could be reproduced in the case of a levy-subsidy for the benefit of United Kingdom milk production. Whatever the balance of that argument may be, the Treasury view would be that the system embodied in the Wrheat Act is bad from the financial and constitutional point of view and ought not to be followed. In a sense the objections in principle become stronger rather than weaker through the existence of a precedent. If that precedent were to be followed in the case of milk it would be difficult to resist its extension, e.g., to bacon and other agricultural products, and it is certainly impossible to contemplate a state of affairs in which a whole series of taxes agricultural or industrial were diverted from the main stream of Exchequer revenue.49. It is understood that the Ministry of Agriculture would be prepared to argue that just as revenue considerations do not govern the imposition or removal of duties under the Import Duties Act so the levy-subsidy should be considered purely as an economic device designed to give protection to United Kingdom agriculture. In their view considerations such as the objections to assigned revenues are irrelevant. The Treasury, for their part, could not accept that argument. The revenue received from duties imposed under the Import Duties Act is part of the general revenue of the country and, so long as those duties continue, is available to the Chancellor of the Exchequer for Budget purposes. The revenue from these duties has indeed constituted a vital element in the balancing of the Budget in recent years, and the machinery of the Import Duties Act certainly does not constitute any precedent for action on the lines of the levy-subsidy.(d) Commercial Relations with the Dominions and Foreign Countries.50. (i) The Dominions. Schedule I of the new Canadian Agreement and Schedule A of the Ottawa Agreements with Australia, New Zealand and South Africa give us the right to impose duties on Dominion milk products, subject to the maintenance of existing preferential margins, but in practice it would be extremely difficult politically to propose such duties.51. The Dominion with which such a proposal would be most unpopular is New Zealand. The Government of New Zealand now buy all the butter from their farmers and are responsible for selling it. Consequently, any sum which we might decide it was necessary to collect on New Zealand butter would (except so far as it might be paid by the consumer) come direct from the New Zealand Treasury. A 5 per cent, levy would involve them in paying out (on 1936 figures) nearly  700,000 sterling per year. (This means, of course, considerably more in New Zealand currency.) The New Zealand Government have been negotiating with us for a new trade agreement to take the place of the Ottawa Agreement, which affords no real security to United Kingdom exporters against measures towards economic self-sufficiency contemplated by the present New Zealand Government. Mr. Nash has indicated that he would regard the proposal to single out dairy produce alone of the important agricultural products for a Dominion duty as a direct discrimination against New Zealand, whose exports of butter and cheese to the United Kingdom represent over 40 per cent, of her trade to the United Kingdom. In the circumstances, the proposal might well render an agreement with New Zealand politically impossible for the New Zealand Government, in which case the United Kingdom would have to face the risk of prohibitive duties or even prohibitions of imports being imposed on various classes of United Kingdom exports.52. The same considerations apply with somewhat less force to Australia, with whom we expect to negotiate for a new Trade Agreement in the near future.
53. Dairy produce is so important a factor in the economy of both Australia and New Zealand that a trade agreement with those Dominions involving less favourable treatment for dairy produce than that now accorded would be the equivalent of a trade agreement concluded by the United Kingdom, which involved less favourable treatment for United Kingdom cotton or woollen goods.54. On the other hand it must be admitted even though this might not weigh with the Dominions that the effect of a 5 per cent, levy would be small in comparison with the normal fluctuations in prices or, for example, with the benefit that the New Zealand Government has derived from the recent rise in the price of butter. Comparing prices of New Zealand butter in September 1936 and 1937 the rise of 12s. per cwt. is equivalent, on an annual basis, to a rise in the New Zealand Governments receipts of about  If million. October prices show a still larger margin compared with last year. On commodities generally both Dominion and foreign exporting countries are now making much better returns from the United Kingdom market than was the case a year or two ago.55. All the Dominions would object strongly in principle to being asked to subsidise their United Kingdom competitors and, from their point of view, a straight duty would no doubt be less difficult of acceptance than a levy-subsidy. A proposal for a straight duty would, however, lead to a request that the revenue should be raised from some other commodity not of such importance to the Dominions.56. There is one further important point arising on any proposal to impose a levy on butter and cheese from the Dominions. Our discussions with the United States about the possibility of a Trade Agreement have reached a critical stage. As a condition of negotiations the United States insist upon the modification of a wide range of preferences guaranteed under the Ottawa Agreements. There is no hope of reaching a basis of negotiation unless we can persuade the Empire Governments concerned to agree to important abatements of their guaranteed preferences; Canada, for example, is being asked to forgo preferential advantages on apples and lumber. The Canadian Government are showing considerable reluctance to agree to the United States requirements. The Australian Government are likely to be no less reluctant to agree to modification of the preferences in which they are interested. The assent of the New Zealand Government, though New Zealand is less directly affected, will not be easy to Obtain. The essence of the appeal we are making to the Dominions to waive their rights is that they should play their part in that movement for the reduction of trade barriers on which the future prosperity of the world and political appease-ment so largely depend. How can we expect them to believe in our sincerity if, at the same time, we are ourselves proposing new duties on imports of butter and cheese, which account for so large a part of their trade with us % Taking butter and cheese together, imports in 1936 were, from   million.Canada     ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...        2Australia ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...        8New Zealand      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      18^57. (ii) Foreign Countries. There is no doubt from previous experience in negotiations with Argentina and Denmark that foreign countries object strongly in principle to a levy-subsidy, under which they are asked to contribute financially to their competitors. From the point of view of foreign trade relations a straight duty is much preferable. In practice in the case of butter and cheese a 5 per cent, levy on imports from foreign countries would yield only about  1 million, whereas it would involve difficult trade negotiations with eight countries, namely, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, with all of which the present duties on butter and cheese are consolidated.58. From a commercial point of view we are hot in nearly such a good position to negotiate these trade agreements as we were in 1933, and it is unlikely that we should get such a good bargain. The value of the Trade Agreements may be illustrated by the increase in our exports which took place between 1932 and 1936 : United Kingdom exports to the foreign countries with which trade agree-ments (other than &quot; non-discrimination &quot;Agreements) were in force for the whole
or the greater part of 1936 increased by,  20 - 2 million or 30-6 per cent, (from  66 million to  86-2 million). In the same period exports to foreign countries with which we had not made trade agreements increased by only  4 - 5 million or 4-4 per cent, (from  103 million to  107-5 million).59. The political importance of maintaining the trade agreements intact was set out by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in a memorandum of the 20th July, 1936, to the Trade and Agriculture Committee (T.A.C. (36) 29). From the commercial point of view also continuity of policy is of the greatest importance, and it hardly seems worth while to subject the whole of our export trade to the countries concerned to the uncertainty which must result from the re-negotiation of these agreements for the sake of raising an extra  1 million on their dairy produce.60. Finally, there is the general argument that it is undesirable in principle to increase trade barriers at the present time. It was on the basis of this principle that we informed the South African delegates at the Imperial Conference that we could not consider increasing any of the foreign duties on which they were anxious to obtain increased preferences.VII. Application to Milk.61. The National Farmers&apos; Union have, for some time, been pressing their view that, in the best interests of producers and consumers, a levy, with a preference to the Dominions, should be imposed on all competing imports of milk products, and that the proceeds of- the levy, together with the proceeds of existing duties on foreign milk products, should be applied to maintaining reasonable price levels for home-produced milk. It should be explained that, in order to maintain an adequate supply of milk for liquid consumption in winter, when yields normally fall off, a margin of about 20 per cent, in the total milk-producing capacity of our dairy herds is necessary. This surplus, which mainly occurs in summer, has to be sold for manufacture at prices which have an adverse effect on the pool price. In the year ended the 30th September., 1937, total sales of milk on wholesale contracts in England and Wales declined by 3-^ per cent., and as this was accompanied by an increase in sales for liquid consumption of 3f per cent., the surplus available for manufacture accordingly declined. A similar position exists in Scotland.   This trend is continuing.62. The National Farmers&apos; Union contemplate that as an alternative to improving pool returns by raising the price of liquid milk to the consumer the loss incurred by the Milk Marketing Boards on manufacturing milk should be offset by the proceeds of the levy. It is not implicit, however, in the application of the levy-subsidy system to the dairying industry that the proceeds of the levy should be used for raising the return on milk used for manufacture, and from many points of view the policy in the White Paper of July last of devoting assistance to the expansion of the liquid milk market and merely introducing a price insurance system as regards manufacturing milk is sound. It would be quite possible to maintain this policy, but to improve its effectiveness from the proceeds of a levy on imports of milk products.63. The existing duties on foreign butter of 15s. per cwt. and cheese of 15 per cent, ad valorem bring in, on the basis of 1936 imports,  3,576,000 per annum, plus  678,000 on Irish Free State imports which are dutiable under the Irish (Special Duties) Act. The imposition of a levy of 5 per cent, on Dominion butter and cheese, with a corresponding addition to the existing duties on foreign supplies (it would be convenient to make it 5s. per cwt. in the case of butter), would bring in an additional  2,827,000, of which  117,000 would be derived from Irish Free State imports. It would be a matter for consideration whether, if such a levy applied to the Irish Free State, there should be a corresponding reduction in the Irish Special Duties. A levy of 5 per cent, is suggested as being the largest practicable addition to the existing duties on foreign butter and cheese. This figure of  2,827,000 compares with the sum of  1,750,000 to  2,000,000 per annum provided in the White Paper for quality premiums for milk during the first three years, plus a contingent liability if the price of milk for manufacture into butter and cheese falls to very low levels.   This would
establish the levy-subsidy system and go some way to satisfy the farmers&apos; demands.Part II.64. An. attempt has been made in the earlier part of this paper to set out the. history and the advantages and disadvantages of levy-subsidies for agricultural products with special reference to the milk industry. In the event of Ministers deciding not to adopt the principle of the levy-subsidy, the Committee have considered, with special reference to milk products, what alternatives there are which might be put forward to meet the farmers&apos; contention that they do not receive and are entitled to a degree of assistance equivalent to that afforded to industry by means of tariffs. ...VIII. The Alternative.65. If the Government decides against the application of the levy-subsidy system to milk and other agricultural products, such as eggs, the policy for which is still undecided, it will be necessary either : (a) to demonstrate that agriculture in general, and the dairy industry in particular, is receiving under the Government&apos;s various policies and proposals assistance broadly commensurate with the tariff protection granted to industry; or (6) to take steps to afford, where necessary, such assistance to agriculture as would justify such a contention. As regards (a), the comparative position of industry and agriculture is examined in Section V. If necessary this might form the basis of a reply to the farmers&apos; contentions. The alternative under (&amp;) in respect of milk products is set out in the succeeding Section IX. There are, however, certain general considerations to which it is desired to direct the attention of Ministers.66. It is impracticable to evaluate the assistance being given by the Govern-ment to agriculture generally in comparison with its assistance to industry under the Import Duties4Act. All that can be said is that farmers are not enjoying equally with industry the present economic prosperity of the country as a whole, and it will be difficult to persuade them that this contrast is not due to the inadequacy of the assistance accorded to them as compared with the tariff protection accorded to manufacturers.67. From the point of view of any particular manufacturing industry, the important consideration is not the average rate of the tariff, but the amount of tariff necessary to give effective protection to that particular industry. So far as dairy products are concerned, as the Import Duties Advisory Committee have pointed out, no straight tariff that could be imposed would be adequate to give effective protection. Moreover, the subsidy proposed in the White Paper is a diminishing subsidy, irrespective of the economic circumstances of the Milk industry, and is, therefore, not comparable to the assistance available to mahu-facturing industry under a permanent tariff system.68. Any alternative or additional measure of assistance, if it is to have any chance of satisfying farming opinion, would in fact need to provide :(a) for a fixed rate of subsidy subject to alteration only if conditions change.Farmers would not regard a subsidy that automatically diminishes and is only designed to carry them over a period as either in principle or in equity the equivalent of permanent tariff protection to industry.(b) for an insurance that the benefit of any fixed subsidy proposed would notbe lost by abnormal or rapidly expanding imports or by falling prices. It would, therefore, be necessary either to give an Exchequer guarantee against appreciably lower prices than those prevailing at present or to retain power to regulate imports of Dominion and foreign products, as&apos;was done in the case of imports of live-stock and meat under Part III of the Live-stock Industry Act, 1937.69. If there is to be no levy-subsidy for milk products, it would probably be impracticable to apply this remedy to eggs, bacon or any other commodity for which the Government&apos;s policy is still unsettled. The Government may therefore be-faced with the alternatives of Exchequer subsidies or quantitative regulation as a permanent policy for.such branches of agriculture as can substantiate a case for further assistance equivalent to tariff protection.
IX. Suggested Alternative in the case of Milk Products.70. If the Government decides against the application of the levy-subsidy system to the milk industry, it should be possible to satisfy the reasonable critics of the White Paper policy among the farming community, if that policy were modified so as to make it more in accord with the claims of the dairy farmers to a measure of assistance and security which they would regard as comparable to that afforded to manufacturing industry under tariff protection and to that which would be given to them by a levy-subsidy. The Committee have been unable to determine what modifications would be required for this purpose. The Agricultural Departments consider that the minimum likely to avert the threatened political campaign is (a) an extension of the assistance for quality premiums proposed in the White Paper with a provision that any diminution or termination of such assistance should be subject to review by an independent body; and (fe) a greater measure of price insurance to the industry in connection with milk used for manufacture. The other Departments represented agree with the proposal to give a greater measure of price insurance for manufacturing milk, but are unable to recommend the proposal of the Agricultural Departments with regard to quality premiums. They take the view that the farmers&apos; criticism of the assistance proposed for quality premiums might be met by other methods. The three alternatives are discussed in the following paragraphs : (a) Quality Premiums.71. The main objection of the Milk Marketing Board and the National Farmers&apos; Union to this part of the White Paper is the diminishing and terminating character of the Exchequer contributions to the quality premiums proposed. It is accordingly suggested by the Agricultural Departments that the Exchequer contributions and pool premiums should be continued for the third year at the initial rate specified in the White Paper (see paragraph 13 of Appendix II) for the first two years, and that this should be accompanied by an announcement to the following effect. It is contemplated that as the Govern-ments White Paper policy takes effect it should be possible to reduce the rates of the Exchequer contributions. It is proposed that the matter should be reviewed by the Milk Commission during the third year, and at such intervals thereafter as Ministers may direct, with a view to advising Ministers on the extent and method of application of the Exchequer assistance to be made available in the light of the progress made in the production of clean and pure milk and of the needs of the industry.72. The effect of this modification will be to increase the total Exchequer assistance under this head from  1,781,000 to  2,586,000 in the third year, but the average annual sum to be found by the Exchequer over the first three years will be approximately  2,000,000. Details of the proposed Exchequer assistance are given in Appendix I.73. In the opinion of the other Departments, the objection of the farmers to the diminishing and terminating character of the Exchequer contributions to the quality premiums proposed amounts to a challenge of the fundamental policy of the main part of the White Paper, and the Inter-Departmental Committee has not embarked on a re-examination of this policy. The same differences of opinion as were resolved by the Cabinets decision embodied in the White Paper would have reappeared.74. Two alternatives to the Agricultural Departments&apos; proposals are suggested :. (i) If it is thought impracticable to maintain the proposals in the white paper without alteration, it would still be possible to maintain the 1  scales of quality premiums and Exchequer contributions thereto and at the same time to make the concession upon which the Committee is in agreement on the price insurance plan.(ii) A further approach to meeting the farmers&apos; claims, which would notoffend against the principle of a tapering measure of assistance for quality milk contained in the White Paper might be as follows : It is undoubtedly difficult at this stage to forecast accurately what will be the effect of the scales of quality premiums and Exchequer
contributions proposed in the White Paper. Paragraph 13 fixes the Exchequer contributions for 5 years except in the case of Attested Herds, and appears to confine the possibility of a review in the third year to the latter case alone. It would be reasonable for the Govern-ment to say that it adheres to the policy announced in July, and sees no reason to suppose that any possible modification of it at this date would give it now an appreciably altered expectation of success. If its estimate of the possibilities is proved wrong in experience, the Government will, however, naturally take into consideration the facts as they appear, and it is the intention, with this in mind, to have a particular examination of the circumstances of the industry and the working of the whole scheme in the third year in the light of an unbiassed review by an.independent body, the Milk Commission, with a view to assessing the effectiveness and suitability of the Exchequer assistance made available and required. In addition, it is suggested that the Milk Commission should be empowered, if in the light of the working of the scheme it considers it expedient, to recommend an alteration in the White Paper scales before the end of the second year, i.e., before the date at which, according to the White Paper, the first diminution in the rate of Exchequer contribution would automatically take place.(b) Standard Price for Manufacturing Milk.75. The price insurance plan in paragraph 7 of the White Paper was of a crisis character and would not come into operation until the average prices of imported butter and cheese fell, over a period, below 1005. and 56s. per cwt. respectively. The present-exceptionally high prices of New Zealand and Danish butter are 152s\and 150s. respectively, and the prevailing prices of cheese are 73s. and 72s. for Canadian and New Zealand respectively.76. In seeking a new basis for a standard price for milk used for manufacture into butter and cheese, it is considered that a distinction should be made between winter and summer seasons, in view of the seasonal variation in quantities of milk available and in costs of production, and that there should be standard prices for each commodity for a summer season, March to August, and for a winter season, from September to February. Seasonal standard prices would also conform both with the seasonal trend in prices of butter and cheese in past years and with the practice observed by the Milk Marketing Boards in their contracts. It has also been the aim to preserve the relationship between the new standard prices and those announced in the White Paper which are based on the normal relationship between butter and cheese prices in previous years. If the revised proposals are to be at all acceptable to milk producers, they should compare not unfavourably with the guaranteed prices of Qd. and 5d. per gallon of manufacturing milk in winter and summer respectively, already embodied in the temporary Milk Acts.77.   It is suggested that the standard prices should be as follows : Butter. Cheese.Period.                            s.    d. s. d.Summer (March to August)...      ...      112   0 62   6Winter (September to February)   ...      120   0 67   678. If prices fell to the above standard levels, milk producers would be receiving from buyers under the formula used by the Milk Marketing Board in its current contract, prices per gallon of milk manufactured into butter and cheese as follows : -Butter. Cheese.Summer   ..........      464d. 520d.Winter    .........      5Sld. 6-23^.These prices are slightly higher in the case of cheese than those at present guaranteed under the Temporary Milk Acts, 1934-37, but in the case of butter are rather below the guaranteed price under the new formula for butter in the 1937 Milk Act, though an improvement upon the formula under the previous temporary Acts;
79. In order to provide for any marked change in the general price level, it is proposed that the standard prices should be subject to review every three years.(c) Standard Gallonage.80. The gallonage used for milk manufactured into butter and cheese in the last two years, including farmhouse cheese qualifying for assistance, has been asfollows : Butter. Cheese. Total.Million Million &apos; &apos;  million gallons. Gallons. Gallons.1935-36......      128                  1321 260$1936-37   ......      1141                  98 212$Having regard to the undesirability of stimulating unduly the manufacture of butter and cheese, it would be reasonable to fix a standard gallonage for butter and cheese of 125 million gallons in each case. These are below the quantities used in 1935-36, and as regards 1936-37, unfavourable weather conditions reacted adversely on the total milk supply, and as there was also some increase in liquid consumption, the quantity of milk used for manufacture was accordingly reduced. It is necessary to maintain a substantial margin above liquid requirements in order to enable the winter liquid milk supply to be maintained at normal levels, to allow for some expansion in liquid consumption, and, in the event of another economic depression, to provide against a reduction in liquid requirements with a consequent increase in the manufacturing surplus until the necessarily slow process of readjustment of supply to demand has taken place. On political grounds, it is also desirable to avoid the semblance of restriction of home agricultural production.81. It is suggested that the standard gallonages should be subject to review at the same time time as the standard prices, so that, if necessary, they could be brought into line with any substantial change in circumstances in the milk industry.(d) Quantitative Regulation.82. If there is to be an increase in the Exchequer guarantee to milk producers by raising the minimum prices at which milk for manufacture into butter and cheese will be guaranteed, it is for consideration (a) how much likelihood there is of any substantial call being made on the Exchequer in the next few years, and (&amp;) whether anything can and should be done by means of arrangements with importing countries to safeguard the Treasury and in certain eventualities the home producer-against any large fall in prices.83. .It is not thought that there is any great risk of a substantial increase either in home production or in imports of butter which might cause a substantial fall in prices, e.g., below 100s. per cwt. Over 80 per cent, of the world&apos;s exports of butter come to this market, and Denmark, Australia and New Zealand are responsible for two-thirds of our imports; New Zealand, at present the largest supplier of the three, has now a very real interest of maintaining the price of butter, since the New Zealand Government purchases all the butter produced by its farmers at a fixed price; Denmark, the second largest supplier, is fully alive to the importance of maintaining the price of butter and, indeed, a year or two ago made advances to Australia and New Zealand through diplomatic channels to ascertain whether they were prepared to enter into an agreement for the limitation of supplies of butter in order to maintain prices.

79. In order to provide for any marked change in the general price level, it is proposed that the standard prices should be subject to review every three years.(c) Standard Gallonage.80. The gailonage used for milk manufactured into butter and cheese in the last two years, including farmhouse cheese qualifying for assistance, has been asfollows : Butter.              Cheese. Total.Million Million million gallons. Gallons. Gallons.1935-36   ...      ...      128                  132^ 260 1936-37   ...      ...      1141                  98 212!Having regard to the undesirability of stimulating unduly the manufacture of butter and cheese, it would be reasonable to fix a standard gallonage for butter and cheese of 125 million gallons in each case. These are below the quantities used in 1935-36, and as regards 1936-37, unfavourable weather conditions reacted adversely on the total milk supply, and as there was also some increase in liquid consumption, the quantity of milk used for manufacture was accordingly reduced. It is necessary to maintain a substantial margin above liquid requirements in order to enable the winter liquid milk supply to be maintained at normal levels, to allow for some expansion in liquid consumption, and, in the event of another economic depression, to provide against a reduction in liquid requirements with a consequent increase in the manufacturing surplus until the necessarily slow process of readjustment of supply to demand has taken place. On political grounds, it is also desirable to avoid the semblance of restriction of home agricultural production.81. It is suggested that the standard gallonages should be subject to review at the same time time as the standard prices, so that, if necessary, they could be brought into line with any substantial change in circumstances in the milk industry.(d) Quantitative Regulation.82. If there is to be an increase in the Exchequer guarantee to milk producers by raising the minimum prices at which milk for manufacture into butter and cheese will be guaranteed, it is for consideration (a) how much likelihood there is of any substantial call being made on the Exchequer in the next few years, and (b) whether anything can and should be done by means of arrangements with importing countries to safeguard the Treasury-and in certain eventualities the home producer-against any large fall in prices.83. .It is not thought that there is any great risk of a substantial increase either in home production or in imports of butter which might cause a substantial fall in prices, e.g., below 100s. per cwt. Over 80 per cent, of the world&apos;s exports of butter come to this market, and Denmark, Australia and New Zealand are responsible for two-thirds of our imports; New Zealand, at present the largest supplier of the three, has now a very real interest of maintaining the price of butter, since the New Zealand Government purchases all the butter produced by its farmers at a fixed price; Denmark, the second largest supplier,, is fully alive to the importance of maintaining the price of butter and, indeed, a year or two ago made advances to Australia and New Zealand through diplomatic channels to ascertain whether they were prepared to enter into an agreement for the limitation of supplies of butter in order to maintain prices. No progress was made because this approach was made at a time when prices were beginning&quot; to rise again, but there is little doubt that an attempt would be made by the two principal suppliers to maintain prices in the event of any serious slump. Australia, however, is an unknown quantity; it is impossible to forecast whether she is, likely to expand her exports in the next few years sufficiently to disturb the market, and whether she would be prepared to enter into any kind of control arrangement with the other producers; her Government, at any rate, shows signs of becoming more &quot; regulation minded as a result of the development of the policy of control of beef, mutton and lamb. -.. .-:
84. So far as the home supply is concerned, there are no present signs of any substantial increase in milk production. Indeed, the trend appears to be downward. This applies particularly to milk for the manufacture of butter and cheese, as the policy of the Milk Marketing Board is to divert the supplies of manufacturing milk clS f *%V clS possible from the less remunerative outlets (butter and cheese) to the more remunerative (e.g., cream); at the present time Wilts; United Dairies say there is no milk at all available for the manufacture of butter. It has been necessary recently to increase substantially the imports frOm the. Netherlands of condensed skimmed milk. (which is a bye-product of butter manufacture). Moreover, the liquid consumption of milk has been increasing steadily for about the last 18 months, and the surplus of milk for manufacturing purposes consequently diminishing. If the proposed guarantees do not insure the Milk Marketing Board an appreciably greater return on milk for butter and cheese than do the present arrangements, there is no reason to expect a change in this tendency,85. On the other hand, it is impossible to say whether there is likely to be a fall in the price of butter and cheese owing to a fall in the general level of prices. The rising tendency of the prices of butter and cheese is largely accounted for by the general increase in prosperity, and if and when there is a reaction, it is impossible to estimate the effect both on the general price level and on the demand for butter. Prices might, and at present levels would, suffer a substantial fall before the Exchequer guarantee became operative. This is a matter of some importance to the home industry as well as, of course, a safeguard for the Treasury. Further, from the point of view of the home industry, the possibility must not be overlooked that in the event of a serious depression (as in 1931-32) it might be necessary, on grounds of national economy, to withdraw this price guarantee as being too burdensome to the Exchequer. In such circumstances the only safeguard of the home producer would be quantitative regulation, and, as past experience has shown, it is at times of crisis that quantitative regulation is most necessary and most easily justified.86. If it should be thought necessary to arrange for some safeguard for the Exchequer and the home producer, the methods to be considered are (a) the reservation of the right to impose a moderate duty on all imports of butter and cheese, and (&amp;) the reservation of the right to regulate imports quantitatively.(a) The reservation of power to impose a moderate duty (in the case of foreign countries additional to the present duty) would seem preferable from the point of view of the Treasury, since it might if so decided be made to operate in the case of a fall in price whatever the cause, i.e., whether connected with an increase in imports or not. Such a duty is, however, open to many of the objections already enumerated to a levy-subsidy : it is open to the objection of principle that overseas suppliers do not like being askeol to contribute directly to their competitors; it is also open to the objection that overseas suppliers would be asked to pay out just at a time when, owing to lower prices here, they could least afford to do so. There is no doubt that some form of quantitative regulation, which would assist the overseas suppliers instead of damaging them, would be regarded by them as less objectionable. Further, such a duty would, in the nature of things, be temporary, and would only bring in a small amount of revenue. It would hardly be worth while to disturb the nine foreign trade agreements, and to incur the political embarrassment of imposing a duty on such an important Dominion product, for the purpose of recovering for the Exchequer a comparatively small amount of revenue.(b) The least objectionable proposal, therefore, seems to be to proceed by way of quantitative limitation of imports. The position as regards the Dominions is that Schedule A of the Ottawa Agreements and Schedule I of the recent Agreement with Canada give us the right to impose a duty, while maintaining the existing preference upon butter, cheese and other milk products or, in consultation with the Governments concerned to apply a system of quantitative, regulation. No treaty difficulty with them therefore arises, at present, but in fact it is quite clear in the light of discussions at the last Imperial Conference that it will be difficult to maintain Schedule A in its present form when the time comes to negotiate new Agreements. The Board of Trade might therefore endeavour at the appropriate time to obtain a clause in any new agree-ment with New Zealand, and in any negotiations with Australia and Canada,
modifying Schedule A of the Ottawa Agreements and reserving the right to limit imports of butter and cheese in the event of imports being such as to lead to instability in the market for milk products in the United Kingdom. It would be undesirable and probably unnecessary to attempt to renegotiate now the foreign trade agreements concerned to provide for such a contingency; but it would be necessary, when the occasion arose, to approach Denmark and the other countries having agreements in which an actual minimum quantitative figure has been guaranteed with the object of persuading them to play their parts in the scheme.87. It must,however, be recognised that even on this basis the Government would inevitably be open to the criticism that they were compelling consumers to pay higher prices and to restrict consumption of an essential foodstuff. Moreover, the Dominions would probably demand relatively more favourable treatment than foreign countries in any such scheme of limitation; such a demand would make the negotiations particularly difficult.88. If, nevertheless, it is thought necessary to proceed with this suggestion, it would be a matter for further consideration between Departments at what point in the price scale and under what precise conditions any such safeguard would be regarded as becoming operative.(e) The Position of Scotland.89. The opinion of the farming community in Scotland is generally in line with that of the National Farmers&apos; Union in England. In regard to the White Paper policy the National Farmers&apos; Union of Scotland go so far as to object to. any part of the premiums being a charge on the general pool, while the Scottish Milk Marketing Board, though not adopting that extreme attitude, are appre-hensive of the effect on milk production (already tending to diminish) of an increasing charge on pool funds towards the payment of quality premiums. The Board have also expressed a preference for a levy-subsidy scheme as against the price-insurance scheme of the White Paper. Pending adjustment of details of the quality premium scheme for Scotland in accordance with paragraph 15 of the White Paper, it is not possible to say whether the scheme will be acceptable to the Board, but there is no doubt that they would regard with grave apprehension the diminishing and terminating character of the Exchequer contribution after the first two years.(f) The Position of Northern Ireland.90. The position of Northern Ireland will also need consideration. As regards the- assistance for quality premiums, the Ministry of Agriculture for Northern Ireland consider that the Northern Ireland Ministry of Finance will be in a position to claim, through the Joint Exchequer Board, an increase in the Northern Ireland share of reserved taxation raised in Northern Ireland. In the case of the price insurance arrangements, however, which may be regarded very largely as an alternative to tariff protection to the milk industry in the United Kingdom against the competition from imported milk products, the Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture feel that just as Northern Ireland participated in the Exchequer assistance given to manufacturing milk under the Temporary Milk Acts of 1934-36, so they should also participate in the proposed price insurance plan and be eligible for direct assistance from the United Kingdom Exchequer.Conclusions. 9.1.   The available alternatives seem to be (1) To stand by the terms of the July White Paper on Milk Policy and to ; refuse to go beyond it.    :If this alternative is adopted, the lines of a possible defence are suggested in the foregoing paragraphs (see in particular Section Y). (2) To adopt a levy-subsidy system for the milk industry, with a levy of, say, 5 per cent, upon imports of butter and cheese from the Dominions, and a corresponding increase in the existing duties on foreign butter and cheese.The pros and cons of this alternative are set out in this paper.
(3) To modify the White Paper proposals by-(i) either (a) increasing and extending the assistance towards qualitypremiums and providing that diminution or termination of that assistance should be settled after a review in the i third year and thereafter by an independent body such as the proposed Milk Commission; or(b) maintaining   the   quality   premiums   and   Exchequercontributions as in the White Paper; or(c) maintaining   the   quality   premiums   and   Exchequercontributions as in the White Paper, but providing for a review of the White Paper scales by the Milk Commission during the third year in any case, and earlier if the Commission thinks it expedient; and(ii) giving a greater measure of price insurance in respect of milk used for manufacture.In this connection it is for consideration whether the power, at present covered by Schedule A of the Ottawa Agreements and Schedule I of the Canadian Agree-ment of 1936, should be reserved to impose quantitative regulation of imports of butter and cheese if imports were such as to lead to instability in the market for milk products in the United Kingdom.92. If alternative 3 (i) (a) is adopted the financial effect would be that Exchequer assistance for quality premiums in the first three years would average about  2 million per annum. Under any one of the alternatives in 3 there would be a contingent Exchequer liability for manufacturing milk that might reach .  300,000 per annum from time to time, and even under crisis conditions, when it is suggested quantitative regulation should be imposed, should not exceed  750,000 a year.(Signed) H.

MILK policy. The Government have carefully considered the position of the dairying industry from the points of view both of pro-ducers and of others engaged in the industry and of consumers. They have had before them the Report of the Reorganisation Commission for Milk, other- authoritative Reports bearing on the industry and also the views of representative organisations, all of which have been of the greatest assistance. They have also taken into consideration the recent outcome of the appli-cation made, on behalf of milk producers, to the Import Duties Advisory Committee, for increased duties on butter and cheese.*2. The Government desire to see the dairying industry of this country self-supporting and profitable and their policy for this industry, as for other branches of agriculture, is to ensure the maximum supplies for the consumer at fair prices consistent with reasonable remuneration for the producer. They believe that the only sure foundation for... the prosperity of the industry is an increased consumption of liquid milk. An essential step towards this objective is to establish public con-fidence in the cleanliness and purity of the milk supply and thereby to quicken demand for what is one of the most valuable of human foods. It is with this object in view, and in order to bring to full achievement the efforts that dairy farmers have themselves been making to improve the quality of their product, that they propose to invite Parliament to provide additional Exchequer assistance on the lines set out below.3. The Government also propose to continue and extend their policy of promoting the increased consumption of milk among those sections of the population for whom it is of particular value.4. With the approval of Parliament, the dairy farmers of Great Britain a few years ago set up Milk Marketing Boards under the Agricultural Marketing Acts. In this way, they were able to cope with a price situation that had been steadily growing unstable and to avert a collapse which would have spread disaster through the countryside.5. The industry, thus enabled by Parliament to attack its internal problems, was further assisted by a temporary Act called the Milk Act, 1934, the main provisions of which expired in 1936, which had a three-fold object, (i) to supplement the low receipts of the Milk Marketing Boards from the sale of milk for manufacture, (ii) to increase the consumption of liquid* An announcement on this subject was made by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury in reply to a Parliamentary question on 28th July,. 1937.
milk and (iii) to promote a purer ,milk supply. The first was of an &quot;emergency nature; the second and third indicated the lines of future policy. This measure has been extended once, and by the Milk (Amendment) Bill of this Session, it is proposed to extend the main provisions for a further period until 30th September, 1938. &apos;6. It is still desirable to safeguard the industry against emergency conditions, but circumstances have altered to an extent that now enables the Government to lay relatively greater emphasis on measures designed to promote the increased con-sumption of liquid milk and the provision of a purer milk supply.7. Under the Milk Act, 1934, the receipts of the Milk Market-ing Boards from manufacturing milk were supplemented by a system of repayable Exchequer advances based on standard prices per gallon of milk used for manufacture. The Govern-ment now propose to safeguard the industry against the effect of any serious fall in the prices of butter and cheese below current levels, by means of a price-insurance plan under which Exchequer assistance will be payable, on a prescribed scale, to the Boards in respect of standard gallonages of milk used in factories for butter and cheese, and milk made into cheese on farms, in the event of the average prices of imported butter and cheese falling, over a period, below 100s. and 56s. per cwt. respectively. The present average prices of imported butter and cheese are of the order of 115s. and 72s. per cwt. respectively. The corresponding prices in February, 1934, when the Milk Act proposals were announced, were 71s. 6d. and 47s. 6d. per cWt. respectively.8. The advances to the Milk Marketing Boards of Great Britain under the Milk Act, 1934, and subsequent legislation, involve the Boards in a contingent liability during a period ending 30th September, .1940, to repay to the Exchequer an amount estimated at over  3,400,000. This liability only arises if cheese or butter prices rise to a certain level, and it is antici-pated that the repayments which will have accrued by the 1st October, 1937, will amount to approximately  150,000. It is proposed to release the Milk Boards from any balance of this liability.accruing after the 30th September, 1937.9. In order to give the necessary momentum to the production of quality milks in Great Britain, the Government propose that Exchequer contributions should be made at diminishing rates, for a period of five years, towards the additional costs incurred inthe production of milk of the Accredited standard, milk of the Tuberculin Tested standard and milk from Attested Herds. This assistance will be partly in the form of quality premiums addi-tional to those now receivable by producers; but they will also
be, in part, in relief of the contribution towards quality premiums which all producers in England and Wales make to-day under the Milk Marketing Scheme. It is proposed that the rates of the Exchequer contributions will be fixed for five years in the. case of the Accredited and Tuberculin Tested schemes but that in the case of the Attested Herds scheme the rates should only be fixed for three years and that milk from attested herds shall be assisted in the fourth and fifth years at rates to be determined following a review of the position during the third year.10. The premium on Accredited milk sold by wholesale now payable from the pool funds of the Milk Marketing Board in England and Wales is at the rate of id. a gallon, the whole cost of which is borne by the pool; it is proposed that, for the five-year period beginning on ist October, 1938, this should be increased to ijd. a gallon, of which the Exchequer contribution would be fd. for each of the first two years, Jd. for each of the third and fourth years and Jd. for the fifth year, the balance each year to be borne by the pool. The proposed rate of premium of ijd. per gallon should encourage a large and increasing number of producers to take up the production of milk of this standard.11. As provided in the amendments, of the English Milk Marketing Scheme which Parliament has recently approved, the Milk Marketing Board will pay a special quality premium on sales of Tuberculin Tested milk sold by wholesale, which will no longer be exempt from the Scheme. For the first two years of the five-year plan under these proposals, the premium will be at the rate of id. a gallon, towards which the Government propose that the Exchequer should contribute Jd. For each of the third, fourth and fifth years, it is proposed that the Exchequer shall contribute ^d. a gallon and that the premium shall not be less than fd. a gallon.12. Under the Agriculture Bill of this Session, financial assist-ance is provided to encourage the eradication of bovine tuber-culosis by means of the Attested Herd Scheme. This assistance . includes an Exchequer payment of id. a gallon on milk from Attested Herds, the Milk Boards being under a contingent obli-gation to assume this Uability in due course. In order to accelerate the flow of pure milk under that Scheme, it is pro-posed for each of the first two years that the premium on sales by wholesale should be increased to 2d. a gallon, of which the Exchequer would contribute ijd. and the pool would be required to contribute ^d. as soon as these proposals came into force. For the third year, it is proposed that the premium that the Boards shall be required to pay shall not be less than ifd. a gallon towards which the Exchequer will contribute ijd. a gallon.   As stated above, the rates of assistance for the fourth
and fifth years will be determined later. In view of these new liabilities, it is proposed to release the Boards from the contingent obligation mentioned above.13. The following Table shows the rates of premium, which the Boards will be required to pay in respect of the various categories of quality milks and the Exchequer contributions thereto:  	Accredited Milk.

Exchequer assistance will be given for the fourth and fifth years also; it is contem-plated, however, that it will be on a dinnmshing scale, and as the amount can only be determined when the development of the scheme is known, it is proposed to leave this question to be reviewed during the third year in the light of the circumstances of the industry and the working of the scheme,The producer of Tuberculin Tested milk will thus earn premiums amounting to i^d.

(T.T. premium) equals 2^3. per gallon in the first two years and ijd. plus fd. equals 2d. in the remaining three years, towards which the Exchequer will contribute:  d.1st year 2nd year 3rd year 4th year 5th yearii4,2. 4jl 2Similarly the producer of Accredited Milk with an Attested Herd will earn premiums amounting, in the first two years to 3^d. per

The position of producer-retailers in England and Wales has. been improved by the recent amendments to the Milk Marketing Scheme which have, had the effect of placing their con-tributions on a new basis. In view of this, some modification of these proposals will be proposed in their case.15.&quot; It-is proposed to make corresponding provisions in rela-tion to the production of quality milks In Scotland, but certain adjustments may be necessary to. meet the special Scottish conditions.16.&apos; The Committee on Animal Diseases of the Economic Advisory Council recommended that the introduction of some measure of compulsory pasteurisation should no longer, be deferred and the Government propose that, subject to certain conditions, any Local Authority shall be enabled to apply to the Minister of Health, or the Secretary of State for Scotland, for an Order making compulsory the efficient pasteurisation of milk sold by retail in its area. These conditions are that no such Order shall come into operation within two years after it is made, that milk from tuberculin-tested herds and Sterilised Milk shall be exempt from its scope and that milk retailed from dairies where the.milk is derived from a single herd shall be exempt for three years from the date of operation of the Order..- r 17. The Reorganisation Commission for Milk, and other bodies that have examined the problem of milk distribution in recent years, have expressed the View that the present methods of disfributing milk are, in many respects, capable of improve-ment.. This appears to be generally accepted by those who speak on behalf of the distributive trade. Accordingly, the Government propose, in the legislation that will be necessary to carry out the present proposals, to include provisions to facilitate the improved organisation of the distributive service.18. It is proposed also to adopt the machinery of service schemes on the lines of those for which provision is made in the Livestock Industry Act of the present Session of Parliament, so as to enable the various sections of the industry to finance co-operatively services of common interest.19. The Government propose that a permanent Milk Corn-mission should be set up to keep under review the production, marketing and consumption of milk (including the effect of prices on demand) and to be of general assistance to the industryExchequer will contribute :  - ,d-if1st year ... 2nd year ... 3rd year ...
j and to the Ministers concerned. The primary duties of the Commission will be concerned with the improvement of milk distribution and with conciliation and arbitration between the Milk Marketing Boards and the milk buyers in business matters. Apart from this, it is not proposed to disturb the existing arrange-ments for the negotiation of contract terms and prices or the public safeguards provided, under statute, by the Consumers&apos; Committees and the Committees of Investigation. The Govern-ment propose, however, to take.steps to enable the views of con-sumers to be made available to the Milk Marketing Boards at an early stage in the contract negotiations.The Commission will be required to present an annual report for submission to Parliament.20. The Government regard the continuance of the scheme for the provision of cheap milk for school-children as an essen-tial feature of their proposals and they are confident that in this matter the co-operation of the industry will, as at present, be forthcoming.. This scheme has now proved&quot; its merits, and has resulted in a large increase in the consumption of milk in schools. In making arrangements for its continuance, the Govern-ment will consider the need for minor modifications to meet difficulties which have arisen in its administration. .21. The Government attach not less importance to an increased consumption of milk by expectant and nursing mothers, and children under school age, and they will bring forward proposals for securing, in co-operation with the industry, a reduction in the price of liquid milk to local authorities for the purpose of their maternity and child welfare arrangements. Local authorities will thus be in a position to extend their present schemes under which milk is made available either free or at a reduced price as circumstances may require.22. The Government commend the proposals as a whole as a policy which will provide for the dairying industry a basis for an increasing sale of milk in the liquid market, will secure cheap milk for those classes of consumers to whom it will be of particu-lar value and will provide for consumers generally a permanent improvement in the cleanliness and purify of the muk supply. The proposals should lead to a reduction in the cost of disfribu-tion and, as the eradication of disease among dairy herds pro-gresses, in the cost of production; they should lead to the enhancement of technical efficiency; and they will be a notable step towards the ultimate objective which must be to ensure that only clean and pure milk is offered for sale for liquid consumption.Legislation to give effect to these proposals will be. introduced as early as practicable next Session.23.
