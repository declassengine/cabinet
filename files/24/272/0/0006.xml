THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1937.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 260 (37).CABINET.PROPOSALS FOR THE AMENDMENT OF THE  CEYLONCONSTITUTION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.1. IN my memorandum of the 22nd September, CP. 220 (37), I submitted certain proposals for the amendment of the Ceylon Constitution.2. At the meeting of the Cabinet 36 (37) of the 6th October, it was agreed (Conclusion 10) that, before a decision was taken, I should circulate my proposals in the form of a draft Order in Council.3. The draft Order in Council appended to this Memorandum is accordingly circulated for the consideration of my colleagues.4. This draft deals only with the amendment of Article 22 of the Order in Council of 1931, and with the consequential amendments of certain other Articles. It is intended solely to render effective the powers given to the Governor by the Order of 1931 on the recommendation of the Special Commission of 1928, and to prevent the exercise of those powers being hampered or obstructed by the State Council. It imports provisions similar to those of sec. 44 of the Government of India Act. In place of the requirement in the original Order that the Governor, as a preliminary to the exercise of his powers, should declare the matter to be &quot; of paramount importance to the public interest &quot; is substituted the provision, based on similar provisions in the constitutions of several Colonies, enabling the Governor to enact legislation whenever he considers it necessary &quot; in the interests of public order, public faith, or other essentials of good government.&quot;5. The terms of the draft Order have been approved by the Acting Governor of Ceylon and his legal advisers, who regard the early amendment of the Order in Council as essential. The draft has been examined in the India Office in the light of the experience gained of the working of the Government of India Act.6. It is considered that the amendments now proposed are in accordance with the Report of the Special Commission, in which it is definitely stated that &quot; the power to enact legislation should rest absolutely in the Governor himself, and that no voting on the Bill should be required &quot;; and they are necessary in view of the obstruction by the State Council of powers which the Special Commission considered necessary, and which the Order in Council of 1931 was obviously intended to provide.7. As I indicated at the meeting of the Cabinet on the 6th October, I propose to defer for the present the further amendments of the Constitution which experience suggests as desirable, pending a full examination of the situation by the new Governor.8. Reference was made at that meeting to the possibility of the amendment of the Constitution raising wider issues, for example, in connection with Imperial preference. As my colleagues are aware, a measure of Imperial preference has been recently passed by the State Council of Ceylon. There has never been any suggestion that such a measure should be carried, in opposition to the Council, by [16070]
the use of the Governors special powers; and it does not appear that there need be any connection between the question of imperial preference and the question whether the Governor&apos;s power to override the Council in matters reserved for his discretion should be rendered effective. The alternative, to allow those powers to fall into desuetude in deference to the recent obstructive tactics of the State Council, is not one which I am able to advocate.9. I therefore seek the approval of my colleagues for the submission to the King in Council of an Order in the form of the draft printed as an appendix to this Memorandum.W. O. G.Colonial Office, October 29, 1937.
