THIS DOOUMEW? IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. SECRET. COPY NO.  LkCAl.SyjI.lEM1 OP UTM.IPLOYI.isn&apos;t INSURANCE ACTS.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR,la It was announced in the King1 s Speech at the Opening of Parliament that legislation would be introduced to enable meals to be supplied to boys and girls attending Junior Instruction Centres. This will be done by means of a Bill to amend the Unemployment Insurance Acts. My proposals under this head are stated below and the succeeding paragraphs mention certain other matters which I wish tc include in the same Bill*2a     Provision of Meals. Hilk and Biscuits for Juveniles attending Junior Instruction Centres and Classes.     Education Authorities are required to provide such Junior Instruction Centres or Classes for unemployed juveniles as may be necessary in their area.   Certain powers and duties of tho Authorities in respect of schools are extended to Centres, hut these do not include the provision of meals for juveniles attending Centres.   The National Advisory Councils for Juvenile Employment have recently recommended that such powers should be granted to the Authorities.   It is clearly desirable that the powers should not be greater in the case of Centres than schools.   I accordingly propose, substantially in accordance with the recommendations of the Councils, that Education Authorities should be granted power to provide meals, for juveniles attending Authorised Courses, similar in scope respectively to those exercised in connection with Public Elementary Schools in England and Wales, and Day Schools in Scotland.   Both National Advisory Councils have recommended also that Education Authorities should be enabled to provide free milk and biscuits for juveniles in attendance at Centres, without an income test or a medical test and I propose that the necessary powers should be granted.   The Board cf Education and the Scottish Department of Education are in agreement.
3.     Medical treatment for juveniles attending Centres in Scotland. Education Authorities in Scotland may make provision for the medical inspection of juveniles attending Centres, but they cannot provide medical treatment.   The National Advisory Council recommended that power to provide medical treatment as well as medical inspection at Junior Instruction Centres should be given.   I accordingly propose, in. agreement with the Scottish Department of Education, that Education Authorities in Scotland should be granted powers to provide free medical treatment at authorised courses in the same my as at Day Schools in Scotland.   Authorities in England and Y/ales already have the same powers fcr Centres as for Schools in this respect.4,     Outdoor Private Domestic Servants.     Private gardeners were brought into Unemployment Insurance by Regulations made under the Unemployment Insurance (Agriculture) Act, 1936.   In April, 1937 the Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee were asked to advise upon the question whether other types of &quot;outdoor private domestic servants&quot; should also be included in unemployment insurance.   The persons in question are in the main private chauffeurs (some 50,000), grooms (some 12,000) and game-keepers (some 13,000). No question was raised in regard to the domestic servants employed in private houses - cooks, housemaids and the like.   The Committee presented their Report on 23rd October and a copy is attached.Briefly the Committee recommend that private chauffeurs should be brought into the general scheme of unemployment insurance and all other outdoor private domestic servants into the agricultural* scheme.   Chauffeurs can be dealt with by means of Regulations but the action proposed as regards the other classes requires legislation.   The Exchequer contribution in the case of chauffeurs will be about  90,000 a year and in the case of the other classes  25,000 a year.I propose to take action accordingly.
-   1425&apos;     Credit of unemployment insurance contributions to ex-Service men.In general ex-Service men upon leaving the Services are, in relation to unemployment insurance contributions, already placed substantially in the position which they would occupy if their service had been in industry for a civil employer.     At the present time, however, a man who leaves the Service at his own wish (unless within three months of the date when he is due for discharge) and a man who is discharged as the result of conviction under one of the Service Acts or by a civil Court, is not entitled to any credit of contributions.     Thus a man who has served for several years but not for the full term of service, including a man who does not complete a second term of service, now receives no credit of contributions.The three Service Departments with the approval of the Treasury now propose that the law should be amended so as to provide that all Service men (with the following exceptions) shall, upon discharge, receive a credit of contributions corresponding to the number cf weeks of service less any weeks in respect of which pay is forfeited.     The proposed exceptions are -(a) deserters,(b) men discharged on account of fraudulent enlistment,(c) recruits or re-enlisted pensioners not finally approved. No credit is at present given to such men.It is further proposed that men discharged in consequence of conviction under one of the Service Acts or by any civil Court, shall be disqualified from the receipt of unemployment benefit for six weeks after the date of discharge.6.     Debt of the Unemployment Fund.     The debt on &quot;the General Account - as distinct from the Agricultural Account - of the Unemployment Fund is now about  103 m. and is in course of redemption by a statutory charge on the Fund of  5 m, a year, payable half-yearly, for principal and interest.     By this means the debt would be extinguished in 1971.The General Account is expected to have a balance of  62 m. - at the end of December next and, with a continuance of present conditions, of some  82 m. at the end of 1938.     These amounts will include large sums representing reserves required to meet additional charges on the Fund as a result of recent improvements in the benefits and a reserve against the risk of higher
unemployment in the future. The existence of such a large balance in hand gives rise to misunderstandings and to demands, which cannot he met, to use the money for various purposes including improved benefits.I am convinced that we should provide for some closer association of the debt and the reserves by using the latter to repay a portion of -die debt -on terms.     At present debt may be repaid, on the recommendation of the Statutory Committee put of a disposable surplus.     The effect under present legislation of making a repayment is merely to shorten the period over which the sinking fund operates.     It does not result in any reduction of the annual debt charge.The Statutory Committee in their last report on the Financial Condition of the Fund indicated that they had difficulty in recommending the use of disposable surpluses under these conditions and suggested that the statutory powers for dealing with the debt should be extended.     I have received a letter on the same subject from the Chairman of the Committee, a copy of which . is attached.     I have consulted the Chancellor of the Exchequer and have his concurrence in the following proposals.Subject to the recommendation of the Statutory Committee, the whole or any part of the balance in the General Account of the Fund may be applied in reduction of debt.     So far as an amount so repaid is a disposable surplus arising from the working of the Scheme, the money so repaid cannot be re-borrowed.     So far, however, as the repayment consists of moneys which are held as a reserve, the amount of debt repaid may, subject to the recommendation of the Committee, be re-borrowed as required (at a rate of interest to be fixed by the Treasury) up to a given limit.     This limit would be the amount which would make up the debt at the date of rerborrowing to the figore at which ,it would have stood but for the repayments put of moneys held as a reserve. The whole debt including any re-borrowings would be liquidated within the period at present fixed for the extinction of the debt.Whenever repayments of debt were made, whether out of reserves or out of a disposable surplus, there would be a proportionate reduction in the annual debt charge, thus releasing a sum annually for general improvements in the conditions of the Scheme.
7*     Minor amendments.     So far as the title of the Bill permits I propose to include certain minor amendments of administrative detail which are desirable.8.     The Chancellor of the Exchequer is in agreement with, the foregoing proposals.9.       I should &quot;be glad to have the authority of my colleagues for the prepare.tion and submission to the Home Affairs Committee   of a Bill embodying the proposals outlined above and for pressing on with arrangements to secure the passage of the Bill into law before Christmas.(intd.)

UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ACTS, 1935 and 1936REPORT AS TO THE EXTENSION OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE TO OUTDOOR PRIVATE DOMESTIC SERVANTS.To the Rt. Hon. Ernest Brown, M.C., M.P., Minister of Labour.Sir,On 23rd April, 1937, you referred to us for consideration and advice under section 57 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935, the question whether outdoor private domestic servants or certain classes of such servants should be brought within the scope of unemployment insurance.On 18th May, 1937, we gave notice in the Press that the matter had been referred to us, indicated the main classes of persons affected, and invited expressions of views from such per-sons and their employers.On 29th June, 1937, the Chairman of the Committee at our request repeated this notice in a short broadcast speech, and invited further communications, emphasising our desire to hear from those who might be opposed to insurance as well as from those who favoured it.We now, after consideration of the communications received by us and of information furnished by the Ministry of Labour, submit our advice on the question referred to us.The term outdoor private domestic servants covers three main classes: chauffeurs (including lorry drivers), gamekeepers (in-cluding warreners, ghillies, river-keepers and water-bailiffs) and grooms (including stablemen). The approximate numbers in these three classes, as estimated by the Ministry of Labour from the census of 1931, are 50,000, 13,000 and 12,000 respectively. There are a few other classes of outdoor private domestic servants such as boatmen, coachmen, gate-keepers and lodge-keepers, kennelmen and handymen with much smaller num-bers, almost certainly not above 5,000 all told. The total subject to our inquiry accordingly is about 80,000, nearly all of whom are men. These men are employed individually or in very small numbers by different employers in all parts of the country. They have no representative organisation and it is obviously a matter of great difficulty to obtain a comprehensive view of their con-ditions of work or of their own views and those of their em-ployers on the subject referred to us.-As the result of the Press notice of 18th May we received 17 letters, seven from employers and ten from employees.   As
the result of the Chairman&apos;s broadcast we received a further 109 letters, making 126 in all, of which 18 were from employers and 108 from employees. These are small numbers in relation to the total numbers of persons affected. The interest and value of the letters lies, however, not in their quantity but in their contents. They are, in practically all cases, not simple votes for or against insurance, but reasoned arguments or records of experience with which their writers have taken trouble. We quote a few typical extracts below as the only means of passing on to readers of this report the effect of the letters which we have received. They leave us in no doubt as to the main tenor of the advice which we should give.The letters came from many different parts, including 29 out of the 41 counties of England, six out of the 12 counties of Wales and nine out of the 33 counties of Scotland. Of the letters from employers 13 are in favour of insurance and five against. Of those from employees 105 are in favour of insurance and three against. A number of those who write in favour of insurance say that they write after discussing the question with their fellows and represent a general and not only a personal view. One sub-mits 60 signatures of chauffeurs collected by him asking for insurance.The first conclusion established by these communications is that the occupations with which we are concerned in this inquiry do not offer security of employment. It is true that an employee who renders satisfactory service may stay with the same em-ployer for many years or all his life. But the dependence of employment upon an individual employer makes domestic ser-vice in one respect less secure than other employments. It is peculiarly liable to interruption by the death or illness of the employer, by a change of household or tastes, or by personal disagreements. Many of our correspondents quote from their own knowledge cases of chauffeurs or grooms thrown out through such causes after many years of service. From this fact of insecurity springs a sense of insecurity even among those who have themselves no experience of unemployment.&apos;&apos; I am a chauffeur and I suppose one of the lucky ones as I have never been unemployed in my life, and have no reason to believe at present I shall be. . . . The point arises to my mind not so much do we want to come under the scheme, but why haven&apos;t we been included years ago. :. -. . There&apos;s no such thing as a sheltered trade or profession; so long as we do our work while it&apos;s there we are alright, but often through various reasons of which we have no con-frol, we are left high and dry. I have seen many cases and I could get plenty of signatures to this letter if required. . . . We should willingly help to pay for the unfortunate ones, knowing it&apos;s there if wanted.&quot;- (Yorkshire.)
&quot; I should like to say right at the beginning that I have no axe to grind, as I have been in constant employment since 1923 (one job only) when I left the Army. There is always a lurking fear that any day I may be thrown out of employment with no relief whatever. My wages are  2 per week with cottage and being married with 2 children it is impossible to put anything by for a rainy day. What a godsend to know that I could be sure of bread let alone butter if, thro&apos; no fault of my own I was thrown out of work. Please do your utmost to remove that fear for the sake of the children. To-day I have spoken to about 50 chauffeurs and what I have said applies to them all. . . . I will.start collecting [signatures in support] straight away if you think it worth while, to add weight to my point of -   view and proof to my argument.&quot;   (Bucks.)&apos;&apos; I am a Groom and also to be a Groom to-day you must drive a car, so for several years I have paid to learn and can drive one. As it happens I have been engaged for the past 6 yrs. in private service without a stain on my charac-ter and am now unemployed as the Lady I worked for through ill health tempory gave up hunting and does not require me. Previously I worked in a Dealers Yard where there was several Grooms, and we had to pay it then, I ask whats the difference with them and us we ,only get just a small weekly wage and get continually thrown out of work through no fault of our own. ... I am willing to go on the farm or anything as long as its work which I can&apos;t get. Theres plenty of jobs for me but what I can see of it, any-one paying in the unemployment insurance goes to the Labour Exchange to get his card signed gets the priveledge of a job in front of me I get nothing and a good many more of my poor colleagues, good chaps, why are we left out. So I hope you will give plenty of evidence to bring this act to pass on all of us (why debar us).&quot;   (Bedfordshire.)&quot; I was a gamekeeper on an Estate for 12 J years, the Estate was sold so I was unemployed. I was so for five months before I got this job. ... I had a boy at the High School when I was employed and to keep his education going I had to board him out near the school, luckily I had a few pounds saved but I know a neighbour keeper who was put out the same way at the same time who had to get Parish Relief not what a gamekeeper wants. ... I know of a brother keeper just now who has been put out after 37 years and had a house to find and his family is much larger than mine. Yes, I think all persons earning a certain wage and under should pay unemployment and I hope it will come soon.&quot;   (Wigtownshire.)These four letters are typical of our correspondence.
Another note often sounded in this correspondence is .that of resentment against being &quot; singled out &quot; (the phrase is common to several letters) for exclusion from a scheme that covers nearly all others in employment.&quot; I have to leave every morning for work at the same time as my neighbour leaves for the factory. I return home the same time, possibly later, I have the same rent, coal, light and household expenses yet should we (and the possibility is far greater in his case) unfortunately become unemployed, he receives his benefit and I none, yet still have the same expenses as him to meet. ... I might add that we have no huge bank balance to draw upon as we are still comparatively young (26-27) and have no family as the present conditions have retarded our desire for children. Heaven knows if unemployment came it would be hard enough without children. I&apos;ve nothing but sheer admiration for my wife the way she manages to save a couple of shillings a week as it is. Why one section of the community should be singled out to go through fife with possible unemployment hanging like a veritable cloud over their heads I don&apos;t know.&quot;   (Warwickshire.)The writer of this letter is somewhat exceptional in having to make his own arrangements for housing. More commonly housing is provided as part of the terms of service. &quot; That means &quot; writes a chauffeur of 30 years&apos; experience less the war period &quot; a man leaving his job has also to vacate his house.. A -man following this occupation has to save both for unem-ployment and the moving from one house to another.&quot; (Kent.) &quot; In the case of married men,&quot; says another, &quot; your home ceases with your employment, that is in my opinion the chief cause of the present hatred of private service, we all are trying to get out of it, into a calling which gives us the chance to pay for unemployment.&quot;   (London.)The three points named of special dependence upon the fortunes of an individual as employer, of a sense of unfair discrimination as compared with insured occupations and of the risk of losing one&apos;s home with one&apos;s job apply to all the three main groups covered by our reference chauffeurs, grooms and gamekeepers. In regard to each of the first two groups our correspondents produce a further special reason for insurance.With chauffeurs the anomaly is stressed that a chauffeur used in his employees business is insured while, if he does precisely similar work in driving for his employees pleasure or con-venience, he is not insured. Business includes both the letting out of cars on hire and the taking of a doctor on his profes-sional rounds. This kind of anomaly, as stated, is stressed most often in regard to chauffeurs.   But it is mentioned also
in regard to -others, as between the gate-keeper of a private estate and of a Mental Home run for profit, or as between the -groom or stableman working for a private employer and one working for a job-master or a brewery. The sense of anomaly has naturally been increased by the extension of insurance to private gardeners.With ;grooms, more than one of our correspondents refers to -the seasonal nature of the occupation, as producing a recurrent liability to unemployment.&quot;I am a Groom myself for 30 years and I am able to speak for many others as I get about and am able to say that all the Grooms I meet are quite of opinion that it would be a good thing if Grooms were included in either Of :the unemployment schemes and all would welcome it very much, we were very surprised this year when private gardeners were brought into insurance and.not us. My reasons are that I may say as many as 70 per cent, of the -Grooms to-day are just employed during the five months of the hunting season when many of them have to work very long hours 12 to 18 hours a day then when the hunt-ing is finished they are not needed any more till the next September or October, during the waiting time they have to live as best they can. ... I have no axe to grind myself as I have been very lucky and always been in regular employment and as long as my health is good I always shall be, but I do hope Sir that something will be done about it.&quot;   (Berks.)The points named above are urged as reasons for insurance alike by employees and by employers. Most of our letters from employers are as strongly in favour of insurance as those of the employees and for the same reasons. It will be sufficient to -quote two of these letters.&quot; I wish to submit the following reasons why I think that privately employed grooms, chauffeurs, etc., should be included in some scheme of unemployment insurance.,(1) Their security of employment is no longer the certainty it used to be, owing to reduction of staffs, ,particularly since 1931.(2) To -bring commercial and private employees of this category into an equal footing; at present a man who has qualified for Unemployment Insurance is loth to enter private service as he knows, however ;good a man he is, that he has no guarantee of security if &quot;the job is terminated by a private employer.(3) To -remove the anomaly which occurs when,an -uninsured private employee works ; alongside an extra labourer who ds insured, &apos;on -jobs which -frequently
occur at a private house but which are not the usual work of a groom or chauffeur, etc., e.g., concrete mixing, tree root lifting, lawn leveling, etc., etc.(4) To bring all outdoor private employees into line with a private gardener.&quot;   (Denbighshire.)&quot;As an employer of labour on a private Estate I am writing to you with reference to the proposal of insuring private outdoor domestic servants against unemployment. I think it is most important to include Grooms in the insur-ance. It is most difficult in this part of the country, where there are still a great number of horses, to get Grooms and Stable-boys; they all want to go and work for Contractors in the neighbourhood so that they can draw unemployment pay if out of work.&apos;&apos;   (Somerset.)As against this the five employers who have written opposing insurance give as reasons that the employees do not desire insurance, that employment is usually permanent and that no man fit for work in these occupations need be unemployed, that the contributions to the various social services are a heavy addition to wages, and that insurance would lead to unemploy-ment both through increasing the burdens on employers and through giving them less sense of responsibility for their servants.The three employees who have written opposing insurance all give special reasons. One is a chauffeur depending on casual employment, driving cars an hour or two at a time for private owners; the chance of obtaining such work would in his view be much reduced if it became insured. Another chauffeur foresees the possibility of being disallowed benefit, if he refuses employ-ment at lower pay than he has been used to. This is an objec-tion not of principle but of practice and the writer supports insurance of grooms as a &quot; blessing &quot; for them. The third objector, as a gamekeeper, fears that if the employment were made insurable, young men would take it on for the easy months, September to March, and go on benefit for the rest of the year. This again is an objection not of principle but of detail. The question of the seasonal worker arises already; it is provided for under the general scheme of unemployment insurance, by the Seasonal Workers Orders, and under the agricultural scheme, by relating the maximum benefit that can be drawn to the contributions paid.In reviewing these communications we do not forget their small number. Nor do we fail to recognize that communica-tions would be more likely to come from those who wanted insurance than from those who are hostile or indifferent. But in all our notices we stressed our desire to hear as much from opponents as from supporters.   In the result the opinions of
the employees as they appear in our correspondence are not only all but unanimous in favour of insurance but are strong and urgent and cover far more men than the actual writers.&quot; Please give us an even break with our fellow workers in other trades. . . . Thanking you in anticipation.&quot; (Glam-organ.)&quot; Hoping for the full scheme very soon.&quot;  (London.)&quot; Give us our cards as soon as possible and earn the thanks of at least 75,000 chauffeurs.&quot;   (Bedfordshire.)&quot; Yes, Sir, bring chauffeurs under the scheme whereby they may get help in bad times by right.&quot;   (Devon.)&quot; So please go ahead with your plans and the sooner we chauffeurs can pay unemployment insurance the happier I shall.be.&quot;   (Wilts.)&apos;&apos; Hoping you will soon have us on your list.&apos;&apos; (London.)&quot; The quicker we are brought under,the Act, the better it willbe for hundreds of us.&quot;   (Oxfordshire Groom.).&quot; I hope we will be put on unemployment benefit very soon and I hope I never have to draw it.&quot; (Berwickshire  Gamekeeper.)We are of opinion that the case for extending unemployment insurance, if practicable, to all classes of outdoor private domestic servants is established. There remain the questions, first, whether these servants should come into the general scheme or into the agricultural scheme, with its lower contributions and benefits, or some into one scheme and some into the other; second, whether extension of insurance would require fresh legis-lation or can and should be carried through under the existing powers of the Minister of Labour. These questions, though distinct, are connected.On the first question, our view is that chauffeurs (including any lorry drivers in domestic service) should be included in the general scheme, and that all the other outdoor domestic servants should be included in the agricultural scheme.As regards chauffeurs the position is fairly clear. The chauffeurs in private service are a small proportion probably about one-eighth-of all persons employed in the driving or care of motor vehicles. The remaining seven-eighths, engaged as drivers of commercial vehicles or for professional purposes are insured under the general scheme. To put private chauffeurs into the agricultural scheme would produce almost as many anomalies as it would cure. It would also, undoubtedly, be disappointing to most of the men themselves. In so far as our correspondents in this class have expressed a choice between the two schemes, their choice has been overwhelmingly for the general scheme; they want to pay the higher contributions for higher benefits.   This means, in regard to the not uncommon
case of the chauffeur-gardener that an individual decision will have to. be reached as to which scheme applies to him: as a chauffeur he should be in the general scheme, as a gardener, in the agricultural scheme. There is already provision in the Unemployment- Insurance (Agriculture) Act, 1936, for dealing by regulations with this problem. Under the Unemployment Insurance (Mixed Employments) Regulations, 1937, the employer and employee can agree to treat the employee as wholly within the general scheme or wholly within the agricul-tural scheme; if they fail to agree the contribution for each week depends upon which of the two types of employment has occupied most of his time in that week. Inclusion of the driving of private cars in the general scheme will increase the number of cases of mixed employment but will not alter the nature of the problem. We have little doubt that in nearly all cases it will be settled by agreement for the chauffeur-gardener as for others.As regards the other classes of outdoor private domestic servants there are several reasons for putting them into the agricultural scheme. All these occupations, unlike that of chauffeur, are essentially rural in character. There are, indeed, some even of these occupations in urban districts as coachmen, stablemen, gate-keepers or handymen as there are a few private gardeners. But by and large they are rural occupa-tions like that of the gardener. These men are also on the whole, though not of course invariably, less well paid than the chauffeurs. Finally in these occupations, private service forms a much larger proportion of the whole than among the drivers of motor vehicles. At the census of 1931 of about 29,000 persons in Great Britain engaged in the care of horses, as grooms or stablemen, about 12,000 or 40 per cent, were in private service: in the rural districts.where these private grooms are mainly found the proportion in commercial service would.be very small. In regard to game-keepers the great majority are in private service.Our proposal means, of course, that of several outdoor domestic servants in the same employ one, the chauffeur, will be insured in the general scheme while the others, in the agri-cultural scheme, pay lower contributions for lower benefits. But this kind of distinction is an unavoidable consequence of having too separate schemes, for agriculture and for others.On the second question as to whether fresh legislation should be used for the proposed extension of insurance or whether other procedure can be adopted, there appears to be a distinc-tion between the chauffeurs and the others, as there is in respect of the scheme that is most appropriate for them. In regard to chauffeurs, there appears to be a case for using the power given by section 3 (2) (b) of the Act of 1935 to adjust the boundaries
icfof unemployment &quot;insurance and bring private^ chauffeurs into insurance on the ground that their work is the same as that of a large body of men already insured, and that their exclusion in-volves anomalies; the care and driving of motor vehicles are by now predominantly commercial employments. But this is not true of the other classes of men now under consideration. With most of them, as has been stated above, private service accounts for a much larger proportion of the whole. It might amount to pressing rather far the powers conferred by section 3 (2) (b) to extend insurance to large numbers of domestic ser-vants in private employ on the ground that a considerably smaller or even a comparable number were doing similar work in commercial establishments and being insured there. More-over there appears to be legal ground for holding that this section could not be used to extend insurance to domestic servants, except with a view to bringing them into the general scheme. If this is so, our advice that all outdoor private domestic servants other than chauffeurs should be brought into the agricultural scheme involves new legislation.In the circumstances we can only express the hope that an early opportunity may be found for dealing by legislation where necessary with all classes of outdoor private domestic servants. The case for the inclusion of all these classes under one scheme or the other is made out. To bring some into the general scheme by regulations, while leaving the others out, would solve the problem for those included, only at the expense of increasing the sense of hardship and injustice among the rest.Signed on behalf of the Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee,W.

Telephone No: Whitehall 6200.Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee, Montagu House, Whitehall,London, S.Y/.1.4-th November, 1937.My dear Minister,I write to put on paper the substance of what I said to you when I saw you recently at the request of the Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee to discuss the position of the Unemployment Fund, on its General Account.     The Agricultural Account is separate and no question arises about it.- As you are aware, in their last Report on the Financial Condition of the Unemployment Fund in its General Account as at 31st December, 1936, the Committee referred to the debt of the Fund, examined the conditions under which, with the existing law, repayment of the debt (over and above the statutory annual debt charge of  5,000,000) can be effected and made suggestions for amendments of the lav/.Since the Report was made, the unemployment experienced has been below expectations and the Unemployment Fund has accumulated rapidly.     There is now an almost certain prospect that by the end of 1937 the Fund will be about  62,000,000 and there is a reasonable likelihood in the course of next year of adding at least another   20,000,000, bringing the total to  82,000,000, or more. As this sum can only be invested in short-term securities the Fund will be earning lV3 per cent or at most if per cent, while paying 3g- per cent or a little more on its debt of about  100,000,000.     The larger part of the Fund will be a reserve held against depression or to provide for the improvements of benefit made on our second, and fourth Reports, but there is every prospect of our again being able to declare a disposable surplus of substantial amount at the end of this year.I brought this position and prospect to the notice of the Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee at two meetings recently.     I did not invite any formal resolutions, but I know that I am speaking for nearly all the Committee, if not indeed for all of them, in saying that in their view the case for considering some amendment of the existing provisions in regard to the debt is greatly strengthened by the course of events since oulrlast Report was made. The Committee asked me accordingly to ascertain from you, if possible, whether there was any prospect of early legislation to increase the powers of the Committee in the management of the Unemployment Fund so as to be able to deal with the debt and with disposable surpluses, with regard to the interests of present as well as future contributors.     They welcomed the Report that I was able to make to them that you had the matter under your serious consideration.As you know, any disposable surplus of the Fund can now on the recommendation of the Committee be used for repayment of debt, but only with the effect of reducing the annuity period and benefiting remote contributors, and not so as to reduce the debt charge and benefit equally both present and remote contributors. The particular suggestion which I laid before you and before the Committee is that ifc should be made possible on the recommendation of the Committee to use any part of the Unemployment Fund, whether or not it is a disposable surplus, for reducing debt with proportionate reduction of the annual debt&apos;charge of  5,000,000 and with certain powers of re-borrowing.In these circumstances all reduction of debt would operate to diminish the current charges on the Unemployment Fund, and would set free resources for improvement of benefit or lowering of contributions.     With the powers suggested above, I have every hope that it v/ould be possible in our next financial report to propose a large reduction of debt and, in doing so, to set free a substantial sum which would not otherwise be available for annual disposal.ie Rt. Hon. Ernest Brown, M.C., M.P-, Montagu House.
My hopes of our being able to declare substantial disposable surpluses, and simultaneously to make a large reduction of debt, might, of course, be defeated by a worsening of economic conditions and increase of unemployment, but there appears to be no reason whatever to anticipate this for the near future.     In any case, I venture to urge that greater flexibility of powers in relation to the Unemployment Fund on the lines that I have suggested, is desirable, not merely for the present but as a permanent improvement of the Insurance Scheme.The present position with the Unemployment Fund receiving interest at about 1/3 per cent on a large reserve and paying interest at about Sjr per cent on a still larger debt leads to continual criticism.     From every point of view it seems desirable to take this opportunity of rediicing the debt, if this can be done as we think it should be done with full justice to the present c ontribu tors.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.)
