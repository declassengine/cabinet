^DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT) C R E T. COPY NO. *^61 (57).CABINET. Inheritance (Family Provisions) Bill;Memorandum &quot;by the Lord Chancellor *In 1928, 1929, 1930 and 1931 Bills were introduced into one House of Parliament or another dealing with this matter, though they sought to effect the objects at which this Bill aims by methods other than those adopted in this Bill.The Bill of 1931 went to.a Select Committee which took the opinion of the Chancery Judges.     The Chancery Judges condemned the method adopted, but their report gave some encouragement to the idea that a Bill might be introduced &quot;which enabled the Court, in the case where no adequate provision had been made for a spouse or infant children, to order proper provision to be made for them out of the deceased1s estate, having regard to all the circumstances&quot;.As a result largely of this report, the Select Committee reported against the Bill, but added that they considered a measure on the lines more or less suggested by the Chancery Judges would be &quot;worthy of serious consideration by Parliament&quot;.In 1933 and 1934 Bills were introduced on the lines indicated by the Chancery Judges, but made little progress. In 1935 a fresh attempt was made on the same lines.     The then Attorney-General then wrote:    &quot;The Bill is regarded with great anxiety - I may also say hostility - by such Chancery Judges as I have consulted informally, Luxmoore and Bennett among them.     I also mentioned it to Tomlin, and he takes great objection to the proposal to give a Chancery Judge carte blanche in the manner set forth in the Bill&quot;.
The Bill of 1934 was dropped, hut further attempts were made in 1936 and 1937 to proceed on similar lines, and in the Spring of this year the Bill passed through Standing Committee in the House of Commons, with amendments. It is assumed that the present Bill will follow the lines of that Bill as so amended.      It has not been possible to procure a copy of it up to the present.I recognise that hard cases may arise under the existing law.     But hard cases make bad law;     and I think that this is one of the hard cases, the remedy for which would create the worst kind of law.     In the majority of cases no one can know the reasons which have led a testator to make the disposition of his property of which complaint has been made.     He may have had excellent reasons.      To discuss them in open Court after his death, and, therefore, necessarily in his absence and without his testimony, would be disastrous;    it would arouse forgotten scandals and embitter family life.     It would be almost more disastrous if, with a view to placing his reasons on record, a testator were forced to state them openly in his will.     I am, therefore, myself strongly opposed to any legislation on this subject, whether the method adopted be that in the earlier Bills mentioned in this Memorandum or that adopted in the present Bill.As soon as I learned that this Bill was contemplated, I gave directions that the Chancery Judges- - &quot;:, -should be consulted in-the matter.     I hope that I may be ina position, when the Cabinet meets, to place their views before my colleagues.      Meanwhile, I would only say that Ishare the views attributed by the then Attorney-General tothe late Lord Tomlin.4^.&apos;&apos;44^-&apos; - .&apos;.r:.^ &apos;v::&apos;v&apos;&apos;:^^;v^.&apos;-^..&apos;::;^(initialed)     H.House of Lords. 29th October, 1937.
