The Cabinet decision of the 30th June provided that the question of the stages of. further examination of this matter should be considered by the Prime Minister, the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, and myself; and I hope to be able to put before the Cabinet on Wednesdav the proposed procedure.J. S.Treasury Chambers, October 22, 1937.I.SUMMARY OF FORECASTS OF DEFENCE DEPARTMENTS&apos; EXPENDITURE OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS.1. Both the Admiralty and the Air Ministry have submitted returns on two alternative bases.  In the case of the Admiralty these are (a) what is known as &quot; the D.R.C. Fleet,&quot; that is the fleet which forms the basis of the Third Report of the (Official) Defence Requirements Com-mittee (Paper No. D.R.C. 37);[15993] b
(b) the proposed new standard of Naval strength set out in Admiralty-Memorandum D.P. (P) 3, which admittedly involves a departure from our present declared one-power standard.2.   In the case of the Air Ministry the alternative hypotheses are : (a) the present approved programme, that is Scheme F,* which gives aMetropolitan First Line Strength of 1,736 aircraft, and an overseas first line strength of 470 aircraft, plus war reserves on the approved scale;(b) Scheme J; that is to say a revised plan to deal with the present situation,which is being submitted to the Defence Plans (Policy) Committee. Under this scheme the first line strength of our Metropolitan and over-seas forces would be raised to 2,331 and 644 aircraft respectively, and our total first line strength after provision for trade defence would be 3,031.The basis on which the War Office forecast is framed is dealt with in para-graph 19 below.3. In both cases hypothesis (b) is considerably more expensive than hypothesis (a). It is convenient, therefore, to summarise the forecasts submitted by Departments of defence expenditure over the next 10 years by giving tables showing : (i) the position if hypothesis (a) were to be adopted for both the Navy and the Royal Air Force (i.e., the most favourable position for the Exchequer);(ii) the position if hypothesis (&amp;) were to be adopted for these two Services.These figures are given in the two following tables. They do not, however, comprise the complete picture, which appears later in Table III.Table I.

The figures in these tables are submitted by Departments subject to a number of reservations and qualifications : 5. The forecasts are not exact. Departments emphasise that the forecasts have been based on a survey of the whole field of expenditure and that a careful calculation of the liabilities under each Vote is impracticable. The figures are, at the best, very rough approximations given on the best data available. The element of uncertainty is, of course, greater as regards later years.The Air Ministry have rounded the total of Air Votes for each year to the nearest  5 millions.6. Prices. The Admiralty forecast is on the basis of the prices taken for the purpose of 1937 Estimates. Between April and August, 1937, there was an appreciable, and in some cases a substantial, increase in wage rates and prices, but the Admiralty do not feel able to say what corrective should be applied in respect of the increase which has already taken place, or in respect of any further variation which may occur in future.The Air Ministry forecast is based on the assumption that there will be no very marked rise in wage rates, no increase in the present pay of the Royal Air Force but some further small increase in the price of materials.The War Office forecast is based, as regards supplies and works, on current prices. As regards stores, clothing and Royal Ordnance Factories expenditure, the forecast is based: (a) for &quot; normal estimates,&quot; on the prices adopted for 1937 Estimates, and (b) for Defence Requirements expenditure on the basis adopted in Cabinet Paper 115 (37), except where experience showed that a re-calculation was required.
7. It will be seen that the calculations have not all been made on precisely the same basis. In the time available this could not be expected, nor does it affect the general validity of the forecasts. Broadly the position is that, taken as a whole, the figures do not wholly reflect the recent rise in prices, and that this factor must be borne in mind in any conclusions drawn from this survey.Defence Loans Act, 1937.8. The figures of expenditure in Tables I and II of this paper and in the returns made by Departments, represent the expenditure estimated to be required, whether found by revenue or by borrowing (i.e., the figures represent the total of Defence Estimates before deducting borrowed money which under the Defence Loans Act mav be appropriated in aid of Defence Votes up to March 1942.)9. Likewise the returns take no account of the provision which will have to be made for payment of interest and sinking fund under the Defence Loans Act.The Act provides that up to March 1942 interest at the rate of 3 per cent, on the sums borrowed should be borne on Defence Votes, and thereafter interest and principal. Some provision will therefore be required on Defence Votes for the years 1938 to 1941, to meet interest charges.Assuming that  80 millions of borrowed money is appropriated in aid of Defence Votes each year, the provision required for interest would be 1938 :  2-4 millions. 1939 :  4-8 millions. 1940 :  7-2 millions. 1941 :  9 - 6 millions. Total 1938-1941 :  24 millions.10. From April 1942 onwards, assuming that the full  400 millions authorised by the Act is utilised to meet defence expenditure, it will be necessary to provide  20 millions yearly on Defence Votes to meet interest and sinking fund.&quot; Stabilised &quot; or average cost of maintenance of the Defence Services at the newlevel.11. Departments were asked to submit estimates of their normal annual expenditure in the years following the completion of the programme. All Departments emphasise that, although a particular Defence Service may be &apos;&apos; stabilised &quot; at a given strength, and although it may be possible to give a figure which represents the average annual cost of maintenance at the &quot; stable &quot; level, the Estimates for given years will vary by several millions up or down from the stabilised figure, owing to the uneven incidence of expenditure resulting from such factors as, e.g., (i) large entries of personnel in periods of expansion, or (ii) inclusion of battleships in the new construction programmes.Items for ivhich no allowance has been made in framing the forecasts. 12.   All three Defence Departments have submitted lists of items for which no allowance has been made in framing the forecasts, but for which Departments may seek authority to incur expenditure at a later date.   This matter is of such importance that the lists are summarised below A dmiralty.13. Neither of the Admiralty forecasts makes provision for the following items : (a) underground oil fuel storage; estimated cost  16 millions if the fullscheme is ultimately approved; (&amp;) underground magazines;  5 millions;(c) various other large works e.g., duplicating Eoyal Navy Cordite Factory;new Harbour at Famagusta; dockyard, &amp;c, development at Hong &apos; Kong, Works at Aden  9 millions;(d) additional costs which may fall on Navy Votes through the transfer of theFleet Air Arm to Admiralty control (no estimate given).Total for Admiralty for items (a) to (c)  30 millions.
A ir Ministry.14. Neither of the Air Ministry forecasts makes provision for the following,:  (a) construction of, four additional hospitals at home, proposals for whichare under consideration. These would cost  1 million capital to erect and  100,000 to maintain;(b) reinforced surfacing of aerodromes, the cost of which cannot be estimated,but would undoubtedly amount to several millions; (c). extension of balloon barrages beyond the barrage already approved for; London.15. The forecast for Scheme F contains no provision for the following items : (a) additional training schools beyond those already authorised;(b) increased cost of high octane fuel reserves.   Expenditure amounting to 1,468,000 over the 6 years 1938-43 has now been authorised by the Treasury Inter-Service Committee.(c) radio directional finding schemes, bejrond experimental stations authorisedwhen the forecast was prepared. Fifteen extra radio directional finding stations have now been approved at a capital cost of  1,237,000 and an annual recurrent charge of  150,000.(d) Silhouette Lighting. Expenditure on the experimental scheme recentlysanctioned is estimated at  400,000. If the scheme is extended to cover the London area another  2 millions would be necessary, and, for the searchlight belt, yet a further  10 millions; but these estimates are highly conjectural.(e) Increased expenditure recommended as part of the Ideal Scheme for theAir Defence of Great Britain. If that Scheme were approved it would mean an addition to the figures of Scheme F of a capital sum of  5,100,000 and an annual maintenance charge of about  1,100,000.16. On the other hand, the forecast for Scheme J contains provision for items (&amp;), (c) and (d) in paragraph 13, and for so much of item (e) in paragraph 13 as is necessary to cover the revised, but rather smaller, requirements now considered essential by the Air - Staff. No provision is, however, made in the Scheme J forecast for additional reserves of raw materials beyond those required for Scheme F.17. In brief, in the case of Scheme F, the capital cost of the items set out in paragraphs 14 and 15 is over  21 millions without making any allowance for the items for which no figure of cost is given. For the purposes of the summary table given below [Table III] the.cost of these additional items is taken as  25 millions for Scheme F and the smaller sum of  10 millions for Scheme J.18. In addition, attention is drawn to various assumptions underlying the Air Ministry forecast (e.g., that re-equipment, after expansion is completed, is based on a five-year period; that overseas squadrons are equipped, so far as types permit, from aircraft displaced from the Metropolitan Air Force; and that no provision for war production is undertaken beyond shadow factory schemes and capital extensions already in hand). No figure can be attached to these and other assumptions; but it is clear that if these assumptions wei^e falsified, the increase in cost might be very substantial indeed.War Office.19. The War Office estimate is framed on the basis of existing authorised policy. Thus it includes provision for re-equipment and war reserves for the Regular Contingent of the Field Force (4 Divisions and 1 Mobile Division). It also includes provision of sufficient equipment to enable the Territorial Army to be trained in the same weapons as the Regular Army.20.   The War Office forecast excludes, however, the following :-(a) Equipment and. War Reserves required to enable 4 Territorial divisions to be sent overseas on the outbreak of war cost  43 millions;(b) War Office share of cost of Ideal Scheme of Air Defence  15 millions;
(c) Improvement in conditions of service or increases in pay which it may benecessary to ask for no figure given;(d) New or alternative requirements likely to emerge as the reorganisation and re-equipment of the Army proceeds no figure given;(e) Various  defended  port  schemes  (not  yet  examined) possible  cost 20 millions.With considerable reserve the Secretary of State for War has indicated that, while he would prefer not to attempt to evaluate the cost of these items, the total cost of the items (a) to (e) might be put in the neighbourhood of  100 millions.21. These three lists of additional items call for two comments. The first is that the far larger cost of the War Office additional items is explained by the fact that the War Office has (unlike the other two Defence Departments) not submitted a return on two alternative bases.22. Had the War Office decided to submit returns on two alternative hypotheses, it seems fair to assume that the main difference between these hypotheses would have turned on the inclusion in the one, but not in the other, of a large proportion of the items which go to make up this somewhat conjectural total of  100 millions. In order to avoid delaying the circulation of this paper, it has not been thought right to ask the War Office to submit a revised return allocating these additional items to two alternative hypotheses. But for the purpose of the summaiy Table given below, it has been assumed that items amounting to  20 millions in the War Office list are broadly comparable to hypothesis (a), and that the whole list of additional items amounting to  100 millions is broadly comparable to hypothesis (b), of the other two Services.23. The second comment is that these schedules of additional items for the three Services cannot be treated as a series of proposals for which Departments are unlikely to seek authority for a long time, if ever. Thus, the Admiralty have been given authority to proceed with an instalment of the underground oil fuel storage scheme, and the Air Ministry with an instalment of the silhouette lighting. Generally, there are indications that the adoption of a number of these schemes will be urged in the near future.24. On the other hand, attention should be drawn to the fact that the Admiralty&apos; have under consideration various means of effecting a possible reduction in the cost of the proposed new standard fleet, and that this might ultimately result in economies of the order of  7,000,000 a year. Realisation of this reduction could, however, only be gradual.II.DEFENCE EXPENDITURE FROM CIVIL VOTES.25. The tables given in paragraph 3 above cover the three Defence Depart-ments only. It is also necessary to take account of expenditure on what may broadly be described as defence measures which is borne on Civil Votes.Air Raid Precautions.26. The Home Office estimate that the total expenditure which they will incur over the five years 1937-41 will be  41-4 millions, spread as follows : Jt1937       ...............        5,215,5001938       ......      .........      11.345,0001939       ...............        9,683.0001940       ...............        9,618,0001941        ...............        5,577,000Total for 1937-41 ......-   ....      41,438,500
27. It is anticipated that grants in aid of capital expenditure by local authorities, and also the provision of various forms of equipment, will continue after March ,1942, and that no sudden drop to a care and maintenance basis is to he expected. After the main capital expenditure has been incurred, the annual recurrent expenditure falling on the Exchequer in respect of Air raid precautions expenditure is expected to be of the order of  2 millions to  2-5 millions a year.For the purpose of the summary (Table III), the expenditure on air raid precautions for the five years 1942-46 is taken as  15 millions. /28. It should be added that the forecast submitted by the Home Office includes  5 millions for grants to public utility undertakings.A Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence is at present considering what steps must be taken to ensure the continued functioning in war time of services vital to the community (water, gas, electricity, &amp;c), and how the cost should be borne, but it is understood that the Sub-Committee are not in a position to frame even an approximate estimate of the sum likely to fall on the Exchequer. The figure of  5 millions for this item is a &quot; token figure,&quot; which may in the event be exceeded.29. The Home Office forecast includes, of course, provision for First Aid Posts and Casualty Clearing Hospitals, responsibility for which falls upon local authorities. No provision is included, however, in respect of any arrangements which may have to be made in peace time to facilitate the improvisation in emergency of Base Hospitals to deal with air raid casualties which cannot be dealt with in the local Casualty Clearing Hospitals.30. No precise figures are at present, available in regard to other expenditure from Civil &quot;Votes on what may broadly be described as defence measures. As stated in Cabinet Paper 165 (37) a demand has been made for capital expenditure of  22-1 millions for food storage.i 31. There is also a proposal to accumulate a reserve of certain fertilisers of which the capital cost is put at approximately  l-g millions.32. There is also likely to be a demand for further expenditure in connection with alternative storage at the docks and harbours. A figure of  1-1 millions has been submitted in respect of the London Docks alone, and the expenditure required in the rest of the country may be expected to involve further expenditure of the same order.33. There are a number of other matters in respect of which demands have not yet been fully investigated or formulated. In the circumstances it would ,seem prudent to make allowance for a possible expenditure of say  30 millions on Defence expenditure to be borne on Civil Votes (other than Air Raid Precautions expenditure) over the five financial years 1937-41.III.GENERAL SUMMARY.34. The figures given in the preceding paragraphs are necessarily somewhat involved and they are therefore brought together in Table III below, in order to bring out the aggregate defence expenditure proposed for future years.35. It will be appreciated from what has already been stated that a number of the figures included in the table are conjectural. Thus, in regard to column (2) it has been assumed that the full  400 millions is borrowed under the powers given by the Defence Loans Act, but that no further borrowing powers are sought and obtained to meet the heavy cost of the programmes now proposed, thereby increasing the interest and sinking fund charges in 1942 and later years. It is obvious, however, that the very heavy cost of the programmes covered by the
forecasts could not be met without, either an increase in the borrowing powers, or a substantial increase in the level of taxation, or by recourse to both these expedients.36. Again, in regard to column (3) Additional Items enumerated by Departments-it must be remembered that, with relatively minor exceptions none of these items have been authorised. The inclusion of a relatively substantial total in respect of these items under both hypothesis (a) and hypothesis (&amp;) is therefore somewhat anomalous, seing that, broadly speaking, the former repre-sents programmes based on approved policy, whereas the latter represents proposals to extend existing approved policy. But it has been thought better to include these figures, in order to show the extent of the demands likely to be made under both hypotheses.It is clearly impossible to say in what years the cost of these additional items would fall if they were now to be sanctioned. It has, however, been assumed that rather over one-half the cost of these items would fall in the five years, 1937-41, and rather under half in the years 1942^46.Table III.

The Navy programme will be substantially completed by the end of the financial year 1940, on the basis of hypothesis (a).&quot; If hypothesis (b) is adopted the date for completion will be the end of the financial year 1944.The Air Ministry programme, including the provision of full reserves, will be completed by early 1940 on the basis of hypothesis (a) and by March 1942 on the basis of hypothesis (b), with the exception of permanent buildings, which will not be completed until 1943.
38. The War Office.state that their programme, as now authorised, will be-completed by March 1943, except for certain expenditure on the less important defences at home and abroad. Actually, as the return shows, it is estimated that the great bulk of the expenditure will be incurred in the period up to March 1941.The Air Raid Precautions Department^ programme will be substantially, completed by the end of the financial year 1941.39. Assuming, therefore, that hypothesis (a) is adopted, and that the-programmes are completed by the dates now anticipated, the so-called &quot; capital&quot; expenditure involved could virtually all be incurred within the period covered by the Defence Loans Act. If, however, hypothesis (b) were to be adopted., expenditure on Navy Votes would be in excess of the new normal figure up to 1944..V.INCREASE IN THE COST OF MODERN ARMAMENTS.40. It is not proposed in this paper to enter into any discussion of the technical merits of the proposals submitted by Departments. Nevertheless, some analysis is desirable of the main causes underlying the very high level of expendi-ture proposed. In the appendix to this paper certain figures are given comparing the Vote A numbers of the Defence Services for various years with the numbers on which the present forecasts are based. Comparative figures are also given of the tonnage of the Fleet at various dates, the cost of warships and aeroplanes.41. These figures are given in order to bring out the fact that the vast increase in defence expenditure, present and prospective, is attributable, more than to any other single cause, to the enormous technical development of modern armaments. Thus, the costs of construction of a warship to-day are two or three times the cost of construction of a warship of comparable tonnage before the war. An army division of the type now planned complete with tanks, anti-tank equipment and mechanised transport and with a great increase in its fire-power  is at once a far more powerful force both for offensive and defensive purposes and is far more costly to maintain than a division of the 1914 Expeditionary Force. Above all, the type of aeroplane of which prototypes are now being built for the Royal Air Force costs about three times as much as the aeroplanes with which the Royal Air Force was armed 10 years ago. while the improvements in performance and in the armaments carried make it an immeasurably more powerful fighting unit.42. So long as the strongest Powers spare no efforts in the application of modern scientific developments to armament technique, the cost of weapons of war seems likely to increase. No one, however, would dispute that the money available for armaments should be spent so far as possible in buying arms of the most efficient type.43. The increase in the cost of armaments hits Great Britain particularly hard, since it has coincided with the emergence of air power as a factor of great importance in modern war, which has compelled us to build up a large Air Force for the protection of these islands. Further, the rapid development of ah&quot; technique seems likely to result in a very rapid rate of obsolescence over the next few years, with the result that the maintenance of an up-to-date Air Force will prove extremely costly.44. This increase in the cost of armaments is emphasised for the following-reason. At the time when the Defence Programmes were first drawn up and approved, the problem was envisaged largely as the making good of deficiencies accumulated during the &quot; Ten years rule.&quot; * It was appreciated that the cost of making good these deficiencies would be a heavy one, but their subsequent maintenance was not then regarded as presenting any very grave financial problem.
45. But, as the figures in this paper show, it is now evident that the develop-ment in technique will result in the maintenance of our Defence Forces proving far more costly in future than in the past. This is a factor which must be regarded as a permanent feature in the defence situation which will continue when the present programme of making good deficiencies has come to an end; and if the best use is to be made of our available resources, its implications should be recognised from the outset.

For the purposes of the financial estimate the Air Ministry have assumed a strength, on the 1st April, 1943, of approximately 650 first line aircraft, though the present approved ultimate establishment is 504, and this figure was used in the Scheme F calculations.d       f Owing to difficulty in providing accommodation, the final establishments of overseas squadrons (372 first line aircraft) will not be reached until a few months after the 1st April, 1939.Note. All the -figures in these tables exclude Reserves.   The present aim is to build up a war reserve which, for the more important classes of aircraft, averages 150 per cent, of first line strength.   The normal working reserve is 75 per cent.

Approximate numbers.* See note (1) below.Notes:(1) In 1914 there were no corps or army troops for temporary allocation to divisions. In order to make a fair comparison it is necessary to add to the modern division a proportion of certain corps troops which are now included for eaoh corps.   The following have been added: 1 Army tank battalion.1J Army field brigades.1 Medium brigade.  Machine gun battalion.1 Army field workshop.1 Divisional section, ordnance field park.(2) Third-line units serving the division have been excluded in both cases.(3) Comparison of the modern division with the 1918 division would not show such a great disparity of weapons and, in fact, the amount of artillery has been decreased to provide other essentials.(4) Generally it will be appreciated that there is no comparison between 1914 and present-day requirements. Thus the Great War showed that our 1914 organisation was hopelessly deficient in automatic weapons and that our artillery support was inadequate. In addition to remedying these defects it is necessary, in order to keep pace with modern developments in Continental Armies, to provide for the following: Greater fire power.Anti-air defence throughout the forces. Anti-tank defences. Anti-gas defences.Armoured support for offensive action against modern defences which have become-more powerful. More mobility for certain elements.More  dispersion  for the whole  force  and  a  division organised in smaller self contained units.A much higher degree of control throughout because of increased mobility and dispersion,, necessitating the provision of better communications.All these factors necessitate increases in transport.
