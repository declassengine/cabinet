(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).     Memorandum bgr the Minlster of ^rd^txitur^^and ^Flaherles *  1*   In view of the fact that the Draft Bill (C.P.152(30))proposes to Include agricultural land within the scheme of landvaluation I desire to direct the attention of my colleagues to thequestion whether the basis suggested in the draft is a proper one for the determination of &quot;land value&quot; of agricultural land.  2.   In this connection when referring to agricultural land I amstrictly limiting myself to such lan--i as has no higher value forany purpose other than agriculture,  3.   I assume that it is the general intention to exclude from&quot;land value&quot; the value of the &quot;owner&apos;s improvements&quot;.  4.   While a serious attempt has been made to do this in the caseof urban lands it is obvious that many improvements carried out byowners will not be eliminated from the &quot;land value&quot; ef agricultural land if the Bill is adopted in its present form.  5.   Experience has shown that the elimination of theseimprovement values by way of divestment or deduction is an extremelydifficult method of procedure^  Problems directly concerned withthe valuation of agricultural land - Including the divestment- ofthings growing on the land and the treatment of &quot;tenant right&quot;were among those which led to the greatest of the many difficulties experienced in the course of the valuation under the Finance(1909/10) Act, 1910.  6.   The Draft Bill is obviously designed to &quot;avoid some of these difficulties by not allowing deductions.  7,   The &quot;land value&quot; of agricultural land under the Bill *ould,in a number of cases, be actually in excess of the value which couldbe realised for the. v,hole property in the open market by the owner of the Fee Simple in possession because the ownerfs liability toTithe is ignored (Clause 1 (I) (e))*  Similar difficulties may be experienced vdiere land is liable to Drainage Rates unless theexpression &quot;Rates&quot; is defined in such &quot;a way as to cover these.EGRETP. 157 (30)CABINETLand Valuation Bill.40lo
                                                           ii     8.  in any event the &quot;land value&quot; of agricultural  land will, under the Draft Bill,  include     1.  All works of a capital nature executed on the  land         more than 25 years  before the valuation.         There is no such time limit in the  case of urban         lend (clause 1 (I)  (ii) ).             I can see no justification for  this             differentiation which would penalize  owners of             agricultural land.   It would perhaps obviate  some             of the difficulties referred to in paragraph 5             above but it cannot be defended on that ground.             in tnis connection it is also necessary to refer             to the definition of &quot;works&quot; (clause  7 (1) ),,             which includes  neither buildings nor  erections nor             works for the reclamation of land, or  for protection             from flooding (except fences, field drains end             ditches).   Under this definition field drains and             ditches would be eliminated but only  if they were             constructed less than 25 years  ago, and all             protective agricultural works,  including those             executed in the last 25 years,  would  be reflected             in the land value of agricultural land.     11.   All grass whether  &quot;natural growths or not.             iluch permanent  pasture ha.s been laid  down  at             considerable expense by land owners and has             contributed largely to the value of agricultural             grazing land.   It should not be reflected in  &quot;land             value&quot;.    111.   Trees and hedges more than 25 years old  in so far as             they contribute to the value by providing  shelter             and enclosure and amenity are to be included in             &quot;lend value&quot; (Clause 1 (I) (a)  (iii)  and I (1)             00 (ii)).       9. The valuation is to be based on an assumed purchase                             -2-
   price for the  ^ee  Simple  in possessions  &quot;computed without   taking into account&quot;  &quot;any sum&quot;  which would  be  payable  to an   outgoing tenant for tillages  manure  and  certain permanent   improvements (Clause  1  (lX$ii in.    The effect of these   words is not clear.  If  &apos;&apos;without taking into  account&quot;  means   that no deduction  is  to be  made in respect  of  these &quot;sums&quot;,   then the land  value will  actually include improvements  for   which the owner may have  to repay his tenant at the end of   the  tenancy.   If  they  are  to be taken to mean that a   deduction is to be made in  respect of these &quot;sums&quot; then,   in the case of land which is  let, presumably very complicated   returns will be required  both from owner and tenant which   must necessarily raise, during the existence of the tenancy,   Important Issues as to  tenant right.  in the  case of   land  .which is not let,  it  may  well be the case that a still  more   complicated return would  be required from the  owner based  on   the  assumption that,  in his capacity as  occupier he would,   at the valuation date,  be entitled by law or custom to claim   against himself as owner  in respect  of &quot;tenant right&quot;  and   Improvements.    If it is  claimed that the expression means   that such tillage^ manurings  and particular improvements   referred to are to be ignored in making, the valuation  it  is   likely again to prove a vulnerable spot  in  the work of   valuation.        10.   In order that  agricultural land  riay receive at   least as favourable treatment,  in respect of owner&apos;s   improvements,  as is accorded to other land, I  am convinced   that the basis of  &quot;land value&quot; as defined in the Draft Sill   needs substantial  amendment.y of agriculture and  Fisheries,th i:ay, 1930.
