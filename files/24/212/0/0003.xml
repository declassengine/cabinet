Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.          As  I am being pressed by Parliamentary questions, in particular by one which Mr. Churchill proposes to put, as to the use of tear-gas in the dispersal of mobsP I should, be grateful for an immediate decision as to the answer to be returned.          The matter of tear-eras has I am informed been discussed academically by the Government of India more than once between 1920 and I926.          It was publicly raised in India in 1928 in the report of a special Magistrate who was deputed to hold an enquiry into a case in which it had been necessary for police to fire on a mob in the Punjab in that year.  In his report he threw out the suggestion that the use of lachrymatorygas might have enabled the authorities to suppress the riots with few or no casualties, and the Punjab Government in publishing his report announced that the suggestion was under consideration.  Again, last year, in their Report on the serious riots which occurred in Bombay,  the Committee ofEnquiry9 consisting of a High Court Judge and two Indians, mentioned that several witnesses had advocated the use of tear-gas fordispersing rioters, but said that on the evidence beforethem they 1: ere not able to endorse this proposal until there was reliable evidence that -the use of this gas,  which appeared to be only in an experimental stage, had been                                                  successfullyIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY OF  HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)JL.O_E._T.

                                                       2.  .15 successfully used in other countries.   In their view firing was  the  only effective remedy.          Before this second report was made, the question had  been brought by the Government of India cenfidentially, in January 1929s before a Conference of Provincial Inspectors-General of Police,  who had the advantage, before discussing it, of hearing the views of technical experts. The  upshot of this examination of the matter in India has  been that the Government of India were disposed to adopt the recommendations of this Conference - namely that, while the information available would not justify the adoption of gas  forthwith in India as a means of dealing with riotous crowds or passive resistors, it was desirable to experiment with gas against dacoits or armed criminals resisting arrest,  both as a practical preliminary to a further examination of the possibility of its use against rioting mobs and  also as a means of eliciting popular opinion on the matter.  But no actual steps have been taken in this direction, the  first of which would have been the supply to the  Government of India by the War Office of gas and apparatus, neither of which at present exists in India.          On the merits of the question,  the following points are to be considered.          1.  It might be urged that the use of any form of gas  for  this purpose would be contrary to the provisions of Article V of the &quot;Five Power Treaty regarding theprotection of the lives of neutrals and non-combatants at sea and the use of poison gas in war&quot;  signed at Washington in February 1929 (which I reproduce below).          2.   The successful use of this weapon depends upon favourablw wmnd conditions. Control  of it is                                               difficult
 difficult,  and  it might, and probably would, penetrate into  houses and among people who had nothing whatever to do with the disturbance. Women and children would probably be amons: its victims.          3.  On the other hand, under unfavourable conditions it might be quite ineffective and resort might have to. be had,  in  addition, to rifle fire.          4.  The manufacture of tear-gas for use againstmobs  might  easily lead to counter-manufacture by revolutionaries.          5.  wTiereas it is true that rifle fire isfrequently  fatal and destroys innocent parties, the number of casualties is limited, whereas by the use of tear-gasthe whole crowd is affected whether concerned in thedisorder  or net.          6.  The interest in Indian affairs is growingrapidly,  not only in this country but in the Dominions andparticularly in the United States where a good deal of  ..sympathy  for the Congress cause exists.  The use of such a weapon  as tear-gas would produce a strength of moraldisapprobation,  which, whether justified on technical groundsor not, appears to me to be a final argument against itsemployment.          I  therefore propose tc answer thq questions onthe matter  by saying the matter has been considered andthe Government declines to make use of this weapon.                                 W.B.12th May  1930.          Article V of Five-Power Treaty (see page 2 above)          &quot;The  use in war of asphyxia tine:, poisonous or    other gases, and all analogous -liquids, materials or    devices, having been justly condemned by the general    opinion of  the civilised world and a prohibition of    such  use having been declared in treaties to which a    majority of the civilised powers are parties.
