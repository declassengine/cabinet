SECRET.CP. 160 (30).Copy No.CAB I K I If,THE REPORT 0? THE CHAUKBL TUNNEL COl&amp;riTTEE     0? TEE ECONOMIC ADVISORY COUNCIL. MEMORAITDUNL BY THE MINISTER ON TRANSPORT.(Circulated in accordance vith Cabinet 23,(30),             Conclusion 5).     In accordance with the Cabinet decision of the 15thApril, 1930, I have considered the Report of the ChannelTunnel Committee of the Economic Advisory Council.  TheCommittee, like the Committee presided over by iir. Peacock,have had before them evidence which was not available forthe Interdepartmental Conference which originally reported on the proposal and which is not before me, and no useful purpose would be served by detailed re-examination of thepoints with which they have dealt after carefully con-sidering all the data which could be collected.  I append,however, my observations on certain features ox the Report.     The following considerations appear to me to bedominant:-     It is  impossible  for anyone, however,  expert, to  say whether or not the Channel  Tunnel can be constructed oraccurately  to estimato it3  cost until a preliminary pilottunnel has been driven.  This will  occupy live years and cost more than  5,000,000.  Erom the point  of  view of affording early or substantial employment,  the scheme  is adisappointment since  it is  estimated by the consulting engineers that, during the  lirst five years only, 1,000men will be employed, after taking  into account the euploy-ment indirectly afforded.                         -1-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY CD His BRITANNIC luvJEaTY^S GOVSRI-MtCi-TT ).
     As regards economic results, I am impressed by thefaet that, there is no demand on the part of traders and commercial men for this new facility and there is no evidence that any substantial stimulus to British trade or industry ivoulci be given by its construction,  he areapt, perhaps, to overlook the ease and cheapness -; ithwhich commodities can be transported by sea and the consequent inducement to ship them from the port nearestto the seat of manufacture.  Reduction in the time of transit with consequent savings in insurance, etc., andthe avoidance of unnecessary handling, would no doubt be a valuable facility for certain perishable, fragileor valuable traffics.  The Channel funnel Policy Committeesay, in paragraph 5 of their Report, that the question ofthe types of new traffic to be created has received only very cursory treatment at the hands of the previousCommittee, -but in the absence of some clear and specificevidence to the contrary from those industrial and trading interests whichare able to speak with authority, therewould seem to be no reason for differing from the con-clusions reached by the Interdepartmental Conference.     As regards passenger traffic, the construction of a tunnel would undoubtedly induce additional travel overand above that which would automatically come aboutunder existing conditions.  After making all allowances for the attraction of American tourists, etc., the addition-al number of English people visiting the Continent wouldprobably exceed the additional number of foreign visitorsattracted here eitheribr pleasure or business.     How far any immediate disttirbance of the balance oftrade, whether from this cause or as a result of anincrease in &quot;luxury&quot; imports, could be said to be againstthe interests of this country is a matter for the Board of                           -2-
c r&quot;3 DTrade rather than myself,  hs Mini ster oi Transport, Iwelcome any new transport facility, provided it is likelyto prove of economic benefit to the country.  I agreewith the conclusions of the Committee in paragraph 3 of cp.114 (30) that, so far as regards economic grounds,          (i) H*H.Government should not Tfithhold their                consent to the construction of the Tunnel                by private enterprise ;         (ii) the evidence of national advantage is not                sufficient to justify construction of                the Tunnel as a national work or with                financial assistance from the State.I should also be averse from meeting out of public fundsany further expenditure for investigating a scheme whichit would fall to private enterprise to carry out.

SECRET.        Notes on the Report  of- ,the,. Channel Tunnel sud-Committee.   1 -  Alternative Methods  of Croes  Channel CommunicationgM           The  Ministry  of Transport  concur generally  in this   part  of the  Report of the Sub-Committee,  ana agree  that the   only  practicable  alternative  to  a  tunnel would be a train   ferry.   2.  Feasibility.           The  Consulting  Engineers confirm,  what  has  always   been  supposed,  that the feasibility  of  constructing the Tunnel   depends upon the  nature,  thickness etc.,  of  the lower chalk   and the extent  of any faults, fissures  or  infilled  valleys which   may exist  and that it is  not  possible to  say whether the   Tunnel  can be constructed until a preliminary  pilot  tunnel has   been  driven  at  a  cost exceeding  5,000,000.           It raa.y  perhaps  be  desirable  to  call  attention to  the   fact  that  the  Committee&apos;s  conclusion in paragraph 177 on  this   point differs  somewhat  in  tone from  one  observations of the   Consulting  Engineers.     The Committee  say  that although &quot;an   element  of doubt&quot; must  remain until  the  pilot tunnel has  been   constructed,  it appears probable that difficulties  likely to   be encountered  could be successfully overcome.   The   Consulting  Engineers say  that the feasibility  of construction   will  depend  upon  the nature of the ground  to  be tunnelled   through, that although  the geological evidence  points  to  the   conclusion that the beds  of chalk extend across the  Channel,   the existence  of  fissures  or infilled valleys cannot  be said to   have  been  proved  or disproved, and that  if large fissures were   met with the  difficulty of tunnelling through them would  be   very  serious, though they  &quot;hesitate  to  say&quot;  that difficulties   encountered  would be insurmountable.                           -4-
 3.  pilot  and  Drainage Tunnel;        It  is agreeo that the modification of the promoters 1 scheme suggested by the consulting engineers is an improvement. (Under the  modification suggested there would he a pilot tunnel of  12 ft. in  diameter together with a drainage tunnel of 7ft. in  diameter.    The pilot tunne.. would become a permanent feature of  the scheme, and the two traffic tunne is of 18&apos;&apos;6&quot; in diameter would be driven subsequently?) . 4.  Cost of  construction.        The consulting engineers estimate the cost of the tunnel portion of the worn of  30,900,000, including  450,000 for seven miles of open approaches.   This estimate does not cover any expense incurred in connection with the scheme outside the 36 miles of tunnel and approaches (e.g. interchange stations,  sidings,  generating station,  etc.)  nor does it include anything, in respect of rolling stock or land.   On the other hand it  includes (see note on page 71)  large sums for standing charges,  supervision and engineering,  etc.,  and contingencies  and payment of interest during construction.        At this stage, any estimate of cost must necessarily be somewhat  speculative,  and in view of the eminence  of thethree firms  of Consulting Engineers employed,  who must be presumed to  have had all available data at their disposal,no useful purpose would be served by criticism of their estimate,especially in  the  absence of information as to  its basis.        The  following observations, however,  may be made :-        (a)  In regard to  the pilot and drainage tunnel works,            the Consultants envisage expenditure,  if  all goes well            of nearly  3 millions each side.   Their  estimate of            5  years for executing this preliminary portion of the            project appears to  be reasonable  having  regard to            the necessity for surveys,  trials  of boring methoas,            etc.  and the careful proving of the continuity of the
              strafe as the tunnelling advances.          (b) As regards the main tunnels, the actual amount to             be expended each year during the period of             construction is not precisely ascertainable in the             absence of information as to the emount allowed for             interest during construction.  The estimate,             however, may be assumed to require an average             expenditure of approximately .Z3-  millions per annum             on each half of the two main tunnels, and it is             thought that such a rate may not be easy of             attainment even allowing for the substantial             proportion represented by the cast iron linings.                 The time of executing the works has an             important bearing upon the cost because of the operation             of the factor of interest on capital during             construction. 5.  Volume of employment provided.         The consultants  estimate that employment will be provided during the first five years on the pilot and drainage tunnels for 250 men directly and 750 men indirectly per annum on each side of the tunnel.     They estimate that for a further period of three years employment will be provided on the main tunnels, including the land tunnels on each side, for 1,550 men directly and. 4,500 men indirectly per annum.   The total labour direct  and indirect  to bo employed annually for the first five years on  the English side is only equivalent to that which could be provided by  the expenditure of about  250,000 per annum on road  construction  in this country.    The project thus loses much of  its  attraction  as a scheme  for providingF[employment,  and it  will  he  borne in mind that the Committeepave submitted certain estimates as  to  the  adverse  effects on employment which will arise  in certain  directions as a result f the opening  of the  tunnel.
 5 .   Cost  of maintenance.        The Cons; ltihg Engineers  express  the  opinion that  on the  assumption that  the electric  locomotives  and  rolling stock will he owned  and maintained  by the  operating railway companies,  the expenditure  on the  operation  (including  cost of current) and upkeep  of the  tunnel  will not reach  a sum  of   500,000 per  annum.     It  is  not clear whether this sum is intended to include allowances in respect of depreciation and renewals; and  if it does not the Ministry of Transport  see  no  reason to take  exception to this figure.  In this connection it is noted that  the consultants Miink  that the movement  of trains themselves will  suffice for  the ventilation of the tunnels.     This might to some extent be true in tube construction where clearances are  only a  few inches, but where clearances are comparatively large, as will be the case  in tue  Channel Tunnel, it  is considered that special ventilating equipment  is  likely to be required in order to prevent  localisation of  air.     In any case the  method of ventilating the tunnels would be a matter for test  before the  were  opened for traffic  and may  prove a difficult  problem.        It is not without  interest to remark that one of the firms of  Consulting Engineers who reported on the ChannelTunnel have  recently recommended an expenditure of  30,000upon purely  experimental plant in order to assist them in determining how to ventilate the Kersey Tunnel -which is nowunder construction.    (The problem there is to ventilate a short tunnel which will be used  for road traffic and has an unprecedented diameter of  45ft.) ?-  Time  of  construction.       As has  already been indicated the Consulting Engineers1 estimate  of  five years as  the time required for driving the pilot and drainage tunnels may be accepted, but a more conservative estimate of the tide required for constructing the
main tunnels (three years)  would appear to he  advisahle.It must also he borne in mind that,  while the  period ofactual construction will be eight years,  a great amountof preliminary work and negotiation will  be required beforeactual operations could begin,          Before the tunnels were actually open fortraffic there would have to be some actual demonstrationas to ventilation and for other technical purposesconnected with the safety of the staff and the travellingpublic.  It is unlikely therefore that even in the most favourable circumstances the tunnel would actually be open for traffic until the expiration of at least 10 years fromthe date of a decision on the part of the two governments that the promoters were at liberty to proceed.8.   Rolling Stock.          The Ministry of Transport agree that, providedthat foreign railway administrations are prepared toaccept stock constructed to the British loading gauge,the best arrangement might be for special Channel Tunnelstock  to be run, at any rate in the first instance.  Theuse of such stock, however, both for passengers and goods  would, in practice, be restricted to places on theContinent between which and this country  considerablevolumes of traffic regularly passed.   As  regards traffic to and from other places, as the Report  indicates, itwould  be necessary for passengers to change into, or from,Channel Tunnel  carriages at some point of their  journey,and it would also be necessary for  goods  to be trans-shipped into,  or from, Channel Tunnel wagons.9o  Passenger  traffic.          The  Sub-Committee estimate,  after a carefulsurvey of all  available data, that  the Channel Tunnel  ifopen  in 1938 would secure 2,357,000 passengers in thatyear.  Departmental  estimates had assumed that in 10 years
tine a possible total of between 2-g- and 2f million passengersmight be secured but that in any ease the number could hardly exceed 6 millions.  This estimate of the maximumtraffic corresponds fairly well with the Committee&apos;s estimate.In arriving at the departmental estimate careful consideration was given, not mereij&apos; to the volume of traffic likely to be diverted from ether existing routes and to the automaticincrease in the volume of traffic but also to the creation ofnew traffic by virtue of the existence of the new facilityitself.  The Ministry of Transport would be inclined to takea fairly liberal view of the latter possibility.           point of importance in an estimate of the economic advantages of the Tunnel is the additional number  of american tourists likely to be attracted to this country bythe existence of a Tunnel.  The Board of Trade, after careful examination of the statistics available, reached: the con-elusion that the total number of travellers from the UnitedStates to Europe who did not come to Britain  in 1927 wasabout  250,000 and  certainly not more than  300,000.  For agreat  number of  these travellers, their country of origin-which  might not be the United kingdom, would,  be the mainattraction, and, it was  not  thought  safe to take more  than200,000 as the number of travellers  from the  United Statesthat might be attracted  to  the United kingdom;  This numberwould  no  doubt increase  as  the travel habit grew,  but  in considering how  far American tourists would, be  likely  to alter  their itinerary or prolong  their stay in Europeregard, must be had to the  fact that  the  increase  in suchtraffic across the Atlantic  since  the war  has been in  thedirection not  of first-class passengers but of  those payinglower  fares and  no doubt possessed generally  of lowerspending  power.                    . . .&apos;  &apos; h&apos;;&apos;9
   In so far as this country is to benefit by increasein passenger traffic, it is to the Continental visitor thatone must mainly look.  It may be roughly estimated that a population of about 100,0.00,000 lives in Northern and western europe within 24 hours reach of London.  What proportion ofthis population would be induced to visit England by the attractions of a tunnel as compared with a sea passage, and how long the duration of their visits, it is impossibleeven to speculate.  But, on the whole, it seems probable thatthe increase in the number of English people who would helikely to take journeys abroad would be greater than theincrease in Continental visitors to this country.         All the estimates of traffic are based on theassumption that the  through fares to be charged would,speaking generally,be on the same basis as the existingfares, but until  the terms on which the connecting railwaycompanies would be prepared to work the traffic and allocatereceipts are known it is not possible  to forecast the  levelof fares which are likely  to be demanded with a view  to  the adequate remuneration of various  interests concerned.         A question  which will arise  in due  course if  the project proceeds  is  whether any attempt is to be made  tocontrol, by  statute  or  otherwise,  fares and  charges for  theChannel passage,  and, if so,  through  what machinery.10.  Goods Traffic.         The Committee  made no specific estimate either  ofthe  tonnage  of goods traffic  which might be  secured,  or  ofthe  receipts which might be obtained  from it.  The consider-ations already mentioned which make  estimates  of passenger traffic  speculative  in  present circumstances,  apply with greater force  in  the case  of  goods traffic.         The Ministry see  no  reason  to doubt the correctnessof the  general view  which  appears  to  be held by  the                           10.
Committee and others that goods -traffic,  so far as can heseen, is likely to he relatively unimportant,,   (it will he recalled that the Board.of Trade, as a result of a verythorough consideration of the position, came to theconclusion that 350,000 tons a year of traffic might heconveyed through the tunnel ten years hence.)lie  General considerations.        The Committee (page 74) state that their calculationsindicate that the return on the capital invested, thoughprobably meagre in the early years, should increase steadilyif - as may with some confidence be expected - the passenger traffic continues to expand at  the same average compound  rate as that at which it has expanded since 1850, viz. 4^0 perannum.        The Committee do not state in  detail on whatassumptions they have come  to  this general  conclusion.  Asthey point  out  in  their Report  considerable  capitalexpenditure in  addition  to  the  capital expenditure  on  thetunnel  works v/ill  have  to be  incurred by  the existing  railwaycompanies  in the  construction  of exchange stations,  rolling stock and  accommodation  therefor,  and those  companies  willalso incur expenditure  in  connection with the  operation ofthe  tunnel  services.    The  railway companies will necessarily have to take this  expenditure  into account in negotiating their agreements  with the  tunnel companies,  and. they willalso necessarily bear in mind the  adverse financial effects which the  operation of the  tunnel  will have in connectionwith their existing steamship services and their financial interest in the ports.   These considerations make it im-practicable at present to  make any approximate estimate of                                                               I the probable financial results of  the tunnel,  apart from the  ipossibility of the continuance or  growth of competitive services and other factors  of uncertainty.                                11.
            The Ministry would,  of course,  welcome  the  introduction       of new transport facilities,  for which there  is  an economic       justification,  and is not  disposed to underrate  the amount  of       additional travel likely  to he  induced by their  creation, but       there  is at present  no evidence that this particular scheme       would  be likely to result  in any general reduction of the       cost  of transport or in any marked stimulus  to trade.   It       would  certainly result.lt in  increased convenience  in certain       directions,and  in some saving of time on cross-channel journeys.       This  saving of  time  would  not be likely to exceed  one  hour       at most as compared  with  the existing booked  times,but the       services would,  of course,  be more reliable  than the existing       cross-channel services,   (The Folkestone-Boulogne  passage       now takes 90 minutes,  and  the time occupied  in changing from       train  to boat and vice versa at both ends occupies the* more,       which  is reduced to  -^hr.  in the case of the  Golden Arrow       (Dover-Calais)  services in respect of which  special arrange-       ments  are made  with  the Customs, etc., the total time  is,       therefore, about Sihrs0   The corresponding time  taken by       trains through  the tunnel  could hardly,having regard to.the       necessity of changing engines,  and the Customsspassport and       aliens examinationpetc , be expected to occupy much less       than  1-JhrSo )            In conclusion it may  be added that if the project were       to proceed, a great  variety of  technical and  other matters       would  require consideration,including the requirements which       would  have to be imposed  in the interests of safety,both       during construction  and afterwards,the method of electrifi-       cation to be adopted,  the  arrangements - whether statutory       or by  international  agreement or otherwise - for the control       and administration of the  services,  etc3, etc.  It is,       however, unnecessary to deal at this stage with  matters       of this kind.
