Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1930.SECRET.Copy No.33CP. 174 (30).CABINET.FRANCHISE PROPOSALS IN CEYLON.          MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.    THE  Special Commission on  the Constitution of Ceylon presided over by LordiDonoughmore prepared a general scheme for the future government of the island and included therein certain recommendations with regard to the conditions for the franchise under the new Constitution for Ceylon.   In a despatch dated the 2nd June,1929, published as a Parliamentary Paper  (Cmd. 3419), the Governor  of Ceylonexplained  the  strong objections which were felt by the Ceylonese to the  generalenfranchisement of that large number of Indians in Ceylon who cannot be regardedas permanently settled in the Island. In order to meet these objections, the Governmentsubmitted  modified proposals in regard to the conditions under which the franchisewould be  granted  both to  Ceylonese  and non-Ceylonese.  Under these  proposalsdomicile would in both cases be the standard test for the grant  of  the  franchise.Under this qualification practically all Ceylonese, an appreciable number of Indians,and a few  Europeans would become entitled to registration.   For the undomiciled,including any whose domicile in the Island might be in doubt, the Governor proposedto substitute the choice of either of  two alternative qualifications in lieu of that ofdomicile.   One alternative would be compliance with the franchise conditions of thepresent Constitution in respect of literacy and  property.  This would provide forpractically all European residents of British nationality, and for a number  of BritishIndians engaged in commerce or professional work.  The other alternative would bethe  production  of  a certificate of  permanent  settlement granted by some duly authorised  officer.   The conditions entitling an applicant to receive such a  certificatewould be that he would be reqiiired to furnish  satisfactory evidence of five years&apos;residence in Ceylon, and, in addition, to make  a declaration to the  effect  that  he-was permanently settled in the Island, or residing  in the Island with intent to settletherein, and that, while registered  as a voter, he would renounce any claim to special protection  by any Government other than that of Ceylon or to any statutory rights,privileges or exemptions to  which residents of all races and communities were not entitled.    2.  These proposals were submitted to the Cabinet in my memorandum of the1st August last, and were approved.    3.  The  proposals  for  the new Constitution  with the modification  of theranchise conditions suggested by the Governor, and explained above, were submittedo the Legislative Council of Ceylon,  and after prolonged debate a resolution  inavour of their acceptance was passed by a small majority.   The modifications  inegard to the franchise introduced  by the Governor were an important  factor  innclucing the Ceylonese members of Council to accept the new Constitution; and Im satisfied, from the many representations which I  have received,  that withouthose modifications there  would have  been  no prospect of the acceptance of theConstitution by the Council.   I have received  a  number of  protests against anyelaxation of the conditions in regard to the franchise proposed by the Governor.    4.  The  Legislative  Council of Ceylon contains two Indian  Members,  repre-enting the Indian  population  of  the Island. &apos; These two members took no  part  in      [21129]                                                          B
2the debate on the Constitution proposals.  Subsequent to that debate, however, theyentered into communication with the Government of India, with  the  result thatstrong protests against the  Governors proposals were made by the  Government ofIndia  to the Secretary of State for  India.  The nature of those protests may begathered from the correspondence between the  India Office and the  Colonial Office,which is attached.    5.  I have felt that the protests of  the Government of India have been based,to a large extent, on a misunderstanding of the Governors proposals..  After full discussion with the Governor of Ceylon,  who is now in this country, I informed theSecretary of State for India that I was prepared to adopt two small modifications of  the  GoArernor&apos;s  proposals, if I could be  assured that  the  adoption of  theseproposals would be satisfactory to the Government of India and would lead  themto  defend the franchise proposals if they were again  attacked  in the  IndianAssembly.   The suggested modifications  involved the omission of the requirement that the voter should  renounce his claim  to protection by any other Government andthe rewording of the requirement  in regard to the claim of any statutory rights,privileges or exemptions to  which residents in Ceylon of all races and communitiesare not entitled.  The first modification would  be of little  practical  effect, althoughthe Ceylonese attach  a sentimental importance to this renunciation.   In practice,an  Indian labourer after five years&apos; residence  in Ceylon would have lost his claim Ito protection by the Government of  India. The second modification,  while deprivingIthe voter  of the right to claim  any special privileges to which all  races and com-1munities are not entitled, would not prevent  the grant to the Indian labourer ofany such rights or privileges as the Ceylon  Legislature might have  approved.   Themost  important  privileges in question in this  connection  are the  freedom of theIndian labourer from arrest for debt in respect of advances made to him to enable him to emigrate to Ceylon, and exemption from certain village rates  and obligations.    6.  It  is very important that  a  decision  should  be reached at  once.   The Iextended  term of the existing Legislative Council will expire at the end of  1930.1Even if an Order  in Council,  providing for  the new franchise requirements, is Ipassed immediately, it will be difficult to complete the register of voters before the Ispring of next year, and it is essential that,  if the new Constitution  is to be brought 1into force, a new Council should be elected  in time to deal with the Budget for the Iyear beginning September  1931.  Any considerable  concession to the demands oil the Indian  Legislature would be strongly resented by the Ceylonese  supporters of Ithe new Constitution, and  would almost  certainly involve  the  rejection of that IConstitution or the refusal  to co-operate  in  its working.  The continued impression Ithat His Majesty&apos;s Government are considering,  under pressure  from the Govermiment of India, proposals for the abandonment of safeguards to which the Ceylonese Pattach vital importance  is creating an unfavourable atmosphere  in  Ceylon.  I feel. i therefore, that I  have gone to the limit of possible concession to  the Government of india, and I propose  now to proceed without further delay with the preparation of Ithe necessary Order in Council embodying the  Governors proposals, subject only to Ithe modifications which I have indicated  above, and which I should  agree to only in Ithe event of their being satisfactory to the Government of India.   Ceylonese opinion Iwould not tolerate any material variation of the proposals, and I can only justifythese modifications to the Ceylonese on the ground that they are adopted to removemisunderstandings and not to effect any substantial change in the conditions of the franchise.

APPENDIX.                                    No. 1.                         India Office to Colonial Office.Sir,                                 Whitehall, London, S.W. 1, March 7. 1930.    WITH reference to correspondence ending with your letter of the 8th February,1930, on the subject of the position of Indians in Ceylon under the proposed newConstitution, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to transmit, for theinformation  of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, copy of a  telegram receivedfrom the Government of India. In their telegram the Government of India formulatetheir final views on the Governors franchise proposals after  discussion with themembers of the Standing Emigration Committee and after consideration of the views expressed in the debate in  the Indian Legislative Assembly on Mr. Kunzru&apos;s resolu-tion of 11th February.   It  will be observed that the Government  of  India  havereceived a memorial signed  by the two Indian members of the Ceylon LegislativeCouncil protesting  against these proposals  and asking for their help  in securingreconsideration of the matter.    2.  For  the reasons given in paragraphs 3 to 5 of their telegram, the Govern-ment of India urge that the question of the adoption of the Governors  proposals relating to the franchise in substitution for  the  recommendations made  by the donoughmore  Commission  should  receive  immediate  reconsideration by  HisMajesty&apos;s  Government.  The Government of India consider that a postponement would have serious  repercussions on political opinion in India  and on the existingamicable relations between India and Ceylon, and that unless prompt measures are taken to meet the present feeling in India in regard to these proposals they will be faced with a strong demand for the cessation of immigration of unskilled workers to ceylon.  This the Government of India are  anxious to avoid.    3.  The Government of  India suggest that the question of basing the franchiseon five years&apos; continuous residence, subject  to  certain conditions, as recommendedby the Donoughmore Commission should be re-examined, possibly by the appointmentof a committee  to  elicit  how  such  residence  could be  satisfactorily proved  anddocumentary evidence  be  made  available to persons  in  a position  to  furnish theevidence required.   It will be noted that the Government of India do not raise any objection to the retention of the existing franchise qualifications as an alternative tothe  above  proposal.    4.  Mr. Secretary  Benn has no doubt that the  views expressed by the Govern-ment of India will receive Lord Passfieid&apos;s careful  consideration, and that no finaldecision contrary to those views will be taken without further consultation with thisOffice.  In this connection Lord Passfieid will recollect that in a reply given by theSecretary of State  for India to a Parliamentary Question on the 24th February, he stated, with  the concurrence of the Colonial Office, that the views of the Governmentof India would be considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government before  a decision wasreached.    5.  A copy of the debate in the India Legislative Assembly on  the 11th Februaryon Mr. Kunzru&apos;s resolution  will be forwarded on receipt from the Government ofIndia.                                                         I am, &amp;c,                                                            E. J. TURNER.Viceroy, Department of Education, Health and Lands, New Delhi, to Secretary of                               State for India.                   (Received 10-45 A.M., 21st February, 1930.)                                  TELEGRAM.(Part 1.)    FEBRUARY 21,  1930 :  Ceylon Franchise.  Question was  discussed by  us  withnembers of the Standing Emigration  Committee on Sunday, the 9th, and in the      [21129]                                                       B  2
Legislative  Assembly on  Kunzru&apos;s Resolution on  Tuesday, the 11th instant.  in both discussions non-official members, including representatives of European group,expressed strong resentment both at omission of Colonial Office to give us opportunityto make representations on Governor&apos;s proposal before orders were  passed by theSecretary of State  for the Colonies, and at anti-Indian character of proposal thatone  of  the alternative  franchise qualifications should  be five  years&apos;  residence,combined with  declaration  of intention  to reside permanently in Ceylon andrenunciation of protection of outside Government and of special statutory privileges.(Part 2.)     In  Assembly, K. C.  Roy  moved  amendment to Kunzru&apos;s Resolution voicingprotest  against the  way the Government of India had been ignored.  He would have pressed the amendment to  division and probably carried it, but for assurance givenby our  spokesman that matter  (1 of,  omitted) such vital  importance could not be finally disposed of by His Majesty&apos;s Government without consideration of views ofthe Government and people of India.   So tense was  atmosphere in House that it wasdecided to let Kunzru&apos;s Resolution pass without omission of the word &quot; immediate &quot;from before &quot;steps.&quot;   Words  &quot;to represent to His Majesty&apos;s Government&quot;  wereinserted after &quot; Governor-General in Council &quot; at Kunzru&apos;s own suggestion.     2.  In  our official  telegram of 29th November, we explained why Governorsproposal appeared to us to be unacceptable to Indian opinion, whether in Ceylon orin India.  From Ceylon we have received memorial signed by two Indian members ofthe Legislative  Council protesting against proposal and bespeaking our  help in having matter reconsidered.  Of Indian public opinion we  have endeavoured to give you idea in preceding paragraph.  Further examination of Governors argumentshas in no way altered our own view of the proposal.   Our reasons for this are set outin following paragraphs.(Part 3.)     3.  Governors  main  arguments  are :  (1)  That desire of Ceylon leaders to restrict the size of Indian electorate so as to avoid potential menace  to  localpredominance of Ceylonese should be met; (2) that emergence in  Ceylon  of Indianquestions like those that have arisen in certain parts of Africa should be avoided.     As regards (1) we  are not  satisfied that menace to Ceylonese predominance isreal.  Total number of Indian  estate  labourers at  end  of  1928 was 700,000.   this figure included both adults and minors of each sex.   Allowing for  persons  below21 years of age and for those who have not been continuously resident in Ceylon for five years, it is most unlikely that more than 300,000 of this number could qualify for vote.   We fail to  see how inclusion  of 300,000  Indians in total  maximumelectorate of nearly 2  millions could thwart legitimate  political aspirations ofCeylonese.   Our former   Agent  estimated  that  if Donoughmore  Commission&apos;&apos;franchise proposal  were accepted, 5 or  6 Indians  at  most would be returned toLegislature consisting of 65 elected members.(Part 4.)     Thus inside Legislature also enfranchisement of Indians in numbers mentionedcould not affect Ceylonese predominance.  It is possible that, both in constituencies and  in  the  Legislature, Indians may, in  certain circumstances,  hold the balance between the opposite  political  groups, but  limitation of  the  size of the Indianelectorate could not altogether  eliminate that possibility,  since,  in  event  of  localparties  commanding equal support,  even one Indian vote  would hold commandingposition.  Moreover, we think  there  is nothing wrong in principle for minoritygroup, such as Indians, will probably always remain in Ceylon, to be able to  safe-guard its own interests by being able to (? wield)  influence over  majority parties.Nor  do  we believe that Indian electorate would be exploited by  political adventurersfrom India for non-Ceylonese purposes.  India affords  sufficient scope for politicalambitions of Indians, and the result of future constitutional developments in thiscountry would be to enlarge rather than to reduce the scope.     (2)  Governors reference to Africa we would beg  leave to describe as neitherfelicitous nor apt.  It has aroused the strongest resentment in India as revealingintention to place Indians in Ceylon eventually on same  footing as  their compatriotsin certain parts of  Africa where His Excellency has served.
(Part 5.)    We submit  there  is no analogy  between certain parts of Africa, with theirpeculiar socio-economic problems created by the impact of races of fundamentallydifferent civilisations, and Ceylon, whose history and civilisation bear unmistakableimpress of Indian influence.   Geographical proximity and affinities of culture andrace make it impossible that Ceylon and South India should subsist side by side inmutual isolation.  We have been contending for equality of political  status and ofeconomic opportunity for Indians upon several occasions even in Crown Colonies in africa.   We are sure His Majesty&apos;s Government do not expect us to be  satisfied with lower  status in neighbouring Asiatic Colony, a result  which would  seem tofollow from application to Ceylon of principle which holds the field in South  Africa.    4.  On hardship of requiring Indians of labouring class to make declaration of intention to reside permanently in Ceylon or to renounce our protection and specialstatutory privileges, we have already commented.   Majority of assisted emigrantshave no intention of settling down in Ceylon, although they  spend greater portionof their active life in the Island.  True criterion for determining their eligibility forfranchise is their life-long service to Ceylon, not duration of their stay there.   If time must enter into fixation of qualification of voters, period of residence recommendedby the Donoughmore Commission is in our opinion adequate, nor  can this class of person reasonably be asked to renounce  the privileges such as those secured for himby Indian Labour Ordinance No. 27 of 1927; they mean much to him.  The vote hewould use to ameliorate his position which admits of considerable improvement.(Part 6.)    5.  Renunciation  of our protection would not be objected to by us if  we weresure that  possession of vote would be effective substitute for our solicitude.  that stage would be reached only when number of Indian voters is sufficient to enablethem  to influence our  policy.    It  seems  to follow  that adoption  of  Donoughmoreproposal would lead more rapidly to stage when we can readily abandon  our protectiverole than substitution for it of Governor&apos;s proposal.     6.  We hope that we have made out convincing case  for question being recon-sidered immediately.  Postponement would have (? serious) repercussions on political opinion in India, and  on amicable  relations that have existed for centuries between this country and Ceylon.  You know how new Indian nationalism regards treatmentof Indians in other parts of the Empire as acid test of Empire&apos;s friendship for India.Again as  you will see  from report  of Debate on  Kunzru&apos;s resolution which is being sent by air mail, practically every  non-official speaker described franchise  proposal as humiliation and an affront.(Part 7.)     Unless something is done  promptly to remove this impression, feeling  in india will be greatly embittered, and we shall be faced with strong demand to stop emigra-tion for unskilled work to Ceylon.   This we are naturally anxious to avoid.  We,therefore, strongly urge that question of basing franchise on 5 years&apos; continuous resi-dence subject to limitation(s) proposed by Donoughmore Commission be re-examined.Best method of doing so would seem to be appointment of Committee for elicitinghow such residence could be satisfactorily proved  and documentary  evidence of it made available  to those who can provide requisite evidence.  Once the criteria ofproofs have been determined, it should not be difficult to ascertain hoAV many non-Ceylonese would qualify for franchise under this test, and we should be very muchsurprised if in  respect of Indians estimate proved  higher  than our rough  figure of300,000.     7.  As,regards retention of existing franchise qualifications as an alternative.toour proposal discussed in preceding paragraph, we have no objection.
                                    No.  2.                         Colonial Office to India Office.Sir,                                           Downing Street, March 26, 1930.    I AM directed by Lord Passfield to acknowledge the receipt of your letter ofthe 7th March,  transmitting a copy  of  a  telegram  received from  the  Governmentof India on the subject of the position of Indians in  Ceylon under the proposed newConstitution.    Before coming to any  decision on  the representations of the  Government ofIndia, Lord Passfield must discuss the question with the Governor of Ceylon.   full consideration  will be given to the views  of the  Government of India before thepreparation of the final draft of an Order in Council embodying the new Constitution.    2.  At the  same time I am to make the following general observations on theviews expressed  in the telegram from the  Government of India.    3.  The agitation against the proposals submitted by the Governor  of Ceylon inhis despatch of the 2nd June last has  been somewhat of a surprise to Lord Passfield.The Secretary of State for India will remember that the Governor&apos;s proposals were submitted to the Cabinet; that the draft of Lord Passfield&apos;s proposed reply was in thehands of the Secretary of State for India for some time before it was sent.   At thattime the views of the Government of  India could readily have been obtained, and itis hardly fair to accuse the Colonial Office of omitting to give the Government ofIndia an opportunity to make representations on the Governor&apos;s proposals.  Whilstit is for the Secretary of State for the  Colonies to consider such questions as the effect in Ceylon of the grant of unrestricted franchise to Indian labourers in the Island, itis, of course, no part of his duty to communicate with the Government of India.    4.  Lord  Passfield  cannot resist the conclusion that the  agitation against theGovernor&apos;s proposals is inspired to some  extent by misapprehension of the details ofthose proposals.   In particular, he must protest against the suggestion of the Govern -ment  of India that the Governor&apos;s reference to Africa in his despatch reveals theintention to place Indians in Ceylon  under special disabilities.   He considers thatperusal of the Governor&apos;s despatch will show&apos; that Sir Herbert Stanley was anxiouslyseeking a solution of the  franchise  difficulties which, while satisfying Ceyloneseopinion, would prevent an outbreak in Ceylon of that racial ill-feeling, the occurrence of which in other parts of the world he deplores.  It is not fair  to suggest that his proposals involved relegation of Indians to a lower status.   It was clearly the duty ofthe Governor  to draw attention to the fact that  Ceylonese opinion in general was strongly hostile to the immediate general enfranchisement of large  numbers of personswho have no permanent association with  Ceylon.   It was moreover not unnaturalthat the Ceylonese should press strongly for the imposition of reasonable restrictionson the enfranchisement of persons not native to or domiciled in the Island.  failure to recognise  the strength  of  this feeling would  obviously  have  prejudiced theacceptance of  any scheme of constitutional  reform.  This hostile  feeling on the partof the Ceylonese is not likely to be relieved by the impression that  the Indian popula-tion, following the example of their representatives in the Legislative Council, will infuture hasten  to invoke assistance from India whenever their views are  not acceptedby their elected Ceylonese colleagues in the  Legislative  Council.    5.   I am  to take this opportunity of transmitting  to you, for the information ofthe Secretary  of State for India, a copy of a telegram received  from the governor of Ceylon conveying the strong protest of the Ceylon National Congress against anyattempt to modify the proposals regarding the Indian franchise which were containedin Lord Passfield&apos;s despatch of the 10th October.                                                      I am, &amp;c.                                                           H. R.  COWELL.
                                     No.  3. Sir,                                                            May   , 1930.     IN continuation of the letter from this Department of the 26th March on the subject of the position  of Indians in Ceylon under the proposed new  Constitution, I am directed by  Lord Passfieid to state,  for the information of  the  Secretary of State for India, that a telegram has now been received from the Governor of Ceylon giving  his  views on  the  letter  from  the India Office  of  the   7th March, E.  &amp; O. 1423/30, and  on  the telegram from the Government of India enclosed in that letter.     2.  The Governor states that the effect in Ceylon of a threat of the stoppage of the emigration of  unskilled labourers from  India to Ceylon would  be the reverse of that desired by the  Government of India.   While such  a stoppage would in time have a serious  effect on  European financial interests,  it  would directly  affect Ceylonese interests to a small extent only,  and,  while some might appreciate that eventually it would prejudice the general prosperity of the island,  it seems unlikely that even this appreciation would outweigh their reluctance to advocate a surrender to what would be popularly considered as an unwarrantable attempt by the Govern- ment of India to dictate to  Ceylon.  Such a threat would be strongly resented, and would  stiffen rather than  relax the  existing opposition to any change  in  the franchise proposals submitted by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and accepted by  the Legislative Council of Ceylon.  The resentment so  caused would not be lessened by the action of the Indian members of the Legislative Council in appealing directly to the Government of India without even having explained their ground of objection to the  Legislative  Council, of which they are members.     3.   The Governor points out that the  telegram  from the Government of  India entirely ignores  the proposal that Indians domiciled in  Ceylon should be qualified for  the franchise.  In the Governors opinion  the number of domiciled Indians is probably very large.    4.   While it may be the fact that, as  the Government of India suggests,  the menace to the local predominance of the Ceylonese involved in any increase of the number  of Indian voters may  be  largely  illusory,  it  is  impossible  to  persuade the  Ceylonese that it is negligible.    5.   The Governor fully endorses the remarks  made in the fourth paragraph of the  letter from this Department of the 26th March in  regard to the misinterpretation of his reference  to Africa in his despatch of the 2nd June last.  He considers that the  suggestion  that  his proposal envisaged or would lead to a  reproduction  of African conditions in Ceylon is so absurd that he is surprised  to find it  embodied in a telegram from  the Government of India.    6.   The Governor states that the reference to  equality of  political status in the fifth part of the  telegram from the Government of India  is to  him unintelligible,  as quality in status is exactly what he has proposed,  and is exactly that against which the  Government of India are contending in their endeavour to secure that all Indians admitted to  the voters&apos; roll must retain a special status and privileges  not enjoyed by the rest of the electorate.    7.   The Governor doubts whether any attempt has been made by the  Government of India to  dispel  misunderstandings which have been fostered by agitators, or to form an accurate appreciation of the real  effect of  his  proposals.   In conclusion, he points to the necessity of reaching a final  settlement with the least possible delay, as if the registration of  voters cannot begin  before the end of May,  the introduction of the new Constitution before the end of  next February will be  impossible.   He states that  he is not wedded to his proposals on any personal grounds, nor were they the outcome of any  bargaining, but they embody what he believes to involve the minimum concession  to  the  Sinhalese objection to the general enfranchisement of ndians, an  objection which, if it had not  been met,  would have been fatal to any chance of the acceptance  of the Donoughmore Constitution by the existing LegislativeCouncil.  Any substantial modification of  what  was a crucial point  determining the  acceptance by the Council of the proposed Constitution could not now be made without an  imputation  of  breach  of faith,  and if  proposals so modified  were e-submitted to the Council, the  Governor apprehends that the result would be the ejection of the proposals by a large  unofficial majority with some risk of extensive on-co-operation in the  working of the new Constitution, if  it were subsequently ntroduced in the face of such opposition.
    8.  The  Governor of  Ceylon is  now  on his way  to  this  country, and LordPassfield will reserve his final decision on the.question of the franchise until he hashad   an  opportunity   of  personal  discussion   with  Sir  Herbert  Stanley.He  thinks,   however,   that  it  would   be   desirable   to  indicate   to   theGovernment  of India  that,  after  full consideration of  their  representations,he  does  not  see  his  way  to  impose  on   the  people  of  Ceylon   a  Con-stitution containing  provisions  which,  as he  is  fully aware, would  excite the strongest opposition from a majority of  the inhabitants.   In this connection,  I amto enclose for the information of  the Secretary of  State for  India a copy  of  a memorial from the Lanka Maha Jana Sabha which  fully  explains  the grounds onwhich the Ceylonese  community are opposed to any  alteration  in the franchiseproposals submitted to and accepted by the Legislative Council.    9.  In connection with the objection  of the Government of India to the proposedrequirement of a certificate of permanent settlement from  Indians wishing  to be registered as voters in Ceylon, I am to point out that the Government of India haveperhaps not appreciated that this certificate was a device introduced solely in orderto assist Indians who could not readily satisfy the standard requirements of eitherdomicile or property and literacy, or  who might  find it difficult to establish a claim under these requirements.   It was intended,  in fact, as a special concession tofacilitate their enfranchisement, and  would not have been accepted by the Ceyloneseunless a condition had been attached to emphasise the readiness of Indians admitted to the franchise without satisfying the standard requirements to be prepared  to betreated as Ceylonese.  In the Governor&apos;s  opinion, and in that of Lord Passfield,  theseconditions seem to be perfectly reasonable, but if the Government of India dislikesthem,  the Governor would see no objection to deleting the whole provision for thegrant  of certificates of permanent settlement, thus leaving Indians  in precisely thesame  position as all other British subjects inhabiting the Island; that is, they wouldbe eligible for the franchise in virtue either of domicile, subject to a minimum of fiveyears&apos; residence, or of property and literacy.                                                        I am, &amp;c.                                                            H. R. COWELL.    The Under-Secretary  of State,             India Office.
