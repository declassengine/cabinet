At the forthcoming session of the International LabourConference a Draft Convention on Hours in Coal Mines is to bediscussed following the preparatory Technical Conference whichhas already taken place.    The attached memoranda state thepolicy which the President of the Board of Trade and I proposeshould be adopted.     My colleagues will remember that underground workers in coal mines are excluded from the Hours of Industrial employment bill: the second memorandum deals particularly with this aspect of the matter.     The President of the Board of Trade and I ask for authority to instruct the Government Delegates accordingly.Ministryof Labour.(Intld. )  M.G.B
         DRAFT CONVENTION ON HOURS  IN  GOAL MIMES.         Memorandum by the Ministry of Mines.        The International Labour Conference which is to  considerinter alia a Convention on Hours in Coal Mines begins at geneva on 10th June.     Following a Preparatory Technical Conference last january the International Labour Office have issued a draft convention for the consideration of the June Conference.     Before reference is made to the terms of this draft Convention,two &quot;general&quot; questions should be mentioned.     The first is whether any Convention should be limited  in its application to the nine European coal-producing countries  (which alone have taten part in the various preliminary proceedings ) orwhether it should cover coal-production in other parts of theworld as well.    The International  Labour Office suggests  that theConference might decide on this point  that the Convention shall not come into force until it has been ratified by certain namedEuropean States, while at the same time it would be expresslystated that any other State Member  of  the I.L.O. would be free toadopt it.     There will doubtless  be  great reluctance on the partof some European countries (and certainly of the British coal-owners ) to enter into any Convention to reduce hours while  otherContinents, e.g. South Africa, continue unchanged, but it isclearly out of the question for the present Conference to consider what Convention would be suitable to non-European coal mines,as the information collected by the  I.L.O. covers Europe alone.If therefore any Convention is to emerge in June it will have tobe on some such basis as that proposed by the Office; and for thisreason it seems that the British Government should support  it, inspite of the attitude of the British owners.                               1.
      The  other general question is whether a final decision should he  taken at this Conference , or whether it should he subjected  to the  usual d.ouble discussion procedure and postponed., after discussion, to a subsequent Conference.    Mainly at the instance  of the British Government, the procedure of the Preparatory Technical Conference was designed, to secure a decision in June  of this year, and the British Government will presumably support that course.      It is now proposed to examine as  shortly as possible the terms  of the draft Convention.    It is necessary to examine them from  two rather different points of view, one being the question what  is desirable and. practicable as between this country and other  European coal producing countries, and the other being the question whether  such agreement  as may be found possible Is in conformity with the Washington Convention.     A copy of the draft Convention itself Is attached as an Appendix to this  note.      On Article I the question will arise as to the application of the Convention to lignite  mines.     Germany will wish them tc be excluded ot? at least to have  their  inclusion postponed for further consideration.     This question does not concern this country so closely as it does some others, such as Poland, but the general  attitude  of the British Government, it is  suggested, should be  for  the  inclusion of lignite, with power to  agree to some modifications  If necessary  to secure Germany&apos; s adherence to a  Convention or  otherwise  as  a bargaining point.     Article 2  (iii)  and. (iv) proposes  what  the maximum normal hours  of work  shall  be.     It proposes  7f hours (bank to bank) for a  period not  exceeding 5  years and 7-g- hours thereafter.Assuming a  deduction of a  uniform half-hour  in this country on account of man-winding (discussed later) this would mean,  in terms  of our legislation,  7-   hours for five  years  and.  7 hours thereafter.     There  is  likely to be strong  opposition to any- thing  less  than 8  hours,  both from producing and from  consuming                               2.
 countries, &quot;but  the previous attitude  of the  British  Government has been  in  favour1 of 7-I hours  (7 hours in  our  legislation) and of an  intermediate period  (if any)  of less  than 5 years and to this attitude they will presumably  adhere.     The  hours  prescribed  in Article  2 relate primarily to each individual and are prescribed  as the maximum period which shall  elapse between the time when  each individual leaves the surface and the time when  he reaches  the surface again.     The  Convention recognises however that  in  order to apply this literally  it would be necessary  for all men to be divided into prescribed cage loads descending and ascending in the same order  and that  this is by  no means  the universal or the general practice.     By Article 3 therefore it proposes to allow the principle of averaging.    Paragraph (i) says in effect that you need not bring  the men up in the same order  as they went down, but that provided  the period of winding up is  the same as the period of winding down, it will be sufficient if the period between the time when the first cage leaves the surface and the first cage returns to the  surface does not exceed the 7-f or the 7% hours. This means taking the average of each shift as  a separate unit and would be applicable in Poland,  for instance.    One effect o it is  that pits that require a longer time to wind their men up or down have less time for coal winding and vice versa, and it is therefore not applicable to the  conditions in British mines in which  the law in effect prescribes a uniform coal windingperiod with varying additional periods for man-winding accordingto the circumstances of each pit.     Paragraph  (ii) is designed to meet this, and provides thatwe shall  be in  compliance with the  Convention provided that in fixing our maximum time by law for  coal winding we deduct fromthe 7-f or the 7-1 hours the average  time taken by all the pits
ti z5 In  the  country  to lower  or  raise  the  workmen.     This  is  essential if v.e  are  to ratify the Convention because all parties  in this  country are agreed that we cannot alter  our  system  at  present.     The inclusion  of this proviso is therefore  satisfactory.     It  is  known however that the German Government, for one, considers  that if this concession is&apos;ma.de to  us  our  man-winding times  ought to  be reckoned at something more than  the actual average  (and our coal-winding time correspondingly reduced)  on the  ground, that our system gives  us an  economic advantage by  allowing us  to send our most productive men down first and bring  them  up  last.     And  the terms of the draft Convention, though  the all-important figure is at present a blank, clearly  provide  for the  incorporation of this view. British colliery  owners firmly  maintain that it is based upon ,* a fallacy.    In  any event the  point  applies equally to every country which has not a regimentation system,  and there is no good reason .why  this country  should,  be penalised on account  of it, while  others, such as Poland,  are  not.     It is suggested therefore  that the British Government  should oppose any figure. for man-winding times which is  in excess  of the actual weighted average (which in round figures will  be 3 0 minutes).     Article 4 provides that all  countries shall give up any average system at the earliest  possible moment and that in any case the question shall be specially  examined,  again in not exceeding  5 years time.    This could  be accepted.     Article 5 proposes to allow  by agreement  between employersand workers a  weekly or fortnightly spread-over, subject to a limit of one extra hour in any day.     This  was opposed at the Preparatory Technical Conference  by the miners&apos;  representative, and the Government representative  abstained from voting.    Hewill presumably adopt the same attitude in June.     Article 6 provides for annual  reports  being made  as  to operation  of the  Convention in the  countries which  ratify it.                            4.
                                                            O &quot;r. o                                                            ij e) U     Article 7 proposes that  lower hours  shall &quot;be  prescribed by regulation in each country for abnormally trying  conditions.This is not the practice in this country  but there seems noreason to object to it.     Article 8 allows &quot;elasticity&quot; for  cases of accident or dangeror of urgent work to be done  to machinery plant or equipment  sofar as necessary to avoid serious interference with  the ordinaryworking of the mine.     The second part of this  Article is not so wide  as thecorresponding proviso in our  own legislation which is not limited to work to be done to machinery plant or equipment,but covers &quot;any emergency or  work uncompleted through- un-foreseen circumstances which  requires to  be dealt withwithout interruption in order to avoid serious interferencewith ordinary work in the mine or in any  district  of the mine&quot;.    This is a very important proviso in our  legislation,particularly In reference to  machine mining (which we do not wish to discourage or hamper  unnecessarily).    At the sametime there are many complaints that undue advantage  of itis being taken, and it is quite possible  that official re-presentations will be received in due course from the miners federation that our proviso should be made less wide inIts terms.    It may be difficult therefore for the  BritishGovernment to take the initiative in asking for an amendment  ofthis article, but the ratification of the Convention withthis Article as it now stands would involve an alteration,of a serious and difficult kind, in our existing law on thissubject.     Article 9(a) is completely unsatisfactory.    It proposesto allow longer hours up to one hour per day for certainclasses of workmen, but It imposes an overriding limit of50 hours per year and does not adequately define the classes.
^ 3 9  c o What  we  want here is something corresponding with the proviso to Section 1(7) of our Act of 1908, permitting longer maximum hours for certain defined classes of workmen;.      Article 9(b) allows  an extension of one hour1 per day or one shift per week and 75 hours per year in order to meet exceptional  economic requirements.    In other words it allows pits  to  work purely economic overtime up to a maximum of 75 hours per year.     The attitude of the British Government hitherto has been that it is not  in favour of any such allowance for economic overtime.    vie have however got a similar provision in Section 3 of our 1908  Act (up  to 60 hours a year) and this is a  point which could ultimately be conceded so long as there. is attached  to it the condition,  which at present follows it, providing for payment of  time and a quarter for such overtime,      Articles.10, 11, 12, 13 and  14 are formal and unobjection- able .      Article  15  is  important because it suspends the operation of the Convention until certain named countries have ratified it.    It  is  essential to the adoption of the Convention by any country  that  its  main competitors should also have adopted. It, and in principle  the British Government will presumably support this Article.     Questions may arise as to which countries shall be named in  the Article ,  including the question of includ.ing one or more non-Suropean  country.    For reasons stated above the British  Government will presumably favour the naming of European countries  only,  (including in particular Germany and Poland)  even  though the British owners take  a contrary view.      There remains  a  further question and that is whether the Convention,  if ad.opted more or  less  on the  lines just  examined,would be in  compliance with the Washington  Convention.      This question  is  raised in the  following note  which has  beenprepared, by the Ministry  of Labour  and the Mines Department jointly.                          ,  6-. -
        COAL MINES AND THE WASHING-TON CONVENTION.Memorandum by the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Mine a.          The Washington Hours Convention regulates the hours of     individual workmen, and the proposed Draft Convention on hours     of work in coal mines lays down in principle that the time     spent in the mine is the individual workman&apos;s time from bank     to bank.          The Draft Convention, however, provides equivalents for     this method of calculation, and the equivalent suggested to     meet British practice Is to add together the uniform &quot;coal-     winding&quot; period as fixed by statute and the weighted average     of the varying times that men are underground on account of     man-winding, taken over the whole country.    This average may     be taken for present purposes as half an hour.    The individual     bank to bank time proposed by the Draft Convention is 7-f hours.     Translated into terms of British legislation, this means a     statutory &quot; coal -winding&apos;1 period of 7-t hours plus the authorised     man-winding t ime s.          It will be seen that the convention proposes to regulate     the hours not of the individual workman, but of the average     workmen.    There is no warrant In the Washington Convention     for setting off the longer hours of one workman in a shift     against the shorter hours of another.    Still less is there     warrant for setting off the  longer hours of one pit or one     shift against the shorter hours of another pit or another shift.     But both these principles are involved in making use of the     average man-winding time over the whole country in applying     the prescribed maximum hours.          The average period spent underground on account of man-     winding being half an hour,  it is obvious that at a considerable     number of pits it exceeds this figure, and in fact there is a                              7.
 considerable number of important pits at which that period is 45 minutes or more.    It is also a fact that though on any given shift  the  average period for which men are underground on account of winding the shift down and up again is equal to the period of one winding only, it is permissible within the terms of our law for  any  individual man to be the first down and the last up, and therefore  to be underground for the period 0f both windings. On a shift therefore with a man-winding time each way of, say, one hour,  a statutory coal-winding time of  7-1 hours would allow individual men to be underground for the 7-J hours plus 2 hours, or 9^:  hours on any day in the week.     The  Washington Convention permits the deduction of specified mealtimes, and, if in the  instance  given a deduction of 15 or 20 minutes were made on this account, the daily hours would not exceed the daily maximum of 9 hours which Washington permits.     There are, however,  a certain  number of pits with shifts on which the man-winding time Is  as much as 75 minutes each way. In such  cases  not even the deduction of mealtime would bring the daily  maximum  for individual men  -within the Washington 9 hours.     And there  still remains the  Washington weekly maximum of 48 hours.    It is  true  in a number of cases that short  Saturday shifts or  alternate idle  Saturdays  will in practice reduce the hours  that  any  man  could, be  below ground during any week or fortnight,  but  it  cannot be  said  with certainty that  this  would in all cases prevent  Individual men from being belowground for more than 48 hours per week or  96  hours  per fortnight.    Itmust also  be borne  in mind that the  short  Saturday shift  or thealternate  idle  Saturday, where it exists,  is  only custom andnot law.     The conclusion therefore is  that,  after  account  has beentafeen  of all relevant considerations,  there will  be a  substantial number of  cases  in  which under our  law,  as  proposed by the  Mines Convention, individual workmen can  be belowground  for a period                         &apos;  &apos; 8. :&apos;
in excess of that prescribed byWashington .As a matter of  strict law,  it  would seem that  no new convention on coal mines can amend theWashington hours convention.On the other hand it is quite clear  that thetermsof the Washington Convention,strictly applied.not approprplate t o mining.The time taken in getting toand from the working place,  for  instance,  is  very different from anything which Washington appears  to  have  had in mind.    It may be presumed, however,  that any  Convention on coalmines adopted by the International  labour  Conference will beadopted, on the understanding  that it Is in harmony with theWashington Convention.    The avowed intention, indeed, has  been to provide more favourable conditions than those of Washington-It should not therefore be difficult to secure  the insertion in the preamble- to the new Convention of a reference on theselines to the Washington Convention.     In  these circumstances,even if the letter of the law be  infringed, it  would seem that aGovernment that ratified, both Conventions  and organised the  hoursof work in its coal mines on  the  basis  of  the new Convention,would, for practical purposes  run  no risk of challenge from anyother State.    Accordingly  the  British Government delegates mightsafely be given Instructions  that they  might  vote for aConvention on hours of work  in  coal mines  that  was otherwiseacceptable provided that it  was made perfectly  clear by words in the Convention Itself that the Convention is to be- regardedas being in conformity with  Washington.     From the same point of  view, i.e.  that of  the ratification by Great Britain of the Washington  Hours Convention , itseems desirable that the delegates  should  have  Instructionsupon the action to be taken  in  the  event of failure to obtain agreement on any figure for  hours in coal  mines.    It is
9 fl 9suggested that in such an event the delegates should press for the adoption of a Convention containing an interpretation of the Washington requirements in relation to coal mines.This would include all the points upon Which agreement couldbe reached, but would clearly be without value to us ifit did not mention the method of calculation already described3rd June , 1950.
