DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEPJWENT.                                                COPY NO.   &amp;_ (30)                              CABINET,                             THE TRADE OUTLOOK.             Memorandum &quot;by the President of the  Board of Trade.            The general tone of  the reports was,  as was not unexpected       unsatisfactory.    The coal output figures for the first four       months of the year show moderate declines,  and there was no       prospect of improvement before the Autumn,            Tendencies  in the iron and steel trade were distinctly       werse in view of the marked paucity  of orders for new ships       and in the engineering trade.    As regards  shipbuilding, it       was stated that  50 per cent of the  firms  in the Shipbuilding       Employers&apos; Federation did not receive a single order throughout       the March quarter.    This position was due, of course,  to the       marked slump in  the tonnage market.    The latest figures of       tonnage laid up  in the United Kingdom ports was given as       892,000 tons dead weight  on the 1st  April last as compared       with 836,000 tons only on the 1st April,  1929.   The opinion       was expressed that one important cause was  the harvesting of       bumper crops in  Europe last year occasioning a greatly       diminished need  for imported supplies.    A slight increase was       registered in the freight index for  April as compared with       March though it  appears that this may be  due to fortuitous       increases rather than to  any general strengthening  of the       market.            The cotton  trade appeared to be in the worst position.       It had, it was reported,  been so badly affected by  the  falling       off of orders from India  and nearly  everywhere else that  there       was not in view work for  more than half the machine capacity       of the industry.   The trade in the  finest counts of cotton,
180-220, was described as dead,  or not more than  5 per  cent of the normal.    The woollen situation was, of course,  over-*shadowed by the dispute,  though here the increase in the  pricesof the raw material gave some ground for good recovery  when  thedispute is settled.     The unemployment figures continue to reflect the depressionin the chief industries of the country, and the percentages  ofunemployed in the more important industries have  risen  in somecases to the neighbourhood of 30 per cent (steel  30.9 per cent,cotton 30.7 per cent and shipbuilding and repairing  27.5  percent) .     As regards the trend of world prices for raw material,  raw cotton seems to have reached what was described as  a safe pointso that there was some ground for expectation that  stocks would again begin to be built up.   In the Indian trades  the discrepancy between the export prices, that is of raw materials,and the import prices, that is of manufactured goods, which hadbeen reduced to zero for a brief time in August,  1929,  had nowreappeared owing to a further fall of the  raw material  prices and amounted to 13 points.     In the wheat market it would appear that supplies  arestill plentiful and that the attempts in America to preventthe movement of stocks at competitive prices are failing.   Itras stated that Russia wants to send us this season some.,000,000 tons of their new crop while supplies from India and australia are likely to be abundant.     The Co-operative representatives reported for the first time for some months an actual falling off in the values of theisales as compared with a year ago due to the falling prices ingrocery and provisions.      In the big stores the results of April trading had been disappointing,,but the comparison  is with the  good trade of                              -2-
April, 1929.    Signs of expansion have,  however,  recentlyappeared.     It may he mentioned that the importation of foreign goodswas &quot;blamed in certain cases for the depression of the home industry, for example, in the case of hosiery and of steelbars for the South \7ales Tinplate industry,  while it was reported that machinery imports had increased though exportshad declined.     Special attention was called to the Chilean plan for what may be called the rationalisation of the nitrate industrywhereby all the existing companies, over 100 in number, areexpected to come into one scheme with the Government as a50 per cent, partner, the consideration of this transfer tothe Government being the abolition of the export duty.   Thisscheme is expected to enable the natural nitrate industry  to compete again with the synthetic product;                                     T7.G.Board of Trade,   29 th May,  1930;

MEETING OF THE BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY, COUNCIL.Wednesda y^^l 4th JMayi L 1930.     PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE:   Gentlemen, I should like to give a welcome in your name and ray own to Sir JamesLithgow who is not a new member of the Council, but rejoinsour ranks, and whose services I am sure every member of theCouncil will very cordially welcome.                         MONEY MARKET;.     LORD BRADBURY:  The Budget brought a check to the boomin the gilt edged stock markets and a lull in business bothin the Stock Exchange and the Bill Market.  There was also anoticeable weakening in the exchanges.  Bill Rates remainedfairly steady at about 2.\% but money became very easy towardsthe end of April no doubt partly as a result of an influx ofgold that had increased the BankJs holding last week to 163,000,000,   Still the Market felt that the weakness of theexchanges was a sufficient reason for not expecting animmediate further fall in Bank Rate.     Nevertheless on the 1st May the Bank Rate was unexpectedlyreduced to 3i(*  It was soon apparent that this was part of a concerted movement by the principal Central Banks to reducethe international level of money rates by h%f and our positionrelative to other countries lias not altered.     The reduction in the Bank Rate was followed by aprecipitate fall in discount rates that has again, at anyrate for the moment, produced a situation common duringthe past few months - a gap between official and unofficialrates so wide that the Bank Rats is completely out of touchwith the real state of money in the London Market.     If this state of affairs turns out to be more thanmomentary an even further fall in Bank Rate might normally be looked for, but there are other considerations to take into account, In particular the weakness of the exchanges.It again remains to be seen whether events will make for a lowering of Bank Rate in accordance with Market tendencies ora gradual strengthening of bill rates until they are more in keeping with the present Bank Rate,  Events in Wall Streetduring the past few &amp;a.ys seem to indicate that the danger of another boom there lias now disappeared and with it thenecessity for keeping our money rates here on the defensiveagainst a renewed speculative drift of funds to America.                        MOTOR INDUSTRY.     SIR WILLIAM MORRIS:    Little change can be seen ingeneral conditions as compared with the April account.     Generally speaking, production is probably not equal tothat of the corresponding period of 19.29.     Commercial vehicle output is still in excess of 1929,and the demand for trucks up to 50 cwt. continues to expand.That business,  the commercial side, appears to be goingforward much faster than the pleasure vehicle.
    . Export  probably  shews some  slight reduction, particularly in Australia and India.  Stocks  abroad are not unduly heavy, and improved conditions  should quickly be reflected in increased demand.     American importers  all over the world hold dangerously high stocks-.  Import  figures have been materially affected by Budget uncertainties, but Importers of many cars hold what are still probably excessive stocks, that is, of imported cars.     Employment appears  slightly better, but is not equal to the seasonal average, and will probably fall during the next few months *     There has undoubtedly been  a considerable falling-off in the demand for the more  expensive type of cars.     Bankruptcies among  dealers  shew growing increases, and failures are at least 3$% greater in number and value comparedwith last year.     The latest unemployment figures unfortunately shew a rise.                           CHEMICALS.     MR. HILL:   Trade in the ohemical industry has been extremely quiet, nor does there  seem to be any promise of Improvement  - in fact rather the reverse, the consuming industries,  particularly textiles, being in a similar state of depression.     In only one branch  is there a report of a more favourablecharacter, namely in the production of dyestuffs.  The total production of all classes of dyes amounted to 24,900 tons during 1929,  an Increase of nearly 10 per cent. on 1923,41 per cent, on 1927, and 67 per cent on 1924.  The increases on 1928 were shown in all dyes exempt&quot; acid wool colours, inwhich a slight decrease was reported.     As regards the Fine Chemical Industry, Export Trade, which as I reported last  month showed some Improvement,has now suffered a setback.  In  this connection especialmention must be made  of  South America.   In this market the returns for  drugs and fine chemicals for the first four months of 1930 show a heavy decrease over the corresponding period of 1929,   Conditions remain distinctly depressed, and,although optimism is felt in some&apos; quarters, there is -little indication of any improvement in the immediate future.  InBrazil business is quiet, owing  to the difficult positionof coffee, and traders are experiencing considerable difficulty in obtaining  payment  of their accounts.  Theseremarks apply,  also,  to  Colombia, where the trading conditions are critical  and difficult, chiefly owing to the political situation arising from the Presidential elections and the low  price of coffee.  Here, again, the financial situation is unsatisfactory in that traders find difficulty in collecting their debts.  In Chile business appears to beaffected by  the Ifitrate  position, which shows no signs of improvement.  Trading in Bolivia Is slow and is dependent to some extent  on the price of tin, which is at present very low.     In India the drug and fine  ohemical trade has receivedrather a nasty blow in the boycott of all British drugs and
chemicals by the Indian Medical Association.  This accordingto the statements in India, has no connection with thepolitical situation generally, nor is it part of. the threatened general&apos; boycott but is specific to drugs and chemicals as a retort to the action of the General MedicalCouncil in withdrawing recognition of Indian medical degrees.Traders are holding off and not sending orders and some orders which have been sent have been cancelled, or, as they term it,postponed, which is a euphemism,  The only hope we have isthat the situation is only temporary but it is already a monthold and even so it is quite serious because our Germancompetitors who are on the spot and always very keencompetitors are reaping the benefit and only yesterday we hadnews of the Germans getting very busy and once they get inagain it will be very difxicult to get them out.  I waswondering whether any action could be taken about that.  We are doing all we can,     PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OP TRADE:  I remember reading ofthe action of the General Medical Council here which I thinkinvolved non-recognition of Indian medical degrees.     MR. HILL:   That is so.  The General Medical Council have withdrawn their recognition.  It is a very stupid reply forthem to make but nevertheless I suppose it is the onlyweapon they have got and they have used it.     PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE:   I will look at thatwhen we get a summary of this morning&apos;s proceedings.     ALDERMAN TITTERINGTON:  I would like to ask the speakerif the additional 10^ increase in production in the dye-waresection is attributable &quot;to a demand from the home market orwhether there has been an increased demand in bulk dye-wares orwhether it is because of the growing variety of dye-wares?     MR. HILL:   I should think all three, Sir, so far as I know.It is the total producoion which is up.  The export is up and home consumption of course Is also up.  Increases over 1928were shown in all dyes except acid wool colours in which therewas a slight decrease and it is chiefly in the more expensivedyes.     (At this point the President withdrew and Mr.Gillett                        took the Chair).                          MONEY MARKET.     SIR GUY GRAhET:  I had a report but it covers exactly the same ground as the report made by Lord Bradbury.  I willhand it in.&apos;&quot;&apos;                         IRON AND STEEL.     MR. WALMSLEY:  May I first mention what appears to be aclerical error in the Report of the Proceedings ox last time.In the Report by Mr. Pugh he referred to a steel contract which had been secured in Shanghai and a tonnage of 12,000 tons was mentioned.  It should be 1,200 tons, not 12,000.* See Appendix p.
     MR. GIL-LETT:  Wa will  take note of  that.     MR. W ALMS LEY:  Again,  referring to  wr. Pugh&apos;s Reporthe mentioned a  steel contract for India  in connection withdredging which would require about 10,000 tons..  I am sorry to say a very large percentage of that would be rolled inIndia and not in British mills.     The immediate outlook  for the iron  and steel industryin this country is almost one of unrelieved gloom.  It is going from bad to worse.  The position is rather different from what it has been on some previous occasions, because this time we are suffering as part of a general world depressionand not as a unit.   On certain other occasions when theContinent has been busy and we have been quiet there has beenhope that we may get some of the surplus which the Continentis not able to take and give prompt delivery of, but that isnot the position to-day.  1929 was a year of greater activitythan for many years past mainly due to an improvement in shipbuilding and to this activity on the Continent whichwas reflected here,  Neither of those factors operates at themoment,  A recent Report of the Shipbuilding Employers&apos;Federation states that the  March quarter has been one of the worst experienced for several years in   regard to orders for new ships and that &quot;the orders returns of the ShipbuildingEmployers&apos; Federation show  that 69 per cent, of the shipbuilding firms did not  receive a single order during january, 84 per cent did not get an order in February, 80per cent, did not obtain an order in March, and 50 per cent.of the firms did not receive a single order throughout thewhole of the quarter&apos;.  The reaction of  this position on the steel industry is obvious.     With regard  go the Continent, production began to outrundemand in the latter months of last year, and as fromDeoember 1st 1929 the International Steel Cartel decided on a reduction of 10 per cent, of the October output on thepart of the member countries (Germany, Belgium, France,Luxemburg and the Saar).  Evidently the  manufacturers didnot comply exactly with the instructions to reduce 10 percent, and they risked over-production and the consequentfine on over-production and they have very much over-estimated the demand with the result  that stocks have increased and now many makers on the Continent have had to close downcertain departments of their v/orks and further restrictionis contemplated.  There is  no doubt ti.at the April productionof pig iron and steel on the Continent will be much lower thanin any month in the first quarter of the year.  In the case ofour own country pig iron production which is not affected byholidays at all, being a continuous production, fell fromo65,8^0 tons in March to 619,600 tons In April, which represents a reduction in the daily rate of about 4 per cent.There was a reduction in the number of blast furnaces inoperation during  the month  of six (from  157 to 151), so that production will show a still further decline in May.  Thenumber of blast furnaces now in operation is less than at anytime since the end of torch 1929 when 145 were in blast.  Thenumber gradually increased  to 170 at the end of August and since then there has been a steady decline.     Steel production of course was affected by the easter Holidays and the total fell from  326,100 tons in
March, to 696,100 tori3 in April.   Imports of iron and steel in April were 234,800 tons as compared with. 280,900 tonsin March.   Imports would doubtless have been higher butfor the Easter  Holidays.   Exports of iron and steelamounted to 268,000 tons as compared with 337,700 tons inMarch and 539,800 tons in April last year.   Exports werelower than in any month since February, 1927.     A report from the North East Coast district statesthat the position generally is most depressing and theoutlook very uncertain.   There is ,as yet no sign of ageneral expansion of business and the volume of enquiry is very slow.   Consumers are only specifying to meetimmediate needs:  there is no prospect of immediateimprovement In foreign trade although the Canadian marketshows signs of promise.   New work for shipyards is veryscarce and little new business Is developing from theconstruction engineers.     In the North East Coast I might mention that furtherfurnaces have gone out of blast or are going out of blastat the moment, furnaces making hematite.   The hematite&apos;position has been getting steadily worse.   Stocks are increasing and it was only a few days ago, I believe, thatthe makers generally decided on a drastic curtailment of output.     The steel Industry in Scotland has during the past few weeks been passing through a period of great difficulty and uncertainty and only spasmodic rolling has been doneby several of the mills.   I think the position is a little better just at the moment, but there is still a feeling ofgreat anxiety.     The failure of the Clyde Shipbuilding Yards to obtainany orders of consequence recently has contributedmaterially to the pessimistic views put forward.   Thereis very little in front of the Clyde steelmakers so faras can be seen.     In South Wales the position has not improved at all.Several of the steel plants are entirely closed down,partly due to lack of demand for tinplates and sheets andpartly due to increased consumption of Imported sheetbars which can be bought to-day at something like 20/-per ton less than the British article delivered in SouthWales.   That of course means that the steel furnaces areclosed down which will reduce the consumption of pig ironand reduce the consumption of ferro-manganese, coal,coke and mean a reduction  in labour.     The export trade has been extremely difficult and theprices are very weak.   There is a great scramble among allthe European steel making countries and ourselves for anyexport work that Is going.   Unfortunately it is a diminishing quantity partly owing to the world demand, partly owing to the increase in production in certain countrieswhich formerly bought all their supplies from us.  The onlyorder of Importance which has been secured by this countryrecently is one for some rails for the Union of South Africa,which represents a tonnage of between 40 and 50,000, butthe price Is a very unremunerative one.     Of course the disturbances in India are having a reflection here on the steel trade where there is a
very large export of sheet, galvanised and otherwise,  andthat accounts to some extent for the tad position inSouth Wales.                         EMPLOYMENT.     MR. PHILLIPS:  In the early part of April therewas some decrease In the unemployment figures, hut fromEaster onwards the state of employment again continued toget worse.   The total at the end of April was 21,000higher than at the end of March and on 6th May there wasa further increase of 13,000 making a total of 1,712,000.This Increase Is not to he accounted for by the effect ofthe New Unemployment Insurance Act.  Indeed the figures are rather worse than they appear, because it is estimatedthat there was a drop of about 5,000 in the number to  be attributed to that Act.   On the other hand, at this timeof the year there was, as usual, a temporary Increaseowing to children leaving school at Easter and takingsome time to be absorbed.     In London and the South of England generally thetotal remained fairly stable during April and there was some improvement in the first week of May,   In Scotlandand Wales there was a net improvement in April and a falling off in the first week of May, but the Improvement inScotland was largely due to the clearance from the register of persons who had come on owing to the new Act.   TheMidlands and North of England showed heavy increases inApril and in Lancashire there was another marked increaseof 15,000 in the first week of May.     As regards particular industries, comparing 28th Aprilwith 24th May, coal went up from 14.5 to 16,6: pig iron  -  -from 1360 to 17.8: steel from 26.1 to 30.9: general engineering from 13.3 to 14.7: shipbuilding and shiprepairing from 27,3 to 27,6 and cotton from 27,1 to 30.7.This means an increase, I am afraid, all along the line inthe larger industries.     I will hand In the usual table of insured personsin employment and this month there is an unusual factor,a considerable number of persons out of work being directly involved In trade disputes, the number is estimated at about53,000 and of course nearly all of them are in the woolIndustry. 31                           SHIPPING.     SIR E. GLOVER:  With regard to shipping I am sorry to say ther* Is no Improvement.   The freight Index numberprepared by the Chamber of Shipping does show an advance of1% on March, being now about 83$ of the 1913 value.   Sofar as I am concerned it is difficult to understand howthat is arrived at as there has been no general upward movement in freights.     In regard to the Argentine, homeward rates did advancerather sharply about the middle of April owing to astevedores1 strike causing a scarcity of prompt tonnage.This advance In the Argentine was countered by a correspondingdrop in outward freights, since which the homeward markethas completely collapsed and. is worse than ill was at thebeginning of April.x See Appendix&apos;p. 34.
I O &amp;     With regard to the Brazils and Argentine,  the tiomeward&apos;shipments of cereals from the Argentine appear  for thefirst quarter of the year at 2i million tons as against3,600,000 for the same period in 1929.   In perusingArgentine statistics it is interesting to note  theexport for the first quarter of 1930 of approximately500,000 hides and skins to Germany as against only40,000 to this country.   General cargo business outwardshas been on a reduced scale owing to lack of demand  andadverse exchange.   Orders for constructional iron work,etc; are reported to be going to the Continent in preference to the United Kingdom,     The St. Lawrence has commenced, business, but onlyon a level much below the cost of the voyage.   Therehas been some activity in shipments of sugar from Cubabut at steadily falling rates of freight.     In India the general trade conditions and thepolitical situation have contributed to an unsatisfactoryposition both in regard to outward and homeward business.There Is a marked decline in shipments to India andhomewards many ships are leaving with part cargoes.    this position has been aggravated during the last week bystrikes of coolies in Burma.     East Africa is importing normally but there is insufficient cargo for vessels loading for Europe owing toabsence of demand.     In South Africa outward shipments have fallen  offlargely as a result of reduced buying capacity owing tothe drop In price of wool and other South Africancommodities.     Australia is suffering from the financial difficulty.Outward cargo is scarce owing to increased Import duties and homeward rates are much below voyage cost.     With regard to cereals, the explanation to a verylarge extent of the absence of demand for tonnage isthe bumper crops of Europe last year.   I am told that inbreadstuffs, that is to say wheat, flour and rye, the worldshipments from 1st August last to 30th April are 32  millionquarters less than In the previous year, that is equal to1,000 voyages of a 7,000 ton steamer.   With regard tofeeding stuffs, It was recently stated at the Millers&apos;and Bakers&apos; Annual Meeting that Europe last year had produced 45 million quarters more than the average.     Shipbuilding records show that tonnage under con-struction, tonnage launched and tonnage commenced in thefirst quarter of 1930 are all in excess of the sameperiod in 1929.   Prom all I hear, with the exception ofyards building tankers or liners, work Is generallycoming to an end and during the month of April the onlyorders placed were for two liners, one tanker and onecr&quot;&apos;ss-channel railway boat.     With regard to coals, exports remain about  theeame.   For April bunkers showed a reduction of  aboutlofo.   It is interesting to note how Russia Is forcing
herself Into this trade.   Steamers have &quot;been charteredfrom Mariopol In the Azoff&quot; f or anthracite to Rouen at12s/9d. against a freight from Wales of under 4/T-,   The same rate is paid to Canada or America whilst there is an enquiryat present from Mariopol to Vancouver for anthracite.     In regard to laid up tonnage, according to themost recent figures published by the &quot;Green List&quot;, therewere over 800 steamers of 4^ million tons laid up.   TheChamber of Shipping figure is approx^aaJbeiy 2% million for600 ships.   The difference is probably explained by someforeign ships having escaped the notice of the Chamber.     I will hand in the usual statistics,*                       AUSTRALIAN TRADE,     MR. SANDERSONS  During the past week or is, Australiahas benefited very considerably by some good falls ofrain.    Coming at this time of year they are particularlyvaluable, although It is a lit tit lute, &quot;but the pastoraland agricultural areas have benefited, not to the efullest extent one could hope, but, still, quite sufficiently togive considerable relief to the anxiety about feeding stockand the cultivation of wheat,   Jt looks at the moment asIf the area for wheat cultivation would be considerably increased,                                         .     Wool - the number of bales received into store- from 1st July&apos; to 30th April last was 2,463,283, of which1,719,333 have been sold, and 36,457 shipped for saleoverseas;   Ckatrpetitlon thr-oughout the April sales has been.more general; the Continent, Yorkshire, Japan, and theUnited States have al3L  been buying freely.   Pricesrealised ten per cent, higher than the March sales.   Youwill understand that that is quite an importantr factor inthe Australian position.     Wheat - the exports of wheat.this season compared withlast are 24,517,850 bushels as against 62,716,320 bushels.That Is due to the bad season of last year.     Flour - the exports of flour are 183,050 tons ascompared with 254,600 tons last season.     Trade - for the nine months ended March, the imports were  107,142,000 and the exports  97,925,000; a decreaseof  1,326,000 in imports and  17,571,000 in exports.The Customs revenue shows a deorease of  644,750 for Aprilcompared with last year; but an increase of  2,^8,000for the ten months which indicates that the effect of therecent increases of tariff is being shown in the revenue.     Finance - There is a deorease of  108,886,000 forthe four months ending 30th April in the Bank Clearancesin all State capitals,                                 .1,1   ....      .....-        &apos;^                                                             *              h 6ee Appendix p. 31.
      A Swedish Match Company is arranging  to  erect a factory in Australia for the manufacture of safety matches.                           HOSIERY.      MR.  WALKER:  As regards the hosiery trade, I am afraid I  have not very much better  news than  before.  The industry is undoubtedly depressed.   The cold and wet Spring has had an adverse effect and,  curiously enough, the Chancellor&apos;s statement with regard  to  the  silk duties has not had the effect upon the trade that one anticipated.  It has benefited trade, but not as much as would have been expected.      The  reports from the districts are as follows:- Leicester - Demand generally is quiet  and  there is no change to report in any section of the trade.   Orders are coming through in very small quantities and there is little forward ordering in bulk.    The withdrawal of the Chancellor&apos;s threat to remove the silk duties has restored some confidence, but the trade has  suffered severely through the uncertainty of the position during the past few months.   Some knitted outerwear manufacturers are experiencing a good demand for light weight tweed effects which are  now very popular,  and with the advent of good summer weather outerwear manufacturers should be well employed,  as there is every indication of  an  increased demand for knitted suits.    Light green, lemon, and blue fabrics are very popular and look like having a good run. Nottingham reports somewhat  similarly.   The  Chancellor&apos;s statement  with regard to the silk duties has  benefited those sections of the  trade concerned.   Business has commenced to increase although it  does not  yet reach those dimensions Which are  so much desired.    In the wool hose section, business is quiet as is  only to be  expected at this time of the  year,  and the half-hose  section remains normal.    As regards the underwear section,  indications point to retail stocks being low and should  the weather improve between now and  Whitsuntide,  it  would  very materially benefit business. The  demand for bathing costumes  continues  to be good,  fancy styles being particularly  popular.   Export trade is at the present time quiet, but  it is expected that when world conditions  become  more settled, a fair amount of business may be expected. Mansfield  - The  state  of trade in this district is no  better except perhaps in the  case of full-fashioned silk hose, where  the Budget  statement seems to have had the effect  of temporarily stimulating  orders.   This has  not been the  case, however, in seamless  artificial silks and  pure silks,  where the  trade,  particularly  as regards the fine gauge, is absolutely  stagnant;   in fact, this may be  said of almost  all departments  of the different firms in this  district.    Even the  fashioned fancy hose and half hose trade which has alwaysbeen good  is now  complaining.Hawick report that there is still no improvement in the hosiery trade and  the prospects of trade improving during the next month or  two are far from encouraging.Loughborough report that trade in their district is  very bad,definitely worse than a year ago, all branches of the  tradebeing  on short time.   The reason given for the very bad state of trade is  the heavy importation of  foreign goods.
     In fact, the trade generally is undoubtedly in adepressed condition and there is not much sign of improvement.                     SOUTH AMERICAN.TRADE..     MR. HOSE:   During the past month,  an event of outstandingimportance has occurred affecting Chile  v/hich may he very interesting to those who deal with South America.   The nitrateposition has heen in a parlous state for some time, hut nowthere is being drawn up a scheme for the formation of a company with the direct co-operation of the Chilean Government.   this company is to have a capital of  75,000,000 and is expected toinclude a consolidation of all producers of nitrate of soda inChile.   The Chilean Government will forego all the duty on the fertiliser, having half of the capital in the company and,naturally,  draw half the profits.   This is expected to enablethe naturax nitrate to compete quite easily with the syntheticnitrate and consequently revive the industry.   The remarkablepart of the plan is that here was an industry that was represented by some one hundred and ten  producers who, owing tothe course of trade, have been compelled to come in under one hat.   It is obvious it is a very interesting project andit is &apos;salvation&apos; for a great many of the companies and,possibly, for the Banks to whom those companies owe money.     The capital of the company,  75,000,000 sterling, doesnot represent that amount in new money,  or anything like it.The Chilean Government will take over each company at a propervaluation of their assets;  they will take over their assets and liabilities and give their shareholders such a sum in thenew company as may be mutually agreed.   You will quiteunderstand that the taking over of all this industry doesinvolve an enormous capital, especially  as the Governmentis to have half of the whole capital which really representsnothing existing at present except the surrender of theduties.   I do not say it is not worth the money, but theactual assets that they will take over will represent 37,500,000.   It may be interesting to  know that a verylarge proportion of that will go to a certain American firmwho have gradually accumulated very large interests in thenitrate industry.     MR. GILLETT:  Will that swallow up  a number of firmswhose names have been very well known in the nitrate trade?Does it take them all in?     MR. HOSE:  A firm in New York whom  you know very wellin regard to nitrate will have certainly a two-thirds orthree-quarters interest in that part of  the shares whichgoes to the holders of shares in nitrate companies.   in short, the interest in nitrate companies is passing over to america.     MR. GILLETT:  Would the Chilean Government then berepresented on the Board in proportion to its holdings?
      MR.  HOSE:  The  Government will have two representatives out  of  five on  the Board of the new company.   I rather suspect that, in  some way or other, they will have a majority  vote.    So  far as I can see all the companies must come into the arrangement because anybody who does not come in goes on paying the  2.12.6d duty for the exportation of the  nitrate.      MR.  H.W. LEE: /Will the Government capital be watered?      MR.  HOSE:  It is rather difficult to say that. I rather  imagine  it  will be watered, except that, in lieu of the   5,000,000 which they at present get from the duties, they are  going  to take  37,000,000 of capital and take their chance of getting a dividend on it.      MR.  H.THT. LEEs   It is watered capital, of course.      MR.  HOSE:  If you like to put it that way, I shall not  object.      In the Argentine things are not good.   Crops have been very poor  comparatively and the value of the crops has fallen  per ton, so that, on the whole, the position is a very difficult one.   The exchange has responded to that condition by falling to a discount of rather over ten per cent.      There is very little to say about Uruguay except that they have had a loan of ten million dollars.   It seems to be becoming quite a  habit of all the South American countries  to borrow  ten million dollars at least very regularly in Hew York and I am afraid they are getting now to the  stage v/hen the total of their borrowings becomes so big  that,  whilst you cannot visualise the situation of their being unable to maintain the service, if they go on like  this  for a few more years,  there may possibly be some difficulty.      In Brazil we have had a very inspiring change after the  depression which has continued and increased year by year, in  the provision of  17,000,000 to carry the coffee surplus.   The  scheme seems to be a good one because they are not going to attempt to dispose of the existing stocks of coffee  except by reasonable annual instalments and, as the present crop is estimated to amount to something less than  the  average,  it is expected that, at all events for this year, it will be quite easy to sell the 1,600,000 bagswhich has  to come out of existing stocks.   One has the impression that there is going to be a little era of relief for Brazil, which will be extremely welcome.   Of course, the money utilised in that way will relieve the generalpressure  on trade and the difficulties from which all tradeshave been  suffering for several  years.     In other countries there is nothing-striking to report.     I have a few notes about them;^ but will notweary you by reading them.Mr. Hose&apos;s written report will be found in the               Appendix p. 37.
COTTON .     SIR KENNETH STEWART S  I have not much to say about the  cotton trade during April, because there Is very little trade  indeed.   There was a little bit of a spurt at the end  of March, but that fell away during April and during April orders have fallen off from every export country.   A great deal of the depression that exists is undoubtedly due to the situation in India.   At first there wears few fresh orders, but  latterly there have been a number of rather serious cancellations of orders already placed.     Really there is very little else to say about the cotton trade because it is chiefly absent.     MR. GILLETT:  The Indian position is largely political, I suppose?     SIR KKKNETH STEWART:  Yes;  largely political.     MR. LENNOX LEE:  I have nothing to add.   I will hand in my  statement.s                       GENERAL TRADE. .     SIR JAMES LITHGOW:  I really cannot enlarge upon whatwas  said about the retail trade.   The general situation is one of great gloom.   In the trade which I represent,we are threatened with a general collapse.   I think wemay  look back on last year as a year of prosperity, but that for  a  considerable time to come we may look forward to a general slowing down of orders.   Generally speaking, I takea very pessimistic view of the immediate outlook.                          COTTON.     MR. H.W.  LEE:  I have nothing to add to whatSir Kenneth Stewart has said.   There is no doubt that at the present time in the cotton textile trade there isan almost unprecedented want of demand.    Sir Kenneth hasmentioned India, but it is not only India;  it applies to every section of the trade.    I think to-day the fine tradeis even in a worse condition than the coarse trade.  Thereare not more than sufficient orders coming in to keepforty-five - fifty per cent, of the machinery at work.There may be an alteration in that position at any time,of course.   One of the reasons for that, I think, is the uncertainty as to the price of the raw material.   Younever do good trade if raw material prices are *coming down,or if there is any idea that they may come down.   Personallyit seems to me that the value of raw material is practicallynow at the stable point;  if we have it gradually going upI think it is possible more trade would come to hand.  Thereis no question that at the present time  the textile trade isdeplorable.    In the forty-five years that I have been inthe trade I have - never seen anything to equal the presentsituation.See Appendix p. 27.
     MR. DEN TURNER:   You say that  the  fine  counts areas bad as the coarse  counts?     MR. H.W. LEE:  The superfine counts when you getup to 160s, 180s, 200s and 220s, are practically dead,absolutely dead.   If you take my own firm;  where weused to send out 100,000 of those numbers, we are nownot sending out 5,000.   In the medium counts such as120s, 100s, 80s, they are not dead, but for the momentthey are almost at a standstill;  for those I should sayfifty per cent, of the orders are coming in.   Yourfavourite district, Yorkshire, is doing a little bit of damage too, owing&apos; to the stoppage there, but not verymuch because Yorkshire is losing its cotton trade.  TheUnions in Yorkshire will not conform even to the practice in Lancashire and the consequence is that the cotton trade will leave Yorkshire and what part of it we stillhold will he held by Lancashire.   There really does not seem any likelihood that Bradford, or Yorkshire, willadopt the Lancashire methods of weaving.   So that it doesnot affect us as much as it would have done if the stoppagehad occurred, say, 3ix or seven years ago.     MR. BEN TURNER:  I suppose the cotton warpbusiness is less because they are using more wool in thewarps now in Yorkshire than they used to do?     MR, H.W. LEE;  Yes.  I am not talking of Union goods.I mean more goods like poplin3 that were made ten yearsago around the Bradford district in quite considerable quantities.   That trade is all going to Colne andAccrington and the districts round there.     MR. WALKER:  Might I ask if this Cotton Week hasstimulated things at all?     MR. H.W. LEE:  Not at the producing end at the moment;there is always a considerable lag between the two and then,of course, the Cotton Week can only help us in the home trade.     MR. WALKER:  Of course, but do you think it has donegood?     MR. H.W. LEE:  Oh yes;  I think so, but it wantsfollowing up.   You must not stop simply at a Cotton Week;it has got to be a continuous policy going on right throughthe year.   Of course, we ought to attack the export tradeand I think we shall have to do that with a Buyers&apos;Exhibition in London;   I do not think we can do it in anyother way.                          ENGINEERING.     SIR Ei PETTER:  With regard to general engineering, I have been absent in India for the past six months and I am a little bit out of touch withthe situation here, but I must say I am very much alarmedat the change that has come over general engineeringduring the past six months.   The reports I havereceived do nothing to relieve the note of gloom wehave had this morning.   The unemployment situation
in the general engineering industry is  rapidly  gettingworse.  Since the beginning of the year it has  gone  up from ten per cent, to 14.7 per cent,  in April.    the exports of engineering machinery for the first  threemonths of the year show a marked decline of somethingbetween eight and ten -oer cent.  It was eight per cent.for the first three months of the year, but I am afraidthe figures for April will make it nearly ten per cent.At the same time, the imports of machinery show an almost identical increase, which is rather remarkable.     What is even more serious than the figures wehave available is that new orders are very scarce indeed.General engineering Is one of the principal exportingIndustries of the country and it is very greatly affectedby the situation In certain countries which are largecustomers, India and Australia.  Australia has  very  greatlycurtailed her purchases of engineering material  duringthe past two or three months and the increase in tariffswhich is still going on is going to make the position worse.The situation in the Argentine, both the financial and exchange position, makes trade difficult.   In  some countries in Eastern Europe, the same conditions obtain.I am very sorry, therefore, I can only say that theposition in general engineering does appear to  be verygloomy for the next two or three months, because thepresent shortage of orders will show itself more inthe next three months1 figures than in the last.                      INDIAN TRADE.     MR. LINDSAY:  In the motor trade,  the iron and  steel trade, shipping, and cotton piece goods, the general reportsfor India by previous speakers seem to be much  the same,that is to say, that trade with India has undoubtedlyfallen off very seriously indeed.  Certainly thepolitical condition has aggravated the situation, if ithas not originated It.  I am receiving a good manyenquiries from the Continent on one or two subjects  whiohI think might interest the Council.  The first  is inregard to the operation of the new preferential duties on cotton piece goods entering India and some alarmwas expressed by finishing firms on the Continent as towhether British goods going to the Continent to be finishedand then passed on to India would still be entitled  tothe preferential duty;  to which the reply is in the negative.  If the goods are to benefit by the preferential rates then they must be finished in this country. ThatIs the reply I have given, subject to any further rulingfrom the Customs people in India.     Secondly, I have received many enquiries about  thepresent situation in India.  One has to remember that the psychological aspect is enormously important in India.  one is not dealing with a llahomedan trouble which,  if I  may sayso, would from some points of view be more serious than the hindu.  The Hindu trouble is a psychological trouble, thatIs to say their temperament Is essentially different fromour3 and from that of the Llahomedan.   You find  sporadicrisings here and there wherever the Congress organisers havebeen able to concentrate, but on the other hand one  must remember that the results of this Hindu agitation on trade
 are bound to be serious,  They have deliberately fomented a policy of boycott, which is an extraordinarily difficult polioy to meet, because you cannot force a man to buy what he does not want to buy, and one can only hold on and hope that things will improve, remembering that in India the only certainty is that the unexpected will hanpen.     Thirdly, in regard to the general position, the one bright spot Is the seasonal position.  The crops have been fairly good and the outlook is certainly good from that point of view. We have still to await the start of the rains In about four weeks&apos;time, but hitherto the crop prospects are good.  The slump in prices to which I referred last month seems to have come to an end for the time being, and I think the following index numbers will be of interest as showing how the slump affects India1a purchasing power.  We prepare a series of   &apos;- index numbers which shows on the one hand the general index number of all our imports which are very largely manufactured goods, and on the other hand a parallel series for our exports which are practically all raw materials and chiefly agricul- tural goods.  The margin between those two was at its widest in 1920/1 at about 90 points, that Is to say our raw materials were about 150 and manufactured goods about 220.  Every year since then, with fluctuations, the two have tended to draw closer to each other.  Manufactured goods have come down In price and the raw materials have very slowly risenj  I worked out the point at which the two did actually coincide for a short time - in August, 1929, I found they coincided at 143, or 43 points above pre-war.  September 1929 was the beginning of the six months slump which most seriously affected Indian produce, and It affected practically all our lines of export trade.  Everything went together, rice, jute, cotton, hemp, minerals (tin and lead), oil seeds, shellac, the whole range went within, I should say, about 30 days of each other.  The oommon explanation of that is over-production, but It seems rather curious that you should get over-production suddenly affecting such a wide range of commodities, and the way In which one would naturally explain it in India Is that the policy of control which can be effected to a certain extent in the manufacturing Industries cannot possibly operate in agriculture.  It is to the agriculturists interest to produce the maximum crop of which his land is capable, and on looking at these index numbers that tendency seems to me to be borne out because at the end of the six months, i.e. by Kerch, 1930, you find that the manufactured, that is to- say the Imported, Index number has only fallen to 138 from 143, while our exports have fallen from 143 to 125 and seem to be still falling, though more gradually,                      CO-OPERATIVE TRACE.     I.IR. CAIRNS:   Measured In money, sales are not so large as they were for the corresponding period of last year.  This is mainly due to the fact that the principal articles in the grocery and provision trade still maintain a downward tendency in prices.  The price of - sugar has declined to a very low point, and with plentiful supplies available retailers are buying only for immediate requirements.  An interesting point is that Finnish butter is a commodity commanding more attention than it did, and It is comingmore into competition with Danish, because the quality is now very satisfactory and the price is attractive.
     The prices of canned fruits have sunk to a low  ebb,even peaches which were said to be in a strong position havegiven way in price, in common with the other kinds of  these goods.  Stocks in this country are abnormally large  and onthese It Is believed that considerable losses are being incurred.  The financial disturbances in America would appearto have weakened American holders of canned fruit andunfortunately for dealers here spot values are determined bythe lower prices for shipment.     Dried fruits, as a consequence of their affinity  tocanned fruits, are being affected downwards in price,  and themarket for top grade Smyrna sultanas has suffered a  collapse,though that for inferior grades is not exhibiting much change.     Prunes and other Pacific Coast fruits are undergoingthis decline in prices in common with most kindred  articles.     Eggs are being handled in large quantities, butthe market is inactive and unexpectedly low prices have to beaccepted to get the eggs passed on for consumption.  Contraryto custom little or no interest is being taken in pickledeggs for Autumn delivery.  It would appear that such eggshave gone out of favour and their place taken by cold  storeeggs,     Our Enniskillen branch as part of the general  Irishllarket reports a continued scarcity of pigs.  It is  statedthat Irish ^ig feeders reduced extensively the number  oftheir sows on the last occasion when feeding stuffs  were  dear,and now, when they are cheap, they are without the  normal stock of feeding pigs to take advantage of the cheapness  and to keepthe market adequately supplied.     About a month ago Scotch oats began to advance In pricefrom the extremely  low level to which they had fallen, andIn a short time they rose 2/- per cwt. or 6/- a quarter.As a consequence, oatmeal advanced 5/6 per bag of 280  lbs.Latterly there has been a reaction to the extent of oats  losingnearly 2/- per quarter of the gain that had been registered.     The new crop of Indian lentils is due to begin itsarrival at the end of June or the beginning of July, but  themarket has undergone a sudden change owing to the trouble inIndia.  The low opening prices have advanced 3/- per cwt, butbuyers are holding off and awaiting developments.  Any suddenadvance of this kind in the price of a food stuff is at themoment seasonal or special as the result of some cause whoseaction is peculiar to the commodity in question.  The  average level of the price of food is still moving in favour of theconsumer.     The comparatively new conditions under which a verylarge proportion of the milk  and  cream used  in  scotland is being marketed  are creating  a  situation which deservesattention.  Those modifying conditions are orderlymarketing through the agency  of the IIilk Pool and the regula-tion prohibit in..&apos; the use of preservatives  in cream.  The fearsexpressed by retailers when the Pool was. formed that  it mighthave the  effect of  encouraging  a  monopoly&apos; tn mill: and  leadto  an  artificially high  price have  proved  groundless.   Theprovision  of  a sure market for  all  the milk that a  Poolfarmer  produced has  stimulated  production,  and  it seems
that the motive afforded by the certainty of a market isstronger in the way of Increasing the supply than that ofthe lower price in decreasing it.     The other condition, the existence of the PreservativeOrder, is turning out to be an important factor Indepressing the price of milk.  It may not be greatly affectingthe use of table cream, which is generally consumed in or near the place where it is separated, but the trade in bakerscream, which mainly comes from the remoter carts of thecountry, is suffering a great injury as a consequence of theOrder.     Our 0&quot;n experience may be taken as typical of whatis occurring in&quot;outlying districts.  In 1927 our creameryat Stranraer dispatched 42,199 gallons of cream.  In 1929,the amount was only 14,003 gallons.  Our various creameriesin the extreme South and South West of Scotland are just nowdaily handling a quantity of milk equal to 500,000 gallons  ayear.  This we are buying at 5d. a gallon to be made into&apos;cheese, whereas without the Preservative Order it would havebeen separated for bakers cream and the farmers would havereceived 2d. per gallon more for the milk.  I need not say anything more about distribution;  I will hand in somefigures showing the fall that has taken place since thebeginning of the year in our standard brands of flour.x     A peculiar thing is that although French millers havebeen compelled to use as much as 97  of native or ColonialTheat in their flour France has a surplus and French wheatis on sale in British markets.     As regards our factories, orders have been greater forthe jute mill, and it has returned to full time.  A reductionof approximately 4/s in workers wages took effect this month.     A Dundee grievance is that steamers carrying jute- arrive in Dundee direct from India and discharge their cargoes.Then they proceed to Glasgow empty, and Dundee exportersof goods to India, say machinery, are required to send thegoods from Dundee to Glasgow by road or rail, notwithstanding the fact that the steamers leave Dundee empty.  I have been requested to raiso this point in the hope that the attentionof the Government might be called to it and something done with the Conference Line of Steamers.     MR. GILLETT:   We will take note of that last part and have it looked into.                      CO-OPERATIVE TRADE.     MR. VARLEY:   There are just two or three peculiaritieswhich I would like to draw attention to this month.     On the question of butter and the peculiar position that has arisen in that connection, I think it is almostunprecedented that at the beginning of the month Danishbutter was 150/- and at the end of the month 139/-,  whileLew Zealand was 132/6 at the beginning of the month,  thatis 17/6 cheaper than Danish,- but at the end of the monthit was 139/6, or 6d.  higher than Danish butter.  Thereason, I think,  is that the Danish has been gradually_                See Appendix p.33.                         -17-
coming down in price owing to the Baltic States sendingmore butter into this country than they have been doing,and New Zealand have been keeping up their quality andthey have been able to retain their price, and towardsthe end of the month they were able to get an increasedprice over what they got at intermediate dates.     So far as sugar is concerned, now that the budget is out of the way, and has brought no change in taxation,and. the single selling agency for Cuban raw sugar has been abandoned, there is no material change there, and if any-thing it has rather hardened.     There is a peculiarity that Lir. Cairns mentioned aboutfruit, especially Californian tinned fruit.  There willbe a big crop this year, lower prices, and to meet thepossibility of reduced prices holders of present stocks have reduced their prices lower than their cost values a yearago.     So far as tea Is concerned, the policy of restriction in crops for next season, which has been agreed upon by allthe countries of production, will produce a better qualitytea, which has been so short during the season that has just passed.     So far as bacon and hams are concerned, they are down4/- to 5/- during the-early weeks of April and indicationsat the moment point to their being still lower.  supplies are plentiful, some in excess of the demand, but it is justpossible that this will right Itself in the near future, atleast so far as those from Continental sources are con-cerned.     In the wheat position, wheat has gone down during themonth l/- to 2/- per quarter.  In Canada we find moredisposition to meet the price and get on with the selling.There will be a considerable carry over into the next season.The Farm Board set up by the United States has not met with success in their attempt to maintain the price of wheat, andthe Government fund must be about exhausted.     So far as Russia is concerned, they are anxious to begin sending in their new crop of wheat, and I believe thatthey are expecting to send us this season something liketwo million tons.  Australia has good supplies of wheatafloat unsold..  Stocks in Australia continue fairly large,and the Government are encouraging the growth of still morewheat.  In India the new crop gives an increased yield ofabout S million quarters, and is the largest since 1923.They will probably export from Hay onwards.     Argentine is trying hard to resist trie further declinein wheat, with the help of American speculators.  Shipmentshowever continue, and the wheat has to be sold at this sideat competitive prices.     Generally, the movement in Europe, with a view torestricting imports of grain from America, continues, andwith, the present world outlook it would appear that theimport of wheat at reasonable prices will continue unless some calamity overtakes important crops.
     Coming to another side of our business, in the woollensand ready-mades Department decreased values continue to be shown in every department, but the volume of trade  shows anincrease over the corresponding period of last year.  Owing tothe bad condition of trade prevailing at the moment the purchasing power of the consumer is reduced and a cheapergrade of goods must be produced to meet this condition ofthings.     In our general furnishing, business has continuedgood In the carpet and floor cloth section during the past month, but there has been a slight falling off in the fancygoods section.     In the wood furniture there Is very little improvementIn the demand, and trade has fallen sff oonsiderably In the yorkshire area during the past month.     So far as our connection with Russia is concerned, our exports during the month have decreased, many orders that wehave reoeived have not yet been sent away, but our friendly relations with Russia still oontinue.                      DISTRIBUTING TRADES.     SIR WOODMAN BURBIDGE:  It is again exceptionallydifficult to interpret the figures to hand for April tradeIn the departmental stores so as to give a reasonably truepictere of the prevailing conditions.  Comparison with thecorresponding month in 1929 does not provide a fair criterionfor several reasons.  It is true that this year, April hadthe benefit of practically all the pre-Easter trade, but asagainst this, the weather has been definitely less favourable than it was at this time last year.  Again, April 1929 was an exceptionally good month when many stores were able to improveon their April 1928 figures although Easter fell in April inthat yoar.  The factor, however, which is coming to be regardedag that which mainly affects the comparison is the  substantialfall that has occurred in retail prices.  This influence hasbeen operating to an increasing extent since the Autumn of lastyear, and comparisons which have recently been made indifferent parts of the country between price levels of representative merchandise in the spring of 1929 and 1930respectively, show some remarkable differences.  This factorcannot but add materially to the difficulty of maintaining lastyear&apos;s figures.  On the whole, however, and allowing for allthese mitigating circumstances, results have certainly been disappointing and trade has by no means been up to expectations.It is a significant fact that once again the houses doing thehigher class trade are feeling the effects of the depressionmost severely.  We started well last month and during the firstten days more than one house reported daily sales in excess ofany one day last year, but the cold wet weather immediatelyprior to Easter exercised a depressing influence.  Taking theLondon West End Stores first, the piece goods departments aredown some 17 per cent., but it was in those departments thatan exceptionally good experience was enjoyed last year.  Thefashion departments also did well last year, and most houseshave not quite been able to maintain figures, but variations in turnover are generally insignificant.  The msn&apos;s weardepartments have shown a decrease, but the boot and shoedepartments are down by an average of 15 per cent, against two small increases, while the furniture departments show uniform  -falls in turnover averaging 12-^- per cent.

The piece goods departments are down,but the increases in women1s wear average some 8 per cent.uen1s wear shows a slight  average increase, and betterturnover has also been reported in the boot and shoe andfurniture departments.  Hardware shows no decided tendency,but the miscellaneous departments are about 5 per cent. up.                                                               1     The conditions in the North have been as bad as they are  fdown South; Easter trade affected their figures.  The piecegoods departments are not  quite so bad as the southern ones,but they are twelve per cent,  down; both women&apos;s wear and men siwear in the North show slight  increases, and improvement isalso shown in  boots and shoes and furniture.  The fooddepartments show an average Increase of five per cent, and miscellaneous  departments are also up by about the same amount.1     The best  results are  reported from the South of Englandand Wales; I think that is accounted for by the fact thatthey had a very bad time last  year, but it is extraordinaryhow trade has  increased in that part of the country whereasit has decreased in others.  All the piece goods departments in Wales and the South as  in other parts of the country aredown by about  12 per cent., but the women&apos;s wear departments are up by 16 per cent, and the men&apos;s wear departments show an  Iincrease of 20 per cent; there is a fall reported in bootsand shoes.  The furniture and hardware departments show anincrease of 5  per cent,                                        1     Since Easter conditions have generally been quiet and below expectations, but the last few days they are showingsigns of expansion and if we have more settled weather trade should improve in the store trade generally in the month ofMay; we hope so at all events.                             WOOL.     ALDERMAN  TITTERINGTON:  The chief event in the wooltextile Industry since the last meeting has been the opposition!of the employees against the attempt of the employers toenforce the recommendations of the tiacmillan Court of Enquiry.The dispute is now in its  fifth week.  I do not think one isexaggerating when one says that the power of resistance ofthe trade unions has come as a revelation to the employers,and has increased the prestige of the unions.  Indeed, the response on the part of the workers has been a source of surprise and gratification to  our respective ExecutiveCommittees and to the Council of the National Association ofUnions in the  Textile Trade.   I regret very much, as all of us must  the harmful effects of a prolonged dispute.  Thedispute itself&quot; is of rather a  complicated character.  some sections of the woollen industry had already made reductions in wages, last  year.  Some  firms, both in the woollen and worsted industry, did not post notices of reduction and arestijl working  at the old rates.  Over a hundred firms have signed agreements with the trade unions for a reduction of5.8 per cent,  for timeworkers, compared with the 9.25 per cent.1of the naomillan award.  Other firms have been able to bringthe full i*iacmillan reduction into effect.  Since the beginning Iof the dispute some of the operatives who originally came outon strike have returned to work, particularly in the spinning  section of the Industry.  The  dispute is still an effective
 ene,  however,  especially  in worsted weaving, woolcorabing and woolsorting and altogether  about  60,000 employees  are out to   In the woolcombing  section,  which  is  a  &apos;tottie neck&apos; in the worsted industry,  the  stoppage is very effective.  Last week  many employers in  the  commission woolcombing  section re-opened their mills to  test the  position, &quot;but  not a  single firm  was able  to re-start.      The dispute has once more  brought Into prominence the relative merits of wage reductions and re-organisation. Speaking from  the point of  view of the employees and as Chairman of the National  Association  of  Unions&apos; in  the  Textile. . Trade, I should welcome an  enquiry into  the whole  of the industry (Instead of the  limited investigation made by the macmillan Court).  Mr.  Graham ?  judging from his  replies  in the House, has still an open  mind  on  the desirability  of such an enquiry, but we ourselves  feel  that the  advantages  are so obvious  that it should  be proceeded with forthwith.  We stressed the importance of  re-organisation  in placing  the employees  case before  the  Macraillan  Court, and  another  point we made  was that the depression in the industry  in recent times had been largely  due  to the  slump  in  prices.      In  this respect there  is ground  for a  little  more optimism, because during  the  past  six weeks there  have been definite signs that the bottom  of  the slump has  been touched. - Wool&quot;  values, I am told, are five to ten  per cent,  above  the lowest point and still  show a hardening  tendency.  Confidence In values has  been restored,  and our  old friend  the speculator&apos; has been in  evidence.  When prices  are falling stocks at  every stage of  the  industry are cut down to  the lowest point.  There are  signs  that this policy  is being reversed.  If  larger stocks are  built up in expectation  of higher prices  or at any rate  stable prices, it will mean more  employment within  the  industry,  though of course, it does  not alter the fact that  the purchasing power  of the ultimate consumer is low.   Turnover at the  retail  end  is not up to last year&apos;e level,  though it  has shown a seasonal improvement.      There was no hope  of better trade so long as  prices continued to fall, and  now  that  the tide has turned I  think the industry will have  passed through the worst  of the depression, though there  Is still  a long and difficult road to travel.  When the dispute  is  over,  I  am  hoping  to see a slight improvement in employment which will be at  any  rate temporarily increased - I hope,  permanently - to make  up the leeway which has been lost  during  the stoppage.      I am at a loss to  reconcile the  answers to  the questionswhich I  received from Mr. Hill  regarding the increase  of ten per cent, in the chemical output in the  dye.7*t.v-es section, although he did make a  specific  reference to the fact  that the aold wool  colours have  no effective  part in  that percentage, but when one  hears  the  report of the cotton  section and their depression I  am at a  loss to explain where the increaeed ten  per cent, in  chemical dyewares has gone  to.      I can say after hearing  the Australian report byMr. Sanderson  that it has certainly confirmed our  opinionregarding the  hardening of  wool  prioes in the prices whichhave been paid in the Australian markets.     MR.  HILL:   I shall be  pleased  to -s-atisfy the gentlemanIf he  wishes for, furthe-r.-inf-c^rmat 1 AH.
                       RAILWAY TRAFFIC.     SIR RALPH WEDGWOOD:  Tho figures for the last vreeV. ormonth are of very little value in judging of the situationin tho railway industry.  They have been vory much disturbed by Easter.  I do not know if this would be an appropriateoccasion to say that the railway companies would vory muchwelcome anything the Government could do in the dirocticnof establishing a fixed Easter.   I think I can say the sameof any other industry which values comparative statistics.These constant adjustments for the altered date of Eastermake comparisons difficult.  In the present case one can only take satisfactorily the figures for the whole period of theyear up to the 3rd May.  Taking that period railway trafficreceipts are down by two per cent, compared with 1929.  Thataffects the different main branches differently.  Passengerreceipts show a decrease of 1^ per cent; coal receipts 2 percent; &quot;goods receipts Sf- per cent.  Those are figuresreflecting the position of the whole of the railways in thocountry.  The remaining figures I have to give representthose of my own Company&apos; only, the only one of which I amable to get the figures for up to the present time, but theymay bo taken as fairly typical, though rather on the favourableside at the present moment because the North East coast is,compared to previous periods nossibiy in rather a morefavourable position than other parts of the country.  I do not mean to say it is not depressed, but it was more depressed afow years ago.  Taking the London S North Eastern, theposition is rather an interesting one, I think it is more orless typical, although receipts are down in all the throeclasses of traffic, the actual numbers of passengers ortonnages carried are in most cases uo.  Taking passengers, forinstance, the receipts are down by 1- per cent, but the numberof passengers carried shows an increase of 4* per cent, andthe train miles also show an increase so we are doing more work and carrying more oassongers for less pay.  That I thinkmay be put down largely to the increase in cheap fares, thecause of which, as is generally known, is the road competition which We have to meet, and it is interesting to see that wehave, at least, arrested the decline in the numbers of passengers,  We are still waiting in the hope of seeing thoreceipts advance as well.  In the case of goods traffic the position is very different, when you take the heavyclass of goods and the lighter classes.  The lighter classesshow a decrease in tonnage of 3.3 per cent, whereas the heavier classes which possibly from the accounts one hoardof the heavy industries and so on you would expect to showa heavy docline, show a substantial increase in tonnage.The increase in this class is 6*9 per cent.  It is fair tosay that includes a very large number of industries,agriculture in particular, and there has been rather a goodseason, for instance, in beetroot which brings the figuresup, but there is no sign of any falling off in the tonnage ofany of this class of traffic.  In the case of coal tonnageoverall - I am still speaking of the London and NorthEastern - is practically stationary.  There has been animprovement in shipments of 1.52 per cent, and a falling offin land sales of 1.44 per cent.  I am not able to say whatthat is due to.  It may bo the harder winter last year which meant a heavier household coal sale, or it may be general depression in industry.  So far as actual railway employment is concerned the two principal railway companies, theLondon Midland &amp; Scottish and the London ?s North Easternh^-ve b&apos;oth found it necessary to curtail substantially theirbuilding programmes and have had to put their locomotiveand carriage shoos on short time as from the middle of lastmonth.A London  and&apos; North Eastern Railway.
COAL.     MR. RIDLEY &quot;WARHAM:  The figures for the output of coal for the  three weeks ended 26th April are in exactly the same position as Sir Ralph Wedgwood described in regard to railway figures;  Easter has completely upset any comparison, but to take the average output for the thirteen weeks ended 26th April, this was 5,170,000 tons as compared with 5,214,000 tons for the corresponding period of last year;  over the thirteen weeks a reduction of over half  a million tons.   The number of persons employed for  the week ended 26th April was 945,000 as compared with an average figure in 1913 of 1,110,000. The average for the thirteen weeks ended 26th April was 955,000 as compared with an average of 926,000 for the corresponding period of last year.   Unemployment for the month of March was 14.5 per cent as compared with 13.2 per cent in February, but an average figure of 21.9 per cent in 1928.   The quantity of coal exported from the United Kingdom in March was 4,570,000 tons as against 4,537,000 tons in February.   The average price in March was 16/6d as compared with 17/- in the previous month.    The average monthly quantity exported in 1913 was over six million tons and the average value 13/10d.    Last year the average was 4,817,000 and the average value was 16/-.   These figures of course exclude the Irish Free State.   I have put in a tabled here showing the export of coal from Great Britain to certain destinations;  to Scandinavia it has been reduced from  a monthly average in 1913 from 825,000 tons to 393,000 for March 1930;  Germany is pretty much the same 746,000 to 398,000, but Belgium has increased from 337,000 to 607,000 tons.  France has increased from 1,065,000 to 1,157,000 tons.   Italy has fallen, of course,but has considerably increased over the average of 1929 from 591,000 to 667,000.    Spain is considerably reduced from 211,000 (in 1913) to 149,000 (in March, 1930).    The exports by sea from Poland show a drop as compared withFebruary, the figures being 630,000 tons in February and only 538,000 tons in March.    Apparently they are suffering from the same causes as we are.   I will put in a table relating to Poland.K     There is a seasonal falling off in the demand for coal for domestic and public utility purposes which is having its usual result upon the inland market.   The great stocks of surplus coal left over from last winter throughout europe are still having a very serious effect upon the export trade.    It seems unlikely that there will be any increase in the demand before next autumn.    During the lastweek or so there has been a certain movement in connectionwith tonnage which is proceeding to Russia to bring back timber.    This has caused an improvement in the demand forbunkers, and also provided tonnage for Baltic andScandinavian cargoes which has been of some temporary help.Otherwise the export trade is still very quiet  and prices in all exporting districts extremely low.   The five counties have now reduced their export subsidy to 2/- a ton from 3/- which may give the real exporting districts an opportunity of getting some share of what little trade is going.     During the past six weeks there has been a good deal of idle time in Scotland, Northumberland and Durham and see Appendix p. 25.
South. Wales, and I understand  that  in Durham  one or twopits are dismissing large numbers of workmen.     MR. GILLETT:  Is the coal for  Russia  going from thiscountry?     MR. RIDLEY WARHAM:   It is bunkers  for the steamersgoing to Russia and on the way out  to North Russia they aretaking coal cargoes for Norway and  Sweden  and Denmarit.  Theyhave all come together which caused quite  a little fillipfor the time being in shipments, but they  are not reallytaking coal to Russia.                (The proceedings terminated).

WARHAM handed in the following statement: -     The follow!ng table shows the export  of coal froir GreatBritain to certain destinations;   (in 1,000 tons).             Norway.            Belgium.

SIR GUY GRANET handed in the following report:-     During the past month money rates have again declinedand the rate for day to day money has been in the neighbour-hood of 2% to l^fo for the greater part of the period underreview.   Until the la3t week of April the three months billsrate kept around 2^% but a heavy demand on the part of theBritish Clearing Banks for one and two months bills eventuallyaffected the rate of three months paper, and on April 30ththe latter rate had fallen to about 2f^.   The demand for short maturities by the big banks was occasioned by the factthat houses outside the circle of Clearing Banks were suchheavy lenders that the Discount Market were in a position toobtain loans under the latter&apos;s minimum rate of 2^fo, and the banks were therefore forced to purchase short bills in orderto invest their liquid funds above 2%.   Their actioneventually forced the rate for short bills to 23/l6$*     The easy state of the market detailed above is quiteinconsistent with an official rate of 3^ but owing to theexchange value of sterling the decision of the Bank of england to reduce the Bank Rate from 3^5 to 3% was unexpected by theMoney Market, and in view of the fact that similar reductionshave been made in other centres including New :*York, Faris andBrussels, encourages belief in the theory that&quot;the central banks are co-operating in a policy which has for its objectthe cheapening of money, for the purpose of ensuring a goodreception for the forthcoming Bank of international settlements issues.   Following the reduction of the Bank Ratethe market rate for three months bills fell rather sharply,
being at one time about 2$ and is now about 2%%*    Thesupply of day to day money has remained plentiful and thegeneral rate has been lJ?5&amp; to 1^%.     Partly owing to the fact that the Easter Holidaysnecessitated a twenty-one day account and tended to discouragespeculative transactions, and also the uncertain outlook for trade and the foreign exchange, and the political situation inIndia, business in the Stock Exchange has been quiet and dull.Since the reduction in the Bank Sate there have been severalnew issues of capital which have met with varying success -either the amount was considered too large or the price too high.     During the past fortnight about  5,000,000 gold hasbeen shipped to France.   It is understood that the Frenchare repatriating foreign balances in order to provide funds for the pending issue of Bank of International Settlementshares, also to finance the tourist season and tax payments.The lack of a short loan market similar to the London.Discount Market causes the French banks to place funds inthe London Call market, with the result that when the stateof the Paris Exchange is unfavourable to London gold shipmentsbecome necessary.                      IRON AND STEEL.     MR. PUGH sent the following report     There is very little change to report upon in respectto the iron and steel industry.     Generally speaking the jaonth of April has not seen theexpansion of trade expected by the manufacturers and new orders have been very scarce     The hematite iron trade hao been very poor and hasresulted in the damping down of three furnaces on the NorthFast Coast.   This will mean a material increase in theunemployed of the district.     In the steel trade reserves of work are beinrr rapidlydepleted and long contracts of any substance do not appearto be forthcoming.     The tinplate industry continues to be good and reportschow that substantial orders are on hand and that the tradeis at present working to about 80% of capacity.     Galvanised sheets are in poor demand and there has been no sign of an improvement in foreign trade in this commodity.Some works are completely idle while employment in a largenumber of establishments is intermittent.   Prices are,however, being maintained at last month1s level.                     NON-FERROUS. METALS...     CAPTAIN LITTELTON WROTE:-Copper:  Drastic Electro price reductions by C.E.I. resultedin*&quot;a  food volume of buying recently.   In Liverpool there was undoubtedly an accumulation of orders to be placed by wire-drawers.   A more reasonable Copper price should havefavourable reactions on the Brass trade and therebj&apos; stiamlateSpelter consumption.
Tim  Trade demand in South Wales and elsewhere has beensteady throughout, with supplies, however, more than amplefor requirements.Lead;  Latterly consumers have bought on a much betterscale, after a long period of restricted enquiry.    Cablemakers in Liverpool report a steady flow of new business.In Birmingham the pipe and sheet trade is still dull, butthere are indications of increased activity.Spelter:  Trade demand has also improved slightly of late.In Swansea consumers are only covered for early needs andenquiry has been better.   In Birmingham fair orders have beenplaced for galvanising and extruded brass, and RefinedSpelter has been fairly well bought.   There have been afew small enquiries in Liverpool.                        MOTOR INDUSTRY.

MR. LENNOX LEE handed in the following statement:-     Business has continued to be disappointing during april and the position has been aggravated by the conditions in someof the principal markets.     American cotton futures have on the whole remained steady,as have also Egyptian Uppers.   On the other hand there hasbeen some weakness in the case of  Sakel.     In the yarn section fairly stable prices have been maintained and a moderate amount of business is reported,although lack of confidence is restricting new orders.     In the piece goods branch of the industry businesshas been very much under the cloud of the adverse conditionsin India and China.   Practically no forward business has
boon &quot;booked for India during the month.   The increase  Inthe Indian Tariff on yarn and cotton goods to 15$ has now become operative and as an offset to the differentialadvantage, which was accorded to British manufacturers,Japanese freight rates were reduced on cotton yarn and  clothexported to India by 2/- per ton with an additional rebateof 20$ on Railway Freights.  A  similar concession was  madein respect of freights to China with the result that theJapanese manufacturers&apos; competitive position is In no wayweakened by the tariff changes.   New business with Egypt hasbeen restricted by the large stocks which are held in thatcountry and tho low prices which are obtainable for the products of other important markets such as Brazil and  WestAfrica have seriously affected their purchasing capacity.The unfavourable exchange and the general financial conditionof the dealers have limited business with the Argentine,     The conditions ruling in tho Finishing Trades have show no improvement over the previous month.   In the  Bleachingsection,, which  normally experiences a fall in the volumeduring April, trade has shown rather more than the usualseasonal decline.   Much the same conditions have been experienced in the dyeing department of the trade.   Thereare Indications that the printers were better employed  during april than at any time during the earlier months  of theyear but the experience Is by no means general and it wouldbe premature to draw the conclusion that the depression ofthe last six months is lifting.                          WOOL.     MR. HAMILTON wrote:-     The dispute be Ween employers and employed referred toin my last report, broke out about the middle of last month and still continues in full force.

SIR GEORGE BEHAPdSELL sent the following report.Tyres.  The condition of the Tyre Industry is practicallythe same as during March.&apos;     Legislation and conditions generally are graduallybut surely rendering Solid Tyres obsolete.     There is a demand for all classes of Tyres - Motor,Motor-cycle and Cycle, but the market is over-stockod,  andthere is evidence of over-production,Sports Goods.  The Home market is generally reported asbeing good, and the Export market Is very good.     The principal lines In demand are Tennis Ballc andgeneral Spirts Sundries,
     The future outlook ia^av curable.     The principal faotor militating against businessdevelopment Is the sale by British manufacturers of Inferiorarticles at cut prices.Surgloals.   The report is, that for all classes ofSurgicals there is a fairly steady demand which is, however,not up to the average for the time of the year.     The Export market is quiet.Ebonite.   The Home Market Is quiet and the Export marketis dull.     Home and Foreign competition is very keen as the amountof available business is seriously limited by reason of theintroduction of competitive materials for certain uses.     There is a heavy import of Ebonite sheet, rod and tube,from Foreign countries in both the Home and the Empire market.Boots and Shoes.  The report is the same as last month.Mechanicals.  The Home market is reported to be rather quiet,the Export market normal.&quot;-o- &apos;     The principal lines in demand in mechanicals are Hosesand Belts,   Engine Packings are notably slow In demand.Competition is very keen, especially in the Colonies,Buyers holding off through price instability.Waterproof Garments.  As in the case of Surgicals^ the export market is better than the Home market, but both are considered quiet.     This condition of the trade can be described as seasonal.The busiest season of the year, generally speaidn.g5 for waterproof garments, is from July to October.   Thoro is certainbrightening up in demand about the beginning of December.From - January to Easter, works, generally speaking,, are workingjust below  normal.   Between Easter and Whitsuntide isgenerally a very bad period,                         BUILDING.     MR. BARRON sent the following reports-     Unemployment in this industry is still alarminglyhigh, and that in spite of us being in tho very height ofthe building season.   The falling off is almost wholly dueto the decline in housebuilding - indeed public and communalbuilding, according to the return of plans deposited, showa slight increase.     In regard to housing, it looks as if very little is tobe achieved this year.   Bills dealing with housing andslum clearance are being considered by Parliament, but even after legislation is completed a great deal of time willelapse before Local Authorities will have these schemessufficiently advanced to allow contracts to be fixed andlabour commenced during 1930.     Like so many other industries the Building industry has had to face the question as to whether it was as efficientas it might be, and largely through the initiation ofLord Amulree, and Mr, Bos son, an Architect who has had many
years&apos; experience in the United States,  steps were taken to inquire into the whole of the working of the BuildingIndustry.     Last year a Council of Review was set up with lord Amulree as President, and representatives from thevarious component parts of the industry - Architects,Surveyors^ Civil Engineers, Contractors, Building MaterialManufacturers and Merchants, Building Trade Employers andOperatives.   Evidence was given by these parties showinghow better to correlate the various functions, how to cutout waste, and how generally to increase the efficiency and productive output of the industry, thereby reducing the costof the product;     Prom the evidence already given and the suggestions made, It would seem feasible for great economics to beeffected without in any way reducing the standards of those engaged In the industry.     The Council hopes shortly to issue an interim report,and from that stage to take up the matter In a moreofficial manner, and seek to Interest the various sectionswhich go to form the industry as a whole,                      SHIPBUILDING-.     MR. BAKRON sent the following report     Although the work on hand In connection withShipbuilding Is considerable, there has been some falling off in the placing of new contracts, and unless there isa speeding up in the placing of those the end of the summer will see an unfortunate addition to the number ofunemployed in this industry.     Two cruisers are expected to be fixed shortly, andrumour is still busy with the precise destination of the projected now $unarder, but against that, owing to lack offreights, an additional number of cargo steamers is being laid up.     The announcement of the formation of and list of directors for the Company to- take  over and close what maybe considered superfluous shipyards has brought intoprominence the efforts of the Shipbuilders to rationalise theirindustry.   Whilst this is naturally causing much concern to the workers In the Industry, who know that whatever theultimate effects may be the Immediate one will be to curtailseriously the opportunities of  employment In particulardistricts, there has also been some questioning as to whatis called this &quot;policy of despair&quot; from prominent Shipbuilders,who possibly may reckon their yards as among the superfluous.     No doubt economies In overhead charges,  In managementcosts, and In general organisation could be effected by methods of greater concentration, but such a problem wouldrequire considerable delicacy of handling.   It cannot be tackled as a mere problem in mathematics.   There aretraditional, geographical, and human reasons centering roundevery yard in the country, and the mere fact of closingwhat may be considered redundant yards Is no guarantee that work hitherto done there will be transferred to someother yard.

It is regrettable, however, that the representativesof the workers, whose lives and fortunes are also hound up with the prosperity of the industry, have not had theopportunity of offering any suggestions with regard to thismost vital question,                SHIPPING AND SHIPBUILDING.

The position of the Coal Trade during  the past four Jreeks has become steadily worse, excepting for Durham Coking Coals, Irhich have  not fallen in value.   In fact, the previous fall has Imdoubtedly brought to the Durham market an increased volume of trade for that class of Coal.   Steam Coals, however, and Gas Coals, ire very weak indeed.M * On  the  12th of May, lloyd Daily  Index  showed  17  of  theseill    vessels engaged in voyages.
     An attempt is being made to bolster up the value ofPatent Coke by means of a Cartel, but my candid opinion is thatit is being so mismanaged at the outset, that it will more thanlikely fail to accomplish its object - which was to obtain areasonable Market price for Coke .     Ship^Repairing, taking everything into consideration,has been&apos; very good, particularly on the North-East coast.     Genera!!. The reports generally which have come to hand tothe Chamber of Commerce, reveal a state of uncertainty as wellas of hesitation, and there is no doubt that the Board ofTrade returns published for April, reflect this opinion whichI am expressing.  Of course, it is only fair to take intoaccount in any criticism of the April figures, the effect ofEaster, which one cannot confine to two days, but as a matterof fact, its effect is felt over a period of at least one week.

HOSE handed in the following report:--     The general commercial situation in Chile continueson the whole satisfactory.   Following the seasonal dullnessin January and February, retail sales improved during March.The Government public works construction programme ispi^oceeding and private construction is still active.  Credit
cond.itlone are good and collections are taking place normally.The agricultural harvest recently completed has been the bestfor several years.   Labour released from the nitrate andcopper mines is being absorbed elsewhere, especially in private and government construction works, and unemploymentdoes not appear excessive for the post-harvest season.     The agricultural situation in Argentina has beenfavourably affected by general rains, vnich have assistedploughing operations for the fine cereal crops, sowing ofwhich has also commenced in certain districts.   A preliminaryofficial estimate of the yield of maize this season is89,582,000 quarters, against 27,075,000 quarters finallyestimated last season.     The total official value of exports from Argentina duringthe first two months of 1930, exclusive of gold movements,  was135,383,097 pesos (gold), the corresponding aggregate for thefirst two months of last year having been 190,511,423 pesos(gold).   Whilst the decrease in the total value of exportsthis year was due partly to the fall in the general level of export prices, the main cause of the contraction was the lesser volume of shipments, which was only 2,092,420 tons,  ascompared with 2,891,536 tons.   Shipments of cereals andlinseed during January and February this year totalled only ,700,737 tons, valued at 78,785,877 pesos (gold), thefigures for the corresponding period of 1929 having been2,457,685 tons, and 112,638,959 pesos (gold), respectively.A marked decline took place in wheat exports, from 1,341,526to 624,401 tons, but, on the other hand, maize exports increased from 361,005 to 628,814 tons.   An examination of the total volume and value of other leading export products of theRepublic show that the chief influence has been theconsiderabljr lower level of prices, although, exceptionally,shipments of quebracho logs and extract increased in bothquantity and value.     Latest advices received from Argentina by mail statethat, whilet the month of March is usually a period ofconsiderable commercial activity,  this year results have been disappointing, exports having taken place on a comparatively small scale.   In regard to the general outlook, the mainconsideration is the future trend of world prices of stapleagricultural commodities.   In the meantime, the argentine government has been successful in placing in the New Yorkmarket an amount of $50,000,000 in Six-months 5 per cent.Treasury Gold Notes.   Drawings there against have had afavourable, if temporary, effect upon the exchange value ofthe Argentine peso, the telegraphic transfer rate in buenos aires on London being distinctly firmer than a month ago.     The adjoining Republic of Uruguay has also recentlyarranged a financial operation in New York, having contracteda loan of ten million Uruguayan pesos, the proceeds to beapplied to the service of a loan obtained from the same sourcein 1928 for highway construction.     Official returns of Uruguayan foreign trade show thatthe total value of imports on the basis of Customs valuationsfor the year 1929 was 94,720,000 pesos, as compared with93,955,000 pesoB in 1928, and 01,830,000 pesos in 1927.  Thetotal value of exports last year on the basis of actual market prices was 92,756,000 pesos, against 101,203,000 pesos in 1928,
and 96,419,000 pesos in 1927.   The following table is ofinterest as indicating the percentages of the Uruguayan import and export trades, respectively, secured by the Republic&apos;sleading suppliers and customers:-                   Imports.

Brazilian conditions have been favourably affected inrecent weeks by the flotation of an international loan of the equivalent of  17,000,000 sterling, the proceeds of which areto provide means for operating a scheme to regulate thedisposal of surplus stocks of coffee in the consuming markets.The general tendency towards increased confidence is alsoattributable partly to anticipations that, owing to climaticand other causes, the next coffee crop in the Republic willbe considerably lighter than those of the past few years.While some considerable time must elapse before the glut of stocks of coffee in Brazil is relieved, there are alreadyindications of a better tone in the markets for imported goods,and the trend of exchange is firm.   Latest advices from SaoPaulo are that money appears to be circulating more freely,and the first signs of a revival in trade should see promptorders from importers, as stocks in hand have been for sometime at the lowest possible minimum.   It is reported that the-new President of Brazil, Dr. Prestes, following confirmation of his election, will proceed to New York to return the visitMr. Hoover, as United States President-Elect, made to Brazil inDecember, 1928.   Dr. Prestes will later visit Europeunofficially.     Import market conditions in Peru are generally dull.Business generally has shown little or no improvement, andcollections are becoming more difficult.   Whilst it isgratifying to observe the stability of exchange secured by therecent reform of the Peruvian monetary unit, it is apparentlyrecognised in Peru that the country has to face a considerable period of retrenchment and economies.     The economic situation in Colombia is still depressed.Some slight increase in the general demand for merchandise isreported, but the movements is still below normal.    Transportconditions on the River Magdalena are fair.   The localcoffee market is dull in tone.   Coffee from the currentcrop Is beginning to come forward for sale, but only in small quantities.     Conditions in Ecuador have been affected by the latenessof the cocoa crop,  which is having a depressing effect uponthe general commercial situation.    Imports show a  markeddecline, but, provided the yield of cocoa proves equivalent tothat of last year,  an improvement may be anticipated.
The Ecuadorian coffee market is quiet, hut there continues to&quot;be a demand from the exterior at prices providing a nominalmargin of profit to exporters.     The drought in Venezuela has recently broken, and prospects for the pending coffee crop have consequently improved.   Localmarket conditions for both coffee and cocoa continue veryquiet.   Practically the whole of last yearfs export crop of coffee beans has been shipped, and remaining stocks are for local consumption.     Nicaraguan conditions are characterised by somecommercial depression, which has resulted from the general fallin coffee prices.   Credit has been restricted and merchantsfind collections difficult.   The coffee growers,  however, are apparently endeavouring to adapt themselves to the changedmarket conditions by lowering their production costs so far aspossible.   The general trade outlook is not unfavourable, butcredit should be confined to known customers.
