(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY  OF HIS  3RITAKNIC  MAJESTY &apos;S  CO VTIRHMZHT)SECRETCP.170 (30)Copy Ho.  If-bCABINETTHE CHANNEL TUNNEL.Memprand urn by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.(Circulated in accordance with Cabinet 23 (30), Conclusion 5)1.      The Report of the Channel Tunnel Committee (CP.72 (30))so far as the probable effect of the tunnel on Englishagriculture is concerned, expresses views which generally arein accord with those put forward in evidence by this Department.These, briefly, are that in so far as the tunnel would belikely to have any direct effects on English agriculture, thoseeffects would De harmful.2.       It is impossible to make any reliable forecast, but any trade developments arising out of the construction of thetunnel would probably include some intensification of thecompetition from imported early vegetables, fruit and flowers,and perhaps the establishment of an import trade in fluidmilk.  The extent of such developments would partly dependon the effect of the tunnel route upon the level of cress-Channel freight rates and, as to this, though some reliefappears to be anticipated, the Report is indefinite.  other factors which may affect development are the possibility of saving time and the avoidance of handling - both points of some importance when considering agricultural commodities of aperishable nature.3.      The Channel Tunnel Policy Committee of the economic advisory Council expresses the opinion that the Report of theChannel Tunnel Committee roes not deal adequately v,ith thepossibilities of new forms of trade developing as a result ofthe construction of the tunnel and even seems to hint that if
                                                          Illthese possibilities had been fully indicated, the irrecommendation as regards the desirability of government assistance to the scheme might have been different.  This,however, does not apply t^ the trade in agricultural produce.All developments in this direction that are at all probableare indicated in the Report of the Channel Tunnel Committeeand, in any event, being developments of Import trade, theycould hardly be used as an argument to justify government assistance.4.     All things considered, the Increase in competition which English agriculture might have to face, although thi3may prove to be serious, would probably not alone besufficient to justify withholding consent to the constructionof the tunnel by private enterprise.  That there may be other grounds for doing so, however, emerges very clearly from theMemorandum prepared in the Treasury (CP. 156 (30)).  Theprobable adverse reaction on English agriculture wouldcertainly support the viev; that no financial assistance should be provided by the Government.5.      I should add that the National Farmers 1 Unionhave emphatically endorsed the minority opinion ofLord Ebbisham that the project should be rejected on economic grounds and they are opposed to any facilities being afforded by the Government for the construction of the tunnel.
