REPORT.                      I.-INTRODUCTORY.              (a) Composition and Terms of Reference.     1.   ON the 26th July, 1929, the Prime Minister appointed a Sub-Committee  of the Committee  of  Civil  Eesearch* with the following Terms of reference:         To consider and report  upon the present  condition  and     prospects of  the  Iron  and  Steel  Industries,  and to  make     recommendations as to any action which may appear desirable     and practicable in  order to improve the  position of  those     Industries in the markets of the world.     2.   The  Committee is constituted as  follows:-        The Eight Hon. the Lord Sankey, G.B.E., Lord Chancellor           (Chairman).        The Eight  Hon. Thomas  Shaw,  C.B.E., M.P., Secretary           of  State for  War.        Sir Cecil Budd, K.B.E.        Mr. C. T.  Cramp.        Sir William Plender, Bart., G.B.E.           Mr.  A.  P.  Hemming,  C.B.E.,-)              Assistant  Secretary,   Economic I  Joint Secretaries              Advisory  Council                [ to the Committee.           Mr. W.  Palmer, Board of Trade   J            (b) Procedure adopted by the Committee.    3.  On the  81st July, 1929,  we held a preliminary meeting for  the purpose  of laying down the procedure  to be followed in our Inquiry.  In order to  inform ourselves generally of the nature of the  problem to be  studied,  we  decided, in the first instance, to obtain preliminary evidence from  the organisations representing the  employers and the workpeople.  We  accordingly invited  the National Federation of  Iron and  Steel Manufacturers  and the  Iron and Steel Trades&apos;  Confederation to appoint witnesses to give oral evidence before  us.   At  the  same time, we decided  to obtain evidence from bodies  representing  industries which  use steel  as a  raw  material, and accordingly issued invitations to the  British Steel Ee-Eollers&apos;  Association,  the British Engineers&apos; Association and the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation.    4.   After  receiving  from the National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers the preliminary evidence referred to in the preceding  paragraph, we devoted a  series of sessions to hearing evidence in respect of the  several sections of the industry, e.g.:        The Pig Iron Industry.       The Heavy Steel Industry.       The Tin Plate Industry.       The South Wales Steel Industry.       The Ee-Rolling Industry.       The Wire, Wire Netting and Wire  Nail Industries.       The Sheet Industry.       The Forgings Section of the Industry.       The Wrought Iron Trade.       The Crucible Steel Section.       The Lincolnshire  Steel Industry.       The Castings Section.The witnesses who gave  this evidence  were nominated by  theNational Federation of  Iron and Steel Manufacturers,  and came before us as the accredited representatives of their respective sections.   *  Note.-By Treasury Minute dated January 27,1930, the Committee ofCivil Research  was absorbed in the Economic Advisory Council, of whichthis Sub-Committee became a Committee.     [20779]                                            B 2
 At the same period, we received evidence from the National Union of  Blastfurnacemen,  Ore  Miners,  Coke  Workers and Kindred Trades, who gave us the collective views of the workpeople engaged in  this section of the industry.   Evidence was also  submitted to us on behalf of the National Union of General  and Municipal Workers.    5.   At an  early stage of our Inquiry it became apparent that if we were  adequately to discharge  our task it would be necessary to undertake a study of post-war developments in the principal steel- producing countries on  the Continent,  e.g.,  France,  Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany.  In this matter  we were greatly assisted by the Department of Overseas  Trade, who arranged  for evidence to  be  furnished to us on the Iron and  Steel  Industry in France by Mr. J. E. Cahill, Commercial Counsellor at the British Embassy at  Paris, and on  that in Belgium  and Luxembourg by Mr. N. S. Beyntiens,  Commercial  Secretary  at  the  British  Embassy  at Brussels.   As regards the German Iron and  Steel Industry,  we were fortunate in  being  able to obtain  evidence from Mr. C. J. Kavanagh,  who for a number of years after the war held a similar position in Germany.    6.,  Many of the witnesses who appeared before us expressed the opinion that part  of the  present difficulties of the  Iron and Steel Industry in this country was due to the lower labour costs incurred by  their Continental rivals.  In particular,  they stated that British manufacturers were handicapped by reason  of the longer hours  and lower  wages of the labour engaged in comparable works on  the Continent.  In no case, however, were witnesses in a position to furnish detailed statistical evidence in support of this  view.  The question appeared  to us of such importance that we recommended His Majesty&apos;s Government  to  arrange for an ad  hoc investiga- tion to be undertaken on  our behalf.   This recommendation  was adopted.  It is a matter of particular satisfaction to us that it  was possible to  arrange for the two officers of  the  Ministry of Labour appointed to carry  out this survey to do so  jointly with representa- tives of the Iron and Steel. Trades Employers&apos; Association and of the Iron and Steel Trades&apos; Confederation,  of which, we understand,  the former  had  itself already  decided to conduct such an investigation. The countries visited were France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany and Czecho-Slovakia.   In  addition,  a number of works in  this country were visited.  On the return of the  Mission  to this country, oral evidence was  submitted to us on  behalf of the Iron and Steel Trades  Employers&apos; Association on this subject.  &apos;    7.   At our first meeting, we were  informed  by the  President of the Board of Trade that shortly before leaving office his predecessor had appointed  a Committee*  under the Chairmanship of Sir  Boy Wilson to consider the difficulties  which the  Steel Industry  had recently experienced in respect of the supply of scrap.  The Com- mittee had  not actually begun its  work  and Sir Boy  Wilson had intimated that, on  doctors&apos; orders,  he had  since been forbidden to              . 1 undertake this  work.  At the  request of the Presidentof the Board of Trade, we therefore  agreed that  this special inquiry into scrap should be merged  into our larger investigation of the general state of the  industry.  At the same time, we agreed to confirm the pre- liminary invitations to give evidence which had been issued on behalf of  Sir  Boy Wilson&apos;s  Committee.   These  witnesses included  the Service Departments,  the Federated  Associations  of  Scrap Iron, Steel,  Metals  and Machinery Merchants  of  Great Britain,   the Scottish Steel Scrap Association, certain leading scrap merchants and others.   In addition, evidence on this subject was submitted to us by the South Wales Siemens  Steel Association on behalf of  the National Federation of Iron and  Steel Manufacturers.    8.   The  evidence of the  witnesses referred to in paragraph 4 above  demonstrated that  large  sums  of fresh capital  would  borequired for the reconstruction  of  the  industry.   We therefore thought it proper to consult with the leading Joint Stock Banks inregard to the financial prospects of  the industry.  In addition,  the  * Note. The Terms of Reference  proposed for this Committee were asfollows :      &quot; To inquire into the position  in  regard to the supply  of scrap  for  steel making in the United Kingdom, and to  make recommendations in  regard thereto.&quot;
Governor of the Bank of England at our request gave evidence beforeus on this subject.   9.  Finally,  we received evidence on  various  aspects of  our inquiry from a number of leading members  of the industry.   10.  We held twenty-six meetings for the purpose of taking  oral evidence.   A full list of the witnesses is given in the  Appendix tothis  Beport.  In addition,  we were furnished with memoranda on particular  points  by  the  Board  of  Trade,  the  Department of scientific  and Industrial  Research, the Department  of  OverseasTrade  and  the  Board of Inland Revenue.   We  also received from various sources a number of other written communications.   11.  We desire to  place on record our  indebtedness to all whohave assisted us in our Inquiry, whether  by giving oral evidence before  UB or by  furnishing memoranda.                    (c) Arrangement of Report.   12.  In preparing our  Beport,  we have given in some detail an historical survey of the development of the  industry (Section II), aswe thought that this was desirable for obtaining a balanced view ofthe present position.   Section III is  devoted to a  consideration ofthe materials and processes employed in the heavy iron  and steel industries.   In this Section we discuss the position in regard to rawmaterials,  ore,  coke and coal; the situation in regard to the  blastfurnaces required for the manufacture of pig iron and the degree of efficiency obtained in the steel works and rolling mills of the country.   13.  The position of the other sections of the Iron and steel industries  differs  in  various  respects  from that in the  heavysection, and in Section IV we describe  briefly  the  situation inregard to each of these sections.  Section V deals with the questionof steel scrap to which, as explained in paragraph 7 above, we were invited at  the outset of our Inquiry  to  give special consideration.In Section VI  we  discuss the question of the  wages earned  andthe  hours  worked  by the labour engaged in the Iron  and SteelIndustry in this country and in the  principal competing countriesin Europe.  In Section VII  we draw a  comparison  between theorganisation of  the British Iron  and Step&apos;  Industry and that ofits  Continental  competitors.   Section  VIII  is  devoted  to  a consideration of  the various  remedies that have  been  suggested to us in evidence  and to our views thereon.   14.  Our  principal  conclusions   and  recommendations  are summarised in Section IX.II. HISTORICAL SURVEY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE           MANUFACTURE OF IRON AND STEEL.                (a) Early History of the Industry.   15.  Although  iron  and  steel  have  been  known  for  manycenturies,  it is only within the last two hundred  years that methodshave been evolved of smelting  and working  iron and  steel in large  quantities,  in  many  qualities  and at a  reasonable  cost.Improvements  in  technique  have  been  rapid   and continuousthroughout the last  hundred  years,  and there is no  reason to suppose that the process  of discovery and development  has cometo an end,  though there is to-day no indication of any new techniquelikely  in   the  near future  to  revolutionise  existing methods ofproduction.   16.  Blast  furnaces  are believed to date back to  about theyear 1500, but  the early ones  were  insignificant  in  size  anddepended  on charcoal for fuel and  water power  for driving theblast.  The introduction of  coke smelting  in the 18th century andthe  use of the steam engine for driving  the blast were momentousimprovements.   Scarcely less  important  was  the introduction ofthe  hot blast (first used by Neilson in 1828), which resulted  in agreat diminution of fuel consumption.  Continuous improvements in blowing power enabled furnaces of increased capacity to be built,
 and there have  been many recent  developments in the utilisation of the  waste gases of blast furnaces.  The  average production per furnace in blast in  Great Britain doubled  during the period of thirty  years immediately preceding  the  war.   It  amounted to 30,400 tons  in  1913.   The  production  per furnace in the  more recent  post-war  years is substantially greater (43,500 tons in 1927 and 46,200  tons in 1928), but this is partly due  to the aggregate output being below  the normal and to  its being  concentrated in the larger and newer furnaces.  Some of the largest  furnaces in Great Britain can produce 500 tons of pig  iron a  day, i.e., about 180,000 tons a  year.    17.  Foundries.- The  invention of the blast furnace led to the development  of  iron  founding or casting.   There  are no epoch- making inventions to which reference need be made,  but  there is a steady  record of progress  in  foundry  practice  and  of  improve- ment in the  quality of the product.    18.   Wrought Iron Industry. The invention  of the  puddling process by Cort  in the latter  part of the 18th century led to the development  of  the bar iron  and  manufactured iron, or wrought iron, industry.   This attained at one period a great development, but during the  past  half century  it  has declined owing  to the relatively heavy cost of producing bar  iron compared with that of producing steel. Wrought iron  is, however, still used for some purposes, especially  where  a material is required which  resists corrosion  Or  withstands shock.    19.  Manufacture  of  Steel.-^-The development of  the  steel industry was rendered possible  by  three outstanding  inventions: (1) the Bessemer process in  1856;  (2)  the open hearth process between 1864 and 1867;  and  (3) the &apos;&apos; basic &apos;&apos; process of Thomas and Gilchrist in 1879.  These discoveries  entirely revolutionised the industry  by making it possible for  the first  time to  convert pig iron into steel in large  quantities and  at comparatively  low cost.   The  original  Bessemer and open  hearth   processes  were suitable for the  conversion of iron produced  from hematite (i.e., non-phosphoric  ores), but  not for that of iron produced from the more common phosphoric ores,  since the phosphorus  which was injurious to the quality of the steel could not be eliminated.  The discoveries of Thomas and Gilchrist made  it possible, by introducing a &quot;basic &quot; lining in the furnace, to eliminate phosphorus from the metal during its conversion into steel, and  thus greatly increased the value of  earlier  inventions.  The basic process was of even greater importance to Germany, Luxemburg, Belgium and France, in  connection with  the  exploitation  of the great  deposits  of phosphoric  minette  ores,  than  it  was  to  this   country.   For although  British supplies  of hematite  ores are  limited  (being confined to Cumberland and Lancashire) suitable  ores can readily be imported  in great quantities.   20.  In this country and to a smaller  extent elsewhere the ten- dency for many years past has been for the open hearth process to gain ground at the expense of the Bessemer process.  The latter is now only carried on in this country  to a limited extent.  The open hearth process takes longer than the Bessemer process and is more expensive in  fuel, but the  steel produced by  it is  more reliable  in quality and the process has the advantage that a much larger pro-portion of scrap metal can be used.   There is also a smaller  loss of metal in conversion.   21.  Another tendency  in this  country  has   been  towards a greater development of the basic process,  thus enabling larger use to be made of phosphoric ores.   As with  the blast  furnace  so  with the Bessemer converter and the open hearth furnace, there has been a tendency to increase the size.  Many special types have also been evolved.  A recent improvement of importance was described by Mr. B. Talbot in his Presidential Address in 1928 to the Iron and Steel Institute.   By the introduction in existing or in new open hearthfurnaces of auxiliary hearths in which scrap or pig iron can be meltedand the liquid metal partially refined while the finished steel is being produced in the main hearth, the output of steel can be substantially increased.
   22.  High Grade and Special Steels. The highest quality of ordinary steel is made in  comparatively  small  quantities by  thecrucible process, which dates from the 18th century; and high gradesteel of somewhat  lower  quality  is made  in electric furnaces, ofwhich many were built in  this country during the war.   During thelast 50 years very important discoveries have been made in regardto alloys of steel and other metals, i.e.,  the so-called special steels.These possess peculiar qualities or properties which  adapt  them foruse for particular purposes.   They are produced in relatively small quantities and their price  is as a rule many times that of ordinarysteel.  High grade  and special steel making  are  concentrated inthe Sheffield district.             (b) Later Developments  in  Great Britain.    23.  The geographical position of the heavy branches (i-e.,  pig iron, wrought iron, steel  making and rolling) of the  industry  has been determined to a  great extent by considerations of transport in relation to the assembling of materials  and the marketing  of  the finished product.    24.  Until less than 200 years  ago the primary considerations were the  availability of timber for use as fuel and water power  for driving the blast.   The proximity of iron ore, though important, was less so than the proximity of wood  since much more fuel than  ore was required.   Proximity to markets was also of  relatively sub- ordinate importance.   The blast furnace industry  had its principal centre, until the  end of the 17th century, in Sussex, and  it was mainly the increasing scarcity of timber  which led to  its migration to other parts of the country.    25.  With the introduction of coke smelting, the blast furnace industry naturally gravitated to the neighbourhood of the coal mines. Districts where ore was won from the same mines  as coal offered a special attraction.   Until the introduction of the steam  engine, how- ever, the blast furnaces remained dependent upon water power.    26.  Technical invention during the last century has to a con- siderable extent been connected with the  attainment of economy in the use of fuel. There has been continuous progress as regards  the quantity of ore that can be smelted (and  where desired converted into steel) with a given amount of fuel.   Changes of this character, in conjunction with improvements in transport facilities, have exer- cised a very considerable influence upon the geographical distribu- tion of the  heavy iron and steel industry.   They have tended to diminish the importance of proximity  to fuel as  compared with the importance of proximity to ore.    For a good many years past a smaller weight  of  coal (converted into coke) than  of ore has been required in the blast furnace, the relative quantities being dependent upon the  richness of the ore and the quality  of the coal.  At the present time the smelting of the ore, the  conversion of the pig iron into steel and the  rolling of the steel can in suitable circumstances all  be carried out with no more expenditure of heat than that generated by the coal required for consumption  (after the conversion into coke) in the blast furnace.  This result has been obtained by the use of heat recuperating and bye-product  recovering coke ovens;  by the discovery of methods of cleaning blast furnace  gas; and by the introduction  of the internal combustion  engine.  Coke  oven and blast furnace gas can now be used to provide the heat necessary forconverting pig iron into steel and for generating electricity to drivethe rolling mills.   27.  These developments have exercised a two-fold effect.   Theyhave caused    (i)  a shifting of the industry in the direction of the ore supply;   (ii) the  concentration  in  some  cases of  coking  ovens,  blast          furnaces, steel works and  rolling mills in proximity with          one another  so that the whole process of manufacture  of          rolled steel products from the ore can be  carried out with          a minimum  consumption of fuel.
   28.   The shifting  of the  industry  in  the  direction of the oresupply is particularly noteworthy in connection with the growth ofsome of the newer iron and steel manufacturing districts which uselocal ores,  e.g., Lincolnshire, and with the growth of  the industry on the coast, where plentiful supplies of rich  ores can be obtainedfrom abroad.   29.

The pre-wars years for which figures are given are years of highproduction.   30.  By the year 1913, several districts had become increasingly important  as pig iron producers, while  other areas were becomingless  important  or were  approximately stationary.   Among  the districts increasing in importance the most conspicuous was that  ofthe North-East Coast, the development  of which occurred, however,mainly prior to 1900.  The industry in  that area was based chieflyupon  Cleveland ore and  Durham coal,  but large  quantities of richores (including hematite ores used to make pig iron for conversion into steel by the original Bessemer and open hearth processes, aswell as phosphoric ores) were imported.  As the local ores began  toshow signs of approaching exhaustion they were supplemented to an increasing extent by Northamptonshire and other British ores, whichwere found useful for mixing with  the  richer foreign ores.   Bailfreights upon these ores (which were  not of high metal  content)tended to increase costs of production on the North-East Coast.   31.  Other districts which showed a marked development  wereLincolnshire, Northamptonshire, the West Biding,  Derbyshire  andNottinghamshire.   These districts  are. essentially dependent uponBritish  ores,   of  which  great  quantities  exist  in  Lincolnshire,Leicestershire,  Northamptonshire,  Butland   and   Oxfordshire.Although these ores are  of rather low metal content (ranging froman average of 22 per  cent, to an average of 32 per cent.), they areeasily worked, and the North Lincolnshire ores in particular, which contain only 22 per cent, of metal, possess the valuable quality  ofbeing self-fluxing  (i.e., it is not necessary to add limestone to thefurnace charge).  It is significant that although the pig iron output in all  other districts was substantially less in 1927  than in 1918, theproduction of Lincolnshire  (with Leicestershire)  was 64 per cent.greater.   32.  In the  Staffordshire district,  production  on the wholedeclined during the half century preceding the war and the produc-tion of 1927 was little more than half that of 1913.  This area has a relatively  large proportion of old and  small furnaces.   It was  animportant centre of wrought iron manufacture and has been affectedby the decay  of that branch of  the industry.   The falling off  ofproduction in Cumberland and Lancashire during the 80 years before
the war may probably be attributed to the exhaustion of some of thebest deposits of the local hematite ores.  It may be noted also thatthe North-West  Coast  district is less favourably placed with regardto supplies to good coking coal than the North-East Coast district.    38.   South Wales is another district which was declining ratherthan progressing before the war as a  producer of pig iron.   Localiron ores were always relatively costly to produce, and have long been almost entirely superseded by imported ores.  Some of the localiron and steel works, though favourably situated in respect of coal supplies, are less well situated in respect of imported ores which haveto be  carried some distance  by rail.  A number of  newer  blastfurnaces, including some of very large capacity, have, however, beenestablished on the coast.    34.   The Scottish pig iron industry possessed a great advantageso long as it was able to draw its ironstone and fuel from the samemines and to smelt in furnaces established at the pit&apos;s mouth.  Thelocal ores have, however, become  exhausted,  and the supplies  ofgood splint coal which is used in the furnaces in the natural state aregrowing short.   Scotland is  also  deficient in  good  coking  coal.Conditions have, therefore, tended to become unfavourable to thedevelopment of the pig iron industry in Scotland.  The furnaces are mostly small and old.    35.   The figures of  pig iron output  may  be supplemented byfigures  showing the average  output  per  furnace in  blast in thedifferent districts.  The  output of a furnace depends partly on therichness of the ore and the quality of the coal, and also  upon  the rate at which the furnace is worked, as well as  upon the cubic capacity ofthe furnace itself.   The figures of output nevertheless give some indication  of  the  relative size of furnaces  in blast  in  differentdistricts.AVERAGE Output per Blast Furnace in 1927.

It will be seen that the largest outputs were  achieved bythe furnaces in blast in South Wales, followed by  the  West Coast,the North-East Coast and Lincolnshire.  In the last named covftitythe comparative  leanness of the ore smelted tends to reduce theoutput of the furnaces.   87.   It may be assumed that the furnaces in blast are on thewhole  larger  and newer than the furnaces idle.  The latter, nodoubt, include some which  are not likely to be put in blast again.As  indicated  by the  figures given  in  paragraph 40  below,  thenumber of furnaces  in existence  has  tended to fall for many years past.   The decline has latterly been accelerated, and the aggregatenumber  of  furnaces  in  existence in Great Britain has decreasedfrom  485 at the  end of  1922 to 424 at the end of 1927, and 410at the end of 1928, in spite of the erection during that period ofa number of  new furnaces.   38.   The  tendency  for efficient practice  to  require largerfurnaces has, in  general,  led to an increase  in  the size of the     [20779]                                              c

The above figures show a marked increase in the size of thebusiness unit in  the  blast  furnace  industry  before  the war.   Afurther substantial  increase  has taken place since 1913.   this advance is greater than the  above figures suggest.   If subsidiary companies  were eliminated from the figures for 1924, the numberof owners would be  reduced to at most  79, the average number ofblast furnaces  under a single control being increased  to 6.   40.  Changes  in  the   relative  and absolute  importance  ofdifferent districts  as regards steelmaking cannot,  in the absenceof statistics,  be traced back beyond 1913.

Scotland   and  South   Wales  in  particular,  and  alsoSheffield, are relatively more important in steel  making than inpig  iron  manufacture.   This is largely  owing  to a  great  localdemand for steel from the tinplate and  galvanised sheet industries in South Wales, and from the shipbuilding industry on the Clyde,and  to the  use of  a  large proportion of steel scrap instead of pigiron (amounting in the case of South Wales to over 70 per cent.)in the steelmaking process.  In Lincolnshire,  the  expansion of pigiron production has its counterpart in a marked expansion of steel production,  though the quantity of steel produced both before and since the war is less than the quantity of pig iron.   Other featuresindicated  by  the  table are  a marked growth of  steel productionin the Staffordshire,  &amp;e., area and a falling off in the West Coastdistrict.   42.  Most if not all of the steel producers are also steel rollers,the  steel ingots  being rolled at the steel works to some  more convenient  shape   such  as  blooms,  billets or bars.   Frequently,also, the steel works also  include rolling mills  for reducing the steel to more highly  finished forms,  such  as  girders, joists, platesand  rails.   In addition, there is a considerable number of rollingmills not attached to steel-producing works.   Firms owning these
works  are known as  re-rollers,  as  they buy rolled  steel and rollit  into  other  shapes.   These firms are  the  principal buyers  of imported semi-finished steel, though some of the works  that havesteel-producing capacity have since the war found it  desirable  at times to cease production of steel themselves and to import foreignsteel  for  their rolling  mills.   The  re-rollers  are distributedthroughout the country, generally in  the  steelmaking  districts.   48.  The finishing branches of the industry are in  generaldistributed among the1 iron  and steel producing districts.  The tubemakers are  mainly in Scotland, South Wales  and  the  Midlands,the wire makers in the Manchester and Birmingham districts, thegalvanised sheet makers in the Midlands and South  Wales, andthe tinplate  makers in South Wales.   44.  Even before the war there was a tendency towards verticalcombination of undertakings in the iron and steel industry by blast furnace owners acquiring control over  ore and coal  mines,  coke ovens and steel furnaces and mills.  During  the war period and immediately  afterwards many  large  undertakings  were formed,mainly  by combination of existing independent  concerns.   Thegeneral plan followed was to combine units engaged in  the differentsuccessive stages of manufacture so that the resulting  combinationcontrolled its coal and ore supplies, produced its own pig iron andsteel, worked the material  up into finished form and had a sellingorganisation  for the  disposal  of  its  products.   It  is  estimatedthat at the present time ten of  these groups possess about 47 percent, of the pig iron capacity and 60 per cent, of the steel capacityof the  country.  It is also estimated  that the pig iron  makerscontrol about 70 per cent,  of their  ore supply and 60  per cent,  ofthe coal and coke supplies.   45.  In the Armaments  Section  there has recently been a largeamalgamation.  The steel-producing interests of Vickers, Limited,Armstrong Whitworth  and  Company, Limited, and Cammell Lairdand  Company, Limited, have been combined to form  the EnglishSteel  Corporation,  Limited, the  engineering  interests  of thecompanies having  been separated from  the steel interests.   Thisamalgamation  differs  from those formed during the war,  as  itembraces a comparatively narrow range of interests.  It has  steelfurnaces and rolling mills, but produces no pig iron.   46.  A recent amalgamation is  that between Messrs. Dorman,Long &amp; Co., Ltd., and Messrs. Bolckow, Vaughan &amp; Co.,  Ltd.,two  of  the  existing large  vertical  combinations.   The  combinedundertaking, trading as Messrs. Dorman, Long&amp; Co., Ltd., is easilythe largest steel firm in the country and represents a very substantial part of the  whole  steel trade of the  North-East Coast.  A recentdevelopment in South Wales is the  formation of a new company totake over the ore, coke-oven and iron and steel  interests of Messrs.Baldwins, Ltd., and  Guest, Keen  and Nettlefolds, Ltd.  A stillmore recent  amalgamation  scheme  in Lancashire  involves theWigan  Coal and Iron  Company, Ltd., Pearson and Knowles  coal and  Iron Company,  Ltd.,  Partington  Steel and Iron  Company,Ltd., and Rylands Bros., Ltd.   There has also  been  a  development in Scotland where  Messrs. David  Colville and Sons, Ltd.,  havetaken over the business in heavy rolled material of Messrs. WilliamBeardmore  and  Sons,  Ltd.;  the  latter firm  will  in  futureconcentrate  on the production of heavy forgings.   47.  Other reconstructions  which  have taken  place recentlyinclude the  amalgamation  on the North-East  Coast of the SouthDurham Steel  and Iron Co., Ltd.,  and the Cargo Fleet Iron Co.,Ltd., which were already closely associated; and the amalgamationin the Glasgow district of eight firms making light castings to formAllied Ironfounders, Ltd.       (c) The Growth of Iron and Steel  Industries  Abroad.   48.  The iron and steel industry developed on the Continent andin the United States  much  later than in  the United Kingdom but during the present century  the growth of the industry in the UnitedStates, Germany, France and Belgium has been very rapid.   The     [20779]                                           o 2
United States steel industry is, in the main, in a different position from that of the rest of the world.  It is supplied with materials by its own varied mineral resources and it supplies its own  large and expanding market.   The rapid growth of the Continental industrydates from the discovery, about 1880, of the basic process of steelmaking which made  possible the use  of the plentiful supplies ofphosphoric ores in the Lorraine district.   Germany now uses, inaddition,  large quantities of ores from Sweden,  Spain and  New-foundland.  The Continental industry had  no advantage over thatof this country in regard to coal and this fact probably stimulatedthe introduction of methods of fuel economy on the Continent.   49.

Many of the foreign iron and steel industries are much more closely organised than is that of this country.  In the United States,the  United States Steel  Corporation  has for many  years been responsible for a large proportion of the output of that country, andthere are, in addition, other very large producers.   In Germany formany years the  Stahliverhsverband undoubtedly helped  the industryto push its way  into the markets of the  world.   The Stahlwerhsver-band was formed as a joint stock company in 1904 with a membershipat that time of 31 steel manufacturers.   These controlled practicallythe whole of the German output of so-called  &quot; A &quot; products, com-prising setui-finished  steel  in the form of ingots, slabs, blooms andbillets, puddled  blooms,  railroad supplies  (such as rails, ties, fish plates, bolts, spikes,  bed plates)  and structural steel.    Of the so-called &quot;B&quot; products (comprising  rods, steel bands, barrel hoops,rolled wire, sheet metal, tinplate,  tubes, cast steel railroad axles,steel forgings, steel rollers, etc.) the members  of the Verband didnot possess  a  complete monopoly.  In 1904 they controlled 88 percent, of these  products, a proportion which rose by 1912 to 95 percent.   51.   Members were required to dispose of &quot; A &quot; products only tothe Verband,  which was thus  responsible  for  selling the whole  ofthe German output of these products,  in  so  far as they were not
used in the production of more  highly finished products by  the firms that produced them.  Production was divided among members on  the  basis of quotas.  &quot;B&quot;  products were  also  regulated asregards  output, but they continued to be sold by the  undertakingsthemselves and not by the Verband.  As regards  &quot; A &quot; products theStahlwerksverband pursued a systematic policy of dumping abroadat low prices, rather than curtailing production,  when demand wasslack.   This at times led to extremely low prices.  To promote thesale of &quot; B &quot; products  abroad a system  of bounties was introducedintended to compensate undertakings  manufacturing such  products from purchased &quot; A &quot; products for the higher price which they hadto pay in the-home market as compared with the price abroad.    52.  Since the war the  Stahlwerksverband has been  reconsti-tuted.    The dumping of &quot;A&quot;  products  has apparently not beenrevived  as a considered policy, but an agreement was  reached  withthe manufacturers of &quot; B &quot; products  under which the latter werecompensated in respect of exports for the higher price which  theyhad to pay in Germany as compared with the world price  for their supplies of &quot;A&quot; products required in producing the  goods.   Thisresembled the pre-war arrangement in  regard to bounties except thatwith the disappearance of the dumping of &quot; A &quot; products the difier-ence  between  German  internal  prices  and  world prices   haspresumably been reduced.    53.   Continental  Steel Cartel. The territorial rearrangementsin Europe at the end of the war affected the iron and steel industryto  a  marked  extent,   especially by  transferring the  iron  oreresources, blast furnaces  and steel plant of Lorraine from Germanyto France; and by transferring Luxemburg from  the German to theBelgian Customs Union,  and the  Saar basin (temporarily)  from theGerman  to the  French  Customs Union.  At  the same time,  theiron and steel industry of Continental Europe was generally for someyears in a state of depression and it appeared  that  some generalregulation of production  might be in the common interest.  Underthe steel Agreement concluded on the  30th September, 1926, it was provided that the aggregate production of the parties  to the agree-ment (viz., the steel  industries  of  Germany,  Belgium, France,Luxemburg and the  Saar and later also of Czechoslovakia, austria and Hungary) should be fixed quarterly in advance, and that  eachparticipating group should  be entitled to contribute a certain per-centage  of the total, these percentages being in fact based on actualproduction during  the  first quarter of 1926.   Participating groups which produced more than their allotted quota were subject to fine,while those who produced less were entitled to compensation.    54.   With  the revival of  demand, the  aggregate  productionunder  the Steel  Agreement  has been  raised  and  during  thegreater  part of 1928 and 1929 the principal participants were, itis understood,  producing up to the full practical capacity of theirworks.   Towards the close of 1929, however, there was a falling offin the demand for iron and steel, in view of which a reduction of10 per cent, in output was decided on.    The results obtained by the steel Agreement have undoubtedly proved  disappointing  to  thoseparticipants who believed that regulation of production would bringabout higher prices for  iron and steel products.   In particular, Ger-many, which accepted a rather low quota in 1926, appears to havebeen hampered in some  ways  by the Agreement, as  the  Germanproducers incurred continual penalties  for overproduction.   To meet their complaints the original agreement was  modified, particularly by a division of the German quota into two parts; a home consump-tion quota and an  export quota.   The fine for exceeding the home consumption quota was  reduced, and  concessions were made asregards  the fines for exceeding the export quota.  The question ofmaking  the international cartel more effective in  the interests of allthe participants has for some time been under close consideration,and important developments have recently taken place.  In the firstplace more or less  informal agreements have been made  within thecartel aiming at the maintenance of uniform prices for exports of products such as steel bars.  Secondly,  an agreement was reached between the principal participating groups for the establishment inFebruary, 1980, of a system of export bureaux,  with  the object of
sharing out the export trade in certain products both internationally as between the groups and among the members in each group.    55.   The British steel industry has  not hitherto participated inthe Agreement.  It is understood that the quota offered was smaller than was acceptable to British manufacturers.    56.   Complete amalgamation of interests has also been carried further on the Continent than here.  In 1926 there was formed inGermany a very large combination of existing steel interests, called the Vereinigte Stahhverke A.G., which  controls about 40 per cent.of the steel production of the country.  In Belgium and France alsolarge concerns have been formed by amalgamation.    57.   Apart from the rapid increase in production in  the  moreimportant centres, there has  been  a  growth in the iron  and steelindustry in some of the newer centres.  Thus, India and Japan arenow substantial producers of iron and steel, Canada&apos;s production  is increasing, and  persistent efforts are being made to establish ironand steel industries in Australia and South Africa.(d) The More Recent History of the British Iron and Steel Industry.    58.  It will be seen from  the table given in paragraph 49 that although world production of pig iron in 1928 was nearly 25 per cent.above the average production immediately before the war, the UnitedKingdom  production  had in the same  period  decreased  by about81 per cent.  World steel production increased by about 64 per cent.and United Kingdom steel production by about 25 per cent.    59.  The decline in pig  iron production in the United kingdom is largely due to a decrease in exports of pig iron and to the increaseduse of  scrap in  steelmaking.   In  recent  years steel has  largelyreplaced wrought iron for many purposes, and a part of the increased production of steel is due to this cause.  In spite of this, the increasein steel production in the United Kingdom has been  relatively small.One important cause is the  increased  importation of steel products,particularly raw and semi-finished  steel, and other causes are theabsence  of  expansion of   home   consumption  and  of  exports.Bestricted home consumption is  to  be attributed largely to thedepression in the shipbuilding and  engineering industries.  Britishexport trade has not expanded because this country now meets with more  severe  competition from the other exporting countries  andfrom the  domestic iron and  steel industries  that have been estab-lished in many overseas markets.    60.  The recent difficulties  of the industry are not,  however,confined to the reduction in the volume of the  trade.  In order tomaintain production, even at  the level of recent years, prices havebeen reduced to  such a level that many  companies have made little or no  profit and the resources  of the industry have been  greatly reduced during the period.    61.  There has  also been  much unemployment in recent years in the  industry.  There are about 400,000 insured persons in thedifferent branches of the trade and  of these about 60,000  to 70,000have been unemployed for some years.    62.  During 1929, there was some improvement in the conditionof the  industry.   The first signs of this change were visible  at thebeginning of that year and  the improvement continued throughoutthe year.   The increased consumption of steel by the  shipbuilding industry was  probably the  most important  single cause  of theimprovement.  There was  also some tendency  to  an increase in continental prices,  which in the early part of 1929 were  nearer toBritish prices than they had been for some time; Continental prices were reduced again, however, in the autumn of 1929.  In addition the industry has since 1st  December,  1928, obtained some relief from railway charges.  The  railway freight rebate scheme provided,in anticipation of the general derating scheme, for a rebate of ljd. aton and 25 per cent, of the remainder  of the charges on coal and coke consigned to iron and steel works, and  of  10  per cent,  of the carriage charges on iron ore and limestone for iron and steel works.It. is estimated that  these rebates are equivalent on the average toabout 2/- to 2/8d. a ton of finished steel.
   63.  The improvement in  output  in 1929  is  shown in thefollowing figures of the  production of iron and steel during recent months :                 PRODUCTION in United Kingdom.(Thousand tons.)

There was also some improvement in foreign trade in 1928and 1929.  Exports increased and imports were lower.IMPORTS and Exports of Iron and Steel and Manufactures thereof.Imports.

Imports for thefirst three  months  amounted to 850,004  tons,  compared  with5S6,409 tons in the corresponding period in  1929 and 842,365 tonsin 1928.   For the same periods, exports were 983,847 tons in 1930,1,151,404 tons in 1929 and 1,058,578 tons in 1928.    65.  It will be  observed that the  increase in the tonnage of exports since 1927 has not been accompanied by an increase in their value.  Iron  and  steel  prices were relatively high during the early months of 1927 when the effect of the coal stoppage were still beingfelt.                    (e) Foreign  Competition.    66.

Both before the war  and in recent  years the bulk of steelimports  have consisted bf  semi-manufactured material which goesthrough further stages of manufacture in the iron and steel industryin this country.  The imported pig iron is used by the foundry tradein making castings and to some extent in steel making; the  steelblooms,  billets and slabs may be  rolled down into structural steel,wire rods, hoops and strips, rails, &amp;c.; the  steel bars and  tinplatebars are the raw material for the galvanised sheet, tinplate and back-plate industries;  the iron and  steel bars and angles, &amp;c, are used instructural work and in making a range of articles such as bolts andnuts;  and  the  strips are used for making tubes.   Most  of theincrease in imports consists of goods of this kind though there havebeen increases in  imports of plates and  sheets (probably largelyplates  for shipbuilding and boiler making), in  structural steel,  intubes and pipes,  in wire and in  wire nails.    69.   These imports come almost wholly from the nearer Con-continental countries.    Belgium,  the  largest  exporter to the  UnitedKingdom,  sent 1,445,000  tons  in 1928.    The next  in order areFrance and Germany, each of which exported 410,000 tons.   Con-continental iron and steel of these  kinds  has  been much cheaper thanthe  British material.   This may  be due to some extent to higherefficiency of some  of the Continental plants,  but the much lowerwages and freight&apos;charges  on the  Continent  are  asserted by Britishmakers to be more  important factors.    70.   The prices of iron and steel products  have been low for manyyears;  in January 1930 the index figure of wholesale prices showedan increase of 31 per cent, above 1918 for all commodities, but  anincrease of only  15&apos;2 per cent, for iron and steel.    71.   The export trade is shown in greater detail in the followingtable :

Exports  consist to a  much larger extent than imports ofgoods  which  are  ready  for  use  by  the  consumer or  by other.industries.  By far  the largest item, plates  and sheets,  includesblack plates for boiler making, motor body building, &amp;c, tin platesand  galvanised sheets.   Exports of each of  these three classes ofplates and sheets  show a substantial improvement over the years before the  war.   In railway  material, structural  material,  andtubes, this country  has approximately maintained  its  pre-war position.  &apos; 73.  There has,  however, been a heavy decline in the  exportof pig iron and  ferro-alloys.   Of  the 1,039,000 tons of  pig  ironexported annually before the  war, about 800,000  tons  consisted of  forge  and foundry  iron,  which  went  to the  Continentalmanufacturing countries as well as to Japan and the Dominions.Before the war British  pig iron was cheaper than the Continentalpig iron,  but  during recent  years  this  advantage has been much reduced, and has, at times, entirely disappeared.  There  has  alsobeen  an increase in blast furnace  capacity on the  Continent,  andthe Japanese  market has been lost to the new iron industries inIndia and China.   74.  The decline  in the exports of ferro-alloys is in  the maindue to a decrease in the trade in ferro-manganese with the UnitedStates, which  imposed very heavy duties on this material after thewar.   The  fall in exports of iron  bars  has been counterbalancedby  an  increase  in  exports  of steel bars,  steel  having  largelyreplaced wrought iron for this purpose.    (f) Recent Efforts for the Improvement of the Industry in                         Great Britain.   75.  We have  already described (paragraphs 44-47)  the effortsthat have been made by the Industry to improve  their competitive position by the  formation of larger manufacturing units throughthe amalgamation of existing concerns.   76.  Other efforts having the same  object include a number of marketing arrangements of restricted scope which  have been madewith branches  of  the Continental and United States industries.The  International  Bailmakers&apos;   Association,  including  British,Continental and United  States  interests, is a revival of a pre-warassociation, and involves a  division of markets  and a  fixing of
prices for steel rails.   The international Tube Makers&apos; association is a similar  association  between the tube  producers in  the samecountries,  and. covers  certain  classes  of  pipes  and  tubes.   Anagreement has also been made between the British  and the UnitedStates tinplate trades for a division of  the export trade.    77.   The trade, or members  of  it, have  made various otherjoint  efforts  to improve the  position,  mainly under the auspices of the National Federation of Iron  and Steel Manufacturers, an association which is fully representative of the trade and deals withall  subjects of general interest other than wages  and hours.  Ascheme has now been in force for some  time whereby a rebate fromthe usual list price is granted by certain  associated steel makersto shipbuilders and engineers who during a definite period under -take to buy only British steel.  It is  believed that this scheme hasbeen  successful in increasing the proportion of British materialused by  shipbuilders.  Another co-operative effort by steel makersaims  at  increasing the  export  trade.  It  is  understood  that  theprocedure under this scheme  is for the associated steel makers toarrange  to tender  for  a foreign  contract  at  a  price  which  it isthought  will  meet foreign competition,  to  allot the  contract to theworks best fitted to carry it out,  and to share between  them  any loss that may  be  incurred.   The  steel makers  concerned in  thisscheme recently sent a representative to Canada to  investigate thepossibility of an increase in  export of steel to that country  underthese   arrangements.    A still  more  recent  development,  whichpresumably supersedes the  arrangements last referred to, is  theformation of a central  selling  agency which controls the exporttrade  in  sections, girders and heavy  plates of nearly the whole ofthe industry.    78.   A good deal of work is also being done in the  directionof increasing the use of steel.   The prosperity  of the iron  and steel trade  is  of  great  importance to  the  railways,  and the railwaycompanies have undertaken to make more extended trials of steelsleepers, and to use, wherever practicable, steel instead of woodin the construction  of coaches and waggons.  The steel makers  andthe structural engineers have recently  formed an association (theBritish   Steelwork  Association) to  undertake research   into  theproblems connected with steel, structural  work, and to  conductpropaganda regarding the  rise of steel for  such  purposes.  Inaddition, the use of steel pit props is being slowly  extended.    79.   The  Industry have also devoted considerable attention tothe prosecution of  research.   For some  years  a Fuel  EconomyCommittee connected with the National Federation of Iron and SteelManufacturers  has  been at  work  on  problems connected  with  theuse of fuel in  the  industry,  and recently this work has been  puton  a  wider basis by  the formation of a Besearch  Council.  TheDepartment of  Scientific and Industrial  Research is making a grant for  this work.  It is proposed now to investigate thoroughly other aspects of  iron  and steel manufacture such as  steel making  and rolling mill practice.    80.   Finally, a  special form  of assistance was  granted to  theIndustry by Parliament under the de-rating scheme.  As  from the1st  October,  1929,  iron and steel  manufacturers have benefited in common  with other manufacturers by  the  relief  of three-quarters of their local rates.   In addition the rating relief of  the railways isbeing devoted  to a reduction of the  freight charges on certainselected traffics including coal and coke, iron ore and limestone foriron and steel works.  This reduction in railway charges has beenin operation since the  1st December,  1928.  It has  been  estimatedthat on the average  the rate&apos;relief on coal, ore and limestone mines,coke ovens, iron and  steel furnaces and mills will be equivalent toabout 8/- a ton of finished steel and as already stated (paragraph 62)that the  railway freight  rebates are equivalent to about 2*/- to  2/8a ton  of finished steel.  In cases where  steel makers own  their ownmines and coke ovens it can be assumed that they obtain the wholebenefit of these reductions.
                 (g) Inquiries Into the Industry.            (i) Board  of  Trade Committee,  1916-17.   81.  The situation  arising from the growth of  foreign competi-tion was examined in 1916-17 by a Committee, consisting of personsconnected with the industry, which was  appointed by  the  Boardof Trade &apos;&apos; to consider the position of the Iron and Steel Trades afterthe War, especially in  relation to international competition, and toreport what measures, if  any, are necessary or desirable in orderto safeguard that position.&apos;&apos;  The principal findings and recommendations  -tions  of the Committee may be summarised briefly as under :    82.  Iron Ore. The Committee recommended that an organisa-tion be formed comprising users of iron ore, and  others interestedin and essential to the conduct  of the  trade, to undertake theimport and distribution of foreign ores  in Great Britain and acquireinterests in ore properties abroad, and that such organisation shouldreceive Government  financial  assistance   as  necessary.   Thisrecommendation has not been carried out.   Proposals for collectivepurchase of ore have been  discussed,  but it is said that members would have  to commit  themselves  to the purchase  of a more or lessdefinite quantity of ore over a period  of years and this they werenot prepared to do in  existing  conditions.   It   may  be noted,however,  that British pig-iron manufacturers control their oresupply in this country  or abroad to the extent of about 72 per cent.of their  requirements.   83.  Export Sales  Association. The Committee recommendedthat  iron and steel manufacturers should associate themselves forthe purposes of export trade and should  form  common  sellingorganisations by the  extension and consolidation  of Associationswhich already exist. The Committee recommended an organisationdivided into  groups,  each  dealing  with  specific products,  theorganisation as a whole to  be able to  handle the  entire output ofthe country.   84.  In  1928 a Steel  Export Selling  Association was  formedcomprising  most steel manufacturers producing  for  export, forthe purpose of discovering new  markets.   We  understand  thatsome  success was attained.  The orders booked were divided amongthe members.  More recently a Central Selling Agency  controllingsubstantially all our exports of heavy  plates, girders,  and sectionshas been formed.   85.  New Plant. The Committee were of  opinion  that toorganise upon modern lines the iron and  steel production of GreatBritain demanded a radical reconstruction  of the  commercial andindustrial system and  that the  British industry should  raise itselfto a point  of productiveness and  efficiency  at which it would  bearcomparison with its competitors in Germany and America.  With onedissentient member, they were of opinion that the steel productionof the country must be raised to 15,000,000 ingot tons per year.Complete new units, blast furnaces, coke ovens, steel furnaces and rolling mills must be laid  down.  The plants must have a minimumcapacity  of  300,000 tons per annum in order to work economically.The  Committee consequently recommended that  the British  ironand steel manufacturers should be urged  to form combinations forthe purpose of laying  down large and well-designed new units forcheap production upon modern lines.  The companies formed tobuild and work these  plants should, if necessary,  receive  financial aid from the Government, especially  in  view of  the  high cost oflaying down large plants at that time  (1917).   86.  Protection. A Majority  of the  Committee recommended the enactment of anti-dumping legislation and merchandise  markslegislation;  co-ordination of  the  economic  policy  of  the  UnitedKingdom and the British Empire; the imposition of duties uponimported iron and  steel, and the  establishment of a system underwhich foreign syndicates and their representatives should carry on commercial and industrial  activities in the  United Kingdom  only under licence from the Government.
             (ii) Committee  on Industry and Trade.   89.  The Committee on Industry and Trade, of which Sir ArthurBalfour was Chairman, and which was appointed in 1924, issued in1928 a  Survey of the Metal  Industries, of which one chapter was devoted to the iron  and steel industry.  In their final  report theCommittee  referred  to the  position  of  the industry  as  follows(Cmd. 3282, pp.  185, 186) :       &quot; The situation in the iron and steel industry was described   in our &apos;  Survey of Metal  Industries.&apos;  As there shown,  British   practice  in  the manufacture  of iron  and steel tended  over  a   period of years before the war to fall behind continental practice.   The  problem of keeping up to date was no doubt in some respects   more difficult in a country where the iron and steel  industry had   grown to full  stature in an  earlier generation than in countries   which were establishing the industry for the first time on a large   scale, since the latter had not to contemplate the demolition of   existing  plant  and naturally built  their new  plant to the most   modern designs.  On the other hand, British undertakings which   had  built up adequate reserve funds during earlier  years should   have had no serious difficulty in financing the renewal of their   plant.      &apos;&apos; As  explained above,  the war-time extensions and improve-   ments in the industry did not completely modernise it,  and, owing   to the extensive  re-construction effected  in  the  iron and steel   plants of Germany and other continental countries, the average   British practice probably remained behind  the  average conti-   nental practice.  Much has been done by British iron and steel   manufacturers since the war to improve their practice, and the   industry is undoubtedly far more efficient than it was ten years   ago.  But it is doubtful whether British  practice has improved   as rapidly  since  the close of the  war as that of  some of our   principal competitors.   Hence the need for modernising British   iron and steel plant  has become more pressing.      &apos;&apos; The very great increase in world productive capacity which   took place  during and  immediately after the war  was unfortunate-   nately not  balanced by  a corresponding growth of demand, with   the result that the industry has been unremunerative.  Although,   even during the depression, there  has been a not inconsiderable   expenditure of capital on improvements  in this  country where   this appeared likely to be clearly and immediately remunerative,   the  companies have  not attempted (and doubtless in most cases   have not possessed the  credit) to carry out thorough reconstruc-   tion.  As shown in our  &apos; Survey of Metal Industries &apos;  (pp. 48-5),   many of them are already heavily  burdened  by interest charges   on debentures raised since the end of the war.   87.  Royalties and  Wayleaves. The Committee reported  that&apos;&apos; drastic revision  of  the  general  system of royalty  and wayleaverents is urgently called for.&quot;  Generally,  the Committee favoured an extension of the  principle  of  arbitration to the  settlement orrevision of royalty and wayleave rents and the setting up of localcourts of arbitration.  The Committee also emphasised the necessityof Governmental action to encourage the search for and exploitation of those  minerals  which  remain  undiscovered  in the  UnitedKingdom.   88.  It may be noted  that this question was also considered bythe Committee  on the Acquisition for Public  Purposes of Eightsand  Powers in  connection  with  Mines and Minerals (see  ThirdBeport, Cmd.  156 of 1919).  The Committee recommended that aSanctioning Authority  (composed of members of  both  Houses ofParliament and others) be created, which would have power to make orders for the compulsory acquisition or working of minerals, or of rights in, over or under land, affecting the working of such minerals.The Authority would be able to deal with applications for compulsoryorders for wayleaves, both above and below ground, and where theterms of a mining lease hamper the development of minerals to revise the terms of the  lease.
                           O J                           H A-   &apos;&apos; No doubt  the  economic condition of the industry may beexpected to improve as the demand for steel recovers, and as theprice of foreign steel rises to the level of British steel.   If thishappens the prospect of a reasonable profit may be expected tomake conditions more favourable for the investment of capital in the re-equipment of the industry.   It is obvious, however, thatin many undertakings drastic financial  reorganisation  will berequired for the restoration of borrowing power.  In the case ofsome of the less efficient  undertakings, moreover, amalgamationwith stronger units or groups may be essential,  production being concentrated in the more efficient plants and  the sales  organisa-tion and general administration being strengthened.&quot;            (iii) Applications for Safeguarding Duties.   90.  An application was made to the Board  of Trade in June1925 on behalf of representative organisations in  the iron and steelindustry for an  inquiry under the  Safeguarding of  industries procedure with a view to the  imposition  of  a duty on  pig iron,wrought iron,  heavy  steel  products and  wire,  wire  netting  andwoven wire.   This  application was  considered by the Committeeof Civil Besearch.  In December 1925, after the Committee hadfinished its investigation, the then Prime  Minister  (Mr. Baldwin)announced in the House of  Commons  that, had the  Governmentbeen able to deal with  the iron  and steel industry in isolation, theymight have regarded the case  for inquiry  under  the safeguarding of Industries procedure as complete, but that  it  had become clearthat  the. safeguarding of a basic industry of this magnitude wouldhave repercussions of a far wider character which might have beenheld to  be in conflict with the  Government&apos;s declaration  in regardto a  general  tariff.   They had, therefore,  come  to the  conclusionthat  the application could not be granted.   Subsequently separateapplications made early in 1926 on behalf of the iron  and steelwire industry,  the  steel joist  industry and  the  wire  netting andwoven wire industry were rejected on the ground that the decisionof the Government  on the general applications from the  industrycovered any applications from sections of the  industry.  The mainapplication was renewed  in  1927,  but was  rejected by  referenceto the original decision.  An application under  the  safeguarding of Industries procedure  received in February 1925,  and renewedin 1927 and  1929,  in respect of the  wire  nail  and shoe rivetindustries, was rejected by the  Board of Trade on the ground thatthe industry  was not of substantial importance,  and  that (in thecase  of wire nails) abnormal competition was not  proved.          (iv) Other Recent Applications for Inquiries.   91.  In  August 1928  the Executive Council of the Iron  andSteel  Trades Confederation appointed a sub-committee  to  inquire into the condition of the Iron and Steel Industry, and particularly the question of  safeguarding.  The Sub-Committee recommendedthat  the Confederation  should direct the  attention of the  LabourParty &quot; to the imperative need, without further delay, of a  fulland  impartial  inquiry  into the  Industry  by  a  competent  and representative Committee set up for that purpose, which committee shall  have the necessary  power conferred upon it to  ascertain asfar as possible all  the  facts  with  regard to  the  present  positionof the  industry,  with  special reference to the  nature  of  thecompetition  in the home market, and to  make such recommenda-tions whether as regards action by the industry itself or legislative action as in the  considered  judgment  of the  Committee  thecircumstances require,  due  regard  being paid  to  all  legitimateinterests.&quot;   92.  Following this recommendation, the Iron and Steel TradeConfederation at the  close of  1928  requested the  Government toappoint a Boyal Commission  to  investigate  the troubles  of  the
industry.   This  request was  refused in a letter from Mr. Baldwindated the  8th  February,  1929,  on the  ground  that  it  was notrequired either  to  supply  information  not otherwise available or as a necessary preliminary to effective action.   93.  After the  General Election in  1929, the position of theIron and Steel Industry was  further considered, and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  in  July  of that year constituted the  present Inquiryas a  Sub-Committee  of  the Committee  of  Civil Besearch.   InJanuary 1980  the latter  body  was absorbed by the  economic advisory   Council,  of  which   this  Sub-Committee   became  aCommittee.Ill-MATERIALS  AND PROCESSES IN THE  HEAVY  IRON                 AND STEEL INDUSTRIES.                       (a)  Raw  Materials.   94.  Great  Britain  has  great natural  advantages in regard  tothe two main materials for steel-making,  viz., coal and iron ore.Supplies of suitable coking coal  are still abundant.  Some  of the ore fields in this country are now exhausted, but others have been developed and  adequate supplies of suitable foreign ores  are also available.   Some steel Companies have interests in  foreign oremines;  others buy  on the open  market.  Ore  is,  we understand,generally bought for the  British industry on short-term contracts of (say) not more than two or three years.  In Germany contractsare.,  however, made for ten or more years ahead.  This difference of policy is due to the fact that the British steel makers individuallydo not  feel sufficient confidence  in the future to  enable  them  toenter into  long-term contracts.  Efforts are, however, being madeto form a central ore-buying organisation for  the  whole industry.Such an organisation should be of definite advantage  in  enabling the industry to obtain assured supplies on more favourable  terms.   95.  Several iron and  steel makers have suggested to us thatthere is room for improvement in the treatment  and  preparationboth of the coal and of the ore that they require.  They desire ahigher and a more uniform quality of coke than is readily obtain-able to-day.  They urge that arrangements should  be made for thecoal to  be better cleaned  before coking.   Coke ovens should not take supplies of coal haphazard  from any colliery, but should  beable to draw regular supplies  from a  group of collieries, and,  ifnecessary,  to blend the different coals  to obtain a uniform quality of coke.  Blending of  coal is possible  when the  coke  oven  works are in the near vicinity of blast furnaces and steel works.   It is also possible when,  as many are now inclined to think is more desirable,the coke oven plants are situated in central positions which  enablethem to draw supplies from a number of collieries and to  supplya number of  steel works.  In the former case, the surplus coke ovengas is available as fuel for the later stage of steel manufacture, and,in the latter, it may obtain a more profitable  outlet for town use.In view of other considerations to which account must  be paid,e.g., the  length of haul of the coal to  the  coke  ovens,  &amp;c, themethod to be  adopted can  only be decided  in  the  light  of theparticular circumstances of each  case.    96.   &quot;Witnesses also agreed that  the  organisation of home oresupplies could be improved.  They pointed out that, in one  of thenewer  fields, Northamptonshire,  there were  some  fifty  differentmines,  all  of which supply ore of different grades.   The ore  shouldbe crushed  and cleaned at the mines, but  the  necessary plantwould,  no doubt, be too expensive for  any one mine to undertakeits installation.  The suggestion was made  that the mines  shouldbe amalgamated and central  ore-treatment plants erected.  Thedifficulty  of  carrying out such proposals lies in the great  variety of quality  of the ores from the existing mines,  and the consequentdifficulty in  assessing the relative values of the mines, and in thefact that some of the mines are owned by steel-making firms who take their supplies  direct.  It was also urged that the  industry isnot  in  a position to provide the  substantial  amount of capital that
would be necessary.  Similar concentration would, it was suggested,also  be useful for  the ore fields in Lincolnshire,  the Clevelanddistrict  and the North-West Coast.   97.  These proposals with regard to coke and ore are designedto contribute to *the better preparation of  the materials generally,before they are fed to the blast furnaces, particularly with the objectof obtaining a  more uniform burden.  This, it is believed,  would lead  to substantial economies.   Its attainment would necessitatesome reorganisation and  a substantial  outlay  of capital.                      (b) Blast Furnaces.   98.  The evidence  which we  have received points generally tothe conclusion  that the blast furnaces are the  weakest part  of the equipment of  the industry in the United Kingdom.  Some  of thefurnaces a2-e modern and well  equipped,  but many  are  old  and relatively, or actually, inefficient.  Of some 460 blast  furnaces inthe country, only some 160 were, on the  average, in blast during1929.   The furnaces now at work are the more efficient furnaces.Witnesses  claimed  that  though  improvements  could  be made inmany of these, the best practice in Great Britain compares well inregard  to  design  of  plants,  technical  knowledge,  and operatingability with that of any other country.   99.  The British blast furnaces are  often  criticised on  theground  that their output per day compares unfavourably with thatof furnaces in other countries.  Efficiency should not be judgedby output  alone.   A large furnace is uneconomical, unless it  isrun  continuously to produce one grade  of iron.  In  this countrymany grades of iron are required and the demand is not uniform.It is, therefore, often more economical to install, say, two furnaceswith a capacity of 200 tons a day each than to install one with a capacity of 400 tons a day.   100.   When a revival of the industry  in the United Kingdomtakes place, new  blast  furnaces  and  coke oven  plant  will  benecessary.  Production of  metallurgical  coke  is  said  to  be onlysufficient to meet actual requirements at the existing low rates ofproduction.   Indeed, there is even now  some  scarcity of coke,whenever the  demand for  pig iron improves.  If, in addition tothe steel at present produced in this country, that now importedwas  made by  British manufacturers, nine and a half million tonsof pig iron would be  required annually.   One witness submitted the following tentative estimates  of the cost that would be involvedin providing fully efficient plant  for the production of  pig iron onthis  scale.  The cost of  reorganisation of  the  home ore-fields  andthe  erection of ore treatment plant is  put at about  1,000,000.The  five new centralised coke oven plants  thought  to be desirable,producing in all 2-J million tons  of  coke a year, would cost about 4,000,000.   Twenty  new blast furnace  plants,  each capable ofmaking normally  400 tons  of  iron a  day,  would  cost  about 8,000,000.  The cost of modernising the  160 blast furnaces nowat work  was   estimated  at  5,000,000.   The  modernisation ofexisting coke oven plants would  involve further expenditure.                        (c) Steel Works.   101.   The  average level of efficiency  of the  steel works  and rolling  mills  of  the country  is higher  than that of the blastfurnaces.   Some of the plants are modern,  many are of reasonableefficiency,  and comparatively few would  be regarded as obsolete.The  expenditure of  large  sums of capital would, however,  berequired to modernise much of the plant and to secure an adequatebalance among the different units of a complete  steel works.   102.   In the opinion of the steel industry,  as disclosed in their evidence before us, the  defects  in the  iron and  steel producingcapacity of the country  are due to a  variety of  causes.   Largeextensions of plant were, for example, made during the war period,but  these were designed  solely  with a view to war  needs and inmany cases were  not adapted to peace-time  requirements.  The
                               &apos;i4cost of these extensions was, it is  true, met in part by the State,but  the industry itself found large sums for  this purpose during and immediately after the war.   It is  claimed  by  the industry thatthe  Government&apos;s contribution,  paid  largely by  way of remission of Excess Profits Duty, was quite inadequate.  The capital required was raised largely by the creation of prior charges, and the heavy burden  of these charges  constitutes  a  serious  handicap  to  theindustry.   In addition, for many years the  iron  and steel makershave, in general, made little or no profit and  have been unable tomake adequate,  or in some cases any, allowance for the  depreciationand obsolescence  of their plant.   In  the  same period,  foreigncompetition, particularly in semi-manufactured steel,  has been very severe.   As  the costs  of  production  are  lower  on the Continentthan in this country,  it has been necessary for  British manufac-turers, in order  to secure orders, to reduce prices  to very low levels(see paragraph  70).    103.   In many cases the prices taken afford no margin of profitand the  work has been undertaken merely to reduce losses dueto operating plant at less than  full capacity.  In addition, foreignsteel has  been  sent  to this country from time  to time at prices which have appeared  at times  to  bear little  relation  to cost andwith  which the  home  makers were unable  to compete.   On this account many works in this country have, at different times, been forced to  cease work.   Irregular working  raises  the  costs  ofproduction, and these frequent  stoppages  have made it still moredifficult  for British makers  to bring their costs down to a  competi-tive level.    104.   The steel  makers,  consequently,  regard the defects  intheir equipment mainly as the result, rather than  the cause,  oftheir difficulties. They have not been able to  maintain their plant at its former high level of  efficiency, or to obtain those economiesthat  are  possible by  continuous working  for the  production  ofstandardised articles.  Most of the witnesses who appeared on behalfof the steel industry said that, even if its equipment were  modernand thoroughly  efficient,  it would  be impossible for  the  Britishindustry  to revive in present conditions.   They allege that higherrailway  rates and  labour  charges, including the cost of social services,  constitute a permanent handicap on  the British  industry by  making its costs higher than those on  the  Continent.  they also allege that the allowance permitted by the  Revenue authorities for depreciation is insufficient.   Further,  Continental  makers are free to  sell their surplus  production at very low7 prices  in thiscountry whenever they  find it  convenient to  do  so, thus  causingBritish  works to close.   If these  conditions  were to  continue itwould, in their view, be impossible for any British works, howeverefficient, to make a  reasonable, profit  after  setting aside sufficientsums for depreciation.  Without some security against Continentalcompetition of this kind they regard the position of the  British  steelmaker as  desperate.    105.   The position of the steel works which are associated  withthe finishing branches of the industry  is, on the whole, rather less serious.    One witness,  representing a company owning both  steelworks and finishing  works, said  that their finishing mills  obtainedtheir supplies  of steel from their own steel works; and  that, takingresults over a long period of time, this course had been profitableto them, although at times their competitors in the finishing trade had obtained Continental steel at very low prices. The advantageof keeping their  works running continuously  had compensated themfor their higher costs, even at times when Continental prices were particularly low. We were  informed that another works, supplyingsemi-finished material to its associated companies, had been reason-ably  successful  over a period of years.   It  had not, up  to  thepresent, been able to earn profits regularly,  but alterations  were inprogress,  from which it was hoped to  obtain economies amountingto as much as 10s. a ton in the cost of production of steel.  Anothersteel-making concern which had regularly  supplied  its associated companies with  steel had  drawn up plans for improvement in  itsore-handling equipment and other parts of its plant.   When these plans were put  into operation,  it was estimated  that  the  savings
which would be effected  would enable the concern to reduce costssufficiently to enable it to produce steel at prices equal to the cost of comparable foreign steel  delivered at the works.   106.  Although many steel  works  are  associated with rollingmills for producing finished iron and  steel  products, a substantial part  of  the  finishing trade  is in the  hands of independent  firms which buy semi-finished  steel for re-rolling.  These firms, as wellas the composite steel-producing and finishing  concerns, frequentlybuy foreign  semi-finished material.   The finishing mills are widely distributed throughout the country and are not,  in  general, nearthose districts such as Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire or the NorthEast Coast,  which  are  specially suitable  for the production  of ordinary steel at low costs.  There would be  great advantages ingrouping the finishing mills  near the  steel  works.  Freight wouldbe saved and the surplus gases of the coke ovens and blast furnaceswould be available for the rolling-mills.   107.  It  has  also been represented to  us  that,  for  manypurposes,  the  finishing  mills  are  satisfied with the  quality  of imported basic Bessemer steel,  which  is  cheaper to  produce thanopen-hearth steel,  but is  not now made in this country.  We under-stand that there is no technical difficulty in making steel by  the basic Bessemer process in selected districts in the United Kingdom.This process of steel-making was  abandoned in this country  infavour of processes yielding a more reliable product, but the growing demand for steel for purposes for which quality is of less importance,warrants further consideration of the  possibility  of again  using  it.   IV. OTHER  SECTIONS  OF  THE IRON AND STEEL                          INDUSTRY.   108.   The tin plate  and  sheet  sections of the industry havebeen relatively prosperous in recent years.   Production has been increasing fairly steadily and greatly exceeds that of pre-war years.In both sections a large part of the production is exported.                         (a)  Tin Plates.   109.   The  tin  plate  trade  is  concentrated  in South Wales.There are a few large firms owning both steel works  and tin platemills, and these firms do a large part of  the tin plate trade.  Thereare also many small firms, which are dependent on other  firms fortheir supplies of steel.  It appears, however,  that not a very large part of the production is normally made from foreign steel.  In spiteof the large number of separate producing units,  the tin plate trade has been  able to co-operate with the tin plate  makers in the UnitedStates  for some regulation of competition in export markets.  Thelatter have  a  very large  home market  in which  high prices  are obtained,  and often sell at low prices in many of the export markets.The British and United States tin plate industries have agreed thatexport markets shall be divided in such a way that the British makersobtain about 70 per cent, of the total export business, and the UnitedStates makers about 80 per cent.  There is no other country with atin plate  industry  approaching in  magnitude that of the UnitedKingdom  or the United States, but there are  growing industries insome Continental countries.   110.   There is no central  selling organisation, but one  largegroup has set  up a selling agency  which disposes  of  a substantial part of the products of this section.   There are many modern mills,but there  are a number on which money could advantageously be spent on improvements.   New plant is, however, being installed toproduce tin plates suitable for the high speed can-making machinerynow being used.  The manufacture of cans is, of course, one of thelargest outlets for tin plates. It was suggested to us that the Govern-ments of the Crown Colonies might assist the  tin plate industry byfostering the development of can-making and the canning of products in their territories.
                (b)  Black and Galvanised  Sheets.    111.   The  black  and galvanised sheet  section is more  widely distributed  than the tin  plate  section.   The  chief  centres  are Staffordshire, South  Wales  and Scotland.   There has  been eom- paratively little foreign competition in the black sheet or galvanised sheet  trade, either  in the  home or in export  markets.   Some countries have,  however,  by means  of   high  tariffs,  developed industries to supply their own home needs, the black sheets in some cases being imported  for galvanising.  There has also been recently an expansion of galvanised sheet manufacture on the Continent, and some  indication  of  keener  competition in export markets.   The United States also export  sheets  at low prices  when they have a surplus.    112.   The organisation of this trade is similar to that of the tin plate trade.  Three  large firms make about half the total output, but  there are  many small firms.   There is  no central selling organisation, but the  Sheet Makers&apos; Conference regulates production by allocating quotas  to  each  member, levying  fines  for  over- production and giving compensation for deficiencies.  Assistance is sometimes given by  the Conference to  enable  members to retain difficult export markets.                     (c) Wrought-Iron Trade.   118.   The wrought iron  section  is suffering from exceptionally severe depression owing partly to  the replacement  of wrought ironby steel, and partly to foreign competition.   No satisfactory substi- stute for the old manual methods of puddling has ever been found,and  these are  very  arduous and expensive.  The much cheapermaterial,  steel,  is, therefore,  used in place of wrought  iron wherever possible.  There are also large imports, mainly from Belgium,  of aninferior and cheaper material, consisting mainly of soft steel, whichis  used for much of the less important work for which wrought ironwas formerly employed.  Serious complaint is made that this inferiormaterial is  imported  and sold under the description of &apos;&apos; wroughtiron &quot; to the detriment of the makers of the  genuine article.  Thereis  little foreign competition in genuine wrought iron, but, as its price is  necessarily comparatively high,  the  demand  is  small and  isdecreasing.   114.   Since the war large sums have been spent on improvementin  plant.  For some years an  experimental plant was operated by theindustry  with the object of finding some  method of  mechanicalpuddling;  the  experiments,  however, were unsuccessful.   Therewere 94 works making puddled iron in 1918,  but 58  of them have since disappeared or have abandoned this part of their business.                       (d)  Crucible Steel.   115.   The crucible steel  section  has  also  suffered considerablecontraction.  The special steels (alloy steels  and high  carbon steels)were formerly all made in the crucible, but steel made  in the electricfurnace,  though possibly not of  such  uniformly high  quality ascrucible steel,  is now very  extensively  used for many  purposes.Foreign competition has been increasing both in the home and export markets, and high tariffs have been raised  against this country inmany  consuming markets.   The  production  of crucible  steel has declined  from about  42,500  tons in 1914 to about 18,600&apos; tons in1928.  The  industry has been working short time and is producingat  only some 25  per  cent, of its capacity.   The number of  firms engaged on  crucible steel making is relatively large.   The witnesseswho appeared before us saw no advantage in amalgamation in thissection, owing to the specialised character of the steels produced.               (e) Wire and Wire Manufacturers.   116.   Consumption of  wire and wire  products  is  increasingfairly  rapidly,  and foreign  competition  is  the chief cause of the
difficulties  of  the  wire  manufacturers.    Continental  countries,particularly Belgium, have obtained  a large  share  of the  british market in the standard wire products of ordinary steel.  The Britishmakers have only been able to  hold their position by  producingspecial sizes or shapes to  suit individual consumers and by makingthe higher grades of  material, such  as high carbon steel wire forropes.   The  total production of wire  in  Great Britain is about800,000 tons a  year.  Imports of wire and wire  products amountedin 1929 to nearly 140,000 tons, and exports to about 180,000 tons.There  is  a large  number of producing units,  and economies in production would  follow  their amalgamation into  larger groups.Costs of production on the Continent are lower than in this country,largely, in the view of the  British makers, owing  to lower wage rates.&apos;  It  is also said that foreign  wire and  wire products  aresometimes sold in this country at  prices below the cost at whichthey were produced.   117.   In  one branch of this trade, viz., wire netting, an  agree-ment was  made  in  1926 regarding  prices with the Belgian  andGerman  makers, but  this  was short-lived, owing  to competition from makers in  one  producing  country,  who refused to becomeparties to the agreement.   118.   Foreign competition in  the home market in  another important  product wire  nails is  very severe.   Imports of wirenails amount to  some  60,000 tons a year, and home production to some 18,000 tons a year.  The latter consists mainly of unusualsizes and shapes  of nails.                (f) Steel Castings and Forgings.   119.   The Castings and Forgings  section is also in a  verydepressed condition.  Plant  and equipment were expanded to  meetwar needs, but much of it has since been idle owing to depressionin the home engineering and shipbuilding industries, and to foreigncompetition.  Much of the existing plant is modern.   The financialposition of most of  the companies is bad and is becoming worse.   120.   It is not likely that profits  will  again be earned  until further  schemes of amalgamation and reorganisation have  beencarried  out by which available orders  could be concentrated  in a smaller number of fully employed  works.   We  were  told,  forexample, of one foundry built a few years ago  at a cost of ^250,000which is  now not  working.  It cannot be  kept  fully occupied inpresent conditions,  and it  has been  found  more  economical to close it completely.  Some  time ago  the British  makers had  priceagreements with one another by which they  aimed at ensuring areasonable profit, but these broke down when foreign competitionbecame severe.   121.   The lower  Continental prices are  said by the industryto be due to the larger and more  regular output  of the foreignmakers and  to  lower standards of wages and working  conditions on the Continent.   Foreign  forgings are also said to  be, in general,of inferior quality  to the British,  and  much of the  work obtained by British makers  is for material that  must pass the most severetests.  In the case of steel castings, some  complaints were madeto us  by representatives   of  the shipbuilding  and engineering industries  regarding  the quality of the British  product.  Britishcastings were said to be inferior to the  castings made by  the  most efficient foreign makers and to be much more expensive.  In sofar as  these criticisms  are well-founded, they constitute a further argument for reorganisation in this section of the industry.   122.   Many of the firms making  steel castings and  forgingshave  other important  interests.   They are  steel-makers,   ship-builders or engineers.  They are nearly all  associated in  the  SteelCastings  Association or in  one or  other of the  Forge-masters&apos;Associations.
               V.-IRON AND  STEEL SCRAP.    123.   Steel Scrap has become almost as important as pig ironas a material  for steel manufacture, the estimated consumption of scrap in steel-making in the United Kingdom being 4 million tonsa year.  Before 1914 it was only about li million tons a year.  Asimilar increase in the use of scrap has occurred in other countries.It is estimated that of the 4 million tons of scrap used about half is steel  works scrap, the  remainder  consisting  of  miscellaneousmaterial,  such as the waste  produced in engineering works,  oldrails, and the  product of the breaking up of ships, machinery and plant,  and other iron and steel articles.    124.   A substantial  amount   of  scrap  from  war  material,including ships, has  been available in past years, and also  therehave been periods of very low steel production, as in 1921 and  1926,when consumption has been small and some accumulation of  scraphas  occurred.   For some years, therefore,  scrap  prices  were low and supplies were abundant.  The  scrap from war material is nowexhausted and the steel  trades in this  and  other countries  havebeen active  during the last three years.   Supplies of  scrap have,therefore, become scarcer.    125.   The  Continental iron and steel-producing countries haveprohibited the  export of scrap, and as these are also the chief scrap-producing countries, there is little opportunity of increasing supplies in this country by means  of imports.  In  the  last two or  threeyears  Continental countries have been  drawing, to  a substantialextent, on  British supplies.   In  1926 British  exports of  scrapamounted to  71,943  tons;  in  1927 to 260,881  tons;  in 1928  to343,737 tons;  and in  1929  to 423,950 tons.  In the years beforethe war exports averaged some 135,000 tons a year.  Some of thisexported material, such as cast-iron scrap and nickel-steel scrap, isnot suitable for ordinary steel-making; some of it goes to the  East,where  it is  used again without re-manufacture.    126.   The   following table  gives particulars of the  export  of scrap in 1929  : Quantities and Values of Exports of Iron and Steel, old and scrap,        fit only  for Re-manufacture (including Old Rails).Consigned to 	Tons.	Poland Germany Belgium Spain Italy ... Other countries Total	108,564 46,527 81,141 95,055 35,186 57,477	355,912 156,419 247,702 349,155 122,606 259,543	423,950	1,491,339   127.  A substantial proportion of the exported scrap is used inthe Continental steel  industries  and there are special reasons insome cases for these purchases by Continental steel makers.  some countries, such as Poland, which has, in the last few years, been avery large  importer  of British scrap, have heavy import  duties on steel and pig iron, but none on scrap.  Their domestic pig iron pro-duction is insufficient to supply the steel furnaces, and it is cheaperto buy foreign  scrap  even  at high prices than to import pig iron.Formerly,  Poland obtained supplies  of  scrap from  Germany, butthe agreement between the  two  countries permitting these importsfrom  Germany, in spite  of the prohibition of exports from  thatcountry, lapsed a few years ago.  Moreover, Polish steel works cancompete in some British markets for scrap, such as  London, on atleast equal terms with British steel  makers, as freight to Polandis as low as it is to some British steel works.   The cost of transportfrom  London  to South Wales was,  for  example, given to us as17s. 6d. a ton by rail and as 6s. a ton by water, with, in the latter case,  an unloading charge of 4s. 2d. per ton, and in addition rail
freight  from port to  steel works of from Is.  lid.  to  4s. 5d. perton.  The freight however, from London to Dantzig is only  about8s. per  ton.   The Commercial Treaty recently  negotiated between germany and Poland provides for an export of 165,000 tons of scrapannually from  Germany to Poland.   When the Treaty has been ratified  and these provisions come into force, the demands of Polandfor scrap from  the  United  Kingdom  are likely to  be materiallydiminished.    128.  There is no doubt that during the last few years steelworks in some parts of the country have been handicapped at timesby the scarcity and high price of scrap.  In the spring  of 1929, forexample, steel works both in this country and on the Continent werebusy; there were heavy demands for scrap, and its price rose  abovethe corresponding price for pig iron.  This is exceptional, as the priceof scrap is usually a few shillings a ton below that of pig iron.  Inmore recent months  the  position  has become easier;  prices havefallen and supplies are more abundant.    129.  Steel makers desire a restriction on the export of scrap,similar  to that in force  in other European  countries.   The  scrap merchants,  who  are  responsible for the collection,  and in  some respects for the production of the scrap, have put to us the other sideof the  question.   They claim that scrap collection and sorting iscarried  on with only  a small margin of profit, and that unless  themerchant can  obtain the  full value of the scrap he will be unable tomaintain the present volume of supplies.  The shipbreaker would beless able  to compete with foreign  shipbreakers  in purchasing  oldships if he were restricted in the way he disposes of his scrap.  a restriction on the export of scrap might lead, therefore,  to a restric-tion on the export of  ships which would seriously interfere with thenormal  course of business of the shipowner.  Even if such a coursewere  feasible  we should,  therefore,  feel  great  hesitation  in recommending its adoption, as we are doubtful whether it would bein the interests of the steel makers, or  would serve the interests ofthe country  as a whole.  International obligations, however,  render it impossible for any export prohibition of scrap  to be adopted bythis country.    The  Anglo-German Commercial Treaty  of  1924precludes Great Britain from imposing a prohibition on the exportof scrap to Germany, and most-favoured-nation provisions in existingcommercial treaties with most other countries prevent prohibition of export to  them unless the prohibition applies also to Germany andall other countries.   In addition, the International Convention forthe abolition of import and export prohibitions and restrictions alsorenders impossible the  imposition of  such  a prohibition.   ThisConvention is  already in  force temporarily as regards this country,and will come  into operation permanently when a sufficient numberof States have ratified it.    130.  We  have no proposals to make, therefore, directed  solelytowards the improvement of scrap  supplies,  but we think that  the consolidation and reorganisation of  the industry that we recommendfor other reasons will also be of assistance regarding  scrap.   Thescrap merchants think they would  be  able to improve  the position for the  steel maker if the latter kept them more fully  informed ofhis future requirements.  There is no general buying organisationamong the steel makers;  each maker goes into the market for scrapas and when he wants it.   A better understanding between buyer andseller as to what the former wanted would clearly help to stabilise a trade of this kind, and we have no doubt that  organisation of  the steel trade into a number of larger units would greatly assist in  the attainment of  this understanding.       \                 VI.-WAGES AND HOURS.   131.  We have  already referred (paragraph 6) to  the  arrange-ments made by His Majesty&apos;s Government, on  our recommenda-tion,  for the despatch of officers by the  Ministry of  Labour as a mission to investigate conditions of hours and wages in the chiefContinental steel-making countries,  in conjunction  with represen-tatives of the British Iron and Steel  Trades Employers&apos; association and the Iron and Steel  Trades&apos; Confederation.
   132.  The Report  of this  Mission gives the  result of their investigations in  France,  Belgium,   Luxemburg,  Germany and czechoslovakia,  and contains a large  amount of information  not previously available in this country.   We  submit it as a separatedocument for the consideration of the  Economic  Advisory Council,who  will, no doubt, consider whether they should recommend HisMajesty&apos;s Government  to  secure  the  concurrence of the  british iron and  Steel  Trades  Employers&apos; Association  and the Iron andSteel Trades&apos; Confederation in its presentation  to Parliament  asa Command Paper.  . 133.  From  the  Mission&apos;s  Report  the following  general con-elusions can be drawn :    (i)  The blast furnaces  in all  the  countries  visited  work con-tinuously, with three shifts, the usual hours of work for shift workersthus being 56 hours a week.  A similar practice is followed in GreatBritain.   (ii) The melting shops in the principal steel-producing countries on the Continent begin work at times varying from 6 P.M. on Sundayto midnight  Sunday, and  finish  work at 6 A.M. on the followingSunday.   In certain cases preparatory work begins about  4 hoursearlier.  The hours of effective work  for each of the three sets ofshift workers employed range, therefore, from about 49 to 52 hours a week.  In Great Britain, the shops generally begin work  at timesvarying from 2 P.M.  Sunday to 6 A.M.  on Monday,  and finish work at 1 P.M. or  2 P.M. on Saturday.   The hours of  effective work  foreach of the  three  shifts range, therefore, from 42^ to 47f hours aweek.    (iii) The  rolling mills on  the Continent  begin  work at 6 A.M. onMonday and finish work at 6 A.M. on Sunday.  The hours of effectivework for each of the three sets of shift workers are,  therefore, 48 hours a week.  In Great Britain,  the mills generally begin work at 10 P.M.on Sunday or 6  A.JI. Monday, and finish w-ork at 12 noon or 1 P.M.Saturday.  The hours of effective work range, therefore, from 42 to45 hours a week.   134.  The Mission give a series of valuable tables regarding the earnings of various classes of men in.the Continental industries,  andalso make an estimate of the average normal weekly earnings of all workers, as follows : Estimated Average Normal Weekly Earnings.FranceBelgium ...LuxemburgGermany ...Czecho-Slovakia In ForeignCurrencies.     francs     francs     francs     marks     kronen230310320 52250Approximate Sterling    Equivalent.      37/-      35/5      36/7      50/11      30/5The  Iron and  Steel  Trades  Employers&apos;  Association,  in evidence submitted to us, estimated the average earnings in Great britain as 67/3rf.  a week:   the National  Federation  of  Iron  and SteelManufacturers  state  that,  according to  returns  received from138  firms  employing 117,005  workpeople, the  average  weekly earnings were 58/5 in December 1929, 60/10 in January 1980  and68/1 in February 1980.  The Ministry of Labour made an inquiryregarding the  average earnings in  various industries  in  October1928, and at that time the average earnings in pig iron manufacturewere 59/1 a week, and in smelting, rolling, &amp;c, of iron and steelwere 60/1 a week.   185.  We  feel  that  we  are under a  deep obligation  to  themembers of the Mission  for  their  work in collecting this informa-tion  on  our behalf.   In  submitting to  the  Economic AdvisoryCouncil  this summary  of  their  principal conclusions,  we feel,however, that  it is only right to  drawr attention to the difficulty,in  dealing  with  such  complex  problems,  of making  reliablecomparisons between  conditions in  one country and another.  The
Mission&apos;s Report  does  not show and indeed  in  the  short time available  for  their investigations  hardly  could  have  shown whether the definitions  of the various  classes of worker adopted asthe basis  of comparison is in each  country  the same.    Further,Trade Union restrictions and other forms of demarcation make suchcomparisons very speculative.   136.   Another question with which the Mission&apos;s Report couldnot be expected  to deal is the net effect on production costs  of the varying conditions of  hours and  wages in  the countries visited.The  lay-out and organisation of the steel plants in those countries are in many cases widely different from those in Great Britain, andfurther  often  differ as  between one  country  and another, and,indeed,   within  a single  country.   Detailed  investigations  byaccountants could, no  doubt,  show  what is  the amount  of labourcharges in the  case of individual plants  in particular countries.Such figures, if obtained, could not,  however, be regarded as  giving a true picture for all plants of the relative conditions obtaining inthose countries.   187.   To sum up, we should not ourselves feel justified on theinformation available in saying more than that  on the  whole it isprobable that labour costs in the Continental  steel-making countries are lower than in Great Britain.VII. COMPARISON OF BRITISH AND CONTINENTAL, IRON                 AND STEEL INDUSTRIES.                       (a) Introductory.   138.  The difference between the general position of the  steel industries on the Continent and in the United Kingdom in recentyears is very  marked.   The  Continental industries  have  been growing  rapidly,  while  the  British  industry  has  shown  noexpansion and has  had difficulty  in  maintaining its volume of output.   In addition, the Continental steel makers have made, andare making, large profits, of which they are devoting a considerable part to improvement of plant.  The British industry has, however,in general, made little  or no profit, and has  been unable even to earn enough to enable it to make, proper allowances for depreciationand  for  obsolescence of plant.   The  value  of the plants of theBritish  industry is,  in fact,, decreasing from year to year, while those of its rivals are increasing.         (b) Organisation  of the Continental Industries.   189.  In  each of  the  principal competing countries on theContinent, the concentration of steel-producing firms into a numberof large units has been in progress for many years.  The result isthat most of the trade is  in the hands of a comparatively small number  of  large  Companies.   These Companies  are generallyvertical amalgamations; they control their coal and ore supplies andhave  their  own  works  for  finishing the iron  and steel.  A singleCompany, the Vereinigte Stahlwerke, formed in Germany in  1926by the amalgamation of a  number of  separate companies, has an output of about 4,000,000 tons of steel  a year and  a capital of 70,000,000.   In  each country  the producing units are furtherassociated under various forms of central control.   140.  In  Germany, the production and sales of  some 90 percent,  of the  industry  are  controlled by a series  of syndicates orcartels,  of which the chief is the  Ingot Steel Association.  Thesesyndicates determine home prices and, for some  products, export prices.  The former  are substantially higher than world prices, butto ensure that no damage  shall be done to the finishing trades inexport markets, a rebate, equivalent to  the difference between homeand  world  market prices,  is allowed on  steel sold for producinggoods for export.  A further  measure of control of the industry is obtained by agreements with the industries in other continental countries  regarding  the  amount of  steel  they  may  export toGermany.
   141.  In France,  the general policy  of the industry, in  whichthe heavy and finishing sections  are closely associated,  is directed by an old-established body known as the Comite  des Forges  whichembraces substantially the whole trade.  To this  Committee  wasentrusted the  expansion and direction of the iron  and  steel tradeduring the  war, and it was under its guidance that the trade  was-organised and re-constructed after the  war.  Associated with  this body  is the   Federation  of  Metallurgical  Mining  and  AlliedIndustries,   under  the  joint  guidance  of  which  a  number of&apos;&apos; comptoirs &apos;&apos;  have been formed to control the production  and  saleof iron and  steel  products.   The principal  body, the ComvtoirSiderurgique,  represents  the  French  industry in internationalcartel discussions.   142.  A somewhat different form of organisation has grown upin Belgium, where a small number of separate  companies  act asselling and purchasing agents for groups of large producing units.There is close  co-operation between the heavy and finishing sectionsof the  industry.  (o) International Organisation of the Foreign Steel Industries.   143.  The  production  of the  countries  referred   to  in  thepreceding paragraphs, as  well as  those of a number of others,  isnow regulated by  the  International  Steel  Cartel.    This bodydetermines, from time to time, what shall  be the total steel  pro-duction of  the participating countries.   Each country  is allotted adefinite jDroportion of the total production and each producing  unitis  allotted  a  share from  the national quota.  There are fines for production  in excess of this and compensation for  under-production.The International  Steel  Cartel aims at  regulating production inaccordance with  consumption,  and  at  preventing  undue falls inprices  through over-production.   Further  proposals  for  inter-national co-operation have recently been reported.   The formationof international selling syndicates, controlling  both  exports  and prices  of  many steel products  in most  Continental  countries  issuggested.        (d) Efficiency of Plant in Continental Countries.    144.  The  iron and  steel  plant  in Belgium,  France  andGermany is at a high level of efficiency.  This is, to a large extent,an  effect of the war.  Under the Treaty of Versailles,  the  plants in  Lorraine   were  lost  to the  German  steel-makers,  but  newplants  were erected by them in the Buhr with the money received as compensation  from the German Government.   The burden  ofthe prior charges on the  German plant  was greatly reduced by thede-valuation of the mark,  and thereby it was possible for the industryto obtain foreign loans for further reconstruction.   Moreover,  theindustry has been  so prosperous in recent  years that it has beenable to devote large  sums from its profits  towards improving and extending its plant.  It is said that  17,&apos;000,000  has been spent on new coke oven plant alone in the last few years, and that a singleCompany,   the  Vereinigte  Stahhcerke,  spent   ^13,750,000  onimprovements  and new construction between  1925  and  1928.    145.  The Belgian plants were almost wholly  destroyed in 1918,so that, with a few exceptions, the existing plants are quite modern.A large part  of the cost  of reconstruction  was met by reparation payments,  but a substantial amount was obtained from the public by capital  issues.   It is said that the banks in Belgium  are greatlyinterested  in  the  industry  as  ordinary shareholders  as well  asdebenture holders.   In the last few years, many improvements  havebeen made out of profits.    146.  At the outbreak of the war, a large part of the French ironand steel plant fell into  the hands of Germany.   During the  war,much new plant was installed by the French for war purposes,  and,after the Armistice, many works were reconstructed from reparation payments.  Further, the French industry was  reinforced by theaddition of the Lorraine works,  which were sold  by  the FrenchGovernment to the larger groups. Considerable sums were raised
from the public at fixed rates of interest, but the depreciation of the currency has, as in the case of Germany, greatly reduced the burdenof all fixed capital charges.   Since then, many improvements havebeen made from profits.   147.  The prosperity of these Continental industries in recentyears has  been  one of  the main  factors in  enabling  them  toObtain the  money necessary for  extensions and improvements.   InGermany,  moreover, the  banks take  a  more direct interest  in industry than do those in the United Kingdom.  They have largeshare-holdings in many iron  and steel companies, and direct repre-sentatives on the boards of Directors.   These representatives take an active part  in the conduct of the  business.  The presence  ofbankers on such boards is  said to have  provided  the  impulse  toamalgamation in  many instances.            (e) Organisation of the British Industry.   148.  In the  heavy section of the  British Industry, two-thirds of the production is in the hands of ten companies.   Most  of theseown several works, and, in general, they control collieries, ore mines and finishing works.  The remaining third of  the industry consists of a  large number of independent firms,  many of which are quitesmall.  There  are also  many  small  concerns in the subsidiarybranches of the trade.   150.  There  are  numerous  old-established- trade, associations,generally local in character and  consisting of the members of some particular branch of the  industry.1 Many  of these associations aim at establishing a ruling market price for the main products of their members.  They  are probably not very effective in respect of exporttrades,  but do something to  eliminate wasteful competition in thehome market.  In addition, almost the whole industry is included inthe National Federation of  Iron and .Steel Manufacturers.  &quot;TheFederation has no executive  powers, but assists. the units of theindustry on  all   matters  of general interest  other&apos; than thoseconnected with labour.   The latter are dealt &quot;with by&apos; the  Iron andSteel Trades Employers&apos; Association.  The National Federation hasbeen instrumental in forming a National  Research  Council for theindustry,  which  represents the  trade in its  dealings  with otherindustries and public bodies.   151.  It  is,  however,  clear  that  there   is much  less rea!co-operation among the units of the industry  in,this country than there is on the Continent.  For example, much advantage would beobtained by a  better understanding in this  country between the primary and the  finishing branches of the trade, which,  on theContinent,  are closely associated.           .  ,,   152.  The organisation of the industry is, however,  changing.Some of the larger companies are combining to form units which may become  comparable  with the  largest units  on  the  Continent.Re-groupings  are taking place  among other  companies  with theobject of concentrating the production of similar products.   There isno doubt that further combination among the existing companiesis urgently required.   In general, the formation of larger verticalcombinations appears to be essential.  The problem of the maximumsize of such units from the point  of view of efficiency, or the numberof stages of production that should  be covered by them,  has not received much attention  in this  country.  This,,is probably becauseeven  the  largest  units  are  substantially smaller than  any suchmaximum.  One witness did, however, advocate a more  completeform  of combination;  all producers of  similar products  in onedistrict should, in his view, amalgamate, and.a further control shouldbe established through a central  trust, which would direct the policyand control the finance and export trade of the  whole industry.   153.  The makers of rolling mill products for  structural workand shipbuilding  have, in the last few years, combined in a schemewhich has resulted  in nearly  all  the  needs  of the shipbuilding industry for such material being met&apos;by British steel.  Under thisscheme a rebate  from the normal price is allowed to shipbuilders
who use  only British  steel.   Quite recently  the  Steel  ExportAssociation  has been formed to control  nearly  the whole of theexport trade in sections,  joists  and plates.   The pig-iron  makersin certain districts also have agreed on schemes to regulate sellingprices.    154.  In the heavy section the British makers have not joined the International Steel Cartel.   We have been informed that  someconversations on the subject took place a  few  years ago, but it wassoon clear that the Continental  makers were  not prepared to offer a quota acceptable to the United Kingdom.  The figure offered was,in fact, much smaller than the actual production  in this countryin subsequent years.   British makers feel  that  they cannot  hope for a reasonable agreement with the Continental makers in existing conditions.  It is very convenient  for the latter  to  be  able to selltheir surplus steel in this  country  whenever it suits  them to do so,and they  cannot be expected voluntarily to forgo  this advantage.Moreover,  they know  that British costs are higher than theirs,and that the British industry as at present organised  and in existingfiscal  conditions is not in  a position to retaliate.   The  Continentalmakers, therefore, have, at present, everything to lose and nothing to gain by  bringing the United Kingdom into the Cartel, unlessthe British  makers  are  content with a  very low quota.  If thelatter were  members of the Cartel some  reduction,  by  agreement,of the imports of semi-finished steel into  this country  might beexpected.   In that event, the home  works would  be  more  fully occupied, costs would be reduced,  and it  might be possible  to earnprofits.   British  steel makers say that, unless they  have  safe-guarding, or a promise of safeguarding,  or are  given  some  otherbargaining power, they cannot obtain from the Cartel  a  quota forthe British  industry that would offer them any advantages.   Wedeal further with this aspect of the problem in paragraph 167.               VIII REMEDIES  SUGGESTED.   155.  In the following paragraphs  we  discuss  the remedieswhich have been suggested to us for the present difficulties of theiron and steel industry.   We  then indicate our conclusions andoutline the policy which we recommend  should be adopted.                       (a) Safeguarding.   156.  For some years  a large  part  of  the  steel industry hasbeen asking for some form of  tariff protection.  The  application made in 1925, which is referred to in paragraph  90,  was  for asafeguarding duty  on certain raw  or semi-finished material, andon wire, wire netting and woven wire.   157.  The  industry is   still  strongly in favour of  an import duty, and,  though no definite scheme for such a duty has been put before us, we understand that the industry would now propose thatthe scope  of the  duty should  be extended to cover  a  much largerrange of articles than those included in the application made in1925.  The re-rollers, who use  the semi-finished material that  isimported,  are now  meeting even more  severe foreign competitionthan formerly  in their own products,  such as hoops  and  strips,bars and  sections,  arid  they  hold  that  any import  duty should apply  to  their products   also.   It  must  be expected  that the manufacturing users of  the products of the re-rollers&quot; would, in turn, ask for a duty on their own products  equivalent to any dutyplaced on their raw materials.  A duty on materials of the kindproduced by the steel industry must be expected,  therefore, as was  foreseen in  1925, to  lead to  demands,  which it would  bedifficult to refuse,  for duties on a very wide range of  articles ofwhich steel  forms a part.   158.  A small section of the re-rolling trade is opposed to theimposition  of any import duty.   In  their view,  the prosperity ofmany of the finishing branches of the  industry depends on their being able  to  obtain cheap  foreign  steel.   In  this connection,another question of some  importance arises that of a drawback
of duty on semi-finished steel when the finished goods made from it are exported.  The industry does not appear to have any definiteviews on this question.   Some  witnesses said they had  not giventhe matter any consideration, and others thought that a drawbackshould not be given, as much of the value of the duty would be lost  if  the  finishing trades that work, largely for  export could continue to use foreign  steel without paying the import duty.   159.  Another side of this question was submitted to us by thetin plate trade.  British tin plates are  exported to  a number of countries for making containers, which  are subsequently exported,and  most countries grant a drawback  of the  import duty or  its equivalent in such circumstances.  The tin plate industry fear that,if  this country imposed a duty on steel  without a drawback on  tinplates  made  from it, many  of the Continental countries which atpresent allow drawback facilities would be disposed to withdrawthem.   A considerable part of the export of British tin plates mightbe affected, and the trade would view any such prospect with a gooddeal of anxiety.   160.  Evidence has been put before us on  this subject  by two important  steel-using industries,  shipbuilding and  engineering.The Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation are,  as a body, definitelyopposed to  any  import  duty  on  steel.  Although  a  very largeproportion  of  the  steel now  used  by  them is  British steel,they   feel  no  assurance  that  the  price  of  it   would   not  beraised if a duty were imposed on foreign steel.  They  themselves are experiencing such severe foreign competition  that  they couldnot  contemplate  any further handicap.   The evidence from theBritish Engineers&apos;  Association was  less definite.   They would be opposed to the imposition of  a duty on steel, if  the duty led merely to an increase in the price of steel and a continuance of the  presentconditions  in the steel industry,  but would have no objection to an import duty, if it was accompanied by a  thorough re-organisation ofthe steel industry and a cheapening of home-produced  iron and steelthrough the increased and more regular output of the home works.    161.  The  steel makers  claim that  an import  duty on  steel isessential to the revival of the industry.  There is general  agreement that some re-organisation of the industry is necessary,  and  that additional capital is required for this purpose.  Steel  makers claim that it would be impossible  to obtain this, unless the investor had some assurance of  profit.  There is no  such assurance  at  present.and, in general, steel makers hold the view that no such assurance could be given as long as Continental steel can at any time be soldfreely in their home market.    162.  We recognise  the  necessity  for new capital and the diffi-culty  of obtaining  it, but we do not  accept the views of the steelmakers on the immediate need for  a duty on steel.  Protection atthe present time would, we believe, actually delay the reforms thatare  urgently required,  as it would lead  to the maintenance  of  anumber of  plants,  not  designed for efficient production or  suitablefor  amalgamation,  which,  in the  interests  of the industry as  awhole, should, not be encouraged to continue.  The re-organisationof the industry, especially  in the heavy section, and,  to  a  largeextent, its re-equipment, is the first essential step.  We are hopeful that when it has been re-organised on the lines that we recommend,the  industry will be able to  compete effectively with its Continentalrivals without the  adventitious assistance of protection.    163.  The need  for re-organisation is,  we believe,  generally recognised in the industry and we are hopeful that this policy  willbe more  vigorously  pursued if, as we  recommend,  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment decline to  consider  any proposal for  protection untilthe industry has been thoroughly re-organised.              (b) Re-introduotion of Trade Facilities.    164.  Among possible methods of assisting the steel industry in its  present  difficulties,  suggestions  have  been  made  that   His Majesty&apos;s Government  should  secure  the passage  of  legislation authorising the grant by the Government of guarantees to the iron     [20779]                             .                 G
and steel industry on the lines of the old Trade Facilities Acts.   Weare. opposed to any  such  proposal.  We.believe that  the policy ofgiving guarantees of this &quot;kind is unsound in itself.  Further, thereis, in our view, no.need for such guarantees to finance the necessaryreconstruction of the iron  and steel industry.  For the reasons giveniri paragraph  170 below,  we are satisfied that all  the necessary funds for  re-organisation  will  be  forthcoming through  normalfinancial channels.                       (c) Reorganisation.    165.   As &quot;we  have indicated  in  Sections  III and  IV of  thisReport, we are  of opinion that a far-reaching re-organisation ofthe iron and  steel industry is  essential as a first step towards a renewal of its prosperity.  It  would be an essential part of  sucha  re-organisation that the units of  the industry should be large enough to obtain the advantages to be  derived  from large-scalebuying or production of raw  materials,  continuous  running of selected works on the manufacture of the products for which theyare best suited, financial reserves sufficient for any  extension oralteration  of  plant  that may  be  necessary,  and  an  adequateorganisation  for selling in the home  market and for export.    166.   We are not in  a position to lay down-in detail the lines on which  any  such  re-organisation should proceed.  That  is aquestion  for  experts  in   the.  industry  after examination  of thecircumstances of each case.  In general, however, we consider thatthe producing units  should be in the nature of vertical combinationsowning their sources of  supply of  raw  materials and producingfinished steel goods,  and that  each  unit should, in  the  main, be confined to one district and should substantially represent the wholeof that district.    167.  An amalgamation of the heavy steel-producing firms onthe North-East Coast would probably constitute one such unit.  if other regional  amalgamations  were arranged  on this scale,  theindustry  of  the whole country could  be organised in five  or six units.  When such regional amalgamations have been effected, it will be possible for the large units so created to make arrangements With one another for the development  of the industry on national lines, thereby  still further reducing costs.   The industry,  when re-organised  in  this  way,  would  at  last  be  in a  position  to negotiate effectively with the highly-organised foreign industries for an adequate share of  the markets of the world.  It would also be in a position to  forecast the probable  changes in the world demand for particular classes and qualities of  steel  products  and to  adapt itself to meet them.    168.   In  one or  two  districts a  promising beginning has  been made in  the  direction of re-organisation on these lines, and further negotiations are being carried on in the same  direction.  It is only natural that great, difficulties  should  be met  in arranging these re-brganisations.  We believe,  however, they  are of  such  a kind that it should  be within the power of  the industry and its owners and advisers to remove  them.  We are assured that the technical assistance necessary in the planning of  the new units can be readily obtained, and  that there need be  no  anxiety  as to the supply of men capable, of managing and directing the new units.  One serious cause of  delay in  the  process of reconstruction arises from the reluctance, which is  no  doubt  natural, of the companies and  firms in the industry to recognise the facts of the present position.   Our inquiry has made it  abundantly clear  that a number of companies and  firms  in  the  iron and   steel  industry  are  already in  an embarrassed condition.  Many of them are heavily loaded with debt and are not only making no  profits,  but  are unlikely ever to do so again until  re-organisation  is effected.   We are of  opinion, however, that when  the  industry is.reconstructed so as to be able to reap to the full the advantage which this  country possesses for steel production, a new  era of prosperity will open.      169.  As explained  in Section  VII  (paragraphs 144  to  146), causes arising out  of the late war have enabled France, Belgium,  Luxembourg  and   Germany  to re-equip  their iron  and  steel
P  N F-&apos;  /  ^   FWI T; industries at a time when  the  British industry has been  passing through  exceptional  difficulties  and has been unable to maintain its plant at the same high level  of efficiency.  Reconstruction to be successful must,  therefore,  be far-reaching in  character.  It will require  sacrifice  on  the part  of  all  those  connected  with the industry, not only the  shareholders but also the debenture  stock holders and mortgagees.  The security available to the latter is, in many cases, small to-day and is diminishing.    The only  way by which they can improve it is for them to recognise frankly  what is the present position,  and to  co-operate fully in the steps that com- petent advisers regard as necessary to put the industry on a sound productive and financial footing, even though this involves  a large writing down of the nominal value  of their interests.    170.   The  policy  recommended in the preceding  paragraphs would require  for its fulfilment the gradual introduction of  large sums of new- capital  into the industry.   The amount required has been variously  estimated by witnesses as  something  approaching  15,000,000, with a possibility  that it might eventually reach  a higher figure.  In view  of the bad  trading results of recent years, it would  not  be possible  for existing concerns  or  for  mere amalgamations  of such  concerns to obtain the  capital  that they require by a public issue, and many  of the  large iron and  steel companies are already  deeply indebted to the  joint stock banks, which could not reasonably  be expected to increase  their commit- ments by taking  up new capital.   In short,  there would be no prospect  of  the  industry securing  the  finance  that  it  urgently requires  if  it were determined  to maintain  its present form  of organisation.  In view of the  evidence which  the Governor of the Bank of  England was good enough  to put  before  us,  we have, however,  reason to believe that the sums, large in amount as they may ultimately be, required to finance re-organisation schemes in the iron and steel industry  will be forthcoming provided that the technical,  administrative and  financial  aspects  of the  schemes proposed  are, on examination, found to be wide and satisfactory.   171.   Finally, we are conscious  that,  in  the opinion  of many witnesses of great  experience,  a  measure  of protection  should precede or be contemporaneous  with reorganisation, as they  fear, even  with the  full advantages to be gained  from the latter, that their  competitive  powers will not  suffice  to  meet  the prices  of foreign rivals, whose  working week is longer  and whose wages are less than those prevailing now in this  country.   Vertical  grouping into more compact units  is essential, and in the process elimination of uneconomic  works may be found necessary  and,  until progress is made to this end, it cannot be said that the steel trade  in Great Britain is, on the whole, in  as efficient a condition as is the trade in other  countries.  We fear  that safeguarding at the present juncture would delay reorganisation and might preserve a number of businesses whose  continued  existence  is  not to the  public advantage or good for the trade  as  a whole.   172.   We  have,  therefore,  come  to the  conclusion,  on the evidence put before us from all parties interested in the  problem, that  reorganisation should be the first  step, and  that it should be accelerated as much as possible,  as  temporising and  delay may be damaging to the  industry.   It might  be  dangerous to await there organisation of  the  whole industry  to determine  whether  that policy, unaccompanied by safeguarding, would  be  sufficient to meet foreign  competition.  If, after certain large  regional units havebeen organised in the most efficient manner,  technically-,  commer-cially and financially, it should be found that they were still  unable to compete with foreign  countries,  or that the benefits which it is claimed that reorganisation  by itself would produce could  not berealised,   a  resort to   safeguarding  for  a  period  sufficient tore-establish  the industry should be seriously considered,  as  in theview of some of us such  a step w-ould then be  imperative.   Duringthe  suggested  trial  of  reorganisation  without  safeguarding,  a thorough&quot; examination should be  undertaken  by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment of the problems which  would  require solution if, in the event  of the failure of that reorganisation, resort to safeguardingproved necessary.
    173.   We  desire  to  express our  thanks  to  our  Secretaries,Mr. A. E. Hemming,  C.B.E., and Mr. W. Palmer, for the servicesthey have rendered to us.  Their knowledge of the subject and theskill and  attention they have devoted  to  the  Inquiry have greatlyassisted us and lessened our labour.  We  also desire  to  place on record the benefits we have derived from the presence of Mr. PercyAshley, C.B., Principal Assistant Secretary, Board of Trade, whose services the President of the Board of Trade  kindly  placed at our disposal.IX. SUMMARY  OF  CONCLUSIONS  AND  RECOMMEND A-                             TIONS.                         (a) Conclusions.   174.  We  summarise our general conclusions as follows:    (i) In the period  since the  war,  imports of  various  classes offoreign steel  have increased and exports  have  decreased.   Totalimports of foreign steel which, in the period 1910-1913, amounted to1,849,000 tons, had risen to 2,817,000 tons  in  1929.   In the sameperiod exports of British steel  fell from 4,747,000  tons to 4,379,000tons.  Further, this country has not maintained its former share inthe world&apos;s iron and steel trade, notwithstanding the growth of worldconsumption of steel and of the great increase of productive capacity in this country during the war.   (ii)  The iron and steel produced in this country has been  sold atlow prices which have not only yielded little or no profit on the  capital employed,  but  in many  cases  have  been  insufficient to  enableadequate provision to be made for depreciation.   (iii) On the Continent the same period has  witnessed  a remark-able progress in the iron and steel industries, especially in Belgium,Luxembourg,  France and Germany.   Special conditions arising outof the war (e.g., the provisions of the Treaty of  Versailles, monetaryconditions, &amp;c.) materially assisted the recovery of the iron and  steel industries in those countries.  Since their recovery from the  imme-diate effects of the war, they have, for a variety  of reasons,  earnedgood profits, which have enabled them to maintain their plants at  ahigh  level of efficiency and  to  extend and modernise  them  stillfurther.   (iv) The organisation of the British iron and  steel industry differs from that of its Continental rivals chiefly in the following respects:    (a) A large number of relatively small concerns are engaged in         the production of the same range of articles.   (b) No effective machinery exists for co-operation in commercial         activities or for the formulation of a national policy.   (v) Under the  British system there are no means of ensuring that orders are so placed as to enable plants to be run at full capacity  and,therefore, at the lowest costs.   (vi) No  recovery  of the  British iron and steel industry  can be looked for until steps have been taken to lower the costs of productionsufficiently to  enable it to compete with its foreign rivals.   (vii)  The first necessary step to this end is the formation of largeregional amalgamations strong enough:    (a) to secure the economies of mass production and the allocation         of orders to the plants  best suited for  their execution;   (b) to obtain the  finance required to bring their plants  to the         highest level of technical efficiency;   (c) to enter into arrangements for a national  production and sales         policy which could later form the basis for participation in         international agreements.
f ,Tj piei    0   (viii) Large sums of new capital will be gradually required to finance  amalgamations of the type indicated in the preceding con-clusion.  On this point we are assured by the Governor of the Bankof England that the sums, large in amount as they may ultimately be, required to finance reorganisation schemes in the iron and steelindustry will be forthcoming, provided that the technical, administra-tive  and financial  aspects) of  the  schemes  proposed  are,  on examination, found to be wide and satisfactory.   175.  In the light of the foregoing  conclusions we recommendthat His Majesty&apos;s Government should take every step in their powerto urge on all concerned in the conduct of the iron and steel industry the importance of proceeding as rapidly as possible with the formationof large regional amalgamations asi the essential preliminary conditionto the recovery of the trade that has been lost.(b) Recommendation.(Signed)SANKEY,  Chairman.T.
