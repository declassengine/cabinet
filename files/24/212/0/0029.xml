This document is tho property of  His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)..      Some time ago John Syme circulated to members of the cabinet an abusive and most misleading statement and he has now intimatedin a letter of the 17th instant addressed to the Secretary of theParliamentary Labour Party his resolve to commit some offence,(such as breaking windows at the Home Office or in Downing Streeton Wednesday, the 28th instant,) and, after being imprisoned,to hunger strike so as to compel his release, unless before then he obtains the redress to which he feels entitled,,   1 thinktherefore that 1 ought to remind my colleagues briefly of thepast history of this case and to inform them of what 1 have? tried to do to effect a settlemente      Each Home Secretary from Mr. Gladstone to Mr. Bridgemanconsidered Syme&apos;s case but found no ground for reopening it.      In 1924 when the Labour Government took office Mr. Hendersonafter consultation with the Prime Minister and the Lord Chancelloroffered Syme a Tribunal of three impartial persons, unconnected with politics or the Syme case, to be selected by the LordChancellor, on condition that Syme on the one hand gave anundertaking to abide by the results of such an enquiry and thatthe Government on the other hand would implement the findings ofthe Tribunal.  Syme agreed to these terms but as the findings ofthe Tribunal were not in his favour, he afterwards refused toabide by them and continued his agitation.      On taking office, Syme appealed to me in a long and abusiveletter for &quot;a just settlement of his case&quot;.   i was alsoapproached by Mr. Winter ton,- the Secretary of the John SymeCommittee, who told me that Syme had placed his cases in their hands with full authority to negotiate a settlement on his behalf.   It was represented to me that Syme had relinquishedRET .CABINET.179(30)THE CASE OF EX-INSPECTO JOHN SYME.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.
his demand for reinstatement and that he did not insist.on..more-than &quot;the clearing of the imputation against his character as aconscientious officer&quot;.      In spite of all the adverse decisions in the last 20years, I tried to find means of closing this case on someacceptable basis, mainly because of the condition of Symo&apos;sfamily.  Syme demands apologies and confessions of wrong-doingfrom &quot;officialdom&quot; and asserts that he has a claim for about 20,000.   In a letter which I have seen he states, &quot;I gave  myfriends (the Syme Committee) permission to settle on my behalffor a lump sum of  10,000, which if invested at 5 per cent.would have given me my pension as a Superintendent.  I considerit a very moderate offer under all the circumstances&quot;.      After going very fully into all the circumstances I camedefinitely to the conclusion that any settlement on the linesof the demands made by Syme was absolutely impossible, but I -felt that I ought to  try to find some other solution.      I was faced with the difficulty that pensions to police officers are not within the discretion of the Executive but aregoverned by statutory provisions and it was therefore necessaryto find a method which could be justified in Parliament for doiiianything at all for a man who had so often broken the law.A pension could be granted to Syme only if he could be treatedas having retired from the service on medical grounds.   this involved a very liberal interpretation, if not  a stretch?ng, ofthe statutory provisions, but I should have felt justified in authorising the payment of a pension on medical grounds to Symeas there was some medical evidence that his mental conditionmay have been developing during a long period of years and itcould be argued that  his dismissal was due to a state of mindin relation to police discipline which at that  date made it undesirable that ho should continue further service as a memberof the police.
9 ft o6 U 0      I accordingly suggested to the Secretary of the John SymeCommittee a settlement on the basis that Syme should receive apension on medical grounds calculated on his length of service atthe date of his dismissal as an Inspector.  Syme on this basis would have received a pension of  72 a year, and, as the pension would Ltave dated back to the time of his dismissal, he would havereceived in addition to that yearly payment the arrears ofpension amounting to some  1,100.  As part of the settlement I said that, if these terms were accepted, I&apos;would take the oppor-tunity of stating publicly that there has never been any question as to the sincerity of Syme&apos;s motives, and that no stigmaremained on his personal character; and I would at the same timesay that a settlement on these lines implied no reflection onthe action of the Metropolitan Police or of the Home Office.,      I outlined these proposals at a private meeting in theHouse of Commons which was attended by Messrs. Winterton, Snelland Matters.  Mr, Lindsay was also present and I understood fromthese colleagues that Syme had placed his interests entirely intheir hands.  I made it clear that I had it in mind, if they thought that these terras offered a prospect of settlement, to approach the leaders of the Opposition privately in the hope ofsecuring their acquiescence and avoiding a Parliamentary discussion.It was understood that until I had done this, the matter would bekept quite private.      The immediate result was that Syme indignantly  and publiclyrepudiated the terms and has circulated to members of the cabinet a grossly abusive misrepresentation of the offers made to him.      in a letter from Syme to the Prime Minister dated April 18th1930 he wrote as follows:--    &quot;I have written to Mr. WintertonM.P. closing the negotiations which I had consented to theCommittee under his Chairmanship carrying on since December last&apos;&apos; ,He also stated that he was intervening in the Fulham Election in opposition to the Labour Candidate.
      The offer which I ha?e outlined is the maximum whichI could defend in Parliament or which I could induce our political critics or opponents to accept.  I can see no way-whatever of meeting Syme&apos;s demands or attempting more than Ihave already tried to accomplish, but as this is more than a departmental matter I should like to know whether my Colleaguesha^e any views on the case.                                      Jo H i 0o26th May, 1930.
