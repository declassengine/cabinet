Playing Fields  (Exemption from Rating) Bill.             Memor^ndxim by -the Minister of Health.           I  submit for the consideration of my Colleagues   the  following note  on the Playing fields (Exemption from Rating)   Bill and the action to be taken by the Government in regard to it.          The Bill was presented by Mr. Macquisten and supported by   Mr.  Hurd, Mr. John  Jones,. Major Sir A, Sinclair, Miss Lloyd GeorgeI  Mr.  Gadogan and Mr. Robert Richards on e          It was read a second time without discussion on Friday,  2ist February, having been taken at about 3 minutes to 4.  i      The Bill has now been eommitted to -Standing Committee B  which  is to meet on Wednesday,  21st May, to consider the local  Authorities (Enabling) Bill,  and this Bill,         As it is likely that  proceedings on the Enabling Bill  will  be brief, it is neoessary, as a matter of urgency., to  obtain a deoision of the Cabinet as to the line to be taken on  the Playing Fields Bill.         The Bill proposes  to  confer exemption from rates inI respect of playing fields  where no entry money is charged.         The legal position according to the views of the  Department (and of the Central Valuation Committee) is that  land dedicated to the public, for perpetual use thereof by  the public for exercise and recreation, is not rateable.  Consequently, playing  fields in recreation grounds dedicated.  as above-mentioned and vested in local Authorities are already  exempt from rating.   But  grounds not so vested are liable to  rates.
          The  present  Bill would extend  the principle of exemption to all playing  fields except     (a)   playing fields  where  gate money is charged;     (b)   playing fields  used as such in connection with          any  school which is &quot;carried on for profit&quot;.          **Playing field  &quot; is defined to mean &quot;any land kept or preserved  mainly or Exclusively for the purpose of the playing of  cricket, football or other games&quot;.          Even if there were no objections in principle to the proposal  in the Bill, it is obvious that any attempt to differentiate between playing fields on the lines suggested would give  rise to  all sorts of anomalies as well as to difficulties of interpretation.    The Bill would apparently exempt thewealthy golf  club or  polo club or the sports grounds provided by a large  industrial undertaking, or the person who lets outtennis courts or cricket pitohes for profit.  On the otherhand, it would  not include the ground of the village footballclub who may take a small &quot;gate&quot; for the purpose of meetingexpenses,  but who are not in any sense a profit-earning body.Further the Bill would exempt grounds attached to schools not&quot;oarried on for profit&quot;.   This latter phrase might be  difficultof interpretation,  e.g. in the case of colleges and public or secondary schools which derive income from fees,  but  are not&quot;carried on for profit&quot; in the sense that they make any return on invested capital.        Apart,  however,  from these points of detail,  theBill is open to objection on the general grounds:    (1)  that no further exemptions from rates for hereditamentsof this kind oan properly be considered without consideringalso the claims  made by other interests,  e.g.  in respect  of
                                                       ... 81&quot;nosjoitaCUr and - all- soxte -of ^pxe-mLa^fl- u sed -for- -charitable  or semi-public purposes.     (2)   that it  is  a  qu-eation whether de-rating  has  not  already- been carried far enough.  There must  clearly  be  a limit  to such continual sapping at  the  base of  our  system  of local taxation&apos;.   So long  as that  system lasts in anything  like its present  form, any further  exemptions or abatements ought  only to be contemplated as  a result of  a comprehensive review  of  the working  of the  system.          Some hundreds of  resolutions  (in  common  form) have been received from cricket clubs and other sports organisations in various parts  of  the country, supporting the Sill.          On the other  hand,  strong protests have  been received from the Association of Munioipal  Corporations, the County Councils Association and the Central Valuation Committee  (copies&quot; of these letters  are attached) .          The Prime Minister  6n 8th April,  in reply to a  question. by Mr, Somerville, said &quot;I regret  that I can hold out no  hope of facilities being  given  for  this Bill&quot;.          In view  of  the considerations mentioned  above I  submit that steps should be taken by  the  Government to  secure that  the Bill is  not passed into law.          I am confident that it  would  be impossible by negotiations to induce the promoters to withdraw  the  Bill, but there is precedent in  the  Committee stage  proceedings on  the Mock Auctions Bill of  this Session for the representative of the Department concerned indicating  that he cannot support a  Bill, although it may have received  an unopposed Second Reading, and inviting the Committee unless  the  Bill is  withdrawn to defeat the Motion that Clause 1 stand part.          I propose,  if my  colleagues agree,  to follow this precedent.                                (Initialled)  A.G. Ministry of Health.

Palace  Chambers,opy) -                                      Bridge  Street,                                            Westminster, S.Y7.1.                                     4th March, 1930.   Sir j           Playing Fields  (Exemption from Rating) Bill.             I am directed by my Committee to call your   attention to  the above named Bill, which they regard   as open to grave objection.    The Bill, although ordered   to be printed on the 1st November last, was, I think, only   issued on Wednesday, the 19th February, and the Bill was   read the second time without any disoussion two days later.   Obviously, this gave no opportunity to any local authorities   to consider the matter.             I am to point out that the Bill is contrary to the   well recognised principles of rating, the object of which   is to require the occupiers of all property to contribute   to the expenses incurred by local authorities in proportion   to the annual value of  their properties, and that where   provision is made for derating, as was done last year, local   authorities are compensated by grants from the State.             If  the present Bill is passed, the effect will be   to make other ratepayers in the areas comprising the playing   fields pay the proportions which should have been defrayed   by the oooupiers of the latter.   Moreover, under the Bill   as it stands, an exceedingly wide definition is given to the   expression &quot;playing field&quot;.   It would include, for example,   a golf course,  and possibly the club house, and my   Committee fail to see any  justification for exempting   a golf club and the members thereof, many of whom are   wealthy, from the payment of rates and imposing the obligation   on the other ratepayers, many of whom have the greatest   difficulty to make both ends meet.             Again in many cases playing fields are let to   clubs at a high rent, and the probable effeot of passing   the Bill would be to enable the landowner to increase the   rent.             In  the ciroumstanoes, I am directed to express   the hope that the Government will take steps to prevent   the Bill passing into law.                           I am, Sir,                                Your obedient Servant,                                     (Signed)  HARRY G. PRITCHARD.
