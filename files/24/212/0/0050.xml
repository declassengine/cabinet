ENCLOSURE.    Note of Proceedings at meeting between Secretary    of State and Deputation from the Church of Scotland    and the Free Church of Scotland in regard to Irish    Immigration into Scotland, hold at 121a, Princes        Street, Edinburgh, on 9th May, 1950.Present:     Secretary of State;     Mr. &quot;/alter Hogg, Scottish Office.Deputation;     Rev. J.H.Cockburn, B.D.,  Dunblane;     Rev. Reid Christie, M.A.,Leith;     Rev. John Muirhead, B.D., Strathaven;     Rev. Professor Curtis,  D.D., Edinburgh;     Rev. Hugh Stevenson, M.A. ,  Dunblane;                 -     Rev. A.3.Robb, M.A., Laurieston;     Mr. V!. Rounsfell Brown,  C.A., Edinburgh.In Attendance:     Mr. Sutherland, Department  of Health.          The Reverend Mr. Cockburn, who introduced thedeputation, referred to the previous negotiations between the churches and the Government&apos;s predecessors in regard to thepossibility of regulating the immigration of Irish intoScotland.   No tangible results  have so far been forthcoming from these negotiations, and the deputation&apos;s object was to impress on the present Government that the position was  .becoming more serious and. to urge them to take action.          The difficulties with which the Government have to contend had been pointed out to  previous deputations, but itis felt that the position is now becoming so acute that freshefforts should be made to stem the flow of undesirableimmigrants into Scotland.          The Churches have been told that the Government haveno means of knowing the numbers  of length of residence inScotland of persons of Irish birth drawing doles or receiving
                                                            *Jt Q -jslparish, relief or old age pensions:.    The  Churches  submit  thatin the interests of the country complete  statistics  of  thesituation should he obtained by the State.   The  Churches  alsoappeal to the Government to set up a Commission  of inquiry to investigate the possibility of introducing regulativei mm i gr a tion laws of the kind in operation in practically  all british Dominions.          The Reverend Mr,.  Reid Christie  referred  to the  very important bearing which the present situation has  on certain questions which are at present giving the Government concern,e.g. unemployment and the incidence of rating on industry.Mr. Reid Christie quoted figures to show  that since  the lastCensus the Irish population in Scotland had continued toincrease.   Notwithstanding all the Government have  done  to relieve unemployment in Scotland by emigrating surplus  labour to the Colonies, the position is no better, as the reductionsthus made in the numbers of unemployed have been more than offset by tho influx of immigrants from Ireland.  Mr.  ReidChristie also stated that the U.S.A. quota for Irish immigrantshas been reduced from 2u,500 to 17,800, and it is  feared  thatthis will result in a further increase in Irish  emigrationto Scotland.   Figures were quoted by iir. Reid Christie to  show the large proportion of persons of Irish extraction  in receiptof public assistance in Scotland and comprised in the criminalstatistics for the country.          Reference was also made to the impossibility of Irishsettlers in Scotland assimilating themselves into  the politicaland. social fabric of this country.   It is feared that asmatters are now proceeding an Ulster question is being-created in Scottish industrial areas.          The deputation therefore asked the Government to
EtfDtake steps (1) to provide effective measures to regulateemigration from Ireland, (2) to secure that immigrants from the Free State who become a public charge in this  countrybe repatriated, and (3) to fix a minimum period before  animmigrant be allowed to exercise the franchise.          The Keverend Hugh Stevenson spoke as to thedesirability of a column being added to the next CensusReturn to show the religion of the person concerned.    Thesuggestion was made not in sectional interests but in theinterests of all Churches and of the State.   In the  matterof statistics the Churches appeal to the Government for their assistance.    A Census of religions has only twice formerly  beetaken in Scotland (in 1051 and 1871), but such information would be invaluable now not only to the Church but, he submitted, to the State.          Mr.  Adamson in re fly stated that he personally  couldnot give any undertaking to the deputation that action  on thelines suggested by them would be taken by the Government  butpromised to report the matter to his colleagues in the  Cabinet.
