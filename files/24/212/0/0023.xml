1 oC RT .t.  173 (30).CABINS T.              THE SINGAPORE^ BASE.   REPORT BY THE CO-AilTTEE ON THE FIGHTING SERVICES.     1.  The Committee have had under discussion the questionof future policy regarding the Singapore Base, In the lightof the results of the Naval Conference and of the inter-national and political situation generally.   The views expressed by the Lord President of the Council in his memorandum (Paper No. C.P. 165  (30)), which has alreadybeen circulated to the Cabinet, pere  taken into consideration.2. In order to assist In Investigating the financialST OFIN TIN- JO OR,alternative-  OF    aspects of the problem, the  Committee  appointed  a  Depart-JA NOONINGIE BASE, mental Sub-Committee to report  on  the  cost  of  the  Base  and        defences to date, the  cost of completing the  scherre  in        accordance with  the present  programmes,  and the  cost of        abandoning the Base,             3. From  the Report of this Sub-Committee  (which is        attached as Enclosure  No. 1), it will  be seen that approxi-        mately  2,477,000 has  been spent up  to date.    Towards  this        contributions in cash  hove been received from the  Dominions        and  Colonies  amounting to  2,133,000.             4, The gross  cost of  completing the Base and  the first        staff of the  defences  is estimated to  be
HISTORY OP the base TO DATE. 3,202,000, from which must be subtracted further contributions expected from the Dominions and Coloniesamounting to  1,117,000.  The net coot to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom of completing the project may, therefore, be taken to be approximately 7,000,000, plus the cost of the second stage of the defences.   5.   On the other hand, the total cost of abandoning the scheme is estimated to be  3,306,000, in respect  ofcompensation to  contractors, dtc., and repayment to theDominions and Colonies, on the assumption that the wholeof the capital sums received would be repaid without   Vinterest.  6.   It  is unnecessary  in this paper to refer  in  detail&apos;to the strategical and other  reasons which prompted thelate  Government  to proceed with  the construction of the base, but  the  draft of a  Memorandum now  in course of preparation by the Oversea Defence Committee  for theforthcoming Imperial  Conference,  tracing the  whole  historyof the Base since  its inception  is  attached  (Enclosure No.2) for Information.HEW FACTORS  TOBE TAKEN  INTO3C0UNT.7.     It is also unnecessary for the Committee to dealat length with the new factors which must be taken intoaccount, such as the results of the recent Naval Conference our improved relations with Japan as a result of theConference, the possibility of the abolition of capital ships in the not very distant future end the progress which has been made with regard to plans for theof international disputes by peaceful means.settlement
1 u otSSSITY CON-jT TNG THEIFNIGN3.ANY NEWDEOIdIONSHOULD BlA FINALONE.     8.  It may &quot;be said at once that, in the-opinion of the-Committee, if the Government1 s hands had been quite free,the right policy on economic and political grounds wouldhave been to abandon the Base forthwith.     9.  There are, however, two Important factorsrequiring consideration before such a step is taken.In the first place, at least one of the Dominions is knownto be at present strongly against abandoning the project,and the attitude of the others has not yet bepn ascertained.His-majesty1s Government in the United kingdom have already declared their intention to take the Dominions, and theColonies who have contributed to the cost of the scheme,fully into their confidence before any final decision inthe matter is reached or any public announcement is made.    2-0, It will be recalled that, on the occasion ofthe decision in November last that the work contractedfor at Singapore should be slowed down as much as possible,that all &quot;work that could be suspended should be sosuspended and that no new work should be embarked on  atthe moment, a strongly warded protest was received-  fromSir Joseph V,&apos;ard, then Prime Minister of New Zealand,  thata decision of importance to the Dominions had been  takenby the Government  in the United kingdom without prior consulation with New Sqaland.  Sir  Joseph Ward has nowresigned, but it seems likely that his successor will hold the same  opinion as tei the importance of the New zealand government being given the fullest opportunity before any final decision is arrived at of  expressing their  viewson any proposed modification of policy.     110  In the,, second place there  is a risk that  any decision now made  to abandon the Base might be subsequently
reversed (as it was in 1924)  by the eventual successorsto the present Government in this country.    Such anoccurrence would inevitably add to the total cost of the base owing to new contracts etc. being necessary.Similarly, instructions to contractors to suspend worknow in hand until the Imperial Conference would resultin a comparatively small saving, and the Issue of suchinstructions would not tend to ease the situation atthe Imperial Conference vis-a-vis those Dominionswhich are at present in favour of the Singapore project and have insisted on their right to be previouslyconsulted.    IS.  Taking all these circumstances into account,the Committee are of opinion that the present &quot;slowed down&quot;programme should be allowed to  continue, and thatarrangements should be made to  obtain at the forthcoming imperial Conference a definite  aid permanent settlement.                     Signed on  behalf of the Committee.                                   (Chairman) *Whitehall Gardens, S.Y/.1.  May 23rd, 1930.
                     dpMMITT SE. CIT THE FIGHTING SERVICES .                          THS^ SINGAPORE NAVAL BASS!.               REPORT BY DSFARTftCTTAL SUB-COMMITTISB  ON  EXPENDITURE.     1.   In accordance with  the  instructions of the Fighting     Services Committee  (9th  Meeting, Conclusion l) , &apos;&apos;e have prepared     the  attached  tables.          Table  &apos;A:  gives  the expenditure  incurred  in connection&quot;     with the Naval  Base  and  the  Military  and Air Defences up to     the  50th April,  1930,  and  an estimate of  the total cost of     completing  the  &quot;Truncated.&quot;  scheme  and the  defences (excluding     the  second  stage  of the  military defences).          Table  &apos;B:  contains  an estimate of the cost of abandoning     the  scheme.BHDI- 2.   From  Item  1,  table  &apos;Ar, it will be zsen that  the&quot;totalS UP     gross  expenditure  to 30th April,  1930, is  2,477,000.4.30 .     Towards  this  contributions in cash have been received from     the  Dominions and  Colonies amounting to  22,135/000.-          The net  expenditure incurred by H..M.  Government in the     United Kingdom has therefore been  344,000.     3.   The  cost of Staff is not included in the  estimate.     Approximately  187,000 has been spent by the Admiralty  on     works  staff,  and 14 Officers and. 66 other ranks have been      added  to the  Military garrison for works and other construction      services at the Bn.se, bi.it the extra cost of the latter  in      respect of Singapore is as a matter of fact inconsiderable.
TOTAL FURTHERCOST (DATINGFROM 1.5.30)OF completing the &quot;TRUNCATED&quot;&apos;&apos;.SCHEME ANDDEFENCES (JPIRSTSTAGE OF MILITARYDEFENCES ONLY ).4.   Item 3, table &apos;A&apos;,  shows that the gr^ssestimated, cost rf completing the Base would be 8,202,: 000    From this  must bo subtractedcontributions expect ad frcm the Dominions and colonies amounting to  1,117,000.     The not remaining expenditure by the UnitedKingdom is, therefore, estimated to ba  7,085,000nlus the cost of the second stage of the defences-f;.   Wo arc unable to give any useful ostimats cf thec^st of the second stago of the military defencessince the nature and sxtont of these defences hasnot yet been considered.     If however the original sstiaiats of the totalcost of tho Singapore defences given in C.I.D. PaperNo. 231-0 is taken as a gum do, it may be assumed that the cost of the second stage will amount t*3scmothlng over  1,000,000.6.   In case it may bs found necessary to defer forsome months a decision reversing the present  policy,wo havo included in Item 2, table  !A&apos;, an estimateof further  expenditure which will be incurred between1.5.50 and.  30.9-30.   This amounts to  270 , $00 .7.   We have also estimated that In the e^ent of  thepresent approved scheme continuing,&apos; the net financial provision by H.M. Government in the United  kingdom during tho  present and the next financial year &quot;willbo as follows:-                  - 1930 -  l\)3r.Naval expenditureMilitary expenditureAir expenditure   4 24,250 93,000 (gross) 73,750591,000Deduct contributions whichwill bb received by War Office  120,750 from Dominions  and Colonies                     Total      470,250

It  should bs  noted,  however,  that  the  air  expenditure in  these  years would b.R  incurred quite  apart  from any modification of policy with  regard, to the Base,  since  in any case  accommodation is required for  B.A.F. units  at Sings pore. 9.    Any  further air expenditure  after  tho  present station has been  completed would be  dependent en a  decision  to provide  spotting and fighter aircraft for tho military def soGOS .   In this connection  ?,e  -would point out that  the whole  of  the air expenditure at Singapore to  date has  been^necessary for B.A.-F. and Flwet  purposes, quite  apart from the project  for the Naval Base.   We have,  however,  included air expenditure in the attached tables, since part of  the Dominion  and Colonial contributions has  been used for it, and the  Aerodrome  is situate! on  land presented to His Majesty1s Government by  the  Straits Settlement  for the naval  Basw . 10.  From,table &apos;B&apos;  it will  be  seen that the  total cost of abandoning tho scheme is estimated to bo -                       5 , 3o6 , 000 in  respect of compensation to contractors,  etc., and repayment to tho Dominions an!  Colonies on  the  assumption that the  whole of the capital sums received will be  repaid without  interest.    To this  must  be added  an  amount  which it  is  impossible to assess -in respect of ro-instating  land which  weuld  be handed back to the Straits Settlement Government  (vide note attached).
11.   Against the cost of abandoning the scheme as estimatedabove muat be set certain asseto ouch as,  approximately, 50,000 for residual value of the plant at the Base,  and asum,  which could, only bo assessed locally, for the salevalue nf houses already built or land purchased from war department funds.   In addition /there Is a Ideating dock and Crane, the future of which, if the Base is abandoned,has not yet boon considered by the Admiralty.   It is exceedingly unlikely that a market oould be found for thorn,or whether any contractor could b.e got to buy them, even for breaking up.IE.   It will be observed that  123,000 has been includedin table TB&apos; under the heading &quot;Military Compensation toContractors&quot;.   This ia the outstanding commitment inrespect    the 15&quot; gun mounting which it has been decidedwill be retained for experimental use at hems if notutilised at Singapore.   The mounting may, therefore, beregarded as an asset equal in valuo to the. liability shewn.13.   While we arc, cf oourap, unable to forecast thearrangements which would be made for the repayment, to thaDominions and Colonies of the  2,133,000 shown in table  &apos;3&apos;if the Base is abandoned, we presume that it could boarranged that the sums due to the contractors  (say  1,173,000)should be spread over the present and the next financialyear.   On the assumption that terms neither less normore favourable were made with the Governments of theDominions.; and Colonies, aporcximatcly  1,650,000 would haveto be reimbursed during each of these years.1.4.   We have been unable to arrive  at any useful estimateof the eventual saving in maintenance cost which would accrue if the scheme for tho Base were abandoned.   Thefuture military garrison and tho establishments for thoBook Yard have not yet been worked out.   In the event,
however, of the Base being continued these charges wouldnot begin to operate ta any considerable extent for .another four er five years.15.   Nor have we taken into account in tho present report the &quot;deferred&quot; Naval and Air requirements, not included in the Truncated Scheme, which &quot;would have to betaken In hand should the Far Eastern outlook developunfavourably&quot;.     In 1928 the cost of these was very roughly estimated to amount to  4,500,000 (0.1.1. Paper 329-0, paras. 5 and11) .Ud. )              (Sd.)  Y.W. BADDELEY  (Admiralty).                    A,P.

Gn the 3rd of May, 1323, the Governor of the straits settlements reported that with the concurrence of the unofficial members of the Executive and Legislative Councils the sitesselected for the proposed Naval Base and Aerodrome would be handed evor to His Majesty&apos;s Geverrmiont as a free gift.   TheSecretary of State approved the offer, which was readily acceptedby His Majesty&apos;s Government.           The land was acquired at a cost of approximately 14GOO and is held under two Trust Deeds for the Admiralty andAir Ministry respectively,   The Declaration of Trust in thecase of tho land held for the Admiralty provides that &quot;if atany time the said portion of land cr any part thereof shall cease to bp required for the purpese of a Naval Base the saidportion cr such part thereof, as the oaso may bo,, shall standfreed and released, from the trust hereby created and theColonial Government nay dispose of the same upon payment to the lords Commissioners of the amount (if any) whereby the market value of the same inclusive of all works, buildings and machineryconstructed and erected thereon by the Lord 0?.mmissloners exceeds the estimated value of the same exclusive of such works, buildings and machinery&quot;.   It is understood that tho Declaration of Trustin the case of tho land held, for the Air Ministry is in similarterms.

ENCLOSURE  No. 2.COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.OVERSEA DEFENCE  COMMITTEE.                          The  Singapore  Base.    Memorandum by the Oversea Defence Sub-Committee of the Committee of                              Imperial Defence.     i.  THE Oversea Defence Committee have been directed to prepare, for  theinformation of the approaching Imperial Conference, a Memorandum  explaining the present situation as regards the development of the Singapore Naval Base.  -   2.  Since the policy  of  creating a Naval Base  at  Singapore  was originallyadopted in 1921, not only  have the plans for both the naval establishments and the defences been subjected to considerable modification,  but in 1924 the project was actually abandoned, only to be adopted again a few months later.     3.  In  order,  therefore, that the  present  situation may  be more clearlyappreciated, the Oversea Defence Committee have ventured in the present paper to summarise as briefly as possible the whole history  of the Base, starting  with  the radical change in the naval situation in the Far East resulting from the Great War,and the termination of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance.     The summary is based mainly on the records  of the  Committee of  ImperialDefence and of various Sub-Committees, as well as on the  records of the  imperial conferences of  1921,  1923,  1926,  the  Washington Conference,  and the BritishEmpire Delegation at Washington.Singapore before the Great War.     4.  Before the War,  Singapore was of  secondary importance, being classified as &quot; a war anchorage, a coaling station and a port of refuge for merchant shipping.&quot;Hong Kong was the principal British naval base in  the Far East,  and it was roundHong Kong that discussions on the subject of naval policy in that part of the worldwere centred.     5.  After the defeat of the Russian Fleet by the Japanese at Tsushima (1905)the British Battle Fleet was withdrawn from the China seas.  Thereby Hong Kongwas uncovered.  In the event  of a sudden outbreak of  war with Japan, it could  nothave been relieved for a month or more.  Although His  Majesty&apos;s Government inGreat Britain realised the risk, and decided  to increase  the fixed defences (whichtake a long time to complete) and local naval defences, they deliberately declined to lock up in Hong Kong the large garrison required  to enable the fortress to holdout in the event of a war with Japan until relieved by the Fleet.  In this respect theGovernment relied entirely on the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, intending to reinforce the Fleet if and when that Alliance came to an end.

                            ENCLOSURE No. secret(Revised Draft.)COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.OVERSEA DEFENCE COMMITTEE.                          The  Singapore  Base.    Memorandum by the Oversea Defence Sub-Committee of the Committee of                              Imperial Defence.     i.  THE Oversea Defence Committee have been directed to prepare, for theinformation of the approaching Imperial Conference, a Memorandum explaining the present situation as regards the development of the Singapore Naval Base.     2.  Since the policy  of  creating a Naval Base  at  Singapore  was originallyadopted in 1921, not only  have the plans for both the naval establishments and the defences been subjected to considerable modification,  but in 1924 the project was actually abandoned, only to be adopted again a few months later.     3.  In  order,  therefore,  that the  present situation may be more  clearlyappreciated, the Oversea Defence Committee have ventured in the present paper to summarise as briefly as possible the whole history  of the Base, starting with the radical change in the naval situation in the Far East resulting from the Great &quot;War,and the termination of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance.     The summary is based mainly on the records  of the Committee of ImperialDefence and of various Sub-Committees, as well as on the records of the imperial conferences of  1921,  1923,  1926,  the  Washington Conference, and the BritishEmpire Delegation at Washington.Singapore before the Great War.     4.  Before the War,  Singapore was of  secondary importance, being classified as &quot; a war anchorage, a coaling station and a port of refuge for merchant shipping.&quot;Hong Kong was the principal British naval base in  the Far East, and it was roundHong Kong that discussions on the subject of naval policy in that part of the worldwere centred.     5.  After the defeat of the Russian Fleet by the Japanese at Tsushima (1905)the British Battle Fleet was withdrawn from the China seas.  Thereby Hong Kongwas uncovered.  In the event of a sudden outbreak of  war with Japan, it could nothave been relieved for a month or more.  Although His  Majesty&apos;s Government inGreat Britain realised the risk, and decided  to  increase  the fixed defences (whichtake a long time to complete) and local naval defences, they deliberately declined to lock up in Hong Kong the large garrison required  to enable the  fortress to holdout in the event of a war with Japan until relieved by the Fleet.  In this respect theGovernment relied entirely on the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, intending to reinforce the Fleet if and when that Alliance came to an end.  But, as mentioned above, they maintained the defences as well as the coaling station and dockyard (on a-reduced scale), which could easily have been expanded if circumstances had made it necessaryto increase the Fleet.[20843]B
Singapore after the Great War.     6.  After the War, when the position in the Far East was re-examined, it was clear that many new factors had arisen. The Japanese Fleet had grown enormouslyand had become the third largest Fleet in the world.  The end of the Anglo-japanese alliance was in sight.  Considerations of economy rendered it impossible to maintainpermanently in the Far East  a fleet large enough  to  dominate the Japanese Fleet,as had been contemplated before the War in the event of a termination of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance.  Still less  could a garrison be maintained in Hong Kong strong enough to hold the fortress in  the event of war with Japan until it could be relieved by a fleet normally stationed  in Home Waters or the Mediterranean.  Moreover,the policy to send a fleet to the east and to maintain  it there in a mobile conditionhad disappeared.  During  the War the transition of  ships from coal-burners tooil-burners  had become almost complete.  There was but little oil on the easternroute, and  supplies in the Far East were insufficient to maintain the Fleet there onits arrival.  There were not enough oil tankers  in the world to take the Fleet to theFar East and maintain it  there in a mobile state in the  absence of local reserves.Further, the advent of the  submarine had necessitated the &quot; bulging &quot;  of capital ships, with the result that they had outgrown the dry docks in the Far East.    7.   In  these circumstances the conclusion was  reached, after  an exhaustiveexamination by the Committee of  Imperial Defence and its  Sub-Committee, the oversea Defence Committee, that Hong Kong was too exposed to continue to be theprincipal naval base in the Far East.   The only harbour possessing all the necessaryqualifications of a great naval  base,  i.e., size, anchorage, secure entrance, depth, &amp;c,was  found to be at Singapore, in  the narrow strait between Singapore  and the mainland.   In  addition,  Singapore was admirably situated as the base for a fleetcharged with the protection of the large British Imperial interests in the indian ocean and  in the South Pacific, a purpose for which it had been utilised during theearly part  of the War before the  &quot; Emden &quot; and &quot; Konigsberg &quot;  and Von Spee&apos;ssquadron had been disposed of.Policy of creating Singapore Base adopted.    8.   Early in 1921 the policy was adopted in principle of creating a great naval base at Singapore, with a  chain of fuelling stations  between that  port  and the mother country.     9.   Shortly after  this  decision was taken the Imperial  Conference  of 1921assembled.   The whole of the  facts regarding Singapore were communicated orallyas well as  in written memoranda  to representatives  of the Dominions and  India.Not  a voice was raised in the Conference against the proposal, but no formal con-clusion was recorded, for all naval questions in  the Far East were felt  to depend onthe results  of the Washington  Conference which had come on the horizon during theImperial  Conference.   Nevertheless,  it was made  quite clear  at  the ImperialConference that the Singapore project was  independent of  the Anglo-japanese alliance, and this was repeated after the announcement  in Parliament in london that the Imperial Conference was aiming at some understanding in the Pacific withthe United States and Japan  to replace the Anglo-Japanese Alliance.Washington Conference.     10.  A month or two later the British Delegates at the Washington conference were instructed inter alia not to enter into any agreement &quot;which will in any wayinterfere with the development of Singapore  as a British naval base,  since such development is purely defensive and is already overdue.&quot;  The records of the BritishEmpire Delegation at the Washington Conference show that the representatives ofthe Dominions were fully cognisant of these instructions.     11.  After the Washington Conference the Admiralty re-examined the strategic position in the Pacific, and their Memorandum was approved by the Committee ofImperial  Defence for despatch to the Dominions.   In this Memorandum  it waspointed out that, by the terms of the Washington Conference the power to increasethe naval facilities and coast defences at Hong  Kong had been lost; that the UnitedStates were debarred from increasing their facilities anywhere west of Hawaii, andthat, for practical purposes, this ruled them out so far as effective naval action in
 the  western basin of the Pacific was concerned,  and left the British Empire alone to counter with naval forces any aggressive tendencies on the part of Japan.  The Admiralty considered the development of Singapore essential,  and the Dominions were invited to assist in this task (July 1922).* The Conservative Government decides to proceed with the Singapore project.     12.   In the autumn of 1922 the Conservative Government came into office, and,lafter fresh investigations, decided to proceed with the Singapore project, although, in the financial  circumstances then  existing, it was decided to  spend very little money on it during the next two years. Imperial Conference, 1923.     13.   This decision was discussed at  great length at the Imperial Conference, 1923, which in its published report took formal note of the deep interest of Australia, New Zealand and India in the provision of a base at Singapore, as essential  for ensuring the mobility necessary to provide for the security of the territory and trade of the  Empire in  Eastern  waters.   Mr.  Massey stated that the  New Zealand Parliament had already voted  100,000 towards the base; and Mr. Bruce indicated that the  Commonwealth Parliament would be asked to contribute in some form. The  Labour Government decides not to proceed with the Singapore Base.     14.   In March 1924, after the change  of Government, it was decided not to proceed  with  the Naval  Base at Singapore.  The statement of policy in connection with this decision was as follows :          &quot; We have given careful consideration to the proposal to develop the Naval     Base at  Singapore.   We have  closely  studied the  reasons which led to  the     adoption  of this project, and the arguments in support of its continuation urged     upon us from the point of view of naval defence.         We had, however, to consider the matter in a wider relationship, and came     to the conclusion that we could not ask Parliament to proceed with this  scheme.     We  were  convinced  that, if we were to do so. our action would exercise a most     detrimental effect on our general foreign policy.   As we have repeatedly stated,     we stand  for a policy of international co-operation through a strengthened and     enlarged  League of  Nations, the settlement of disputes by conciliation  and     judicial arbitration, and the creation of conditions which will make  a compre-     hensive agreement on limitation of armaments possible.   As stated in the Prime     Minister&apos;s letter  to M. Poincare of the 21st February :   &apos; Our  task mean-     while must be to  establish  confidence,  and&apos; this task can only be achieved by     allaying the international suspicions and anxieties which exist to-day.&apos;         It seemed  clear, apart from  any  other considerations, that to continue  the     development of the  Naval Base at Singapore would hamper the establishment     of this confidence and lay our good faith open to suspicion.  Whilst maintaining     the present standard in a state of complete efficiency, we take  the view that it     would be  a serious mistake to be responsible for new developments that could     only be justified on assumptions that would definitely admit that we had doubts     in the success of our own policy.  As  a result, we should  almost inevitably drift     into a condition of mistrust and competition of armaments in the Far East.         Having provisionally reached the conclusions which I have set out, we felt     it our duty,  in view of the discussions  at the  recent Imperial Conference, to     communicate with the Governments of  the self-governing Dominions.  We,     therefore, put the position before them and invited their views.   I propose to     give the House a summary of these views.  The  Canadian Government tell us    that they  wish to refrain from any advice on the problem.  The Irish Free State    has adopted a similar attitude.  As to Australia, New Zealand and Newfound-     land, I must explain quite clearly that their  Prime Ministers wish, and, indeed,     urge us to proceed with the Base.   The Commonwealth Government  express i   cordial sympathy  with our  international policy of conciliation.   They tell us I   that the  desire in Australia is for a better  understanding  among the  nations     and  a definite reduction of armament on every possible occasion.   They consider,                                 * C.I.D. 176-C.       [20843]                                                       B 2
    however, that the action which we  propose, instead  of assisting the policy in    view, will jeopardise it  in that any reduction in the mobility of the Meet will    reduce our influence in the Councils of the Nations.   If the development of the    Singapore Base (the intention to proceed with which was, they point out, well    understood at the time of the Washington Conference) is now to be discontinued,    Australia would rather see this step taken  as a means for securing  further    international agreement for mutual  reduction of armaments.        The New Zealand Government  attach great importance to  development of    the Base, their opinion being founded  mainly on grounds  of  naval strategy.    Whilst laying  stress on  the view that its use is for defensive and not offensive    purposes, they feel that the interests of the British Empire in the Pacific will be    endangered should our capital ships be  unable to operate in those waters,  and    that the time has not yet come to rely solely on the  influence for peace of the    League  of Nations.        I should add  that  the  Commonwealth Government have  informed  us of    their  readiness to  submit proposals to their Parliament for a  substantial    contribution to  the development of the  Base.   New  Zealand has  already    generously offered a first contribution of  100,000 towards it.        Lastly, from South Africa we have heard from General  Smuts that our    proposed policy, which  he describes as 1 a bold move towards enduring peace,&apos;    meets with his wholehearted agreement.  He feels  that the authority of the    British  Empire  as the  protagonist of  the great cause of appeasement  and    conciliation  among  the  nations   would  be seriously  undermined  by  the    construction of the Singapore Base.        From the above summary, I think I may claim that we have  a large  measure    of sympathy in the Dominions with our international policy, even  if all parts    of the Empire do not feel able to endorse the methods by which we consider that    that policy should be carried out.  The  criticisms are founded,  in the main, on    the conception that the  Singapore Base is essential as part of  a complete    defensive Pacific  strategy.  Should the practical necessity for putting such a    strategy into operation arise by reason of the condition of world politics  and a    return to attempts to provide Imperial security primarily  by  armaments, the    whole question would  have to be  reconsidered, but,  in the  opinion of  His    Majesty&apos;s Government,  that  has  not  now  arisen, and  it  is  the  duty of    His Majesty&apos;s Government to try and prevent its arising.        We have every confidence in our policy, and we  feel that a decision  not to    proceed with the Naval  Base at Singapore will give that policy  the best possible    chance  of success and  is an earnest of  our good  faith.&quot;   (Hansard, 1924,    Volume  171-319-321.)November 1924.  The Conservative Government decides to  proceed with the Singapore        Base.    15.  On the 26th November, 1924, the new Conservative Government decided inprinciple that the Singapore Naval Base should be proceeded with.Setting up of Singapore Sub-Committee, 1925.    16.  Shortly afterwards,  the Committee of Imperial Defence  (193rd Meeting)decided to set up a Special Sub-Committee, presided over  by Lord Curzon :       (i) To re-examine the sites approved  by the Committee of Imperial Defence             on  the 14th  December, 1922,  for  the naval  base,  aerodrome  and             seaplane  station, in whicE connection the Secretary was instructed to             circulate the papers on which the previous conclusion had been reached.     (ii) To consider the  rate at which the naval base and the defences necessary             for its protection should be proceeded with.    (iii) To consider the programme of construction to be aimed at both for the             naval base and the defences, including examination  of deterrents as             alternatives  to heavy guns against  attack  by capital  ships;  the scale             of  defences required; the  strength of the Military and Air garrison;             and the approximate cost  of the proposals  recommended.First Interim Report.    17.  In February 1925, the Singapore  Sub-Committee issued  a  short InterimReport (C.I.D. Paper No. 243-C), in which they recommended without hesitation
I  the site for the floating dock in the Old Strait proposed  by the  Admiralty and  supported by the General Staff and Air Staff.  They also gave their opinion that theI  programme of work to be undertaken by the Admiralty on the Old Strait should be  limited  to what was  essential  to enable  the  dock  to be used  after its arrival at  Singapore; and they added that, for the immediate future, ships using the floating . dock would  have to depend  upon naval  repair ships and  the not inconsiderable  repairing resources in Keppel  Harbour.      The Sub-Committee also came to the conclusion, irrespective  of the  choice of  sites for the naval establishment, that the site provisionally selected for the aerodrome  and seaplane station on the South Shore of the Old Strait,  was the best available.  These conclusions were approved by the Cabinet on the 2nd March, 1925.  Lord Curzon&apos;s Statement in the house of Lords on the 4:th March, 1925.      18.   A statement of the  Governments policy with regard  to Singapore, based j on the Sub-Committee&apos;s report referred to above, was made  by Lord Curzon in the  House of Lords on the 4th  March, 1925.      For  convenience of reference, the  part of this statement dealing with more  general questions of policy is reproduced as Annexure I to this memorandum.  Second Interim Report.      19.   On the 23rd  October, 1925, the Singapore Sub-Committee, the  Chair ofI which had been taken by the Prime Minister on the death of Lord Curzon, issued a1 Second  Interim  Report (C.I.D. Paper  No. 253-C),  dealing with the cost  ofI fabricating the new floating dock and assembling it at Singapore, and recommending1 certain  naval,  military and  anti-aircraft defences.  The  Committee also  recom-I mended that authority should  be given to  the Air Ministry to proceed  with the  construction of an aerodrome and accommodation for FLAP, personnel at Singapore.  It was recommended that consideration of the heavy defences should be postponed  until the following year.      These recommendations were approved by the  Cabinet  on the  11th November.  1925.  Third Interim Report.      20.   On the  20th  July, 1926, the Singapore Sub-Committee submitted to the  Committee of  Imperial Defence a Third Interim Report (C.I.D. Paper No. 275-C),  dealing with the defences and the future development of the Naval  Base.      The recommendations as regards the defences were as follows :            &quot; (A)  Heavy  Defences. To approve the  Report  of  the  Chiefs of  Staff  Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 273-C), the Conclusions of which are as follows :            Subject, then, to the views we severally hold, on the question of principle,      as summarised above,  we recommend that the  Committee of Imperial Defence      should approve the following Conclusions :            (1)  That the  first stage of the  plan of  defence of Singapore shall makeIprovision for mounting three 15-inch guns.           (2)  That,  before  the  second stage  is  entered upon, there shall be  a                 re-examination,   which   shall  include  a   fresh   investigation,                 unprejudiced by the  present agreement,  of the question of substitu-                 tion of aircraft for the balance of the 15-inch guns in the light of air                 development during the intervening period.           (3)  That, with a view to the strategical grouping of Air garrisons so as to                 admit of the organisation of  a mobile system  of defence, the  Air                 Ministry shall continue                  (a) The organisation of a  chain of air ports throughout the Empire                       by the  development  of suitable aerodromes  and  landing-                       grounds on the section between Calcutta and  Singapore.                 (&amp;) The development of a  suitable type of torpedo-bombing aircraft                       capable of utilisation in dual roles, such as  frontier warfare                       and coast defence.
        (B) Medium and Light Armament. To approve the proposals of the War    Office for amending the medium and light armament, so that the scale will now    BE AS FOLLOWS:                                      Anti-       Anti-Aircraft       9-2-inch.         6-inch.         C.M.B.          Guns.           Lights.         6             14             8*           24             16                                * Double equipments.            Note. Of the above,  two 9-2-inch, four 6-inch, and four  lights are         already installed in the existing defences.         (C) That the  generous contribution  of  the Malay States towards the    Singapore Naval Base (C.I.D. Paper No. 274-C) should enable  the above scheme I    to be proceeded with during the next four years, as well as the first stages of the  ;    scheme of development dealt with below.&quot; ... The Sub-Committee  further recommended  that a reduced  scheme  for the Idevelopment of the Naval Base, submitted by the Admiralty at a cost of  7,750.000 Ias compared with the original estimate of  11,000,000, should be approved, providedthat it was clearly understood that it would be necessary for the deferred portions ofthe scheme to be proceeded with (in some cases at a  somewhat increased cost) shouldthe outlook in  the Far East become  threatening.    They also recommended that the Committee of Imperial Defence should considerthe desirability of giving instructions  for the preparation of a Table for circulationat the forthcoming Imperial Conference, showing, so far as was then possible, the anticipated cost, year by year, of the development and defence of the Singapore Base.    The above  conclusions were approved by the  Cabinet on the 3rd August,  1926,and a Table showing the anticipated cost of the Naval  Base and defences was prepared  and  circulated two  months  later  at  the  Imperial  Conference  underC.I.D. Paper No. 281-C.Imperial Conference, 1926.    21.  Among the Conclusions reached by the Imperial Conference, 1926, on thesubject of Defence was the following :     &quot; 4.  Impressed with the vital importance&apos; of ensuring the security of  the world-wide trade routes, upon which the safety  and welfare of all parts  of the Empiredepend, the representatives of Australia, New Zealand and India note with special interest the steps already taken by  His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great  Britain todevelop the  Naval  Base  at Singapore,  with  the  object of facilitating the free movement of the Fleets.  In view of the heavy expenditure involved, they welcome the spirit of co-operation shown in  the  contributions made with the object  of expediting this work.&quot;Reduced Scheme for Local Naval Defences submitted  by the Admiralty.    22.  In January 1927 the Admiralty informed the  Committee of ImperialDefence (C.I.D. Paper No. 290-C), that the proposals  for the local naval defences of singapore had been reconsidered in view of the urgent need for reducing  the cost of defending Singapore consistently with the necessity for rendering that port secure from  attack, and with special regard to the fact that  Japan had not developed, and appeared unlikely to develop,  Coastal Motor  Boats  as a  branch  of the ImperialJapanese Navy. As a result of further investigations, the Admiralty were of opinionthat, whereas the local naval defences  already approved were designed to  give a fullscale of defence for the Fleet anchorage and Keppel Harbour against both submarine and Coastal Motor Boat attack, certain modifications could be accepted involving a saving on the original estimate of  215,000.                            i    By direction of the  Committee of  Imperial  Defence these recommendations were considered by  the  Oversea Defence Committee, who  recommended that  &quot;approvalshould be given  to the modification suggested in the Memorandum by the  Admiralty(C.I.D. Paper No. 290-C), which, in the opinion of the Committee, do not  necessitateany alteration in the plans for the military defences as at present approved.&quot;  Thisrecommendation was approved by the Committee of  Imperial  Defence at  their226th Meeting  on the 5th May,  1927.Lieutenant-General  Sir Webb GUlman&apos;s Commission&apos;s Visit to Singapore,  1927.    23.  In March 1927 the Army Council, with the cognisance of the Committee ofImperial Defence, sent a Commission, under the chairmanship of Lieutenant-General
 Sir Webb Gillman, to Singapore, in order to investigate on the spot the details of the  proposed defences of the Naval Base  which had received approval, and the Committee of  Imperial Defence, at their 229th Meeting on the  14th July,  1927, recommended that,  on the return  of  Sir  Webb Giilman,  the Committee should reconsider the whole question of the development of the defences.  Early in 1928 the Chiefs of Staff, by direction of  the Prime Minister, reviewed the question of the scales of  attack and scales of defence of the Naval Base at  Singapore, taking into consideration the Report by  the Commission headed by General Sir Webb Gillman which had visited Singapore  (C.I.D. Paper No. 304-C).     In their Report (C.I.D. Paper No. 312-C) the Chiefs of Staff recommended-     (a) That the first stage of the plan of  defence of Singapore, as approved by           the  Committee of  Imperial  Defence and the Cabinet (215th and 218th           Meetings of the Committee of Imperial Defence), including provision for           three 15-inch guns, should be proceeded with, subject to such modifications           in detail as  may  be  adopted  as the result of the enquiry  now being           conducted by General  Gillman&apos;s Sub-Committee.  This will not result in           any economy during the financial year 1928-29.     (&amp;) That the time  originally allowed (3 years) for the  completion of the first           stage of the plan of gun defences should be prolonged by 2 years, i.e., to           the end of the financial year 1932-33.     (c) That, in considering the first stage of the programme, General Gillman&apos;s           Committee should assume that there is no alteration in the scale of attack           as hitherto laid down, with the exception of attack by Coastal Motor           Boats,  which,  we are  agreed,  need not  be  considered  in present           circumstances.    (d) That consideration of the later  stages of the plan of  defence, which include           the western defences, should be postponed for the present, since both the           scale of attack and the scale of defence will be affected by the assumptions           to be made on certain matters  on which it may be possible  to express           more definite opinions a year or two hence, such as the presence or absence           of battle  cruisers on the China Station; detailed plans for mine-fields;           the strength of the Air Forces to be based  on Singapore;  the degree of           reliance to  be placed  on reinforcements from  India; and other possible           developments.     The above  Conclusions were approved by the Cabinet on the 4th April, 1928.Revised Estimate of Expenditure on the Naval Base and Defences, prepared 1928.    24.   In October 1927 the Admiralty decided that the year 1937 (instead of 1935)should be  accepted as the date of completion of the Naval Base on the understandingthat the Floating Dock would be ready for use in 1929,  as previously arranged, andthat no change would be made  in  the programme for the provision of  defences(C.I.D. Paper No. 306-C).    In consequence,  the Prime  Minister,  in  addition  to  instructing the  three fighting Departments  to consult  at  once together and produce revised plans on themost economical scale compatible  with the objects to be  attained, directed that theyshould present a revised estimate  of  the expenditure in each year up to 1937 on thesame basis as that presented  in 1926.    This estimate was subsequently circulated to the Committee of Imperial Defence(C.I.D. Paper No. 329-C).December  1928.  Decision to suspend  Expenditure  on 9-2  and lb-inch Guns at        Singapore during 1929-30.    25.  On the  19th  December,  1928,  the  Cabinet  approved the  following recommendations by  the Committee  of  Imperial  Defence regarding  the  SingaporeNaval  Base (C.I.D.  Paper No. 331-C) :-    (a) That the Chiefs of Staff  Sub-Committee should enquire into the results of          the recent bombardment  trials at Malta and  Portsmouth, and in due          course submit a report on the  deductions to be drawn from them in regard          to the employment of guns in coast defence.    (b) That there  shall  be  no expenditure  on the installation  of  9-2 and          15-inch guns at Singapore during the financial year 1929-30, in order to          allow  adequate  time   for  full  investigation  of the  results of the          above-mentioned trials.
                                      w    The Cabinet took  note  that,  in  making  their  second  recommendation,  theCommittee of  Imperial Defence  did  not suggest that  the final completion  ofthe Singapore defences should be further postponed.Situation on  the formation of the present Government.    26.  In  June 1929 the situation was briefly as follows :      Naval Programme.         The Floating Dock had been constructed and had arrived at Singapore.         The completion of the modified scheme for the naval repair and storage    base by 1937 had been approved.         The contract for the main part of the work (the graving dock and facilities    connected  therewith)  had been  placed  with  Messrs.   Sir  John Jackson    (Singapore), Limited, on the 27th September,  1928.   The time for completion    was seven years from that date.    Military Programme.         The first stage of the plan of  military defence (including the provision of    3  15-inch, 4 9-2-inch and 4 6-inch guns) had been approved and work was pro-    ceeding.  The date of completion for this stage was the end of the financial year    1932-33.         It had, however,  been decided that there should be no expenditure on the    installation of 9-2 and 15-inch guns during the  financial year 1929-30, in order    to  allow adequate  time  for  full  investigation of the  results  of  recent    bombardment trials at Malta and Portsmouth.         Consideration of  the later stages of the plan of defence had been postponed    for the present.    Air Programme.        A flying-boat squadron was now located at Singapore.  The landing ground    itself was practically completed, while the works services, barracks and technical    accommodation  for headquarters,  one flying-boat squadron and two flights of    Fleet Air Arm or one squadron of Torpedo Bombers were making good progress.         On the air route from India to  Singapore considerable progress had also    been made; landing grounds and sites for seaplane moorings had been surveyed,    and in some cases work was already in  progress.Cash Contributions by  Members of the British  Empire.    27.  Cash  contributions  to the  cost  of  the Base had  been  promised  byHong Kong, the Federated Malay States and New Zealand, amounting to  250,000, 2,000,000 and  1,000,000 respectively.    Of these, the following had already been received and expended :                                                                           Hong Kong    ...      ...       ...       ...    250,000             New Zealand  ...      ...       ...       ...    250,000             Federated Malay States ...       ...       ...   1,080,000                         Total     ...       ...       ...   1,588,000Decision to slotv down  the work on the Base.   October 1929.    28.  Soon  after the assumption of office  by His Majesty&apos;s present Governmentin the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the question of the singapore Base again came under review in accordance with.the new Governmentsdesire  that defence  policy should be co-ordinated and put  on a thoroughly scientific and systematic basis and related to the international  policy which it  was intendedto pursue.    29.  At  the 244th Meeting of the  Committee of Imperial Defence on the25th July, 1929, the Prime Minister made  a statement outlining the points which,
 in his opinion, required careful consideration in connection with Singapore*; the   large overruling problem &apos;&apos;  being that            The conditions of the international situation governing Imperial strategy,     and perhaps of Imperial stategy itself which  prevailed when the Singapore     base  was  projected have undoubtedly changed.  What  modifications in the     conclusions come to in those days are now required ? &apos;&apos;     The Prime Minister mentioned that the small Cabinet Committee which had been surveying  the  present position at Singapore  had, amongst other  things,  been considering the following         &quot; (1) Commitments made to the Dominions, as well as to the Colonies and     Dependencies,  like the Straits  Settlements,  Hong Kong and the Malay States;         (2) Contracts already entered into for  the execution of work;         (3) Progress already  made, like the  presence of  the Floating Dock and the     commencement of the graving  dock;         (4) The present position of the defences in relation to recent experiments;&apos;&apos; and that &quot;the  Committee&apos;s conclusions for the moment&quot; were :          &quot; (1) That the Dominions should be  kept fully informed of  what is passing     in its mind.         (2) That the financial gain which would result from a complete stoppage     would, when all obligations are taken into account, be comparatively small.         (3) Whilst there  is  disagreement  about defences,  the original  scheme,     suspended  by our predecessors, will remain  in that condition.         (4) For at least the  next  two years an Air Force Squadron  drawn  from     Home Forces will be based at Singapore.         (5) The Jackson Contract for the completion of  a  graving dock will  be     proceeded with.&quot;     He added that the conclusions would be  transmitted  at once by  telegram to the Dominions, and expressed the earnest hope that those principally concerned would endorse them.     These conclusions,  having been communicated to the  Dominions,  were subse- quently endorsed by the Cabinet, and a torpedo-bomber squadron from the &quot;Home Forces &quot; is shortly proceeding  to Singapore.     30.  Towards the end of 1929 a further important factor emerged,  namely, the acceptance by all the Powers  concerned of the invitation issued by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to a Naval Disarmament Conference in London in January 1930.     31.  While it was considered impossible to forecast the effect of this Conferenceon the future of the Capital Ship, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdomfelt  that to continue the entire Singapore  scheme  in complete disregard of thepossibilities of  the  Conference would be indefensible, and  in  October  1929 it wasdecided, pending the results of the Disarmament  Conference      (1)  That the work on the  Singapore  Base already  contracted for  should be          slowed down as much as possible;     (2) That all work that could be suspended should be suspended;  and     (3) That no new work  should be embarked on.    32.   The practical effect of  this decision has, however,  been negligible,  since itwas subsequently found that it would not be economical to retard the work  alreadycontracted for, and the Jackson Contract is therefore proceeding normally.            , Secretary,Oversea Defence Committee.I, Whitehall Gardens, S.

ANNEXURE I.    Statement made by Lord Curzon in the House of Lords on March 4, 1925.    I should have been prepared, had the necessity arisen, to state the case  or todefend the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the broadest grounds, but agood deal of the need for doing  so has disappeared after the speech to which welistened from my noble friend, Lord Balfour.  He successfully, and, I hope, finally,disposed of the charge, or, at any rate, of the insinuation, that this construction ofa naval dockyard and base at  Singapore either does involve,  or can be regarded byany fair-minded person  as  involving,  or is regarded by any responsible  body ofopinion in Japan as involving, any act of even the smallest possible offence to thatcountry.   The noble Earl spoke from his experience at the Foreign Office and, stillmore, from his experience at Washington.  I also happen to have been at the ForeignOffice at the same time and  for some years afterwards,  and all I can say is that Inever received from any Japanese representative, or from any authoritative body ofopinion in Japan, any expression of doubt or distrust, much less of suspicion orhostility,  and when Lord Wimborne said that this feeling existed in Japan and,for all I know, it may find occasional expression in newspapers I hope he will take it from me, and  I am certain that my view will be endorsed by the present occupantof the  Foreign Office, that this view is not shared by those who have had to speakofficially for that country.    The second point that was,  I  think,  established  by my noble friend,  lord balfour, was that this base is  going to be set up, as I hope it will be, at Singaporebecause it is a  necessary and indispensable link  in the  great chain of imperial communications.  Noble Lords opposite are rather disposed to argue as if our positionin the Far East  were exactly comparable with those of other  European Powers.  Itis not so.  The noble Lord himself said just  now that if we were engaged in war inthe East the possession of a base at Singapore would be regarded by other  powers as giving us a position of advantage and I  think he meant unfair advantage.   Butwe are already in a position of advantage.  Look at our Possessions in those  partsof the world India,  Ceylon, Singapore itself, Trincomaii and Hong Kong. Thoseresponsibilities  which we have inherited  from our predecessors surely carry  withthem the elementary obligation of protection and defence,  and that anybody in anynation should deny to us the privilege which they all take for  themselves which the americans take for themselves  in the Pacific, which the Japanese take for themselvesin their own waters of protecting  our  own interests and looking  after our ownPossessions, is to me  incredible.    The  noble  Viscount,  Lord  Wimborne,  said I do  not  think that I ammisrepresenting  him that he did not think  it likely that in the event of war in theFar East  the British Fleet  would ever be sent to Singapore.  I very much doubt whether the Admiralty would support that proposition, and it would occur  to me tosay rather and I challenge contradiction that if  there were war in the Far Eastand if you did not send your Fleet to Singapore, or to  the Far East,  the whole ofyour Possessions would go, your trade routes would be destroyed and your dominions would be exposed to attack.  I do not  want to suggest dangerous possibilities, butsurely it must be obvious that in conditions  like that, whoever might be the enemy(and I am not for a  moment thinking of any Far Eastern Power), if the  british fleet were not there to support our cause and without a naval base  it could not doso what  would become of Hong Kong, of Singapore itself, what would become ofthe vast body of mercantile interests which we have built  up in the Far East, and,in the last resort, what would become of the Dominions ?  The Dominions are rallyingto the  cause and obligation  of self-defence in a manner to which I  shall presentlyallude, but nobody who knows their view can doubt that  the apprehensions whichthey entertain upon the matter are serious, and that they regard it not merely fromthe point of view that I have expressed, but as an essential and&quot; elementary condition for the protection of their own territories.    That is, I think, all that I need say upon the general  aspect of the case, exceptthis:  When the noble and learned Viscount, Lord Haldane, said just now that thisproposal is regarded  as provocative by the onlooking nations, whom  did he mean?
oHe himself accepted the disclaimer of my noble friend Lord Balfour with regard to japan.  Whom then does he mean&apos;?  Who are the people who regard our creation ofthe naval base at Singapore with suspicion?  I challenge reply.  I know that  thenoble and learned Viscount cannot reply.  This is one of those genial but really quiteempty commonplaces which,  when examined, mean nothing.   We  are told that  thecreation of a base at Singapore is calculated to cause suspicion, is  inconsistent with proposals for disarmament, is a provocative act.  Whom does it provoke ?     Viscount Haldane: I  did not say that Japan was not agitated over  this.   Onthe contrary, I said that it was.  I admitted that this was quite outside the line of demarcation drawn at Washington, but if you read foreign  newspapers,  Japanesenewspapers  that come over here, extracts will show  that there is a great deal ofmurmuring about this.    The  Marquess  Curzon of Kedleston:  That is not an answer to my question.The noble and learned Viscount  did not say Japan, he said  &quot; onlooking  nations,&quot;and I am  afraid that he will not  reply to my question because he is unable to do so,because there is no reply.  The noble Viscount then asked me a number of questions as to the manner in which this matter is being treated by His Majesty&apos;s Government.Those questions were, if I may say so, entirely fair, and I will endeavour to reply tothem. When we came into  power, as your Lordships know, we reversed the decisionof the late Government  regarding the abandonment of the naval base at Singapore,but we then set to work to  make  a renewed and most careful examination of everybranch and aspect of the case in  the Committee  of Imperial Defence.  I can speakauthoritatively, because on  all these occasions I happened to be in  the chair.    The  first question to which we addressed ourselves was this.   It is,  I think amatter of common consent  that,  if you are to have a naval base  in the Far East,Singapore is, without doubt, because of its position, its facilities  and its supplies,the right  place.  But it did not, therefore, necessarily follow from that that theOld Strait, which is the place selected for  the site,  was the only possible, or even the obvious, site, and accordingly we  addressed ourselves to a most minute examinationof the question whether the existing facilities at Singapore in the  harbour that liesto the south of the  Island, commonly known as  Keppel Harbour,  could be used in place of  the site on the  Old  Strait,  or whether the two could be employed in combination.  For this purpose, we took the evidence  of all those high officials whowould be  most competent to advise us  in the matter.   We saw and examined thelate Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet in Eastern waters.  We saw the late GeneralOfficer Commanding in Singapore.   We  communicated by  telegram  with theGovernor, who has been there for nearly five years, and who gave us his views.  we also saw experts familiar with the locality and with every aspect  of the case, with what I may call the technical and hydrographic aspects of the problem.    After this minute  examination, protracted  over  several meetings, we came tothe conclusion that,  at any rate, for the purpose of the floating dock, there  can be nodoubt about it that the site on the Old Strait is the only possible site.  We consideredvery carefully whether  it could be put  in Keppel  Harbour, and we  found that the locality would be exposed both to long-range bombardment and torpedo attack, and,further that the swift currents which run to and fro in that narrow strait wouldbe incompatible with the kind of work  required, and  that the space in what  I willcall the commercial  harbour is so  restricted that  to combine the entire operations ofthe Navy with those of  commerce  in that narrow area  would  be  impossible.Therefore, we came to the inevitable and unanimous conclusion that, as between thetwo sites,  there wras no question that the site in the Old Strait must be selected.  Bythe Old Strait your  Lordships will understand that I refer to the strait between the island of  Singapore and the mainland of Johore.    I said that that decision  applied to  the floating dock, and here  I may recall that lord Wimborne frankly agreed that a floating dock was a necessity.  If so, it mustbe placed  somewhere, and as  between the two sites, I think no one  will dispute thatthe Admiralty is in all  probability right in pronouncing in favour of the northernsite, to which I have referred, and up to that point His Majesty&apos;s Government,agreeing  with the findings of the Imperial Defence Committee, have authorised thepurchase and sending out of the floating dock and necessary works for installation onthe site in the Old Strait.
