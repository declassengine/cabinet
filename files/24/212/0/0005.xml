Note  by the Secretary,  Economic Advisory Council.    AT  their  meeting   held  on  the  8th  May,  1930  (E.A.C./4th  Meeting,Conclusion 3), the Economic Advisory  Council bad before them the attached note,with enclosures,  prepared at their request by the Ministry  of Labour,  in consulta-tion with the Treasury and the Board of Trade, relative to the issue of charts givingthe figures of employment in relation to the state  of trade.    The Economic Advisory Council agreed     (a) To submit to the Cabinet the above memorandum prepared by the Ministry          of Labour, in  conjunction with the Treasury and the Board of Trade,          covering a series of charts illustrating the relation of employment to the          state of trade (Council Paper E.A.C.  (H)  87).    (b) To recommend that the Cabinet should consider the periodical  issue in the          &quot; Ministry of  Labour Gazette &quot; of charts with explanatory figures on the          lines suggested in the memorandum referred to  in (a)  above.              Note.-In agreeing to this Conclusion, Mr.  Benin asked that a note          should be taken of his view that, in accordance with the recommendation          of the  Balfour Committee,  banking  statistics should  include the  total          turnover of the Joint-Stock Banks,  i.e., the total value of cheques drawn          on customers&apos;  accounts.

BEVIN&apos;S PROPOSALS    FOR THE  ISSUE  OF  CHARTS  GIVING  THE  UNEMPLOYMENT    FIGURES  IN  RELATION  TO THE STATE  OF TRADE.    1.  IN  accordance with the conclusions reached by the Council,  consultationshave taken place between the Ministry of Labour, the Treasury and  the Board ofTrade.  The present memorandum has the concurrence of the Treasury and the Boardof Trade.    2.  There is agreement upon the principle that those who have occasion to study the nature and significance of the unemployment figures should periodically be givenconvenient means of examining them in relation to other information  bearing uponthe state of trade, and that a chart helps to bring out the effect of one factor on another. It is, however,  thought  to be inappropriate that the same chart  should appear  in  both the &quot; Ministry  of Labour  Gazette &quot;  and the &quot; Board  of  TradeJournal.&quot; There  is  already published,  once a  month, in  the &quot; Board of  TradeJournal,&quot; a table of figures and Index Numbers from 1924 up to date, covering manyaspects of trade and finance, and including the unemployment figures in total  and byselected  industries.   (Specimen  attached.)  The  Board of  Trade also   issuesperiodically to the Members of its Advisory Council charts illustrating certain ofthese figures. (Specimen  attached.)    3.  What follows has reference to the periodical publication of charts and tablesin the &quot; Ministry of Labour Gazette.&quot;  It may be said  that the graphic illustrationof statistics has in recent years been greatly extended  in the &quot; Ministry of LabourGazette,&quot; and that since 1925  a Chart Supplement (specimen  attached) has been presented with each February issue.    4.  In considering- what curves could most informatively  be presented along with the unemployment curves, attention has been given to the items suggested byMr. Bevin.  Two of the items appear to  present objections or difficulties.  As regardsthe rise and fall in the volume of  Bank Deposits, an expansion may reflect eitherexpanding or diminishing trade activity, according to circumstances; that is  to say,either trade activity may be leading  to the creation of  credit, or depression may beleading to an accumulation of frozen credits.  In the absence of an analysis of thecause and nature of the movement,  which  would be inappropriate to the present purpose and to the character and scope of the &quot;Ministry of Labour Gazette,&quot; it isthe view of the Treasury  that a curve  of Bank  Deposits would  be more misleadingthan helpful.  The same objection  would apply to statistics of Bank Advances.   Asregards the  Total Available Working  Population, no  sufficient data  are available.The numbers of &quot; occupied &quot; persons are ascertained at each census, and for inter-censal years computations can be  made of the  numbers of  persons in various  agecategories; but there is no means of ascertaining the numbers who are available forwork  (including those in employment)  in inter-censal  years. The  available infor-mation  nearest  to that sought by Mr. Bevin is the annual  computation of &quot; personsinsured against unemployment.&quot; This  series excludes domestic service and agricul-ture,  also certain excepted employees,  and  the ascertainment is made only once inthe year.  A curve showing the growth of these numbers can be given on the chart.       [21079]                                                         this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF  HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENT.

(b) Public Works Contracting.     6.  The Board of Trade will supply to the Ministry of Labour all the figures(other than  those  for employment, unemployment, wages,  and  cost of living)necessary for the periodical preparation of the above charts.  As regard wages, theonly information continuously available relates to changes in agreed rates of wages.Data as to earnings would be much preferable for index-number purposes, but  suchdata (apart from the tabulations  of the earnings enquiries of 1924 and 1928) areavailable only for a varying, but in general small, sample of firms in the industriescovered by the &quot; State of Employment &apos;&apos; articles in the Ministry of  Labour Gazette.Should sufficiently  representative  earnings figures become  available  later on  theymight be  substituted for the changes in rates on which any present  index-numbermust be based.     7.  It is proposed that the charts shall cover a period beginning 1924, and thatall  indices shall be computed from  the year 1924 as a base.  This will avoid the increasing difficulty of relating present-day to 1914  conditions, and will enable the significance of 1924-30 movements to be brought out more clearly.     8.  In a series of charts covering a period of six  years, monthly additions would add only  1 /72nd to the existing  line,  and it would  appear inappropriate to issuesuch  charts  monthly.   It is  suggested,  therefore,  the charts should appear atquarterly intervals.  When monthly data are available they would  be given.   Theywould appear as a double-page insert supplement to the Ministry of Labour Gazettein the months of January, April,  July and October.   Advance copies of the  chartswould be available  for issue to  the  Press  with the advance &quot;unemployment&quot;summary which they now receive.     9.  In the specimen charts attached  an attempt has  been made to arrange allthe general curves on one  foolscap page  and  all the charts relating to particular industries on another.   This implies a series of charts on a minute scale,  but  it issuggested that the purpose and value of a graph lies not in its measurability  but inits  trend, and that  the trend of a graph  is as easily seen on a small as on a large scale.  The charts will be  produced by photographic reduction  and the trend  willbe accurately represented.     10.  The figures on which the charts are based would be printed on the back ofthe charted pages.  The tables would give both absolute numbers and index numbers.It might be that, for reasons of space, only annual figures and indices could be givenfor  the earlier years, and quarterly or monthly figures  for, say,  the last twelvemonths.     11.  Each graph, it will be observed, is presented in a separate &quot; box.&quot;   Thealternative course would be to have, say, half a dozen &quot; boxes &quot; each containing theunemployment curve as a basis with two or three other curves overlying it.  Underthis plan difficulties of &apos;&apos; scale &apos;&apos; arise.   Impressions  as to the relation of two move-ments can be greatly affected by  choice of scale.  Moreover, the grouping of  thecurves under such a scheme implies a prior view as to  the  relation  between onephenomenon and  another.  It would appear inadvisable to imply such  views in anofficial publication of this kind.     12.  The Ministry of Labour sees much difficulty in the adopting of Sir SydneyChapman&apos;s suggestion for an index-number of unemployment which shall disregard       [21079]                                                        B 2
the changes in the volume of recorded unemployment due to administrative changes.It is often possible to estimate roughly the numbers of  persons brought  on to the registers by a particular legislative or administrative change; and to a lesser degreeestimates can be made of subtractions from the register due to similar causes.   Butthis applies only to short-term effects of considerable  magnitude and of  a markednature.   It cannot be safely extended in  a continuous modification such as wouldbe necessary for  the  compilation of an index-number.  One cannot, for example,estimate what the unemployment figures would have been to-day had the Acts and regulations remained unaltered since 1923 or 1924.    13.   The specimen chart herewith submitted is no more than an attempt madein the time available to  indicate generally the form that  will be aimed  at in theversion  to be  published.  Improvements  in  arrangement,  greater precision indescriptive labels, and adjustments of scale, will be effected where it seems desirable.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,        May 5, 1930.
