The question of the Channel Tunnel was consideredby the Committee of Imperial Defence on May 29th, when mr. Baldwin and Mr. Lloyd George were present at myinvitation.   The v/hole of the proceedings of theCommittee are being circulated separately to theCabinet.      The Papers of the Economic Advisory Counciland those prepared by tho various Departments interested.in tho economic side of the subject have also been circulated.      In order to focus the disci;.ion at the CabinetI have had prepared the attached draft Statement, whichI should propose to show, in th6 form approved by theCabinet, to Mr. Baldwin and to Mr. Lloyd George , and.subsequently to read in the House of Commons beforethe lhitsuntide Recess.(Signed )RIMS AY MACDCNA-LD&apos;,2,  Whitehall  Gardens,  S.W.T,         May  30th,  1930.
                  THE  CHAHNEI.  TUNNEL            DRAFT STAr:^.; ?NT  BY TK;J  PRIJ-OS  MINISTER                        The recent comprehensive  enquiry  into the                  question of  the Channel Tunnel was  initiated by                  the  late Prime  Minister,  after consultation with                  the  Leaders  of  the  Opposition Parties, in April,                  1929.  It  differed  from the  four previous en-                  quiries  undertaken  during the present century in                  this respect, that  whereas on those occasions                  the  military and  economic aspects were dealt                  with simultaneously -  the latter rather                  perfunctorily - in  the  present instance  the                  enquiry  was  begun by an exhaustive  investigation                  of  the economic and civil aspects of  the project.                        I wish to  take  this opportunity to place                  on  record  the thanks of the  Government to the                  Channel  Tunnel  Committee  for the thoroughness                  and impartiality  of their enquiry.  It is                  unnecessary  for me  to enter  into the  details of                  the  Channel  Tunnel  scheme, as these are  set                  forth in the published Report.   The  Committee                  reaches  the  broad conclusion that &quot;the construction                  of  a Channel Tunnel, by creating now  trafficCmd.3513,page 90, and thus increasing trade, would he of economicpara.  6.                  advantage  to this country&quot;.                        One of the five  signatories  to the                  Report,  however,  dissents from this view, andIbid,  page 96.     &quot;is  opposed  to  the  scheme on economic grounds&quot;.                        The weight of the  majority conclusion,
0 rj o6 / I                    however,  has to be valued, in the setting                    of the Report ,  which contains many important                    Qualifications, and, for my part, as a                    supporter in principle of the idea of a                    Channel Tunnel, I was disappointed to find how                    many elements of doubt and uncertainty exist,                    and how lukewarm is the support to the project                    from trade and  industry,,                           The main element of uncertainty is in                     regard to the  feasibility of construction.                    Tho three great firms of engineers consulted by                    the Channel Tunnel Committee state in their                    Report that &quot;no definite opinion can be given                    until the ground has been proved by the                    construction of the pilot tunnel.

If this operation is successfully                    accomplished -  and it is estimated to take  five                    years - the main tunnel would be constructed at                    a further cost  estimated at  25,000,000.   Even
                    this large figure,  however,  does  not  include                    the cost of the exchange  stations,  the  open                    approaches from the mouth of the  Tunnel to the                    exchange stations,  the  electric locomotives,                    the necessary rolling stoc:, the  electric                    generating stations and the  land  required.  The                    total cost, therefore,  &quot;Ould considerably exceedr.d.3513,  page 89.    the  30,600,000 provided  for in the Committee&apos;s                    Report for the pilot and  main tunnels.   In                    addition,  a considerable  amount of  capital                    invested in the existing  cross-Channel  system                    will be  rendered unproductive.                          Once the Channel Tunnel is constructed, -                    the Committee anticipate  no  difficulty  in regard                    to  its operation and upkeep.                          The Committee believe &quot;that  the  Channel                    Tunnel could be built,  maintained and operated                    by  private enterprise at  a cost vrhich ^ould                    permit of  the traffic through it  being  conveyed                    at  rates not higher than  those at present inmd. 3 513 , pa ge  90.conclusion 5.         force on the short  cross-Channel  route&quot;,&apos;                          There is no  suggestion of  lower  rates.                          A careful study  of tho Report reveals                    a conspicuous absence of  enthusiastic support                    to  the scheme from  any  large trade, industry                    or  interest.   The farming community, especially                    in  the south and south-east,  are  reported to hemd.3513,  para.100.   apprehensive,  though the  Committe^&amp;elieves their                    apprehensions to he exaggerated.  Nevertheless,                    those apprehensions have  not been allayed, for                    since the  publication of  the Report, the

The bodies representing industry andtrade who were consulted hy the Channel TunnelCommittee &quot;have in the main been reluctant to commit themselves to any definite view onthe effect of a Channel Tunnel&quot;.       Chambers of Commerce, with certain exceptions, are on general grounds in favourof its constriction, hut this is &quot;subject toa reservation on its possible adverse effecton trade&quot;.   Manufacturers are apprehensive that it might &apos; stimulate the import of foreigngoods to the detriment of their own           -production.   In fact, that part of theenquiry is reported as indecisive.       The shipping &quot;Companies engaged inrunning cargo boats on the cross-Channelshort sea trades are alarmed at the prospectof a Channel Tunnel&quot;.   The general attitudeof the Railway Company principally concerned is reported to be &quot;one of caution&quot;.  in short, nowhere in the Report can I find any sign of any strong demand for the &apos;runnelfrom any of the major industries or interests.       That the Tunnel would largely increasethe number of passengers crossing the Channelis generally admitted, hut doubts have been expressed as to whether this will prove an
 economic advantage to this country.  In so far as the number of British passengers going abroad for purposes of pleasure is increased, there will he an economic loss to this country.  It will require a substantial alteration in the proportion of foreign to British passengers, of which there is no evidence,: if any appreciahle benefit is to accrue..       There is no evidence that any substantial stimulus to British trade or industry would be given ty t he construction of the tunnel.   Lord Sbbisham, in his note of dissent, points out that &quot;the total trade how carried by the cross-Channel short sea routes amounts to not more than b per cent of the total trade of the country, and therefore any advantage or disadvantage must, on the basis of existing conditions at all events, be comparatively slight11.       Prom the point of view of relief tounemplojrment, the results of the enquiryare especially disappointing in comparisonto the expenditure involved.-  &apos; During thefive years required for the constructionof the pilot tunnel only 250  men would beemployed directly and 750 indirectly.   Duringthe following three years 1550 men ^ould heemplojred directly and 4,500 indirectly.  Ithas been calculated that the  total labour,direct and indirect.,  to  be employed annuallyfor the first five years, on  the English sideis onlr equivalent to that which could be
 mo. by the Minister  provided hy the  expenditure of about  250,000 f Transport, ,?. 160(30) page 6,    per annum on road  construction in this                      country.                            Further,  it seems probable that,                      from the  start of the  eight years of the                      construction period,  &quot;and,  indeed, during the emo. by the Treasury  preliminary period of negotiation and .F, 156(30) ara0 4,               preparation,  which must be considerable, there                      is  no  Company likely  to be affected but will                      restrict to the  utmost expenditure on new                      steamers, landing  facilities, and harbours                      and piers generally,  and this is confirmed                      by  a statement in  the Report that one Railway                      Company  is already understood to have deferredCmd.3513,  para,. 129.    their  decision in  regard to a proposed                      extension until  it is known whether or not  the                      Channel  Tunnel scheme is to go forward.   Thus,                      the unemployment,  direct and indirect, may  go                      some way to counterbalance the employment                      created  hy the scheme.                            The question has been raised as to                      whether  it is desirable that capital should be                      sunk in  this enterprise, at the present time,Memo, by the          having regard to the  small effect on employment,President of theBoard of Trade,        bo  the fact that the  investment would not evenCP. 158(30),para. 3.              begin  to fructify  for a decade, and to the  body                      of  opinion that  when  tho rationalisation and                      reconditioning of  British  industries (from                      which  a  speedier return can be secured) is                      serioushy undertaken, it will be found that                      the capital available is barely sufficient.                            *.V&apos;e have received many other criticisms
                       of this kind&apos;, hut enough has boor, said to                       show that no overwhelming case in favour                       of the construction of the Tunnel has &quot;been                       made out on economic grounds.                              v/e have had the Report examined in                        its economic aspects both by the Economic                       Advisory Council and by the Government                       Departments concerned.    There is general                       agreement that the evidence in the Report                       regarding the advantages of a Channel Tunnel                       to the country as a whole is not sufficient                       to justify His Majesty&apos;s Government eitherReport of Channel    .  in itself constructing the funnel or givingTufmel PolicyCommittee of the       financial assistance to enable it to beSec no m i c Advi s o ryCouncil.

AlsoDepartmental           have to be on the clear understanding that ifMemorandum                       private enterprise commenced the operation                       and failed to carrjr the venture through, they                       could, not call upon His Ma jest;-&apos;s Government                       for a subsidy or for financial support.                              This brings us to the military aspects.                       And here I would, first observe that the                       military aspect also has its economic side.                       If this ialand is to be connected with the                       Continent by a tunnel, our- advisers on defence                       matters have always insisted, and still insist,                       that it shall bo adequately protected,  and,                       as I shall show, this would cost a great                       deal of money.                              Our first aim was to ascertain the                       nature and. cost of the defences required.    The                       investigation has been very thorough,  and that                       is why I  have been unable to make this  statement
earlier.   The whole area has been reconnoitre don the spot by the General staff,  and besides the Service Departments, various scientificadvisors of the Government have been consulted.       In a short statement of this kind i cannot attempt to describe the multiplicityof the forms of attack to which the tunnel would he exposed under modern conditions, northe ingenious means proposed for itsprotection.    Perhaps I should mention, however,that the provision of an adequate defence to a Tunnel, emerging, as contemplated inthe Report, near the coast, is so costly andso unsatisfactory that the military authoritiespress strongly for an alternative sitefurther inland which, however, is understood to involve heavy additional expenditure on railway construction.  Apart from this,it is estimated that the capital cost ofthe necessary defences would not he much less than from  1 mi]lion to  2 million,according to the site selected for theTunnel and its exchange stations.    In addition there would he a heavy annual charge lorupkeep and maintenance of the garrison,including additional Air Forces.   moreover,Governments would, be pressed to keep the defences abreast of the march of militaryprogress, and. that would entail from time totime additional expenditure.
       One thing that our advisers  object  tostrongly is the acceptance of a  new and expensive military commitment at a  time  when our ,imperial defence farces have been reducedto a level which leaves no margin beyond our existing commitments.   So long as  there aregroat military establishments in Europe,the Tunnel if not adequately defended,becomes a potential danger:  if it  isproperly defended, a military commitment is incurred, in which consider able forces wouldbe locked, up and immobilised.      If I may sum up the views of&apos; our military advisers in a nutshell, I  would, quotea phrase attributed to the late Lord Balfour:&quot;So long as the ocean regains our friend,  donot lot us deliberately destroy its powerto help us&quot;.       Such, in bare outline, was the case as presented to a meeting  of the Committee ofImperial Defence on flay 29th.  As it is essen-tial in an enterprise where heavy preliminaryexpenditure would have to be incurred by thepromotors on works of an exploratory character,that, as far as is humanly possible, thedecision should be a national  one,   not  likelyto be upset by changes of  Government, Iinvited the two former Prime Ministers  tobe present, and. they were  good  enough toattend the meeting.   They were supplied notonly with the papers prepared for theCommittee of Imperial Dofence, but  also with
those of the Economic Advisory Council,  andin fact with all the material on the subject at the disposal of the Government.        The Committee of Imperial Defencewere unable to discover a single advantage froma military point of view which would follow from the construction of a Channel Tunnel..On the contrary, it would only result in anincreased, military commitment, involving incertain happily remote contingencies an element of danger, to provide against whicha heavy capital and annual expenditure wouldhave to be incurred.       Following on tho meeting of theCommittee of Imperial Defence, the whole matter was examined by the Government, which inaddition to economic and military considerationsreviewed possible diplomatic reactions;Having regard to the element of doubt as to the feasibility of construction, the weakness of theeconomic case, the great cost, the long period before which the capital expended, couldfructify, and tho small amount of employmentprovided., we have come to the conclusion thatthere is no justiiication for a reversal ofthe policy pursued by successive governments for nearly fifty years in regard to the ChannelTunnel.
