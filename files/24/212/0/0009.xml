IIS DOCtT.rg.yr IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVBRNIAEKT ) ,E, C, RET..159(30).COPY HO.3/CABINET.NAVAL CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMME,  1950.REPORT BY THE COMMITTEE ON THE FIGHTING SERVICES.       At a meeting of the Fighting Services Committeeto-day, the First Lord of the Admiralty drew attentionto the question of proceeding at once with the constructionof the three submarines which were included by theCabinet in the 1929 programme, but for which no provision was made in the 1930 Navy Estimates pending the result ofthe London Naval Conference at which the Government had proposed the abolition of submarines.   The First Lordrecalled that in introducing the Estimates, which showed the three submarines in the Programme, he explained tothe House of Commons that, should the vessels have to be built a supplementary estimate would, if necessary, beintroduced.       According to the Treaty, we are allotted a totalsubmarine tonnage of 52,700 tons on the 31st December, 1936.Of our submarine tonnage existing to-day there will remain on the 31st December,  1936, 54,009 tons of vessels.       In order therefore to maintain our submarine strength at the figure laid down,  13,691 tons of new constructionshould be spread over the years 1929-1930-1931-1932-1933(the 1929 Programme having been postponed until after theNaval Treaty),       This gives an average of approximately 3,700 tonsof submarine construction each year including the year 1929,which will permit of three boats being laid down in each year
                  The Admiralty proposals for the 1929 Programme are              2 &quot;S&quot;  type submarines of 650 tons each and. 1 &quot;G&quot; type              submarine of 1,300 tons.   These tonnage figures are              approximat e,                   The estimated cost of these vessels is as follows,             &apos;the spread of cost over the years being based on the              assumption of an early start with all the three submarines:Total costa         1950.        1951.          1932.      1955.:                                                              933,500          190,685     494,090        226,425      27,300                    The First Lord informed the Committee that the&apos;              engines as well as the hulls of the 2 &quot;S&quot; type submarines              would  be built at Chatham., and that if their construction              were not proceeded with it would be necessary to discharge              500 workers from that Dockyard at the end of June.                    The larger submarine would be put out to contract,              and its construction would considerably ease the              situation of the Admiralty vis a vis shipbuilding firms              which are suffering from lack of contracts.,                    The Fighting Services Committee agreed that there              was no reason why the construction of the three submarines              should, not now be proceeded with, the fact being              announced to the House of Commons by means of a Parlia-              mentary question and answer.                               Signed on behalf of the Committee.                                         J. RAMSAY MACDONALD.
