THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Committee  of Imperial  Defence.  May 1930.SECRET.Copy  No.COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.Extract from the DRAFT Minutes of the 248th  Meeting,  held on May 29, 1930.                      (1.)-THE  CHANNEL  TUNNEL.            (C.I.D. Papers Nos. 164-A, 171-A, 174-A, 175-A, 176-A.)     (Previous Reference :  C.I.D. Minutes of the 186th Meeting, Minute 1.)    THE  COMMITTEE  had  under   consideration   the  following  papers  inconnection with the Channel Tunnel:     Summary of  Previous  Proceedings prepared by the Secretary (C.I.D.  Paper        No. 164-A).    Report of the Channel Tunnel Committee of Economic Advisory Council (C.I.D.        Paper No. 171-A).    Memorandum by the Home Defence Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 175-A).    Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 176-A).    Note by  the  Secretary to the  Cabinet and  C.I.D. on some  Imperial Defence        aspects (C.I.D. Paper No. 174-A).    THE PRIME  MINISTER said he had caused to be circulated  the above fiveMemoranda on the subject of the Channel Tunnel, which were on the Agenda for themeeting, and he would be glad if  the Chief of  the Imperial General Staff wouldadvise the Committee regarding the military aspect, and, in particular, his views asto the desirability  of locating the Tunnel mouth at Shepherdswell  instead of atFolkestone, as proposed by the Channel Tunnel Committee.    SIR GEORGE MILNE  said that the Chiefs of Staff,  in their Report (C.I.D.Paper No. 176-A), generally agreed with the views expressed by their predecessors inJanuary 1924 to the effect that the Channel Tunnel should not be proceeded with atthe present time.   There were certain minor alterations to the previous Chiefs ofStaff Report which they desired to make, but these were not vital.    Previously it  had been recommended at the instance of the Admiralty, he under-stood, that the entrance to the Tunnel should be  near the sea  coast, so that the fire from  His Majesty&apos;s Ships  could, if  necessary, be employed for  covering  it.  TheChiefs of Staff were now, however, of the definite opinion that it was  desirable thatthe Tunnel entrance should be located inland, as this removed  the  danger of its being captured by a raiding force landed on the British coast,  and  would enableBritish  troops located in  the Dover area to meet  the attack; the site also precludedthe possibility of  bombardment from  the  sea, unless air observation were provided.There was  a  further advantage to the Shepherdswell site,  namely, a reduction inthe cost of the fixed defences as compared with the Folkestone site.   Shepherdswellbeing behind  Dover, it would  be practicable to utilise the existing Dover  defencesfor covering the Tunnel; whereas, if the  exit of the Tunnel were behind Folkestone,new seafront  defences would be  needed.  The Shepherdswell  site,  unlike theFolkestone site, met the requirements from the military point of view, in  that theyfulfilled the following conditions : Firstly, that the Tunnel mouth exchange station and all appurtenances should be close together to form one compact defensive area;secondly, that the site  should be more than five miles from the coast; thirdly, thatthe defence area should be so sited as to be capable of incorporation in, or of being      [21151-1]                                                      B
    welded on to, an existing defence  scheme;  and fourthly, that it should possess a    practicable alternative railway route from the site to London.        So far as the defence of the English end  of  the Tunnel was concerned, it    presented  another military liability which would have to.be  met.   Not only were    fortifications required, but the Air  Force would need additional aircraft, and there    would have to be an increase in the regular troops for manning the defences.  The    question of personnel was also a matter of some difficulty, as the  defence  of  the    country was now a responsibility for the Territorial Army.  It had to be remembered    that the Territorial Forces could only be called out under certain conditions, and the    sanction of Parliament would be needed; thus provision of the personnel  for  the    defence of the Tunnel would have  to await Parliamentary sanction.  The question    of despatching forces to the area might further be affected by  the acceptance of the    Model Treaty, which might preclude the movement of troops during  just that period    Avhen the risk of attack was greatest.        He could not see any  great advantage in  the Tunnel in the event of our being    engaged in a war on the  Continent.  Sir Henry  Wilson had expressed  the  opinion    that it might save 48  hours in the despatch of our expeditionary force to  France    He  (Sir George Milne) could not  see  how this statement could  be justified; it    required some 60 trains to move the personnel of a division, and the impedimenta    and additional stores needed would require a still greater number; this would  tax    the Tunnel possibly beyond its  limit,  whereas if we had a number of ports from    which to send our expeditionary force,  as  in  1914, there was little likelihood of    delay.  He very much doubted whether our forces  could have been sent to France any    quicker even in 1914 if we had then possessed a Tunnel, and since that time  the    equipment of the army had become  much more  bulky, and it might  turn out, before    long, that  some of the  equipment would be too large to pass through a tunnel at all.    What was more important, however, was the  strategical effect of  the existence of    the Tunnel; in 1914, had a Tunnelexisted, our expeditionary force would have been    placed  in the  gravest danger.   Von Kliick would without doubt have made  for the    Channel ports, and we should have been forced  to fall back on the Tunnel and would    have been divided from the French Army.  He wondered whether the French General    Staff would favour the construction of a Tunnel  under such circumstances.   Great    Britain had always relied on its sea power  to change its bases to meet  the varying    strategical conditions of war,  and he considered that this policy was one we should    follow and not bind ourselves to a line of communication such as the Tunnel might    provide.        Although France was friendly  at the present time we could not always  depend    upon a friendly Power being in control of the  Continental entrance to the Tunnel, t,  and, although it might suit our strategical requirements in one situation, it wouldjj  not necessarily do so  in  another.  In any event the  Continental  entrance to the    Tunnel would  become a railhead of considerable strategic importance and would    involve us  in further military commitments.        MR. SNOWDEN pointed out that, whereas the cost of the  fixed  defences for the    Folkestone site was estimated at  958,000 with  an annual maintenance charge of     21,000, the Shepherdswell site entailed  an  expenditure of  772,000 and an annual    maintenance charge of  17,000.   Thus the Shepherdswell site  would effect a  saving    on  account of the fixed defences of  186,000  and of  4,000 on account of  annual    maintenance.        MR. LLOYD GEORGE enquired what the additional cost for the railway would    be,  should  the Shepherdswell site be adopted.        SIR MAURICE  HANKEY replied that the length of the  Tunnel for  the    Shepherdswell site would  be the same as that for the Folkestone one.   The extra    expenditure involved, so far as railway was concerned, would be on account of  the    additional rail facilities that the Southern Railway would have to supply either  for    improving  the London-Chatham-Shepherdswell route, in order to make it capable    of  fast traffic,  or for  connecting  the main line from1 London  to Ashford with    Shepherdswell.  The  Shepherdswell site, in  fact, would achieve   a saving from    the 1 defence aspect,  but it would  involve  a1  greater  cost on  account  of  railway    modifications.        MR. SNOWDEN enquired what depth  the Tunnel would  be below the sea bed,    and whether it would  be possible to damage it by an explosive charge fired  on  the    sea bed.
     SIR MAURICE HANKEY replied that the Tunnel was some 120 to 130 feet below the sea bed, and that, although they had obtained  technical advice from the Department of Scientific Research, the Admiralty  and the War Office, no definite information could be obtained as to the effect of an explosion on the sea bed.  So far as  historical  evidence was concerned,  they had the experience obtained  by  the Oppau Explosion in Germany and the  Lakehurst Explosion in the United States. A  C.I.D.  Paper had  been  prepared on the evidence  obtained  regarding  the Oppau Explosion, where a crater some 50 feet deep  had been blown.  At Lakehurst the crater had been 88/feet deep, but in neither case was the explosive charge tamped as it would be if fired on the sea bed.  The Home Defence Committee,  in their report, had recommended that, should the  construction of the Tunnel be proceeded with, the question of its being constructed of steel instead of cast  iron should be considered,  as a  steel  tubing would be far less liable to  damage by an explosive charge than cast  iron.   The consulting  engineers preferred the use of cast iron, as it was not so liable to deterioration by rusting.     MR. SNOWDEN enquired whether it would be possible to bore down to the Tunnel and flood  it in that manner.     SIR MAURICE HANKEY  replied that this  possibility had been  raised in 1920. but the  Home  Defence Committee, at the present time, had come to  the conclusion  that it would be far too difficult an operation.  Although it would be possible to locate  the Tunnel with accuracy, as the electric current carried by the  live rails enabled its position to be located by magnetic  means, the possibility of boring- down to the Tunnel, when once it had been located, would take a long time, and the workings would be liable to attack and  destruction during the operation..     SIR CHARLES MADDEN observed that it would be necessary to build casoons of great strength  around the place where boring was proposed, if the work was to be undertaken at all.     THE PRIME  MINISTER enquired  what the opinion of the Foreign Office was upon this subject.     SIR ROBERT VANSITTART  said  that he  must speak with reserve as  he was not in possession of the views of the  Secretary of State.  Subject to this  the Foreign Office considered that the construction of a Tunnel would tend to incommode us in our relations with Continental Powers.  He believed that both Germany and France would consider the  construction of a Tunnel  as  a definite  link and bond between Great Britain and France, and this  would seriously embarrass us in  the diplomatic sphere.     MR.  SNOWDEN suggested that it would be the easiest thing in the world to destroy any invading forces advancing through the  Tunnel, and that the danger of invasion by this means  was not a very serious one.     LORD PASSFIELD observed that the position of the officer commanding would be a very unenviable one, if he desired to flood the Tunnel to prevent enemy troops from passing  through at a  time when  a train of ordinary passengers  was in  the Tunnel.   It was probable, he thought, that if military forces were being sent they would follow or take the place of  ordinary passenger  trains.     MR.  SNOWDEN  enquired whether  it  was reasonable  to  suppose that  an invading army would be sent against England as a  &quot;bolt from the blue&quot; during  aperiod of diplomatic negotiations.    SIR  MAURICE HANKEY observed  that the  Home Defence Committee hadtaken as an assumption that the situation might be as in 1914, when, according to General ludendorff&apos;s book,  six brigades of  specially mobilised troops were sent to effect a coup de main against Liege within a day or  so of mobilisation being ardered.  The Germans actually crossed the  frontier at 4 places and crossed the frontier of Luxemburg  before the outbreak  of war, and he suggested that this situation  was  one against  which the defence organisation of  the  Tunnel should provide.    LORD PASSFIELD observed that, in the case of  the Russo-Japanese war, lostilities took place 48 hours before the actual declaration of war.    LORD THOMSON enquired how many trains  would be required to take the lersonnel of two brigades of infantry.      [21151-1]                                                    B 2
     sir GEORGE MILNE replied that some 8 to 12 trains&apos;would be required.     Continuing,; he said that, to provide against attack, on oxvimmediately before theoutbreak of wary lit would, be necessary to provide regular troops, as the presence of territorial units could not be relied upon.,     ^                 -          ,&apos;  ! 1 &quot;MR. ALEXANDER  said  that the  Tunnel would, to some  extent, relieve-theAdmiralty of responsibility for giving the necessary security to troops crossing from great Britain to the Continent.  It would, however, result in a serious reduction inthe cross-Channel services, and  the silting up of certain of the ports.  As it would beimpossible to rely entirely upon the Tunnel for the transport  of troops, munitions and stores by the Tunnel,  this  deterioration of  sea facilities in the Channel mighthave serious consequences.     SIR CHARLES MADDEN handed in the following commentary on the reportof the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper  No.  176-A) :-         &quot; With  reference  to  paragraph  5,  a further  examination shows that,     although suitable steamers  might be obtained from other Services, there is bound     to be a reaction towards slower communications elsewhere.   The probability of     the  harbours at Newhaven  and Folkestone silting up is considerable, were the     Channel Services to cease.  Continuous dredging for maintenance purposes is     necessary at Newhaven and at Folkestone,  and a J million  cubic yards of  silt     are  removed every 3 or 4 years.&quot;     MR.  BALDWIN said that the question  of  the  Channel  Tunnel had been carefully investigated in 1924, when it had  been recomended that the Tunnel shouldnot be proceeded with, and he had  not changed his view as a result of the examina-tion that had been carried out on this occasion.   His opinion  had, in fact, been strengthened as to  the undesirability of proceeding with the venture.  He did notbelieve that it would become a  commercial  proposition,  and this was borne out bythe investigations that had been made into the  economics of the scheme.&apos;  It appearedto him that Britain  was  to gain nothing by the  construction of the Tunnel,  andwould have to accept additional responsibilities.  We were already carrying a heavy burden of  defence on account of our world-wide responsibilities, and he would be most reluctant that any more should be added.  With regard to the diplomatic sideof the question,  he said he was  in complete agreement with the view expressed in the extract from the &apos;&apos; Manchester  Guardian 5&apos; contained in  the paper by Sir maurice hankey (C.I.D.  Paper No.  174-A).  The  French would, without doubt,  considerthe Tunnel to be a  tie between Great Britain  and  themselves,  and this might resultin their trying to pull us into  their orbit,  both political and military.  He addedthat; if. either nation found it necessary to destroy the Tunnel, whether at  Dover orCalais, they would destroy a good  deal besides the Tunnel itself.     MR. LLOYD GEORGE said he entirely agreed with the views expressed by Mr.Baldwin.  All the  experts were against the construction of. the Tunnel, as were thevarious political parties represented at  the meeting.  We had nothing to gain by itsconstruction, and it presented considerable dangers.   The Memorandum prepared by Sir Maurice Hankey, he  considered, was unanswerable.  He had also been much impressed by the observations  of the Chief of the  Imperial General Staff, who  had made it clear that there were no military advantages to be gained by the constructionof the Tunnel, an opinion which he assumed the Admiralty concurred in.     During the 4^ years of war we had sent millions of troops and vast quantities of material across to the Continent, and  we had not  been  in any way  embarrassed because of their having to cross the Channel.   Even  in 1918, when it was necessary to hurry considerable  numbers of troops  across  to  save the  situation which  had resulted from the German offensive, we in no  way suffered delay as a result of their having  to be sent  by sea; in fact, he considered  that  they probably reached their objective  then even faster than if they could  have  been sent by  rail through the proposed Tunnel. It was impracticable to send the vast quantities  of material and men that would be needed through such a line of communication as the proposed Tunnel : as the Chief of the  Imperial  General  Staff had stated, it would take 60  trains to carry a single division, but added to this would be all the heavy material, such as tanks, heavy guns and shells, which, at any rate at some future date, might not even be able  to use the  Tunnel owing to their weight  and size.  In  1914 there were no tanks or heavy guns, and we could not compare  our  requirements to-day  for the despatch of an expeditionary-force with that -which-existed in 1914.
     There was  another consideration which he desired to stress, namely, that of the difficulty which would confront the Government if it became advisable to flood the Tunnel.  In 1914 there was a good deal of doubt as to whether we should enter the War, and a  decision was not taken until the war had actually begun.  All kinds of  difficult and  conflicting  considerations arise at such a time.  In  these circum- stances, a Government would always be reluctant to take so decisive an action as to flood the Tunnel during the period before war broke  out.  The question also  arose as to how long it would take to pump out the Tunnel when once it had been flooded. Should an enemy capture the bridge-head at the English end,  and he were able to pump out the tunnel (which might be only partially flooded),  he would  be able to send  reinforcements by a route which our Command at Sea could not  possibly interfere with.     From the economic point  of  view, he  could see no possibility of the Tunnel proving a financial  success, as sea transport was always cheaper than rail.     It was the psychological effect upon the people of the country, however,  which might well prove the most important consideration of all.   It might  be possible to persuade seven or eight experts that no danger of invasion existed,  but it was a different thing to  persuade 45,000,000 people  that invasion was impossible.   The existence of the Tunnel  might well cause a panic in this country and influence a movement towards the maintenance of military forces on a scale existing on the Continent.  It might appear to the people of this  country to be anything but satis- factory for us to have  an army of 100,000 men if we were connected by means of a Tunnel with a continental Power possessing a huge army of two or three million men, particularly if, in the  event of trouble in India or elsewhere, we had  to reduce our home forces to some thirty or forty thousand.  It also had to be recollected that those forces on the Continent were five or ten times better equipped than they were in 1914. Finally, the proposal to construct a Tunnel possessed no commercial advantages, and could in no way  assist unemployment in the country.    MR. SNOWDEN enquired whether the views of the French military authorities were known on the subject of the  Tunnel.    SIR GEORGE MILNE replied that no information was available on this  point.    THE PRIME  MINISTER said that from the Economic Advisory CounciFs report it was clear that the Tunnel would give to Great Britain no economic or financial advantages :  from a diplomatic point of view it must embarrass  us as it would tend to tie us to the policy that France desired : from the military standpoint it added to our  responsibilities without  in any way adding to our  strength : the present Report of the Chiefs of Staff showed that the military objections to the scheme were even greater than those visualised  in the 1924 Report.    From the financial standpoint the scheme  would necessitate the expenditure of considerable sums both on account of capital and for maintenance.    Having studied the economic,  financial,  diplomatic and military aspects of the problem, and having heard  the opinion of two ex-Prime  Ministers, leaders of the Opposition Parties, it would be possible for the Government to consider its decision, and he would take advantage of communicating this to the House of Commons before the  Whitsuntide Recess.                                 CONCLUSION.    THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE are  unable to find any advantage in theconstruction of a Channel Tunnel from the point of view of Imperial  Defence.  Onthe  contrary,  they consider  the  Tunnel would  present  definite disadvantages andwould  involve an increased military  commitment,  to  provide  for which a heavy capital and annual expenditure  would  have  to  be incurred *  Consequently tiheCommittee are opposed to the construction of the Channel Tunnel.TV          TV&quot;           TV          TV           TV2,  Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,        May 29, 1930.

INTRODUCTORY.    1.  IN  these notes the project  of a Channel Tunnel is examined,  not  in its technical  aspects,  but from the standpoint of  the  central problem  of ImperialDefence, involving more particularly the border-land between  policy and  defence.The subject  is discussed in the light  of past history and of modern developments inwarfare and international administrative machinery.  Reference is made also to theviews expressed on this subject by those who were consulted in previous Inquiries.    2.  The present Inquiry into the Channel Tunnel project is the fifth which hasbeen undertaken  since the beginning of the present century.  In one  importantrespect, however, it differs from previous Inquiries.   For, whereas, in those of 1906,1914,  1919  and  1924  the  civil,  and  military considerations  were  dealt  withsimultaneously-the former  somewhat perfunctorily in  the present  instance the inquiry has been opened with  an exhaustive examination by a Committee set up under  the Committee of Civil Research, and completed under  the auspices of theEconomic Advisory Council, of the economic aspects of the project, from which, upto the  present time, military and political considerations have  been excluded.    3.  The present position, therefore, is that the  Government have before them aReport containing full particulars,  so far as  these are obtainable, regarding the feasibility of constructing the Tunnel, the probable cost,  the economic advantages and  disadvantages.  It remains for them to consider once more the military andpolitical aspects of the question and to weigh these in the balance with the economic aspects, before deciding  whether or  not  to advise Parliament to sanction progress being made with the preliminary stages of  the project.    4.  One  point seems  quite  clear.   It would  not  be  fair to encourage the promoters to undertake  the  construction of a pilot tunnel or  other works  of anexploratory nature involving heavy expenditure unless it were possible  to give thema reasonable assurance that they would not at some  later time, after spending much money, be forbidden to proceed.  In other words, it is desirable that the  decision should, so far as  is humanly possible, be a national one, not likely to be upset by changes of Government.                               II. HISTORICAL.    5.  A summary of the previous history of the Channel Tunnel project and of theprevious Inquiries has been circulated separately (C.I.D. Paper No. 164-A).  Fromthis it will be seen that the foundation of the military case against the Tunnel was laid  in 1882 by Sir Garnet (afterwards Lord) Wolseley, whose opposition led to the rejection or withdrawal of successive Bills or Motions in favour  of the Tunnel on no less than eleven occasions between 1883 and 1894.[21099]B
    6.  Among the more prominent statesmen and  Service men who, when in aposition of responsibility, have  declared themselves definitely for or against theTunnel project, or else have been associated with resolutions rejecting the scheme may be mentioned the following :                   For.The Marquis of Lansdowne.Mr. Winston Churchill.Lord Sydenham.Prince  Louis  of  Battenberg  below).Sir John French (in 1902, but  his opinion after the war).(but  seechanged               Against.Lord Wolseley.Sir Henry Gampbell-Bannerman.Lord Balfour (repeatedly).Lord Oxford (repeatedly).Mr. Lloyd George (repeatedly).Lord Haldane (repeatedly).        *Sir Neville Lyttelton.Lord Fisher.Mr. McKenna.Lord Grey.Lord Morlev.Lord Crewe.Mr. Runciman.Lord Kitchener.Sir Arthur Wilson.Lord Jellicoe.Sir Frederick Sturdee.General Seely.Sir Charles Douglas.Sir Henry Wilson  (unless we  are pre-  pared to intervene on the continent on  a continental scale).Lord Haig.The Earl of Ypres  (post  war).Mr. Ramsay MacDonald.Mr. Snowden.Mr. Baldwin.Sir Austen Chamberlain.Lord Passfield.Lord  Thomson.Lord  Chelmsford.Lord Beatty.Lord Cavan.Lord Trenchard.It is worthy of mention that Lord Kitchener was  a  very  strong opponent of  theTunnel, and told the writer in 1914 that he had come to the Committee of ImperialDefence solely in order to oppose the scheme.  Also, that shortly after the present prime  Ministers announcement in 1924  of  the rejection of the proposed  Tunnel,and again a few weeks before his death,  the late  Lord Haig, in conversation withthe writer of this  Memorandum, expressed the  strongest satisfaction with  thatdecision.  In 1914 Prince Louis of Battenberg was willing to assent to the construc-tion of the Tunnel provided it could be cut by purely  naval action, but, as  pointedout at  the time and afterwards  proved by  war experience, that was a conditionimpossible of acceptance by those who wanted the  Tunnel to be available  for  thetransport of our army to the Continent, since it would render the Tunnel liable todestruction  by an  enemy&apos;s  ships,  or  aircraft.   Apart  from this conditionalacquiescence and from Lord Sydenham&apos;s unswerving support, the Earl of Ypres (atthat  time Sir John French)&apos; was the only  responsible Service expert  who  ever

Against.Lord Wolseley.Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman.Lord Balfour (repeatedly).Lord Oxford (repeatedly).Mr. Lloyd George (repeatedly).Lord Haldane (repeatedly).Sir Neville Lyttelton.Lord Fisher.Mr. McKenna.Lord Grey.Lord Morley.Lord Crewe.Mr. Runciman.Lord Kitchener.Sir Arthur Wilson.Lord Jellicoe.Sir Frederick Sturdee.General Seely.Sir Charles Douglas.Sir Henry Wilson  (unless we  are pre-  pared to intervene on the continent on  a continental scale).Lord Haig.The Earl  of Ypres (post war).Mr. Ramsay MacDonald.Mr. Snowden.Mr. Baldwin.Sir Austen Chamberlain.Lord Passfield.Lord  Thomson.Lord  Chelmsford.Lord Beatty.Lord Cavan.Lord Trenchard.It is worthy of mention that  Lord Kitchener was  a  very  strong opponent  of theTunnel, and told the writer in 1914 that he had come to the Committee of ImperialDefence solely in order to oppose the  scheme.  Also, that shortly after the present prime  Minister&apos;s announcement in 1924 of  the rejection of the proposed Tunnel,and again a few weeks before his death, the late Lord Haig, in conversation withthe writer of this  Memorandum, expressed the&apos; strongest satisfaction with  thatdecision.  In 1914 Prince Louis of Battenberg was willing to assent to the construc-tion of the Tunnel provided it could be cut by purely  naval action, but, as pointedout at  the time and afterwards  proved by  war experience, that was a conditionimpossible of acceptance by those who wanted  the  Tunnel to be available for thetransport of our army to the Continent, since it would render the Tunnel liable  todestruction  by an  enemy&apos;s  ships,  or  aircraft.   Apart  from this conditionalacquiescence and from Lord SydenhanYs unswerving support, the Earl of Ypres (atthat  time Sir John French)  was the  only  responsible Service expert  who  ever
advocated the Tunnel  at the Committee of Imperial Defence.  But the experienceof the War changed his views, and eventually he became an opponents  Sir JohnFrench&apos;s reasons for supporting  the idea in 1914 were, in a nutshell, that undermodern conditions it was necessary for our national safety to hold a bridgehead onthe other side of the Channel, which, he thought, would be facilitated by the con-struction of the Tunnel- a reason which, if published, might render the Tunnel lesspopular in France than it  is to-day.    7.  In the political world the only convinced and  consistent advocate  of theChannel Tunnel at the  Committee of Imperial Defence at  anytime during the presentcentury was Mr. Winston Churchill, whose arguments undoubtedly influenced theattitude of Sir John French and Prince Louis of Battenberg in 1914.    8.  To sum up, it  is no exaggeration to say that instructed political and serviceopinion has for the last half century been overwhelmingly opposed to the ChannelTunnel a consideration that cannot lightly be set aside.                       III. POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS.    9.  The  argument has been used  that, with a firmly established  League ofNations, with the Locarno Treaty, with the Kellogg Peace Pact signed and ratified by  nearly every  nation, with  the  ratification by  many nations  of  the  optional clause, with the  probable early conclusion of the General Act,  with the closing ofthe gap in the Covenant, with the measures now under consideration for avoidance of military movements in anticipation of war, and with  the progress made towardsthe settlement of many of the questions which have vexed Europe since the War,  aquestion like the  Channel  Tunnel can be settled apart from the war aspect or  fromstrategical considerations.  This  would seem to be too sanguine a view.  While thegreater part of the civilised world has already come to regard the League of Nations,reinforced by  the Kellogg  Pact, as the main hope of peace,  the  new system has notyet succeeded  in creating in Europe a very stable or pacific atmosphere:  The &quot; OldAdam,&quot; as has been shown elsewhere, is still a live force in  many  parts  of theContinent.  No nation  (except some of the Scandinavian  countries) has yet gone farin the direction of entrusting its security to the  new  international machinery. Inthis respect Great Britain, under successive Governments, has advanced far beyond any other great Power- for example, by naval limitation, by reducing the Army tothe bare minimum required for police purposes, by slowing  down  the completion  ofa comparatively modest air defence scheme,  and by  adopting the assumption that war is unlikely to break out within ten years of  a date  that advances from  day  today.   That lead  has  not yet been followed  by continental nations.   Years of continous effort at Geneva have not  up to now reduced continental land  or airarmaments at all. France, which is easily the most influential nation on the Continentin these matters,  not content with a huge army, recently$rganised in the interest of efficiency,  as  well as a  large air  force and a considerable navy, has registered herattitude by incurring an expenditure on frontier  defences of about  34,000,000, ofwhich no less than  11,000,000 will be spent during the  present year.    10.  What, then,  is the cause of this difference of outlook between the Britishand the Continental nations?   Why is it that Great  Britain, the Dominions, andthe United States take so pronounced a lead in the peace movement ? There is  little doubt as to the answer.  It is that the Anglo-Saxon nations,  separated from  theirpotential enemies by oceans and  seas, have not only security but a consciousness of security.  France, twice invaded within 50 years; Italy, with the memories of thelong Austrian occupation of the northern plains refreshed by the experiences of thelate war, and other continental nations in greater or less degree, have  not  the  sameconsciousness  of  security  as the overseas  nations.  It is, above  all,  the nationalhumiliation and hardship of invasion and  armed occupation that they dread,  and,lacking any physical feature such as the Channel to safeguard  their security,  theyhave less confidence than we in Pacts and seek to safeguard themselves by armaments.That  is one of the main reasons why the word &quot; security &quot; appears so  frequently  inthe utterances of continental, and  more especially  of French, statesmen.    11.  If we wish to preserve our position of detachment, and to continue to lead the world in the  maintenance of  peace, it would  be  a profound mistake to do  any-thing to diminish our  security or our consciousness of security.  That is one of the          * See letter to  &quot;The Times&quot; reprinted in C.I.D. Paper No.  164-A, Appendix  III.
 points of view from which the project of a Channel Tunnel ought to be examined. Before we incur any risks or uncertainties in that respect, the nation should assure itself that the advantages on the other side are overwhelming.      12.  No overwhelming  economic advantages  are to be found in  the report of Mr.  Peacock&apos;s Sub-Committee.  It is  a  lukewarm document and has been severely criticised, even in its economic aspects, by the Government Departments concerned. Even the feasibility of the project is uncertain.  The Report, it  is true, states that the geological  and engineering difficulties could  probably  be  overcome.  But that is not quite the view of the  three great engineering firms who were paid  a fee to report on  the project.   The professional engineers, in striking contrast to the optimism of the Sub-Committee, firmly decline to  express any definite opinion  until a pilot tunnel has been driven, though they  &quot;hesitate  to say&quot; that  the difficulties would be  insurmountable.  One of the most distinguished  and experienced tunnel engineers in the  country (Mr. H. H.  Dalrymple-Hay) has publicly described the project as  a  gamble.  The financial returns  are uncertain, and  the  plan has  been described  as  a mining risk with a  railway  dividend.   Not a single great manu- facturing or trade interest  in the country demands the Tunnel. No  Chamber of Commerce asks for it on its own account, and some oppose it.   Agriculture, which employs more than any other industry, is opposed.   Manufacturers, on whom our trade depends to  a large extent, are described in the Report as for  the most  part adverse or  indifferent.  And the sections concerned of the two  greatest transport industries,  namely, shipping and, to a  less  degree,  railways, are opposed to the Tunnel.  From the point of view of relief of unemployment, the merits of the Tunnel are inconsiderable.  The  main advantage claimed  for the project by  Mr. Peacock&apos;s Committee  is that, &quot;by creating new traffic and thus increasing trade&quot; (in  spite of the capital loss and dislocation involved in the annihilation of some of the existing cross-channel  transport  facilities),  it Would, in the  long run, be  of. economic advantage.   In this and  other respects, the evidence summarised in  the Report of the Sub-Committee  bears a surprisingly close  resemblance to the summaries in the seven  draft Reports, of  the Joint  Select Committee of 1883, which  resulted  in a majority recommendation to reject the  proposal.    &quot; 13.  Whatever may be the economic advantage in a large increase of passenger traffic between England and France, the claim that has sometimes been made  that the intermingling of races is of political advantage and creates a  better under- standing between nations is not borne out by past  or present experience.     14.  Plausible as this claim sounds at first sight, it is in  fact contrary to all human experience.   The truth  is  that  long coterminous  frontiers and   easy communications across them do not make for international amity.  To realise the truth of this statement it is only necessary to recall such instances of  long-standing international  dislike as exists between French and Germans, French and Italians, Austrians and Hungarians, and, indeed, between  nearly all the nations of  the old Austro-Hungarian Empire, Belgians and  Dutch, Southerners  and  Ulstermen  in Ireland, &amp;c.  In Palestine,* India, the Tyrol, the Balkans, or parts of Poland, where the nationalities are actually  mixed up, the hatreds reach  their maximum.   There are but few exceptions to this rule.  If, on the one hand, xenophobia thrives on proximity and ease of communications,  distance, on the other hand, &quot;in international relations,  seems to lend enchantment to the view.   Long-standing friendships  and mutual admiration have existed between France and Russia, France  and Poland, France and the United States, Spain and Austria, Great Britain and Japan,  and for long periods between Great Britain and Turkey.  Even the intimate association of vast armies co-operating as allies under a single command in the Great War  does not seem to have increased the mutual esteem or admiration of the peoples concerned.    15.  In  certain circumstances,  indeed, the Tunnel might become a cause of friction between  the  nations concerned.  Suppose,  for  example, that  relations between Great Britain and France became strained,  as has often happened withinthe recollection of most of the readers of these notes (e.g., the Siam boundary crisis of 1893, when we were within  an ace of  war, or the Fashoda crisis  of 1898, when theMediterranean Fleet was  &quot; prepared  for battle,&quot; or the South African War, or the ruhr  crisis)  and supposing  one or other nation thought  it necessary  to  take    * Compare the following- passage  in the works of Tacitus, Vol. II, Book V: &quot; He &quot; (Titus) &quot; had also aband of Arabs, formidable in themselves, and harbouring towards the Jews the bitter, animosity usually subsistingbetween neighbouring nations.&quot;
precautions regarding Channel Tunnel traffic, or even to stop the traffic altogether,or flood the Tunnel.  Would that make for good relations?   Certainly not.   Yet, ona long view, such a possibility cannot be dismissed.  For example, if a serious inter-national crisis  arose in circumstances comparable  to those  existing in the SouthAfrican war, when nearly all the regular troops were out of the country, as might happen, for example,  in India a Government  would be in a very serious dilemmabetween aggravating the political situation by taking precautions and endangeringthe national safety by failing to do so.    16.  This argument gains force when it is  recalled how easy it is to work up apanic in this country.   Whatever the degree of the actual danger from a  ChannelTunnel may be,  and, as shown later in this Memorandum, it is by no means negligible,there will always be people ready to work up a panic on the subject.  At the moment,living  in an era of universal war-weariness and of Covenants, Peace  Pacts andLeagues, we are perhaps less prone to this than  usual.  But even now we  are notexempt as is shown by the real and justifiable anxiety that was worked up a few yearsago, and which has not yet been entirely allayed, in regard  to air defence.  In thepast our people have been peculiarly susceptible to  panic,  particularly in regard toinvasion.  Monuments to prove this exist all round the coast in the form of Martellotowers,  dismantled batteries, as well as the obsolete forts  of the North Downs, theland defences of our ports, and so forth.   We have seen several such scares duringthe present century,  which have exercised a  profound  (and not in all  respectssalutary) effect on our defensive preparations, e.g., the invasion scare during theSouth African  War, Lord Roberts&apos; invasion scare of 1907-8,* Lord  Charles Beres-ford&apos;s naval scare  of 1909, and the air defence scare already referred to.   Duringthe Great War, naval, military and air forces were often diverted from their properstrategical role  owing to anxiety regarding Home Defence, aggravated by the navalraids on Yarmouth, Hartlepool, Scarborough, Lowestoft and the air raids. Before theWar,  after two exhaustive inquiries, the Committee of Imperial Defence fixed themaximum force against which the Home Defence army had to provide at 70,000 men,&quot; in order  to  insure  an  ample margin  of  safety.&quot;  The  figure was sometimesridiculed as excessive.  Yet, during the war, on naval and military advice the figure was raised to 160,000,  notwithstanding that the enemy was engaged in stupendousoperations on several  fronts.  The subject was re-examined, but remained  at that figure until the end of 1917, when it was again reduced to 70,000.  The authorities responsible for  these figures included such experienced officers as Lord French andSir William Robertson.  Also,  detailed schemes were worked out for the control ofthe civil population in case of invasion or raid throughout the eastern and southerncounties.  It is believed that nothing would be easier than to work up a scare aboutthe Channel Tunnel while it was being constructed, or after it had been built, andthat,  sooner or later,  this would happen.  Whatever the feeling  in quiet times,the Tunnel would be a source of anxiety in case of war or threat of war.    17.  If such a scare were raised, as it probably would be raised, at a time whenthe Empire was confronted with some danger necessitating the despatch of an armyabroad, to India, Afghanistan, Egypt, China, or elsewhere, the Government mightbe in a most difficult position.   For, in addition to  the immediate military commit-ment  abroad, it would have a highly inconvenient  potential commitment at home,on which public opinion might be worked up.  Some such  argument as that was thebasis  of Sir Henry  Campbell  Bannerman&apos;s  rejection  of the project  in  1907(frequently quoted at the  Committee of Imperial Defence by Mr. Asquith), whichwas couched in  the following terms :           &quot; Even supposing the military dangers involved were to be amply provided    against, there would  exist through the country a  feeling of insecurity which    might lead to a constant demand for increased expenditure, naval and military,    and a continual risk of unrest and possible alarm, which, however unfounded,    would  be most injurious in its effects, whether political or commercial.&quot;The defensive side of this political aspect of the question is referred to later.    18.  Another  political objection to the Channel Tunnel, which appeals to some people,  is that  it would tend to link our policy more closely with the continent ofEurope.  The  sovereignty over the  Low Countries and  of  the other side of theChannel has always been a matter of preoccupation to these Islands, and many of our   * -Eg., the temporary retention  for.home defence  of two  divisions of  the expeditionary force inAugust 15)14, which was a direct result of Lord Roberts&apos; agitation of 1907-8.
Continental wars have  been fought in  order  to prevent their  falling  into  thehands of an ambitious and dominating Power.   Recent tedhnical developments havin no way abated the interest we are bound to feel in these territories.  Long-rangguns of the &quot; Big Bertha &quot; type can now shoot  across the Channel, and perhaps asfar-as London, and hostile aircraft can menace London from Belgium as well as from north France.   Napoleon is credited with  the  statement that Antwerp is a pistolpointed at the heart of Britain.  The Tunnel would give the  pistol a useful barrelIn any future Franco-German struggle we should be bound by self-interest,  whatevethe merits of the issue, to make sure that Germany did not obtain possession of thContinental end of  the Tunnel.   On the other hand, Germany, when  she  hasrecovered, might have a special interest to  establish herself at that point.  In thiconnection it is noteworthy that in  September 1917 General Ludendorff, in advisina special  Crown  Council on German war aims,  wrote, inter alia, as follows :          &quot; We should only become  quite secure, i.e., as regards the  industrial  area     of the Lower Rhine, especially if  the  Channel Tunnel scheme  is executed, by     occupying  the  whole of Belgium and  establishing our  army  on the coast of     Flanders.  This object is unattainable at present.&quot;It is probable that the British people would never allow it to be attainable.   Howeverfoolish,, or provocative, or irritating, the French attitude might have been and fromthe  time  of  the French Revolution to  the Ruhr  it  has again and again beenexasperating to us Great Britain could never afford  to see a greater Germanyestablished on the shores of the Channel.  In these circumstances, the impartial rolethat is allotted  to us under the terms  of the Locarno Treaty might prove ratherembarrassing.   In this connection, it is worth recalling that twice in the Great Warthe occupation of the  continental   shores of the English  Channel  was  seriouslyapprehended, namely, in 1914 and 1918.     19.  That  the Tunnel is more popular in France than in  England is easy tounderstand. The French, with their huge conscript army and their preponderatingair  force, have nothing  to fear in  the  way of invasion from us, with our slendermilitary and air forces.  But they would gain  from the construction of the Tunnel:firstly, by the creation of a tender spot  in Great Britain adjacent to France, whichthey could threaten in order to get their way, particularly if the bulk of our naval,military and air forces was dealing with trouble in some distant part of the world;and, secondly, by the greater interest that the Tunnel would compel us to take intheir hold on the  southern shores of the  Channel. England would no longer be what.  Paul Cambon once described it  to be, &quot; le grand intangible &quot;:  and her policy might  have to be woven  more closely and more inextricably into European politicsand more particularly into the French group.*    20.  The above disadvantages of the Channel Tunnel would disappear in either of the  following circumstances :      (i) If the sincere friendliness of France could be  relied on for all time.     (ii) If it could be shown that the construction of the Tunnel would involve no           military danger whatsoever, and that the public could never be induced to           believe in it as a possible danger.    21.  As regards  the first point, the  views  expressed by  the Foreign  Office in1920, and reaffirmed in 1924 by the  late Sir  Eyre Crowe on behalf of that Office (ofwhich  the present Prime Minister was then head), were most explicit, as shown bythe  following extracts :          &quot; It must be remembered that until a  century  ago France  was England &apos;s    historic and natural enemy, and that real friendship between the inhabitants of    the two countries has always been very difficult owing to differences of language,    mentality and national character.   These differences are not likely to  decrease,    The slightest incident may arouse the resentment or jealousy of the French and     fan the latent embers of suspicion  into a flame.   Nor  can Great Britain place    any reliance  upon public opinion in France  being well balanced and reasonable.          ****-,*&apos;*         Nothing can alter the fundamental fact that we are not liked in France.    and  never will be, except for the advantages which the French people may be    able to extract from  us.    * See the remarkable summary of French opinion published in the &quot; Manchester Guardian&quot; on the 1stFebruary, 1929.  (Appendix).
                                                                                  c. o. cy                                                                                  (j e) (j                                      ?        These considerations point conclusively to the imprudence, and even danger,    of increasing at enormous cost the facilities of communication with France by    means of a tunnel under the Channel, which may  have to be destroyed at  any    moment as a military measure to secure the safety of this country in the event    of France assuming a hostile and aggressive attitude.   The destruction of the    Tunnel  at such  a moment, however necessary,  might do more permanently to    embitter relations between the two countries than its construction could ever do,    to cement them.  The Foreign Office conclusion is that our relations with France    never have been, are not, and  probably never will  be, sufficiently stable  and    friendly to justify the construction of a Channel  Tunnel, and the loss of the    security which our insular position, even in spite of the wonderful scientific  and    mechanical developments of recent years, still continues to bestow.&quot;   (C.I.D.    Paper No. 101-A.)    22.  The  truth  of  Sir Eyre Crowe&apos;s estimate of the French  character  wasdemonstrated again and again during the War, at the Peace Conference and afterthe  War, notably during the Washington Conference and in the case of the Ruhrepisode.  The want of balance and reasonableness of French public opinion, to whichhe refers, was once more  illustrated by the attitude of the Paris press in  certainphases of the London Naval Conference, 1930.   The more militant attitude of theFrench, when considered in conjunction with the more impulsive tendencies of theLatin character, are factors that ought not to  be overlooked when considering theChannel Tunnel.    23.  The second point brings us  to the defensive aspects of the question.                       IV. DEFENSIVE CONSIDERATIONS.    24.   The principal military advantage claimed for the Channel Tunnel is thatit  would provide  an additional line  of communications  if we  found  ourselvescompelled,  as  in  1914,  to send an  expeditionary  force to  the  Continent.   Thisadvantage,  however,  is one that can easily be exaggerated.   It is not as though we did not already possess a  first-rate  line of communications, so  long as  we retaincommand of  the  sea.   Nothing in  the  Great War  was more  striking  than thereliability and adaptability of our sea communications, which enabled the bases ofthe army to be changed at a moment&apos;s notice from Boulogne, Havre and Rouen toSt. Nazaire and Nantes in the first week of September 1914, and back to Boulogneand Havre  a couple of months later; which rendered  possible the use of  Zeebruggefor the  with Division; and the development later in the  War of fresh bases atCalais and  Dunkirk.  A tunnel is a  far less adaptable line of communications, andin similar circumstances to those that arose in September 1914, would have to bereplaced by an improvised system of sea transportation.  Moreover, as shown in thereport of the Home Defence Committee, the Tunnel is peculiarly difficult to protectagainst  sabotage; and,  even though  that kind of  interruption  would only betemporary,  the dislocation of our transportation time table at a critical momentmight prove very serious indeed, as  can  be judged  from the  most  cursory study ofthe events of August 1916.  Anything that contributes, in however small a degree,to the diminution of  existing facilities for sea  transportation,  whether by the disappearance of efficient ships and their personnel  or by the neglect and deterioration-tion of harbours on either side of the Channel, and more especially of their wharves,cranes,  railway communications, illumination, &amp;c, is to be deprecated.   In  thisconnection, the post-war objections to the Tunnel, already referred to, of  officers ofsuch unparalleled experience as Lord Ypres, Lord Haig and Sir Henry Wilson, aresignificant.    25.  The  other  defensive advantage claimed for the Tunnel  is that  it wouldsimplify the question of food supply  in time of war.   But where is the food to comefrom ?   France has no large surplus for exportation.   If she happened to be engagedin war at the same time as ourselves, which is not unlikely, the withdrawal of man-power from agriculture for military service would make her dependent on importsof food. As in the  Great War, we  should be supplying France, not drawing food from her.   It  is only in the case that France is not engaged in the war, either as anenemy or  an  ally, that the  possibility  of  our benefiting  from imports  from thecontinent arises.   But in such a case we should have no difficulty  in bringing such
food as we desired to import from France by sea.   From the food supply point oilview, the Channel Tunnel would not reduce our dependence on our trade routes tolany appreciable extent.                           Defensive Disadvantages.    26.  The advocates of the Channel Tunnel have sought to belittle the dangers to national defence by some such argument as the following :  In France, during theGreat War, we held some hundreds of miles of front.  Are we in future unable todefend the  outlet of a tube a few yards in diameter ?  The superficiality of this lineof argument is disposed of by a glance at the military case  against the Tunnel, which,as already mentioned, was  first formulated  in detail by Lord Wolseley in 1882(C.I.D. Paper No. 61-A).  The following is Lord Wolseley&apos;s own summary, thoughit only dimiy reflects the power of the original Memorandum :          &quot; That by the construction of a tunnel between England and France you    destroy the great defence of the country, upon which we have hitherto entirely    depended; that is, you destroy the value of the Channel.   You completely put    out of  action the use  of the fleet, which has always been hitherto our first line ofI    defence. You join us on to the continent, and we must, in my opinion, when sol    joined on to the continent, sooner or later, if we wish to remain an independent!    people, become like  the continental nations, a  military Power.  Although at    soldier, I should be very sorry indeed to see this coxvntry  bowed down beneath    the weight of the burdens which all continental nations at present suffer from    owing  to  universal  military  service,  and  also from  the  enormous expense    attendant upon those great standing armies which they keep  up.  As  regards    the direct  danger which I  dread,  it  is  this, that, were  the  Tunnel  once    constructed, you would have between England and  France a line of communica-    tion which, speaking in  a military sense, is  the most indestructible  in  the    world, for, whatever line of communication you establish between your base of    operations  and your army in the front, in any campaign or in any possible    country, that line of  communication,  when  above  ground,  is  liable to be    attacked.   It has to be  protected by large forces on its flanks, often by great    armies; but this Tunnel bored down beneath the sea  can neither be touched by    an  army nor by a navy unless  you destroy  it  before  war  actually comes upon    you, which,  I think,  would be a very unlikely event.   Looking to the nature of    our laws and our customs and our entire  unpreparedness for war, and  the    instinct which underlies all  our feelings in England  against war,  which    prompts us to believe that war is  almost an impossibility,  I do not believe that    we should ever be so prepared beforehand for an emergency as to have  the    Tunnel destroyed in  time to ward off the danger which I foresee.  That danger    is briefly this, that the  French, or whoever for the time being held the Calais    end of the Tunnel, could  by a coup de main seize our end of it,  and the very    moment they had done so Dover would become a tete du pont for their army, from    which  they could issue forth with any large army they  chose to bring through    the Tunnel.  In  other  words,  from  that  moment we  should  cease to be an    independent Power,  as  we have no.army in England,  nor could we raise an    army  that would have the slightest possible chance,  under any circumstances    whatever, short of the direct interposition of God  Almighty, of enabling us to    withstand  a French army of  the character that would  be  poured  into  the    country. As regards the seizing of the Tunnel by  a  coup de main, it is, in my    opinion, a very simple  operation,  provided it be done without  any previous    warning or intimation whatever by those who  wish to invade the country.&quot;                         The &quot;Bolt from the Blue.&quot;    27.  The point of Lord  Wolseley&apos;s Memorandum which has been most criticisedlies in the  last sentence,  where he seems to suggest that a coup de main could onlybe carried  out if  attempted as a  &quot;  Bolt from the Blue &quot; without  any previouswarning or intimation  whatever  by  the would-be invader.   Modern  experience suggests that this  is  not  by any means so great a danger as  a  sudden  raidsimultaneously with a declaration of war, or even during the period immediately preceding the outbreak: a point to which we return a  little  later in these notes.    28.  Even the &quot;Bolt from the Blue,&quot; however, has never been regarded as soremote  a contingency that it can be ignored.  The conclusion  of the Committee of
Imperial Defence, under Mr. Asquith&apos;s Chairmanship, after the exhaustive Inquiryof 1907-08,  stimulated by  Lord Roberts, into the  question of  invasion was asfollows :           The Committee consider that the  possibility of a surprise attack being    made upon this country during normal diplomatic relations is not sufficiently    remote to be  ignored.   They  agree  with Mr. Balfour  that if the  German    Government believed  that the  adoption of such a plan made the difference    between  failure and success, it is  conceivable that they  might resort to  it.&quot;    (C.I.D. Paper No.  44-A, p. 4.)That pronouncement was confirmed at the Inquiry of 1913-14.    29.   Since the War there have been one or two minor examples of the  &quot;Boltfrom the Blue,&quot; e.g., the Polish occupation of Vilna within twenty-four hours ofthe signature of a Treaty between the two countries, D&apos;Annunzio&apos;s  seizure of Fiume,and the recent coup de main by Venezuelan revolutionaries at the Dutch Island ofCuracao.  From Karl Kantsky&apos;s published collection  of German official documentswe know that during conversations in Berlin on the 6th July, 1914, Count Berchtold&apos;s&quot; chef de cabinet &quot; mooted the possibility of taking action against Serbia withoutany diplomatic preliminaries. Remote as may be the  prospect of a &quot; Bolt from the blue&quot; to  seize the  Dover end of the Channel Tunnel,  perhaps it ought not to be ignored.                          The &apos;; Bolt from the Grey.&quot;    30.   What is a far less  unlikely eventuality is what has sometimes been termedthe &quot; Bolt from the Grey,&quot; that is to say, a coup de main delivered during  a periodof strained relations, a period which in  the past century has frequently been a  longone (e.g., 1866  and 1877), and is even more likely to be so in the future in view ofthe elaborate plans of the League of Nations to interpose delay.  Moreover, it is asdifficult to provide against as the &quot; Bolt from the Blue.&quot;  Of this, history, includingmodern  history, provides many examples.  For  instance, the Japanese destroyerattack on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur on the 8th  February, 1904, and the landing of an army next day at Chemulpho, both took place forty-eight hours beforethe declaration of war.   According.to the Official History of the Great War, german troops broke into  France at four  different points and entered  the  territory ofLuxemburg on the 2nd August,  1914,  the  day before the declaration  of Avar onFrance.  The attack on Liege is particularly interesting as showing what can be doneby a Power that has its plans ready.  &quot; The coup de main at Liege,&quot; says Ludendorffin the opening words of his Memoirs, &quot; was the first of  the series of  German victories.The decision was a bold one, and  its execution extremely daring.&quot;  The  Germanmobilisation had only been ordered on the 1st August,  and was, of course, not nearlycomplete, when war was declared  on the 3rd August. Ludendorff  describes theposition as follows :          &quot; Next I had to join General von Emmick, who had been  given the task of    taking the fortress of  Liege by surprise, the troops for this purpose being    composed of some quickly mobilised mixed infantry  brigades which  had not    been brought up to full  strength. By this move it was intended to  clear  a  way    through Belgium for the army.&quot;Our  Historical  Section state that  the  attack  was by  six  secretly mobilisedbrigades, which were over strength,   As bearing on the defence of the  Tunnel, thesinister feature is  that  the brigades were secretly mobilised.  The greatest danger to the Tunnel would seem to lie in a coup de main by secretly mobilised forces, as inthe case  of the Japanese on Port Arthur before, or as in the case of Liege simultaneous with  a declaration of war, which may or may not be  unexpected.    31.   This sudden attack after a period of strained relations would,  in  the lightof modern experience, seem  to be  a  far greater and more probable danger  than the&quot; Bolt from the Blue &quot;  in time of profound  peace, and it is  almost as difficult toguard against.  At such a time a pacifically-minded Government (as ours always is)must necessarily be extremely anxious to avoid doing anything that could possibly
be interpreted as provocative or calculated to arouse suspicion. As the late Sir JulianCorbett says in the Official History of Naval Operations in the Great War :          &quot;The period of  &quot;Strained Relations&apos;  is the &apos; No Man&apos;s Land&apos; where    political action and war overlap. The tendency of all Foreign Offices is inevitably    to postpone till the  last moment a declaration that they cannot guarantee the    attainment of their object by political means.....&quot;Thus, when, on the 29th July, 1914, the prearranged Precautionary Stage of theWar Book was put in operation, it was not the  Foreign  Secretary (on whom theresponsibility was fixed by the War Book) who  raised the  question at the  Cabinet,but the First Lord of the Admiralty.  Even so, the Cabinet refused to allow several important precautions to be taken,  including use of the &quot; Special Service &quot; Sectionsof Territorial troops, for which special  arrangements had been made,  and the putting in operation of the examination service  at defended ports.  This experienceconfirms previous experience (the &quot; Agadir &quot; incident of 1911, for  example) to show how reluctant Governments are at a time of emergency to take any but  the  mostelementary  and unobtrusive  precautions.   The  general principle  on  which  our arrangements  for  the  &quot;precautionary  stage&quot;  are  based is that  they  must  beunobtrusive.   In  the case of an international  tunnel, owned by an internationalcompany, it would be difficult to  take effective  precautions unobtrusively.  It ispossible, therefore,  that  they would be postponed  until it was too  late.   In view ofthe attitude of the Government, when on the brink of war in 1914, the writer  feelsthe gravest  doubt as  to whether any British Government would take the responsi-bility during strained relations of allowing proper precautions to  be taken, such asthe calling up of the Territorial forces required  to man the coast defences and  anti-aircraft defences of the Tunnel bridgehead.                          The Government&apos;s Dilemma.    32.  This consideration  is of the first importance in examining the possibilityof a coup-de-main at such a time against the Dover end of the Tunnel. The dilemmaof the Government would be a terrible one.  If they took really adequate precautions,such as the closing of the Tunnel to traffic, their motives might be misunderstood, orused  as  a  pretext  for  misrepresentation, and  they might  even  precipitatehostilities for they would probably be  closing the only expeditious route remainingbetween the two countries.  If they did nothing at  all they might endanger the safety of the country. There would be no lack of  critics whichever course they took.    33.  The machinery of the League, however  well designed to avert war,  doesnot provide any safeguard against a coup de main by a nation that has decided thatit can risk an aggression. Rather does it serve as a cloak to a malefactor.  The mainprinciple of  the League&apos;s plans is to postpone  an outbreak of war, to gain time,during  Avhich  measures  of conciliation  and mediation can be carried  on.  In themeantime, tihe League uses every effort to prevent military movements or precautionsby any party to the dispute.  This would tell rather to the advantage of an aggressorwho had fixed his zero hour, and to  the disadvantage of  the nation which wasgenuinely anxious to act  up  to  the  spirit  of  the League&apos;s  provisions.  It is certain that  Great  Britain would be  acting in strict conformity with the Council&apos;decision.  In this connection, Lord  Wolseley&apos;s words, already quoted, when he spoke of &quot; our entire unpreparedness for war, and the instinct which  underlies all ourfeelings in England against war, which prompts us to believe that war is almost animpossibility,&quot; are extraordinarily appropriate to the state of the public mind inEngland to-day.  Can the same be said  with truth of any of the greater Continentalnations?   There is, surely, still much  to be said  for the Field-Marshal&apos;s disbelief&quot;that we should ever be so prepared beforehand  for an emergency to have the Tunneldestroyed in time to ward off the danger which I foresee.&quot;                      The Commanding Officer&apos;s Dilemma.     34.  If  the position of  the Government would be difficult, that of the OfficerCommanding at Dover would be  even  more distracting.  He would know that he must do nothing ostentatious, and  yet he would be responsible for the safety of the fortress against a coup de main delivered fhrough the Tunnel or on the harbour, oron the coast,  or from the air,  or mere  sabotage by evilly disposed persons brought
from a distance on the lines of the Sinn Fein or Chittagong raids.  In all probability,if the attack were made, several methods would be combined.  The attack throughthe Tunnel  would be sudden  and formidable.   Possibly the Officer Commandingwould  know nothing  about  it until the train emerged from the  Tunnel,  for theenemy  would probably substitute a troop train for one of the regular passenger orgoods  trains.  Even  after  the enemy&apos;s  coup de main party  had emerged, the commanding Officer might be unable or reluctant to set the machinery in motion forflooding or otherwise destroying the Tunnel, for a prudent enemy would endeavour,as his first act, to seize or derange our  apparatus for interrupting  the Tunnel, andmight take steps to ensure that a civilian train  on the down line  was  detained inthe Tunnel,  and to make the defenders  aware of that fact by wireless or otherwise.The Commandant would be put in the position of having to choose between drowningthe inmates  of the passenger train and  risking the seizure of the bridgehead by theenemy.  The situation in which the garrison might have to remain on the qui vivemight last for months, if the crisis were a prolonged one, such as has often precededan outbreak of war, and during that period vigilance might easily be relaxed.  the commandant would be a fortunate man if he did not either put the Tunnel out ofaction prematurely on a false alarm or put off action until it was too late.                             Historical Examples.    35.  It may, of course, be said that the above is far-fetched and unlikely; that,whether  by  Government  orders  or  on  the  Commandant&apos;s  initiative,  properprecautions would be taken;  that such things do not happen.  The trouble is that,even when the most elaborate  precautions have  been  prepared, such things have happened again and again up to the most recent events in history, as shown by thefollowing examples :-          At the outset  of the  Franco-Prussian War  in 1870 the most  elaborate    precautions had  been made  for destroying  the  tunnels  through the Vosges    mountains.  By  co-operation  between the  Chemin-de-Fer  de l&apos;Est  and  the    military authorities, mine chambers had been cut, explosives had been sent and    placed in  position.  Yet, when the French army had to retreat the destruction    of tunnels was neglected.  What was the cause ?   It was as follows :  Marshal    McMahon, though urged by the Chief Engineer of the 1st  Corps to destroy the    tunnels, refused to sanction the order, as he hoped to return to the  offensive.    The men on the spot refused to take the responsibility.  When the French War    Office eventually ordered action  to be taken it was too late.  A raid  was then    organised to make good the failure to destroy the tunnel,  but  it was  defeated.    (Summarised from  &quot; La Guerre de 1870-71.  Operations  dans L&apos;Est.  Revue    d&apos;Histoire.&quot; Vol. Ill, 1902, p. 994.   Vosges en 1870.)On the other  hand,  in  the same war, the Germans blew up  the Strasburg-Kehlbridge over the Rhine in a panic, and  then spent months rebuilding it.         In  1877 the Bar Boshi  bridge  over the Pruth, many miles behind  the    frontier, was  ready  for demolition,  but the Russians  secured it  before  the    declaration  of war, which gave them a tremendous initial  advantage.It should be noted that the latter was  an instance of a war preceded by a long periodof strained relations, when both sides were fully prepared.  The Russians,  it will be noticed, took action before the outbreak of war.    36.  The following notes by the Historical Section to the Committee of ImperialDefence show the difficulties in timing a demolition, even when all has been prepared and thought out beforehand :         &quot; In 1914 the French went to the other extreme &quot; (%&amp;., as  compared with    the failure to  destroy the Vosges tunnels in 1870).  &quot; A number of demolition    parties careered over the railways in special trucks and destroyed a number of    bridges, many in areas the Germans never  reached.  It was only by a lucky    chance they were  prevented from blowing up the Meaux bridges which carried    the water mains into Paris.  At Ham, Lagny, &amp;c, they blew up  road bridges    before all the  troops were over them.  The  Germans, too,  in their retirement
     over the Lys in  October  1914, blew up bridges only to set about rebuildin     them next day.  In March and April 1918 the  British Fifth Army did no     &apos; crater &apos; the causeways over the  Somme and Lys, and the canal locks were no     destroyed because the orders of higher authorities required did not arrive.  On     the other hand,  the Inland Water Transport wholly unnecessarily sank over     a hundred launches and barges  in the canals near Bethune and Arras without     cause, and not only lost the use of them, but  blocked the canals for nearly     year.&quot;     37.  Another striking example from the late War was our omission in  1914 to block and destroy the  ports of Zeebrugge and Ostend and the canals connecting themwith Bruges, with the result that they became bases for the enemy&apos;s submarines andtorpedo craft, and so formidable a menace  to our own Channel communications asto influence the major strategy of the War for the representation of the admiralty in regard to the danger to our cross-Channel communications was  one of the decisivefactors in the decision of the War Cabinet to sanction  the Flanders offensive in 1917The failure in this case was not due to any oversight on the part of the naval andmilitary  authorities  or of the  Government.   The  matter  was most anxiouslyconsidered,  and preparations were made.    The failure  to act  was  owing  to the uncertainty as to whether Sir John French &apos;s army, then moving up from the Aisneto the left flank, would  be able to advance far enough  to secure the Belgian coast, inwhich case those ports would have proved  invaluable as bases.   In  the event thedecision  not to  demolish the ports  was a  costly one, and it  well illustrates thedifficulties that arise.     38.  Yet another example occurred in the case  of the German attack  on theChemin des Dames at the end of May 1918, when, partly owing to the failure of theFrench to destroy the bridges, the German  advance reached the  record distance of20 kilometres in  one  day,  which aroused the greatest anxiety as to the safety of paris.  &quot; General Duchene&apos;s staff delayed too long the  destruction of the  bridgesacross the  Aisne,  and most of them fell  intact  into the hands  of the  invaders.&quot;(&quot; The World  Crisis,&quot;  1916-18,  Part II,  Chapter  XIX-based on Pierrefeu&apos;s account.)     39.  History provides so many examples of surprise  and of  the unexpected inwar that it would be imprudent to  dismiss as impossible a successful raid  on the bridgehead.                    Possible Failure of the Human Element.     40.  The  above examples illustrate the danger of failure on the part  of the human element, and  the difficulties involved in  taking  a decision.   If elaboratearrangements for  demolitions made  during actual  war could break down, as theyoften did during the Great War  and previous wars, how much greater would bethe risk of taking action too early or too late in the event of a prolonged diplomaticcrisis.  If the order to destroy must be given by a higher authority, it may (as in1870) be too late; if  it is  left to the man on the spot, he may lack  the necessary information, or shirk the responsibility or act prematurely.                    Possible Failure of the Material Element.     41.  Apart from the human element  there are all sorts  of possibilities of mechanical failure of  the arrangements to act; one can never be certain of them untilthe event has occurred.  Telephone exchanges may be demolished, wires or  electricleads may be cut or damaged by a shell or an air bomb, or by an ill-disposed person;or a joint may fail.   It would obviously be  part of  the enemy&apos;s plan to find, outwhere the apparatus for putting the Tunnel out of operation was situated, so as to seize or damage it, and, if  possible, to get the minor officials in charge  of it into hispay, &amp;c.                           Secrecy of Arrangements.     42.  In this connection it is interesting to mention that in 1920 the writer hadoccasion  to consult one of  the promoters of the project, in order to ascertain howfar the technical arrangements for putting the Tunnel out of action had been worked
out in detail.   He  admitted that this had  not been  done, and offered to get  theEnglish and French engineers to consult together on the subject and submit plans ! !That state of mind illustrates the difficulty of securing secrecy in an internationaljjroject of this kind, and tends to confirm Lord Wolseley&apos;s view that secrecy would never be secured.                            Government Ownership.    43.  Considerations, such as those referred to in the preceding paragraphs, ledEield-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson and the Home Ports Defence Committee in 1920,and the Chiefs of Staffs Sub-Committee in 1924, to recommend Government owner-ship if the Channel Tunnel was ever built.   This, it should be noted, is  directlycontrary to the recommendations, on economic grounds, of the Sub-Committee of theEconomic  Advisory Council.                     The Position after a &quot; Coup de Main.&quot;    44.  Whether an enemy who had seized the Dover &apos;&quot; bridge-head &quot; would have so easy a task as Lord Wolseley supposed in advancing to London and  subjugatingthe country would depend upon the military conditions prevailing in this country atthe time.   If, however, the enemy were able to select his moment and to deliver hiscoup de main at a time when the country was denuded of troops and air forces, hisprospects  of success would be  greatly  enhanced.   And,  after  all,  as  already mentioned, at times the country has been denuded of troops, e.g., in the SouthAfrican War, when only 17,000 organised regular  troops were available for homedefence.   There are sufficient problems in China, India, Afghanistan, Persia, Iraq,Transjordania,  Palestine, the  Suez Canal, Egypt and Arabia,  to make it probablethat the military  conditions that prevailed at home during the  South African war might be repeated.  Limitation of armaments is going to increase this risk by leaving a smaller  margin  of forces  available.  Even in the  absence of complications abroad,however, the situation,  if  the  Dover  bridge-head were in hostile hands, would beformidable.                             Influence on Strategy.    45.  From the previous paragraph it follows that one of the most formidablemilitary objections to the Tunnel is that its existence might hamper our strategy ina distant war.  If there were any possibility of trouble with the nation occupying the Continental shores of the Channel, anxiety for the Tunnel bridge-head mightwell make the Government hesitate to denude the country of troops, and forces thatstrategy dictated should be sent overseas on active service might be confined to apassive and unprofitable role.  Here again  international limitation of armamentswill add to the risk.  Supposing it were found by experience that the existence ofthe Tunnel,  combined with  the  development  of  the  international  situation,necessitated an increase in the size of the home forces, it might be difficult to justifythis to the League without causing international friction of an awkward kind.                Influence of a Channel Tunnel on Peace Terms.    46.  A further military objection to the Tunnel is that, if ever England wereinvaded and occupied by a Continental enemy, the existence of the Tunnel would render our emancipation from foreign control more difficult.  The peace terms wouldcertainly include the retention of a bridge-head in Kent,  from which London couldalways be threatened.          Comparison between the Channel  Tunnel and Alpine Tunnels.    47.  Advocates of the Channel Tunnel  have  urged that considerations such asthe above have not prevented the construction of the tunnels through  the Alps.As Lord Wolseley pointed out, however, the Alpine tunnels have both ends in thesame  territory (French or Swiss, as the case may be).   Moreover,  he might have
 added that the approaches on either side of all the tunnels through the main chain of the Alps pass through narrow defiles with many formidable tunnels, bridges, &amp;c, the destruction of which would put the railway out of action as effectively as that of the principal tunnel.  Besides this, the principal nations concerned cannot rely, as we are able to do, owing to our insular position, only on naval and air defence supported by a  small voluntary army, but  have compulsory service.  It was  some such  considerations that led Lord Wolseley to the  conclusion that, sooner or later, the completion of the  Tunnel must lead to the adoption by this country of compulsory military service.  There is no doubt that Lord Roberts&apos; case for compulsory service before the war would have been immensely strengthened if the Channel Tunnel had existed during the South African war.             Comparison between Invasion  and Aerial Bombardment.    48.  It is sometimes suggested that, in view of the seriousness of the air menace, the danger of invasion can be disregarded.   There is no reason to belittle the danger of the air menace.  Without any technical infringement of the laws of war, Trance (or Germany, more especially, if in occupation of Belgium and northern France,  as in the Great War),  by air attacks nominally directed against military  objectives such  as  the  Service  Departments,  factories  of war  material,  railway termini, docks, &amp;c, could inflict the most serious casualties  and material and moral damage on London.   It is one of the most serious problems which the Committee of Imperial Defence  has  had to confront since  the War, and no one pretends that it has been solved in a satisfactory manner.  But that is no reason for assuming an even greaterburden of responsibility or for under-rating the risks of invasion.  The  air forcesraiding England,  though they  could  render  life in London insecure and  almost intolerable, could not impose  a foreign system of government or martial law; exactcontributions of money and material;  levy and collect cash; restrict the  liberty  ofthe subject; prohibit  free movement;  requisition transport or labour;  billet troops;or generally  inflict the ignominious humiliations  to which a  territory  in hostileoccupation is liable.   Moreover,  in the case of an air bombardment, a good deal canbe done to restore the  moral of the population by inflicting casualties on the enemy&apos;saircraft  and by counter-bombardment in the enemy&apos;s territory.   It  must also  beremembered that,  as  an invader advanced,  he would  establish air bases in thiscountry, and  the effective radius of action of his aircraft would be steadily  increased.The terrible  devastation of territory  on which heavy fighting  has taken place  is another factor that should not be overlooked.  No worse argument in favour of theChannel Tunnel could be found than to under-rate the humiliations and the trials  of invasion.   It is  that, and that almost alone, that makes Continental  countriesanxious about their security  to a point that  British citizens, to  whom  the bitterexperiences of invasion are happily unknown, can hardly even realise.  It is mainly in order to  prevent  invasion  that  France is spending   34,000,000 on frontierdefences.                               V. CONCLUSIONS.    49.  The burdens of Imperial Defence, considered as a whole, are very heavy-They  already comprise defence of territory  all over the world against seaborneattack; defence of trade routes extending over the whole  world, including the food supplies on which we depend for our existence;  the defence  of the heart of the Empireagainst the formidable dangers  of air bombardment;  the land  and air  defence ofthe frontiers of India; provision  against unrest in  many distant lands.  We havepotential  commitments of a  serious  order under  the Treaty  of  Locarno, not to mention the Covenant of the League of Nations.   Our  slender military and airforces  are liable at any time to be called on to proceed to  distant theatres of opera-tions.  Not a year passes but the Committee of  Imperial Defence is called on to studysome danger that has become imminent and which calls for or may call for the useof armed forces.  During recent years, such emergencies have arisen or threatened,fortunately not simultaneously,  in Chanak, Persia,  Iraq, Egypt, Palestine, Chinaand India.  Hitherto, there has been one danger to which  we have not been exposed,namely, invasion of  the homelands, except by a force transported across the sea.That particular danger has been steadily reduced in importance.   Post-war develop-ments  in the political sphere, and in naval, military,  and especially air, warfare,
 added that the approaches on either side of all the tunnels through the main chain of the Alps pass through narrow defiles with-many formidable tunnels, bridges, &amp;c., the destruction of which would put the railway out of action as effectively as that of the principal tunnel.

Hitherto, there has been one danger to which we have not been exposed,namely, invasion of  the homelands, except by a force transported across the sea.That  particular danger has been steadily reduced in importance.  Post-war develop-ments in the political sphere, and in naval, military,  and especially air, warfare,
have all tended to make it less probable and more difficult.  The construction of aChannel Tunnel would bring the danger of invasion once more within the sphere ofconceivable possibilities, and this time not from an army conveyed across the sea intransports, with all the risks attendant thereon.  For the first time in our history weshould  be  faced with  the possibility of an  invasion based on  a land  line of communications which is not easy to destroy.  Dover would become  one of the greatkey fortresses of the world.    50.  Opinions have varied in the past, and will vary in the future, as to whether such an attack could succeed. Admittedly it would require surprise, audacity, andgood luck, but enterprises requiring these concomitants have sometimes succeeded inthe past.  Whatever may be said in quiet times, it is certain that in times of stress the Tunnel would become a source of anxiety.   When trouble threatened partlcu-larly if this coincided with the absence of the expeditionary army and air forces indistant seas it is by no means  improbable that a demand would arise for  a great increase in the protective forces,  or the diversion of existing forces from their properstrategical role.    51.  It is  submitted that our commitments for Imperial  Defence are  alreadysufficiently great, and that a new burden with great potentialities  ought not to beassumed without overwhelming  advantages.  Such advantages, as  shown above inparagraph 12,  are not to be found  in  the  Report of the Sub-Committee  of theEconomic  Advisory  Council.  In  every economic  aspect the project  is speculativeand  uncertain.  The political and military  advantages of the Tunnel  have  been shown  in this Memorandum to be negligible.  Apart from the improved international machinery for  keeping  the peace, which has not yet been subjected to a first-classtest, there are no new factors in favour of the Tunnel.  If a decision were made toremove the ban imposed by  successive  Governments  since  1883,  it could not bejustified by changed conditions.   In these circumstances it is submitted that, apartfrom the many uncertainties, the possible advantages are in no way commensurate with the  political,  defensive and psychological disadvantages indicated  in thesenotes.  In the words of the late  Lord Balfour :  &quot;So long as the ocean remains ourfriend, do not let us deliberately destroy its power to help us.&quot;                                           (Signed)       M.

APPENDIX.Extract from  the  &quot;Manchester Guardian Weekly&quot;  February 1, 1929.THE CHANNEL TUNNEL.                          End of Britain&apos;s Insularity.                                                             Paris,  Tuesday.    NOW that the British Government has definitely decided to re-examine and,as it appears, from a new angle the whole question of the Channel Tunnel,  presscomments here become more  frequent  and more outspoken.   It  is  curious  andinstructive to notice how differently the subject is approached on  this side of theChannel than  in England.  For example,  only  the  political  and strategicalconsequences of a Tunnel are considered, and they are considered to be enormous andrevolutionary.    Again,  the idea of a possible invasion of England by such a Tunnel  seems to occur to no one, or rather to be regarded as too fantastic for serious consideration.On the  contrary,  surprising as it may seem to British opinion, it is the permanentpossibility  created by  a Tunnel of a  British  invasion  of the  Continent thatmonopolises,  almost obsesses, attention.  It is not forgotten that during the  years1914-18 Great Britain put 6,000,000 armed men on the Continent,  and by  so doingnot only decided the destiny of Europe, but revealed herself as potentially a millitary power of grandiose proportions.    Even in the  event of a blockade of  British waters an eventuality that  is nolonger treated as  remote this British power of intervention in Europe, her ability to seek a decision  by land warfare, would remain intact.  In times of peace a Tunnelattracting only a small  proportion of British tourists might  prove a commercialfailure.  In time  of war it would be capable of transmitting scores of  thousands ofBritish troops per day towards European battlefields.    In  short, a  Channel Tunnel would constitute  the most tremendous  military&quot;bridgehead&quot; in the world, and  would constitute a strategic objective  of vitalimportance in any war.  As M. St. Brice explained yesterday,  it would inevitablyinvite  the main attack,  and as a simple logical  corollary  would require  the  maindefence.  The military possibilities of the Tunnel would  displace and distort  thewhole  of  the strategic conceptions that have hitherto  governed  the  ContinentalGeneral Staff,  and,  according to opinion here,  it  would  involve  a  more or lesscomplete change in the British strategic  attitude towards Europe;  in  other words,it would tend to make Great Britain a Continental military Power,  and to make herarmy an instrument on the  Continental model.    Is the British Committee of Imperial Defence prepared to change so vitally the traditional conception of Great Britain&apos;s world role?  Will British public  opinion,when it comes to the  test,  accept the inevitable burden ?   Such are the  questions that are being asked by the press commentators here, impressed  as they are,  above all, by the prospect of British intervention on a grand scale in Europe.     &quot; Pertinax &quot; has in the last  few days prophesied not for the  first time that,however slow and reluctant the process may be, the British will be compelled to endby becoming  a  Continental  military people.  Yesterday M.  St. Brice, of  the&quot; Journal,&quot;  foresaw in his turn that a Tunnel, owing to its strategic repercussions on Europe,  would finally  turn the  British  into a  conscript  nation.   To-dayM. Paluel-Marmont, of the &quot;Echo de Paris,&quot; makes much the same profession of faith.   England&apos;s  &quot;insularity&quot; (by which  is  meant Great Britain&apos;s power ofremaining aloof from the Continent) is, in his opinion, gone;  &quot; proud  isolation &quot; isan empty formula.  &quot; She can no longer consider herself an island.  She  is a partof the  continent  of Europe.  Henceforth nothing on  earth will be able to detachher from Europe. It is henceforth her governing interest  to keep herself as closelyand  as  intimately bound to Europe as possible.&quot;     In M. Marmonts opinion, the Channel Tunnel will bring home these realitiesto the British mind.   But  is the British mind as yet ready to face these realities?he asks.  &quot;This permanent linking up  of England and Continental  Europe,&quot; hewrites, &quot; which would be made effectively tangible by the construction of a  means ofcommunication so safe and  practical as a  Tunnel, would involve for the BritishEmpire consequences  of such a character in the military and economic  domain thatit hardly seems as if  the British  people are as yet prepared for them.&quot;
                                                                                 o. f) nCOMMITTEE   OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.THE  CHANNEL  TUNNEL.(Previous C.I.D. Paper 175-A.)                  Report  by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.     ON the authority of  the  Prime  Minister, we  deal  in  this Report  with themilitary aspects of the Channel Tunnel project, using the word &quot;military&quot;  in the widest sense of the term.     2.  We  have carefully  studied the Report  of our  predecessors,  dated the24th June, 1924 (C.I.D. Paper No. 125-A),  a copy of which is attached, as well asthe Minutes of the 186th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence held  on the1st  July, 1924, at  which that Report  was discussed.   Generally  speaking, andsubject to the detailed observations below, we agree  both with the views of our predecessors  and with the  Conclusion of the Committee of Imperial Defence that          &quot;At the present time  the  Channel  Tunnel should not be proceeded with/&apos;-which conclusion we regard as  applicable to the present situation.  Such being thecase, the present  Report  consists  largely of a commentary on the  views of our predecessors  and the  Report of the Home Defence  Committee on  the  measures required for the defence of the Tunnel and the bridgehead (C.I.D. Paper No. 175-A).Military Considerations.     3.  In 1924 the  Chiefs of Staff Committee expressed the following view, that          &quot; The principal military advantage to be  derived from the construction of     a Channel Tunnel would be a gain of not much exceeding 48 hours as compared     with  uninterrupted sea transport  in  the concentration and deployment,  as  in     1914, of an Expeditionary Force  of,   say,  six  Infantry and  one  Cavalry     Divisions on the Continent of Europe &quot; (C.I.D. Paper  No. 125-A, paragraph  2).We are disposed to think that under modern conditions this view is too optimistic.The impedimenta of the Division,  as well as of larger formations, has increasedvery considerably since 1914, and a  good deal of very heavy material has to be dealtwith by the  transport services.  In these circumstances,  we doubt if the tunnel would offer any advantage  as compared with sea transport, even from the point  ofview of time. In  other respects we see grave disadvantages in the Army  being-dependent for its main line of  communications on a  submarine tunnel.  A british army engaged on  the Continent in circumstances similar to those  which existed in August 1914 that is to say,  falling back in concert with a Continental army might find itself in a position of the greatest danger.  If it separated from its allyin order to fall back on the Tunnel it would be liable to be taken in detail and crushed      [21128]                                                         B          Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   May 1930.SECRET.                                                     Copy  No.   115176-A.(Also Paper No.  CCS. 233.)
 before it could escape.   If it fell back, as in 1914, in  conformity with  its ally, it would be separated from its base and a new line of sea  communications would have to be improvised,  instead of a mere change of base, as in 1914.  Notwithstanding that  there may have  been  some  periods in the War  when the front was fully stabilised, during which the  Tunnel would have proved  an  advantage,  we  are convinced that any  Commander-in-Chief would prefer to be dependent, as in  the past, on the adaptable and well-tested system of sea communications. Naval Considerations.     4.   Since, as pointed out above, the circumstances  of a war might quite likely be such as to separate the army from the Continental end of the Tunnel, it would be  important (as recommended  by Field-Marshal Sir Henry  Wilson  in  1919  C.I.D.  Paper No.  98-A,  page  6,  paragraph  (b))  to  provide an  alternative line of communication.   Since the Railway Companies could not  be expected to keep their ports  in serviceable condition  when  once  the Tunnel was constructed,  we recommend, that if  the Channel  Tunnel  is constructed, some authority should be designated to take over responsibility for dredging and maintaining the ports of Newhaven and Folkestone, which  otherwise would silt up and deteriorate.     5.   We think that our predecessors tended slightly to over-state the effect of the disappearance of the  cross-Channel  steamer  services when they  remarked,  in paragraph 3, that this &quot;would  deprive us of an important element in our sea power.&quot;  Nevertheless,  we hold  the view  that  the disappearance  of  these fast steamers and their crews would be very regrettable, more particularly from the point of view of any military emergency, as discussed above.  Even if suitable steamers could be obtained from  other services round these Islands  at the present time a point on which  we have not at the moment precise information the tendency to increase the size and draught of such vessels makes it doubtful whether ships capable of using the Channel ports would be available in the future. Air Considerations.     6.  We do not share the view of the Channel Tunnel Committee of the Economic Advisory Council that &quot; As regards passenger traffic the London-Paris air services are not likely  to be affected adversely by the advent  of a Channel Tunnel.&quot;  On the contrary, we agree with our predecessors that the Channel Tunnel, by  injuring civil aviation, would weaken one of the supports of our air power.     7.  We must point out that additional air forces will be required in  connection with  the  Channel Tunnel in both the cases  discussed in the Report  of  the Home Defence Committee, and that the cost of such addition must be added to the estimate of defence requirements. Security.     8.  Like our predecessors (paragraph 5), we do not wish to over-state  the risk of the Channel Tunnel from the point of view of security, but we only accept this view on the condition, which was probably intended to be implicit in their statement, that adequate  provision is made for the protection of the Tunnel bridgehead and for putting the Tunnel out of action in case of necessity.  These matters are  dealt with in the Report  of the Home Defence Committee (C.I.D. Paper No.  175-A).  Generally speaking, we  concur in  the measures proposed in the Memorandum  by  the Home Defence  Committee, but we  desire to  draw attention  to  the  fact  that in  some important particulars the scheme is  unavoidably vague, even  on so important a question as the question of flooding, and  that the  information available is not sufficiently detailed to enable a final scheme of defence to  be prepared.   The proposals cannot be regarded as more than an attempt to indicate what is essential for security. Military  science  is  constantly developing,  and even before  the Channel  Tunnel could be completed it is not unlikely that important modifications would have to be introduced into  any scheme that could  be drawn up  at the  present time.   As the Home Defence Committee point out, the whole question will have to  be  constantly reviewed.  We draw attention, however, to the estimates of cost in  paragraph  9.7 of the Home  Defence  Committee^ Report (C.I.D.  Paper No. 175-A), which only
provide for actual gun  defences. By the time provision has been made for the ancillary  services for putting the Tunnel out of action, the precautions in theTunnel itself and  in and about its entrance,  for the military obstacles to surroundthe various vulnerable points, for clearing the ground  round the Tunnel, and forthe proposed  illumination,  &amp;c., we have no doubt that the estimate of cost for the cheapest scheme will at any rate exceed  1,000,000.    9.   The scheme discussed in the  Channel Tunnel Committee&apos;s report providedthat the entrances should  be  1J miles from  the coast at Folkestone.  The  HomeDefence Committee in their report point out, however, that the proposed site  isunsound from the defence point of view, and that the cost of the defences required,should this site be  adopted, would exceed considerably the expenditure if the Tunnelentrances  were  located  at  Shepherdswell,  5  miles  inland.   Although  theShepherdswell  site would  entail considerable additional  railway expenditure,  weconsider the advantages  from the defence  aspect, including as  they do the removalof this vulnerable  point  from the danger of ship bombardment and raiding attack,as well as providing a big  reduction in the cost for defence, should be fully takeninto account, and we recommend that the Shepherdswell site for the Tunnel entrancesshould be  adopted.    10.  We desire also  to  draw the attention of the Committee of  Imperial defence to paragraph 92, in which  the Home Defence Committee discusses the personnel ofthe garrison, and points out that, in the absence of some special provision, the wholeof the coast defences and anti-aircraft defences would be manned by the TerritorialArmy.  Judging  by  the experience  of  1914, we agree  with the Home DefenceCommittee that there  is considerable doubt as to whether any Government,  at the acute stage of  a diplomatic crisis, would be willing to take the responsibility of calling out Territorial forces, a step which would almost certainly be represented as liable to jeopardise the  success of the negotiations.   Thus, the defence organisa-tion would not, in fact, come into action until after mobilisation had been ordered,and a surprise attack,  which  is the most  probable  contingency,  would not beprovided for.   If the Model Treaty were in operation, the circumstances might wellbe such that the consent of the Council of the League of  Nations  would have to beobtained before this step could be taken.  We believe that if the Channel Tunnel isconstructed the Chief  of the Imperial General Staff of that day will feel bound topress strongly  for the provision of additional regular  artillery troops to man the-inch guns commanding the Tunnel  entrance, as well as the coast defences and anti-aircraft defences.  In this connection it  must be  borne in mind that ourexpeditionary forces might be engaged in  a distant theatre. In such an eventualityregular forces would still be required  for the protection of tihe Tunnel bridgehead,and this would involve  an  increased military commitment.  We would regard  theprovision  of  at least  some regular troops for this purpose as one of the essentialconditions of security.  This will add very considerably to the annual maintenancecost mentioned in paragraph 97 of the Home Defence Committee&apos;s Memorandum.    11.  If these  views are accepted, it  would be  necessary to add  to  the HomeDefence  Committee&apos;s  estimate.. .of  annual  maintenance cost some considerable expenditure both for the maintenance of regular artillerymen and for  the additionalair forces mentioned in paragraph 7.    12.  To sum up our  views regarding the question of security, we would point outthat recent investigations have led to the conclusion that a sea-borne raid has becomeextremely improbable.   The construction of the Channel Tunnel would,  however,materially alter the situation by providing an enemy with a military objective  off first-class  importance,  and  if they had any reason to expect that our arrangementsfor destroying the Tunnel might prove defective they might be prepared to take veryconsiderable risks for the capture of the northern entrance.  To provide against thatpossibility becomes an additional military commitment  of the first importance, andthat is the aspect of the security problem to which we desire to draw special attention.Government Ownership.    13.  Our predecessors held the view that          &quot; If the Tunnel were constructed, Government ownership  would tend to    facilitate the taking of measures whether for its security or its destruction.&quot;    (C.I.D. Paper No. 125-4, faragraph 11.)       [21128]                                                        B 2
We do not differ seriously from this view, but our position is better expressed in thfollowing paragraph of the Home Defence Committee&apos;s  Report :          &quot; The Home Defence Committee agree with their predecessors that defence    interests  would be  better  served under  Government than  under  private    ownership, but they observe that this  is directly  contrary to  the  views, on    economic  grounds, of the Sub-Committee of the  Economic Advisory Council    The Committee, therefore, do not feel justified in going further than to draw the    attention  of the Committee of Imperial Defence to this aspect of the question    They regard it as essential, however, that the Government should have the power    to  take over the  English half of the  Tunnel,  either in an  emergency or    permanently, if experience should render this desirable, and it should be made    clear that no undertaking could be given to pay compensation for  damage.&apos;    (C.I.D. Paper No. 175-A, paragraph 95.)General Conclusion.    14.  In the last paragraph of  their Report  (C.I.D.  Paper No. 125-A)  ouipredecessors stated that &quot; So far as defence considerations are concerned we havebeen able to give only one important reason in favour of the  Tunnel, and the balanceof advantage and disadvantage inclines against its construction.&quot;  For the reasons give   above in paragraph  3 we  consider  that there  is  no  important militaryadvantage to be found in the construction of the Channel Tunnel.  From the pointof view of Imperial Defence the  Channel Tunnel involves a heavy military commit-ment without  any corresponding advantage.                                    (Signed)       G. F.

ENCLOSURE.I C.I.D. Paper No. 125-A.]                        THE  CHANNEL  TUNNEL.    REPORT BY THE CHIEFS OF STAFF SUB-COMMITTEE,  DATED JUNE 24, 1924.    THE Chiefs  of Staff Sub-Committee met  on Tuesday, the 24th June, 1924, toconsider themilitary aspects of the Channel Tunnel project.    2.  The principal  military advantage to be derived  from the  construction of aChannel  Tunnel would  be a gain of not  much exceeding 48 hours,  as comparedwith uninterrupted sea  transport, in the concentration and deployment as in 1914of an Expeditionary Force of, say, six Infantry and one Cavalry Divisions on  theContinent of Europe.    3.  From  a naval  point of  view  there would be the disadvantage that if  theChannel  Tunnel  were constructed  in all  probability a  large  proportion  of  the cross-Channel  steamer services would disappear.  These services include a  numberof fast small craft and a personnel  which,  as was shown in the late war,  are ofgreat value  both  to the Fleet  and  for combined operations.  The  disappearance of the cross-Channel services, therefore, would deprive us of an important element in our sea power.    4.  It also appears probable that the construction of a Channel Tunnel wouldhave an adverse effect on the development of  the cross-Channel air services, and,by injuring civil aviation, would weaken one of the supports of our air power.    5.  From  the  point of view of security we do not wish to  over-state the risk.In the past the principal danger alleged has been that an enemy who held  theContinental  end  of the  Tunnel might, by a  coup  de  main,  seize the  Britishentrance before it had been put out  of action.  He would then be in possession ofa bridgehead, with a secure military line of  communication behind  him,  for  the invasion  of  this  country.  This presupposes  a seaborne  raid  on Dover,  possiblyaccompanied  by the passage  by stratagem of an  armed force through the Tunnel,and supported by concerted operations in the air with the object of dislocating  thedefence and interrupting the arrival  of reinforcements.    6.  A military raid on this country,  though regarded as a comparatively remotecontingency, has always been taken into account in our  military preparations.  as recently  as  November  1923 the Committee  of Imperial Defence  adopted  therecommendation of the Service Staffs that         &quot; As  the  basis of  the  military scheme for  home defence,  it should be    assumed&apos; that the maximum enemy force which might be  landed is  10,000    men,  . .  .  .&quot;  (C.I.D. Paper No.  463-B).    7.  A raid, the object  of  which was to  seize the  British end of the  ChannelTunnel, would have the best prospects  of success if carried out as a &quot; bolt fromthe  blue &quot; in time of profound  peace.  We regard this as a very remote contin-gency.  The Committee  of Imperial Defence, however, have always taken the viewthat, in discussing the  problem of invasion whose true solution involves such a vital issue as national  independence it  is justifiable, and indeed  necessary, tomake a series of assumptions unfavourable to this country.  As the result of threesuccessive Inquiries, in  1905, 1908 and 1914,  the Committee has advised that  thepossibility of  a  surprise attack being made  upon this country  during  normaldiplomatic relations  is  not  sufficiently remote  to be  ignored.    (C.I.D.  PaperNo.  62-A.)    8.  In the  event  of strained relations  the risk  would be considerably less,particularly if the precautionary stage of our War Book and Defence Schemes had
been put  in  operation.   The  principal danger  would  be  that  the  enemy  might precipitate hostilities and deliver a raid simultaneously  with the outbreak of war,as in the case of the surprise attack on Liege on the night of the 3rd/4th August,1914.     9. Wide differences of  opinion have existed in the past, between  the highestnaval and military authorities, as to the degree of importance  to be  attached tothese risks, and as to the extent to which the problem  is affected by the possiblefailure at the critical moment either of the human element or of the mechanicaldevices for putting the Tunnel out of action.  On this  subject we do  not wish todogmatise,&apos; but  we  concur  with  the view  expressed  by  Sir Henry  Campbell-Bannerman, in his announcement in Parliament on the 21st March, 1907, that         &quot; Even supposing the military dangers involved were to be amply guarded     against,  there would exist throughout  the country a feeling  of insecurity     which might lead to a  constant demand for increased expenditure, naval and     military,  and a continued risk of unrest and possibly  alarm,  which, however     unfounded  would  be  most  injurious  in   its effect,   whether  political or     commercial.&quot;     It is by  no  means unlikely,  for example,  that  the existence  of a  Tunnel(particularly in the event of an international crisis) might lead to a public demandfor measures, whether  of naval,  military or  air  defence,  which would tend to concentrate an undue proportion of our limited  defensive resources  in the  region of the Tunnel, to the detriment of the general defence of the country.     10. In estimating the defensive dangers,  it is necessary to bear in mind that developments may take  place in the weapons and methods of warfare which at thepresent time  it is impossible to foresee,  but which may vitally affect the problem in the future.  We consider that this aspect of the question is well stated  in thelast  paragraph of  Lord Balfours Memorandum of February  1920 :          &quot; It may, of course, be said  that the unknown  dangers which I fear may     possibly  be  of a kind  which will  put an end to  our  position  as an  island     Power and  make the  command  of the sea useless as a  means  of defence.     It may be so, but let us wait till  it  is so; and  so  long  as the ocean remains     our friend do not  let us deliberatelv destroy its  power to help us.&quot;  (OLD.     Paper No. 96-A.)     11. We agree with the view  expressed in  1919 by the Home Ports DefenceCommittee (C.I.D. Paper No. 92-A) and  by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff(Field-Marshal Sir Henry  Wilson) (OLD. Paper No. 98-A), that, if  the Tunnelwere constructed,  Government ownership would tend  to facilitate the taking of measures whether  for its security or destruction.     12. So far as defence considerations are concerned  we have been able to give only one Important reason in favour  of  the Tunnel, and the balance of advantage and  disadvantage inclines against its construction.   It is for the Government toweigh the disadvantages of  a Tunnel from the point of view of defence as set forth above, against such civil and commercial advantages as the promoters of the scheme are able to substantiate.

Memorandum by the Home Defence Sub-Committee of the  Committee of                          Imperial Defence.                                   PART I.                                 INTRODUCTORY.     ON the 25th March the Prime Minister referred to the Home Defence Committee the following question :  &quot; What measures of defensive security ought to be provided if the Channel Tunnel were built I&quot;     2.   The  Committee  have taken as the starting-point  for  their  inquiry  the Memorandum of the Home Ports Defence Committee, dated the 17th December, 1919 (H.P.D.C. No.  40-M).  In examining this Memorandum in the  light of the Reportjof  the Channel Tunnel  Committee of the Economic Advisory Council,  it  was\ found that a number  of new factors had been introduced.  The project  of aj Channel Tunnel is now presented in a more definite form than in 1919.  Information, even though of a somewhat general character, is for the first time now available on a number of matters,  such as the  limitations as to the stratum within which theUunnel must be constructed, if it can be constructed at all;  the conjectured depth of this stratum below the sea-bed; the localities in which it is proposed that the tunnel should emerge on either side  of the Channel; the general plan and lay-out of the project; the  position  of the  exchange stations;  the supply of  electrical  power;ventilation and so  forth.  This general information (which is  summarised below)has enabled the Committee to examine the  defensive precautions  in greater detailthan was possible in 1919, and has resulted in certain alterations in the proposals ofthat date, the reasons  for which are explained in this Memorandum.  nevertheless the available  information is  not  of a sufficiently detailed  character  to enable acomplete scheme to be prepared for the protection of the tunnel, and  the  present memorandum only contains a general outline of  what is suggested.   The HomeDefence Committee reserve  their  right  to amend  their proposals to  meet  theconditions resulting from the final plans, if  and  when these are available.    3.  In addition to  the co-operation  of the Departments represented  on  theCommittee, the Home Defence Committee wish to acknowledge invaluable assistance and suggestions from the Electricity Commission,  who  were represented by one ofthe Commissioners, Mr. W. W. Lackie, C.B.E., and from Dr. F. E. Smith, C.B.,the Secretary to  the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.  In addition,this report  was communicated confidentially to  the  Ministry  of  Transport  forapproval in its technical details.    4.  The question referred to the Committee does not involve the consideration ofthe general question as to whether the construction of a tunnel is desirable or not.The Committee have accordingly confined their remarks, set forth below, to dealingwith the actual  conditions necessary to ensure the security of the tunnel, and  theextent to which, in  their opinion,  it is practicable to meet these conditions.               A General Outline of the Channel  Tunnel Project.    5.  Before setting forth the elements of the defence problem which the HomeDefence Committee  are asked to consider, it  will be convenient to give an outline ofthe  plan of a Channel Tunnel as contemplated in the Report  of the Committeeof the Economic Advisory Council, and more particularly of those  aspects which bearon the problem  of  defence.  The  particulars  contained in the  Report have beensupplemented  by inquiries addressed  to  the  Consulting  Engineers (through theSecretary to the Economic Advisory Council), to the Chief Engineer of the southern railway, who  is also Chief Engineer to the Channel Tunnel Company (through theGeneral Staff), and  to the Electricity Commission.
Memorandum by the Home Defence Sub-Committee of the Committee of                          Imperial Defence.                                     PART  I.                                   INTRODUCTORY.       ON the 25th March the Prime Minister referred to the Home Defence Committee   he following question :  &apos;&apos;  What measures of defensive security ought to be provided   if the Channel Tunnel were built? &quot;       2.   The  Committee have taken as the  starting-point  for  their  inquiry  the   Memorandum of the Home Ports Defence Committee, dated the 17th December, 1919   (H.P.D.C. No.  40-M).   In examining this Memorandum in the light of the Report   of  the Channel Tunnel  Committee of the  Economic  Advisory Council,  it  was   found  that a number  of  new factors had been introduced.   The project  of a   Channel Tunnel is now presented in a more definite form than in 1919.  Information,   even though of a somewhat general character, is for the first time now available on   [a number of matters, such as the limitations as to the stratum within which  the   tunnel must be constructed, if it can be constructed at all; the conjectured depth of   this stratum below the sea-bed; the localities in which it is proposed that the tunnel   should  emerge on either side of the Channel;  the general plan and lay-out of  the   project; the  position of the  exchange stations;  the supply of electrical  power;   ventilation and so forth.  This general information (which is summarised below)   has enabled the Committee to examine the defensive precautions in greater detail   than was possible in 1919, and has resulted in certain alterations in the proposals of   that date, the reasons for which are explained in this Memorandum.   Nevertheless  I the available  information  is  not  of  a sufficiently  detailed  character  to enable aI  complete scheme to be prepared for the protection of the tunnel, and  the  present :-  Memorandum  only contains a general outline of  what is suggested.   The Home H Defence Committee reserve  their right  to  amend  their proposals to  meet  the1  conditions resulting from the final plans, if and when these are available.      3.  In addition  to the co-operation  of  the Departments represented  on  the1  Committee, the Home Defence Committee wish to acknowledge invaluable assistancei  and suggestions from the Electricity Commission,  who  were represented by one ofI  the Commissioners, Mr. W. W. Lackie, C.B.E., and  from Dr. F. E. Smith, C.B.,1  the Secretary to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. In addition,I this report  was  communicated confidentially  to the  Ministry of Transport  forH approval, in its technical details.      4.  The question referred  to the Committee does not involve the consideration ofI the general question as to whether the construction of a tunnel is desirable or not.I The Committee have accordingly confined their remarks, set forth below,  to dealingI with the actual  conditions  necessary to ensure the security of the tunnel, and  theI extent to which,  in their opinion, it is practicable to meet these conditions.                 A General  Outline of the Channel Tunnel Project.      5.   Before setting forth the elements of  the defence problem which the Home  Defence Committee are asked to consider, it will be convenient to give an outline of  the  plan of  a Channel  Tunnel as contemplated in the Report of the  Committee  of the Economic Advisory Council, and more particularly of those aspects which bear  on  the problem of defence.  The  particulars contained in  the Report have been  supplemented  by inquiries  addressed to the  Consulting Engineers (through the  Secretary to the Economic Advisory Council), to the Chief Engineer of the Southern  Railway, who is also Chief  Engineer to the Channel Tunnel  Company (through the  General Staff), and to the Electricity Commission.
     6.   The scheme would comprise (a) two independent traffic tunnels, each withjj diameter of 18 ft. 6 in., and (6) a smaller pilot tunnel, having an internal diameter! of about 12 ft., according to the plans of the Consulting Engineers (instead of 10 ft as proposed by the Channel Tunnel Company).  The Consulting Engineers consider that  the pilot tunnel, which is to be driven in the first  instance for purposes of exploration, should become a permanent unit in the Channel Tunnel system,  and should not be enlarged to form one of  the main traffic tunnels.  According to the plan attached to the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report, it would lie midway between tihe two traffic tunnels. In addition there would be  a drainage tunnel, having an internal diameter of 7 ft., which would slope from the  centre of  the Channel to  permit of gravitation down to the coast on each side, where any water would be pumped  to the surface. Both the traffic tunnels and the pilot  tunnel would be lined.  It has been ascertained from the Consulting Engineers that the intention  is to line the tunnel with cast-iron rings, and the estimate of cost was prepared on this basis.  They consider, however, that  the use  of  either cast-iron or wrought  steel would  be practicable,  and that there would be no great difference in the cost, but that cast-iron is preferable from the point of view of deterioration from corrosion.  The point is referred to again later in this report. The geological evidence shows that  if a tunnel is to be constructed it must be driven on a line below the water-bearing strata of the upper and middle chalk, and that equally it must be on some line above the gault, which overlies the  lower green- sand and has as much, if not more, water than the upper chalk.  It follows, therefore. that tihe only formation in which  the construction of a tunnel could be attempted with  any hope of success is the  lower chalk, and the practicability of the  tunnel is stated in the Committee&apos;s Report to depend on tihe continuity under  the channel of the lower chalk, a point on which the evidence will remain incomplete until a pilot tunnel has been driven.  These considerations fix  the depth of the tunnel at a level below the bed of the sea, which,  in  some parts, does not  exceed 120-130 ft.   The Consulting  Engineers believe  that the running of the  trains themselves would probably create enough ventilation, which would be regulated  by openings into the pilot  tunnel as found necessary.  If this were insufficient,  it could be supplemented by propeller fans, the pilot tunnel being used  to convey air to the  running tunnels. The total length of the tunnel would be 36 miles, of which 24 miles would actually be under the Straits of Dover.   The remaining 12 miles would be approach tunnels on either coast.  The whole of the tunnel section linking the Southern Railway and theChemin de Fer du Nord  would be electrically operated,  and for this reason it wouldbe necessary to construct at  either end of the  tunnel exchange stations, where thelocomotives would be changed from steam to electric and vice versa, at any rate until such time as the railways on either side of the tunnel are electrified.    7.  The Report of the Committee of  the Economic Advisory  Council is somewhat meagre in regard to the operational aspect of the Channel Tunnel Scheme. and the General Staff have consequently sought further information from the ChiefEngineer of the Southern Railway.  From this source it has been  ascertained thatthe exchange station is required to afford, inter alia, facilities as under :-            (i) Locomotive transfer and housing; steam to electricity,  and vice versa.           (ii) Marshalling of goods trains.         (iii) Transhipment of merchandise, where broken loads  have to be dealt                 with.          (iv) Customs Examination.           (v) Passport  and  Aliens Permit Examination.          (vi) Bonded storage.         (vii) Motor transport loading facilities.         (viii) Hotel accommodation.    8.  For  these  purposes  it is  understood  from  the Chief Engineer,  southern railway, that an area approximately  one mile by two miles would be required.  It is further understood that, from tihe railway point  of view, the  nearer the exchange station to the tunnel mouth the better, but this  is largely for convenience and not of paramount importance.  Convenience is further  achieved by  siting the exchange station near a large town where hotel accommodation and good  road communicationsexist.  In the Report of the Committee of the Economic Advisory Council it is stated that the British exchange station would be at Sandling Junction.  It has been ascertained, however, from the  Chief Engineer of the Southern Railway  that  the site contemplated is actually  4^  miles to the eastward of Sandling Junction, in the Brickworks-Golf  Club  area.
     9.   Unless special arrangements are made, the electrical power for the English half of the  Tunnel  is  likely to be  provided from  the English  side, and  for the French  half  from  France.   As  regards the  English  half,  it  is  stated in  the  Channel  Tunnel  Committee&apos;s Report that  the  Consulting  Engineers have  assumed that  the  current  for  operating   the   Channel  Tunnel  would be  derived  from  the  national  scheme  under  the  Central  Electricity  Board (the  &quot;Grid&quot;).   The  Committee  are  informed  by  a representative  of  the Electricity Commission that the stations  at  Barking  and Brighton would  feed the &quot; grid  &quot; from which the tunnel would be supplied, and that this current would be&apos;132,000 volts. There is a suggestion that another power-station might be erected at Richborough, and if this station were built it would provide a third source of supply.  The  total  current required  for  the  Tunnel might be  in  the  nature of\ 10,000 kilowatts, and to provide this energy at the necessary  voltage (1,500-3,000 volts) the current from the grid would be stepped down from 132,000 volts to 33,000 volts at Folkestone and Dover; the current would then be reduced by static transformers and rotary generators in the immediate vicinity of the  Tunnel itself.  The spacesI required for these transformers and generators would not exceed an area  of 60  feet! by 36 feet  for each.  It is desirable that the transformers  and  generators should be situated at a point just before the Tunnel passes under the sea  at both ends, as  this would reduce the distance of supply of current in the Tunnel. The supply  of current would be conveyed to the Tunnel  from the main generating stations at Barking  and Brighton through  high-tension cables supported by pylons  above the ground.                                  PART  II.                           THE DEFENSIVE PROBLEM.    10.  During the various discussions which have taken place in the past on the advisability or otherwise of constructing a Channel  Tunnel,  one  of  the  points onwhich  there has been general  agreement is that approval to carry out any scheme should be dependent upon its being possible to devise some easy means  of blocking ordestroying a tunnel in time of emergency, and on its  being practicable to make themeans  so devised reasonably secure at any time against damage or destruction by a potential enemy.    11.  It has been argued with great weight by various eminent naval and militaryauthorities that,  without some such  easy means  of  blocking or destroying a tunnelin time of emergency, it is conceivable that, in certain  circumstances, the British endmight be seized, and that with a hostile Power in possession of the other end also itcould be used as a means for invading the United Kingdom.    12.  The  experiences of the war do not afford any grounds for modifying theviews previously held, and  in  this connection it is necessary to remember that fromtime to time the political relations of countries inevitably change, and that, althoughunder existing conditions the  exit of the Tunnel on the Continental  side would be-in the hands of a Power with whom England is on terms of friendship, there can beno guarantee that it will at all times in the future be in friendly hands.  On theother hand, the Tunnel, once constructed, will be  always there until destroyed; and,even though great changes may take place in the future in the international  situation,it is almost inconceivable that the destruction of a tunnel costing more than 30 millionpounds to build would be contemplated except in the last emergency, and when warwith the Power in possession of the  other end is imminent, or has even broken out.It is essential,  therefore,  that means  should exist  for  putting the  Tunnel bothtemporarily and permanently out of  service at a moment&apos;s notice.    13.  Further, the experiences of the  Great War  showed of what value theexistence of a  tunnel would have been for transporting troops and stores to france at certain stages of the war, provided that it had not been destroyed in view of thesituation existing in the early  autumn  of  1914, and these experiences emphasiseindirectly the  importance in certain  circumstances of  being able to protect a tunnelagainst any attempt by an enemy to destroy it.    14.  It is important to bear in  mind that once a tunnel  is constructed it willbecome a leading factor in military plans for war, that in the event of our everagain having  to send the Expeditionary Force to Belgium or Northern France the
 assured maintenance of the Tunnel would in most circumstances relieve the Navy of a certain amount of convoy and-transport work, and that consequently the arrange- ments for its efficient protection against  attempts to destroy it might be no  less important than the arrangements for denying its use to a hostile Power.  In a word, the Tunnel requires to be destructible when we wish to prevent an enemy from using it, and indestructible when we wish to use  it ourselves.     15.   In existing conditions, therefore, it appears that, from  a military point of view, the main conditions which must be satisfied, if the construction of a Channel Tunnel is approved, are :      (a) The English end of the tunnel  must be so defended as to make  it secure           against capture by any form  of raiding attack, which it is thought           possible may be employed with a view to seizing it.     (b) Some of the means provided for putting  the tunnel out  of service must be           such as to make its repair either altogether impracticable, or, at  any rate,           impracticable within such a period as it is thought possible that an enemy           force might be able to keep possession of the English end.     (c) Means for putting the tunnel out of service must at all times be capable of           being used at a  moment&apos;s notice, and so guarded and protected that there           is no reasonable probability of  their being put out of working  order by           enemy gun-fire,  bombing, raiding parties or sabotage.     (d) The tunnel itself, its approaches and any machinery vital to its use, must at           all times be  so protected and guarded  that  there is no reasonable           probability of their being  put  out of  use  by enemy  gun-fire, bombing,           raiding parties  or sabotage.     16.  It remains now to consider firstly, to what extent these conditions can becomplied with, and  secondly, whether such measures as are considered practicablewill  be adequate to meet the forms of attack considered possible.  The Committeepurposely refer  to the  forms of attack  considered possible.  As pointed out  byMr.  Balfour in 1905, it is justifiable, and  indeed necessary, in discussing the problemof invasion, whose true solution involves such a vital issue as national independence,to make a series of assumptions unfavourable to this country.  &quot; National  indepen-dence,&quot; he wrote, &quot; must not be staked even in appearance on too nice a calculation of chances.  We cannot  sleep secure with only a bare  margin of probability  in  our favour.&quot;   That principle has been reaffirmed more than once by the Committee ofImperial Defence, and  was set forth in the Report  of the Home Ports  DefenceCommittee in  1919.  It must be  considered as peculiarly applicable to the defenceof the Channel Tunnel.                           Possible Forms of Attack.     17.  In accordance with the principles set forth above,  two strategic cases  are considered in this Memorandum, and it is important that the difference between them should be borne in mind.  For convenience,  the two cases have been called Case &quot; A &quot;and  Case  &quot; B,&quot; and this nomenclature will constantly be used for  reference in  the paragraphs which follow.     Case &quot; A.&quot; An enemy in possession  of the Continental end of the Tunnel wishes                    to use it himself.     Case  &quot; B.&quot; The British Expeditionary Force, involved on the Continent, is                    using, or about to use, the Tunnel as a line of communication.                    The enemy  wishes  to deny  the  Tunnel to the Expeditionary                    Force.Case &quot;A.&quot;     18.  As already indicated, the enemy&apos;s object would be the  invasion of  south-eastern England.   His method would be  to seize the  English mouth and form abridge-head, which he would seek to extend by means of passing troops through  thetunnel.  Surprise, coupled with audacity, stratagem and cunning,  would be  thekeynote of this enterprise, but it is most unlikely that such  surprise  could be effected by any other means than as a first act of war, or an act preceding  a declaration ofwar.   In  numerous investigations into  the question of  invasion and raids,  theCommittee of Imperial Defence has never excluded the possibility of an attack beingmade on the outbreak of war or even before a declaration of war.   On the contrary,
 the possibility of surprise attack has been laid down as a proper assumption for purposes of calculation.  Events which occurred at the outset of the Great War, such as  the crossing of the French  frontier by German troops on the 2nd August, 1914, the day before the declaration of war on France, their entry into Luxemburg territory on the same date,  and more especially the coup-de-main delivered against Liege by six secretly mobilised brigades, which (according to information derived from the Historical Section)  were over  strength, and crossed the Belgian frontier simultaneously with the  declaration of war, confirm the  experience of  previous campaigns that wars are often opened by a surprise attack.  The element of surprise, as can be shown by historical instances,  is not necessarily weakened by a prolonged period of strained relations, particularly if accompanied by a popular belief that war is  impossible.   Even  though  defences may be in  order and vigilance kept, watchers may not watch with that vigilance which is bred of war.  For these reasons the Home Defence Committee feel  bound to assume a surprise attack at the first moment  of a  war as the  most probable  and the most dangerous  contingency to be provided against in Case &quot; A.&quot;    19.   The hostile force to seize the mouth, and simultaneously to put out of action our arrangements  for denying the use of the Tunnel to an enemy, could be provided by any one, or a combination, of the following :          (a) Parties landed from ships.         (b) A troop train substituted for a normal  train.         (c) Sabotage directed against our  own safeguards.         (d) Parties landed from aeroplanes.    20.   The seizure of the mouth would probably  be accomjoanied by an intensive bombardment  either by air  or sea,*  or both, of the defences and of barracks, head- quarters (e.g., Shorncliffe and Dover), aerodromes, men-of-war in the harbour, tele- phone exchanges, &amp;c, with a view to disorganising the defences.  The tunnel mouth and the railway works would almost certainly not be bombarded, as the enemy would desire to maintain them intact for his own use.    21.   It will thus be seen that the foci of such an operation would be, first, the mouth, and, secondly, our own mechanism for blocking the Tunnel.    22.   The  exchange station, though  highly desirable  from the enemy&apos;s point of view in order to obtain turn-round of his trains,  would not necessarily be included in his first objective. He might make it his second.  The first objective is likely to be the close defences of the mouth,  and  the defences of the points from which our mechanism for blocking the  Tunnel is operated    23.   It is estimated that as much as a  brigade might debouch from the Tunnel by means of piling up trains, head to tail, just within its mouth.  It is to be expected that this operation would be accompanied by the landing of troops at points on the coast. Case &quot; B.&quot;    24.  Here the enemy&apos;s  object would be to make it impossible for us to use the Tunnel.   An operation of this kind might take place at any period of a war and it might depend for  its success either on the strength and persistence of the attack or on surprise.  A number of methods of attack would  be open to the enemy,  includine&apos; the following :      (a)  Bombardment of the exchange station from the air and/or from the sea, but,           unless and until  the range of guns  is materially increased, not from the           Continental shores of the Straits.   (See footnote beloiv.)    (b)  Capture by a raiding force of the whole working or of a sufficient  part of it           to enable the Tunnel or its workings to be put out of action.    (c)  Sabotage against  the Tunnel or some part of the workings which would put           it permanently or temporarily out of action (e.g., the flooding apparatus,           power station,  transformers and generators, electric cables, voltage control           apparatus see Part IV the rails, points, switchlines, &amp;c).    (d)  Destruction of the Tunnel itself by explosive charges placed on the bed of           the Channel.   * Bombardment from the Continental shores of  the Straits of Dover is unlikely in the present state ofdevelopment of artillery.  The tunnel works would be within range of guns of the &quot; Big Bertha &quot;type, but these would probably not be in position at the outset of a war.
    25.  This latter  form of attack appears improbable,  but the Home DefenceCommittee felt bound to explore it.  The Committee consider that the possibilitymentioned in the Report of 1919 of an enemy boring into the bed of the Channel inorder to attack the Tunnel may  be dismissed&quot; as impracticable.   A more conceivablemethod of attack  would be by  explosives laid on the bed of  the Channel.  this operation would be attended.by great difficulties and uncertainties, firstly in placinga concentrated charge in the right spot, and secondly in  calculating the amount ofthe charge.  As regards the first point, the presence within the Tunnel itself of thecharged electric cable necessary for the supply of power to the locomotives wouldmake it an easy matter to locate the precise position of the Tunnel, and from thispoint of view the difficulties are not  considered insuperable.  The calculation of thecharge is a matter of  greater difficulty owing to the entire absence of data in regardto the effect on  the strata below the sea-bed of a large  charge of high  explosive.Against a lined tunnel 120-130 feet  below the sea-bed the effect of a small charge ofa few tons would probably  be negligible.  But no data  whatsoever are obtainablefor calculating the effects of the detonation  of a charge  of some hundreds or eventhousands of tons of high explosive in such circumstances.  A crater 50ft. deep wasproduced  by an explosion in September, 1921, at Oppau,  in  Germany,  regardingwhich a special report was prepared for the Committee of Imperial Defence (C.I.D.Paper No. 480-B), and the explosion of 1,000,000 lbs. (less than 450 tons) of T.N.T.in the Lake Denmark Naval Ammunition Depot disaster of the  10th July, 1926, left a crater 45 ft. deep and 150 ft. long.  The circumstances of these explosions on the surface of the ground are so obscure and so different from those of a sub-aqueousexplosion that they do not provide any scientific data on Avhich a calculation couldbe based,  though they suggest  that  a submarine explosion of  several  thousands oftons of high explosive might well have a serious effect on  the Tunnel.  But whetherthe effect would be to flood the Tunnel or merely to block it with  chalk, which could be cleared, it is impossible to foretell.   A Tunnel lined with steel  would offer a greaterresistance to this form of attack than one lined with cast  iron, as at present con-templated.  Like most  of the methods of attack on the Tunnel, it  would be easiestto carry out at the zero hour fixed by an aggressor.  On the whole, the Home DefenceCommittee consider this form of attack to be very improbable, but not excluded fromthe range of possibilities.    26.  In addition to the  forms of attack on the tunnel workings mentioned above as applicable to Case  &quot; B,&quot; the following attacks on objectives outside of the zone oflocal defence have to be considered :     The power-stations at Barking, Brighton, and at Richborough (if constructed).    The high tension cables carried  across country on pylons.    The lines of railway leading to the tunnel.In all these cases attacks might be made either by aerial bombardment or by sabotage.    27.  Finally,  it must be borne  in mind,  in connection with Case &quot; B,&quot; that thetunnel, its workings  and  approaches, would be liable to attack at the Continentalend, though that problem is, of course, outside of our terms of reference.                        The Scale  of  a Raiding Attack.    28.   In the preceding statement of the various forms of attack mention has beenmade of the possibility of a force being  landed on the coast in connection with boththe cases considered.   The subject of raids on the United Kingdom has repeatedlybeen  examined by the Committee of Imperial Defence before,  during  and since theGreat War, and has  lately  formed the basis  of  an intensive re-examination by the staffs of the three Fighting Services,  wdth the assistance of the Imperial DefenceCollege, and under the general supervision  of the Chiefs of  Staff Sub-Committee.The general conclusion has been reached that a sea-borne  raid, of any dimensionswhatsoever, is extremely improbable in existing circumstances.  But that conclusion is qualified as follows :-          &quot; The building of  a Channel Tunnel would, however, materially alter the     situation, in that it would provide the French with a military  objective of first-     class importance.  If they  had  any reason to expect that our arrangements for     destroying the Tunnel might prove defective, they would  probably be prepared     to take very considerable risks for the capture of the northern entrance.  These
    risks might well include landings at points between Hythe and South Foreland,    in conjunction with  a surprise attack through  the Tunnel itself, and with    intensive air attacks directed  against  the local garrisons, with the object of    securing a permanent bridgehead.&quot;    29.   The maximum force that  could leave French shores in a war with Franceonly, having regard to considerations of available transport, has been calculated asthree  Divisions,  but the  maximum force  whose  transports  could be protected dequately on passage  is  estimated at one Division, and the  prospect that one division could evade detection while en route  is regarded as remote.    In the circumstances, it would appear that, so far as concerns Case &quot; A,&quot; at anyrate, the maximum force that could raid the Tunnel bridgehead would not exceed a division, and would probably be less.  The scale of attack on the Tunnel, however, isone that would have to be kept constantly under review.                Outline of the Defensive Measures recommended.    30.   Before setting  out their  recommendations as to the defensive measures required to meet the forms of attack enumerated above, the Home Defence Committeedesire to mention a matter of the first importance.    31.   As a result of a reconnaissance by the General Staff  of  the Folkestone-Dover area, which extended many miles inland, it transpires that the most effectivedefence against all forms of attack, with the single  exception of sabotage by agents in this country,  is a proper siting from the military point of view of the Tunnelmouth and all its operational appurtenances.  This applies to cases  &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot;equally.    32.   Financial considerations governing the  length of tunnel naturally  precludean absolutely safe siting, but much can be  done by a judicious use of ground.  Indefault of an absolutely safe siting, defences will always be required.   Certain ofthese  are  common to both  Cases &quot;  A &quot; and &quot; B.&quot;  For  instance, medium  seafrontarmament will be required to reply  to  bombarding cruisers  and  to  fire  againsttransports.  Similarly, anti-aircraft defences will be  required in both  Cases.  Thescale of these defences will depend upon the  siting of the Tunnel lay-out.    33.   The reconnaissance  referred  to above  indicates that the site at  present contemplated for the exchange station is unsatisfactory from a military  point ofview, and that, so far as the Committee are in a position to judge, an alternative siteis available, which can be  defended both more effectively and at a far smaller cost.The  reasons for this will become clearer when the  general outline  of  the proposeddefences has been explained, and to this aspect, therefore,  attention is first directed.                     General Review of M\eans of Protection.    34.   The following is  a list of the means of protection recommended as applic-cible to both Case &quot; A &quot; and Case &quot; B &quot; :-    (a)  Anti-aircraft defences to protect             (i) the  whole  railway lay-out  (tunnel  mouth to  exchange  station                 inclusive);           (ii) the local defences of these  places;  and          (iii) the barracks housing the defensive  mobile force, headquarters, &amp;c.    (b) Medium  anti-ship defences (9-2-inch-gun* armament) to protect the whole          lay-out  from bombardment  from  the  sea, and  as  a  defence  against          landings;    (c) Close defence of landing beaches within reach (say, 5 miles) of the mouth          and exchange station (6-inch armament and machine guns);    (d)  Scrutiny of  traffic,  the proposed  measures   for  which are  described in          Part V; and    (e) Local defence of the whole lay-out  by a  mobile force.   * NOTE. In referring to a 9-2-inch-gun armament,  the Committee in no way desire  to prejudge theissue regarding medium anti-ship defence for  defended ports which is at present, under examination by the staffs of the War Office and Air Ministry.      [21058]                &apos;                                          c
    35.  Two brigades of infantry (less one battalion), a brigade of Field artillery and a Regiment of Cavalry are normally maintained at Shorncliffe and Dover.  TheGeneral Staff consider  that no additional mobile force  would be required.   these troops form part of the Expeditionary Force, but, under  existing mobilisationarrangements, would not leave the country until some weeks after an outbreak ofwar, by which time Territorial forces should be available to take their place.    36.  In 1919 the Home Ports Defence Committee  contemplated, in addition,an  extended naval  defence.  The Admiralty, however,  are averse on principle tolocking up  naval forces for local defence.  Their  main apprehension,  indeed, isthat the existence  of the Tunnel  is  liable,  in the event  of war with a  Powercontrolling Northern France, to result in the deflection of naval force from its properstrategical  purpose, just as  the German activitj^ culminating in the Lowestoft raidin 1916 in the Great War led to the deflection of the Third Battle  Squadron to the thames as  the result of popular clamour.                        Safeguards peculiar  to Case &quot;A.&quot;     37.   Certain measures of protection are peculiar  to  Case &quot;A&quot;; they  are as follows :      (a) Fixed defences around the Tunnel mouth.   Fixed gun positions (6-inch) to           fire  direct on  the Tunnel  mouth  and machine-gun  &quot;pill  boxes&quot;;           obstacles.     (b) Clearance area of 1,000 yards&apos; radius round mouth.     (c) Means for stopping traffic instantly.     (d) Means for prolonging this stoppage for a period of days.     (e) Means for prolonging this stoppage for a period of weeks or months.     (/) Permanent flooding. * The mechanical and other arrangements for blocking the Tunnel under sub-heads (c), (d),  (e) and (/) are discussed in greater detail in Part IV of this Memorandum.                       Safeguards peculiar to Case &quot;B.&quot;     38.   Certain means of protection are peculiar to Case &quot; B,&quot; that is to say, for the  protection of the  Tunnel when we desire to  use it ourselves;  they  are  as follows :      (a) Special safeguarding of our own mechanism for putting the Tunnel  out of           action (e.g.,  removal  of essential parts, burying the operating  points           beneath mounds of earth, &amp;c).     (&amp;) Suitable  safeguards, whether by siting or protection, to transformer stations           supplying current  to the Tunnel.     (c) The possession of  a practicable alternative  railway route between London           and the exchange station.     (d) Patrolling of Tunnel  alignment in  the  Channel by vessels and aircraft.     39.   From the point of view of resistance to the shock of explosion of a largecharge on the bed of the sea it would be preferable that the Tunnel should be linedwith steel rather  than cast iron, which is particularly susceptible to a sudden  shock. This form of attack, however, is, as already stated,  improbable at the present time,and  the  Home Defence Committee hesitate  to insist on  the point,  if  technical difficulties or considerable expense are involved.  Nevertheless, having regard  to thepossibility that this form of attack might become more serious in the future, they recommend that,  if and when the specifications of the Tunnel project are worked outin detail,  the Engineers should be asked to  consider the point.                   Protection outside the Local Defence Area.     40.   The  protection against  air attack of pylons,  high-tension cables and power-stations  outside the local  defence area comprising  the Tunnel   workingswould  be  part of the  general air defence arrangements of  the  country or of theLondon Anti-aircraft  Defences, as  the case may be.   As regards both the  high-tension cables  and  the railways  leading  to  Dover,  provision  should   be  made
or rapid repairs in the event of interruption.  The Committee recommend thathe Ministrjr of Transport should be asked to assume responsibility for ensuring thathe necessary  arrangements are  made.   Tor defence of these objectives againstabotage, see Part V, paragraph  79.   41.   It has been stated above that certain measures of protection are common tooth Case &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B,&quot; whilst others are peculiar to each.   As far as the Tunnelroject is concerned, either Case may occur.   In order to be secure in war, therefore,t appears necessary to plan and provide for all the measures of protection cited inaragraphs  34 to ,38, keeping always in view the great asset of a, proper sitingrom the military point of view.  To this aspect attention will now  be directed.                                 PART  III.         THE LAY-OUT  OF THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE AND ITS  APPROACHES.    42.   In  1919 the Home Ports Defence  Committee favoured a dispersion of theimportant yards and junctions and  recommended that  &quot; there must be two or  moresmall yards rather than one large one, viz., one  for up-traffic,  one for down-traffic,and one for  locomotives.&quot;   While recognising that a single exchange station wouldprovide an easy target for naval or air bombardment, the Home Defence Committeetake the view that, on the whole, it is better to concentrate the defences on a singlearea.  Moreover, the  area (1 mile  by 2)  is  so large that it should be possible to isperse in it the more vulnerable objectives. In  these circumstances, the Committeedo not  feel justified in recommending the adoption of methods of dispersion whichmight tend permanently to inconvenience the economical working of the line.    43.   When describing the general outline of the  Channel Tunnel project it was stated  (paragraph 8) that the site  contemplated by  the  Southern Railway for theexchange station is between the entrance to the  Tunnel and Sandling Junction, inthe Brickworks-Golf Club area (Sq. W.55  in attached map).  The advantages and disadvantages of this site will first be discussed.  The potentialities of a  modifiedproposal providing for  an alternative site  in  the Westenhanger area further west nd further inland (Sq. V.65), will next be examined.  And,  finally, a third sitewill be suggested which is preferable from  a military point of view to either of theareas mentioned above.                      THE BRICKWORKS-GOLF  CLUB SITE,                            (Map reference W.55.)A advantages  of Proposed Lay-out.    44.  The following appear to be the advantages of the Brickworks-Golf Clubsite :      (a) Military.         Close to Shorncliffe Barracks,  and an  anti-aircraft lay-out covering the    railway works would cover these barracks also.    (b) Railway.          (i) Uses the best route to London and the one now used for Continental                 traffic.         (ii) Tunnel mouth close to this route.         (iii) Good site for exchange station close to mouth.         (iv) Good road communications.          (v) Good hotel accommodation at Folkestone.Disadvantages of Proposed Lay-out.    45.  As far as can be seen, this scheme is the best and most economical  one fromthe railway point of view, and there are no  known railway disadvantages.  From the       [21058]                                                        c 2
                           THE  WESTENHANGER SITE.                             (Map reference V.65.)    46.  Whilst it can be agreed from the railway point of view that a site nearFolkestone would be eminently more suitable for an exchange station, it is understoodthat an area could be selected in the vicinity of Westenhanger (three miles from thecoast), which would be practicable.  Such an area would have the following militaryadvantages:     Case &quot;A.&quot;        (a)  It was stated in paragraph 22 that the exchange station would probably               not be included in the first objective of  an enemy having designs on               the mouth.  It was further stated, however, that the possession of               the station would be an advantage  to him, in that,  without it, he               cannot turn round his trains.   An exchange station  removed six               miles from the  mouth,  as this one would  be, would therefore be an               asset to the defenders.Case &quot; B.&quot;    (b) Being further from the sea, an exchange station at Westenhanger would           be less liable to capture by sea-borne raid.    (c) Better facilities are offered for anti-aircraft defence.    (d) Less liable to bombardment from the sea.47.  The following are  the military disadvantages: Cases&quot; A &quot; and&quot; B.&quot;    The Tunnel mouth and the exchange station must be considered as one unitfrom the defence point of view.   It would thus be necessary to protect from theair and from the sea an area extending over some seven to eight miles, as againstmilitary point of view, however,  the scheme teems with disadvantages; they are asfollows:     Case &quot;A.&quot;        (a) Mouth is liable to capture by parties landing from boats.  There are no               less than three good landing beaches little more than 1 mile from the               mouth  (i.e., (i) Victoria Pier-Folkestone Harbour, (ii) Folkestone               Harbour-Copt Point, and (iii) East Wear Bay).        (b) There is cover for the attackers near the Tunnel mouth.  Folkestone is               spreading along the Canterbury Road, and a large colony of artisan               dwellings has already been erected on the East side of the road.        (c) The direction from the landing beaches to the mouth is easy to find,  and               could be effected by an issue to the troops of route-sheets giving street               names.    Case  &quot;B.&quot;        (d) The anti-aircraft defence of the exchange station would be extremely               difficult owing to  proximity to the coast.        (e) Both exchange station and mouth are only just defiladed from the  sea,               thus rendering aerial observation from a bombarding cruiser an easy               matter to  carry  out  without interference  from  the  anti-aircraft               defences.  Moreover, Caesars Camp and Sugar Loaf Hill are clearly-               defined  landmarks,  which  would  facilitate naval bombardments               without aerial observation.        (/) The exchange  station would be very nearly as  close to  the landing               beaches as is the mouth.A scale of defence has been worked out for this  lay-out and is given in Appendix
 !     one some two  miles in length.   This  would naturally add materially  to the I     personnel and money locked up in pure Home Defence.          A scale of defence, taking  into account an exchange station at Westen- &apos;]     hanger, is given in Appendix No. 2.          The military disadvantage of  an exchange station at Westenhanger could11     be considerably lessened if the Tunnel were to be extended North-Westward to      the area Stanford (Sq. V.66)-Postling (Sq. V.87), but this extension would add!      some five miles to the Tunnel, entailing additional expenditure, amounting to,      possibly, three to five million pounds.      48.  To sum up the two schemes discussed above, it can be said that,  whilst the  modification gives better security than the original, it would be much more expensive  in  defences.  Both the original and the modification, however, are fundamentally  unsound from the defence point of view.  A lay-out and alignment  which lie so close  and parallel to the  coast, would always be a source of anxiety both in war and during  strained relations.        THE MOST SUITABLE SITING FROM THE MILITARY POINT OF VIEW.Considerations governing the most suitable site from the military point of view.    49.  The most suitable site would fulfil the following requirements :      (a) Tunnel mouth, exchange station and all appurtenances to be close together,           to form one compact defensive area.    (b) No part of such defensive area to be within five miles of the coast.    (c) If possible, the defensive area should  be sited in a locality where defences           can be incorporated in and welded on to an existing defence scheme.    (d) There should be a practicable alternative  route from the  exchange station           to London.A pplication of the considerations governing the most suitable lay-out to the ground           in the Folkestone-Dover area.    50.  A reconnaissance of the area appears to show that a site might be selectedin the Shepherdswell area  (5-1 miles north of Dover,  Sq.  R.96 on map) for theTunnel mouth, exchange  station,  &amp;c,  which would fulfil the military conditionsstated in the  previous  paragraph.  From the railway point of view, however, alay-out in this vicinity would have the disadvantage of  linking up the Tunnel withthe London-Chatham-Dover line  instead of the London-Ashford-Folkestone line,or; alternatively, of involving the construction  of  a  new line to join  with thelatter  line.  It is  understood that  the  former line would require considerablealterations in order to bring it up to date; there are several 1/100 gradients, and reduced  speed is necessary  in the Chatham section.  Nevertheless,  in view  of the highly important military advantages of this  route, and the fact  that no greaterlength of  tunnel would be  necessary, it  is suggested  that a  scheme using  thisalignment  should receive full  investigation  by railway engineers  and a detailedproject prepared.    51.  With regard to the defences of this site, it is to be noted that should theLangdon Battery at Dover be withdrawn, as is recommended in Addendum No. 1 toC.I.D. Paper 158 A,  a warship  could bombard  the Shepherdswell area with theassistance of air spotting from a position east of Ramsgate and only one 9-2-inch gunin the Dover area would be able to  engage it  and then  only when the presentmountings are modernised.   It is recommended therefore that should the Shepherds-well area be adopted for the entrance of the Channel Tunnel the three 9-2-inch gunsat Langdon Battery should be retained and the  mountings be modernised so as togive them a 35 degrees elevation.   A scale of defence, based on the above suggestions,is given  in Appendix No. 3.
                                   PART IV. MECHANICAL DEVICES FOR PUTTING THE TUNNEL  TEMPORARILY  OR PERMANENTLY                                OUT  OF  SERVICE.     52.   As already explained in paragraph 37, the measures for putting the Tunnel temporarily or  permanently out of action to meet Case &quot;A&quot; should provide as follows :          Means for stopping traffic instantly.         Means for prolonging this stoppage for a period of days.         Means for prolonging this stoppage for a period of weeks or months.         Permanent flooding. The measures suggested  below for these purposes are intended to be cumulative and! progressive in the order  stated, so as to provide security in proportion as the danger increases.     53.   Although the suggestions made in this Report include the fullest possible! use of electric power, whether by switching off current or by increasing the voltage so as to burn out  the electric motors,  this means cannot be relied on in all circum- stances, since it is possible that a well-prepared raid  would be based on the use of locomotives  that would be  independent of the electric  power supply.  For example, the Committee are advised by  a representative of  the Electricity Commission that it would be practicable to run self-propelling battery electric locomotives through the Tunnel, though they would need considerable addition to their battery capacity to I haul  a troop train over the whole length of the Tunnel.   Such locomotives are actually used for sidings, and would probably prove essential for survey and repair Avork  in  the Tunnel itself;  further,  should the   Paris-Calais  route  ever  be I electrified (which  the Ministry of  Transport regard  as unlikely  at  present),  it is] probable a number of such locomotives would be available.  Apart from the use of I electrically-propelled engines,  it Avould be practicable to use steam or Diesel-electric locomotives  at any rate  for a short time  without making the atmosphere in the Tunnel unusable,  while  there have recently been suggestive  developments in  corn- pressed air  engines.  Although these  various  alternatives  to the normal electrical propulsion exist, it is recommended that provision should be made  for either cutting off the current to the Tunnel or increasing the voltage so  as to burn out the electric motors, if only as a means  of increasing the difficulties of a raiding party desiring to use the Tunnel.                      Means for Stopping Traffic  instantly.    54.  The folloAving  means are  suggested for stopping the traffic  instantly on information being received of a coming or actual emergency :      (a) Spur lines, without electric supply and fitted with sand-drags, leading  from I           each tunnel mouth up an incline and into  the most convenient position!           for  the  defending forces to destroy  the trains,  Avith the  necessary          control  points  to  switch  the  trains  from the normal  track  up the          inclines,  where  they would be brought to  rest.    (b) A gate or portcullis that can  be  closed near the  Tunnel mouth.    (c) Means for switching off the current.    (d) Means for effecting a sudden increase in the voltage sufficient to burn out the J          electric motors,  though,  in the opinion of the Ministry of Transport, this J          is a method on  which too much reliance must not be placed. The two  latter methods  are, of  course,  subject  to  the  element  of  uncertaintymentioned in the preceding paragraph. These devices should be applied to both the traffic tunnels, and, mutatis mutandis, to the pilot tunnel.  They should be capable of being actuated by the Officer Commanding the Defences.    55.  In order that some warning of a surprise attack  may be given, particularly of the substitution of a troop train  for an ordinary train,  the Committee recommendthat an examination post,  provided with an alarm signal,  should be established inthe English  half of the Tunnel in case of emergency, where trains could be stoppedand examined.  Provision should be made for this in the construction of the Tunnel.
                   Stoppage for a Period of Weeks or Months.    62.   The above methods have envisaged putting the Tunnel temporarily out ofaction without inflicting any very serious damage.    If  the  situation  rendered  desirable a semi-permanent  obstruction  whichcould nevertheless be cleared without involving any great delay,  the following is recommended:                                                            &amp;Derailing a train and wrecking other trains behind the first.     56.  If reliable information were received of a threatened raid, any or all of these devices could be put in operation.   Time would thus be gained to enable the garrison to occupy its emergency stations, to bring into action  the battery covering the entrance to the Tunnel, and to render possible the escape of any innocent traffic or workers that might be present in the Tunnel pending the adoption of the more stringent measures enumerated below.     57.  If a surprise had been effected and a train conveying raiders had already emerged from the Tunnel, these  measures might hold up for a time a second and subsequent trains, unless the apparatus had been put out of action by the advance guard of the attacking force.                        Stoppage for a Period of Days.     58.  The following methods have been considered in order to provide a stoppage for a period of days :      (a) The provision of a slight  dip in the Tunnel, which could be rapidly flooded.     (b) Poison gas, if this is not ruled out by the signature  and ratification  of the          Geneva Gas Protocol.     59.  The dip  would need to  be connected to the drainage  tunnel for drainage purposes and a drainage pipe of  suitable  diameter fitted.  To enable the dip to be rapidly flooded  an automatic sealing  device  should, if possible,  be fitted  to the drainage orifice which would be  operated by the  flow of water.  It is considered that a stoppage of traffic would be certain if the flooding provided for a 6-foot depth of water at the lowest point  in the dip.   The question of flooding is dealt with in greater detail  in paragraphs 63 to 72 below and it will be seen that  the system for flooding the dip would be  the same  as the one employed for permanently flooding the Tunnel.     60.  The Home Defence Committee are not absolutely certain that the construc- tion of a dip is feasible, owing to the doubt that exists as to the thickness of the layerof lower chalk through which the Tunnel has to be driven.  This is a point which canonly be decided if and when the pilot tunnel is driven, but, as the dip need only be a few feet deep, it ought not  to be difficult to provide.     61.  The possibility of using  gas to supplement other methods of defence for theTunnel has been discussed at a Conference between the War Office and the represen-tatives of the  Chemical Warfare Department, at which the following conclusions were reached :      (1)  That the use of gas as a main means of defending the Tunnel is out  of the          question for the reason that the quantities, even if used in a diluted form,          are prohibitive.    (2)  That gas could be used to supplement other methods of defence by rendering          the process of recovery of  the Tunnel more difficult.     (3)  That, if required for such a purpose, the best gas to use would be mustard          gas.    The Home Defence  Committee  felt it  their  duty to examine  this means  ofdefence, but they cannot recommend its adoption.  By the terms of the Geneva GasProtocol this  country has bound  itself not to use  gas unless it is first  used  by  anenemy.  Action to defend the  Tunnel might be required on the outbreak of war, and,if gas had not already been used by an enemy, which is unlikely, its employment todefend the Tunnel would involve this country in being the first to commit a breach ofthe  Protocol, which, apart from other considerations, might involve reprisals.
                              Permanent Flooding.     63.  None of the measures for  denying the  Tunnel to an enemy has been the subject of greater controversy than the proposed arrangements for putting the!Tunnel completely out of action in the last emergency by flooding or otherwise, and Ithe Home Defence Committee, like their predecessors who have studied this question, jhave encountered considerable difficulty in finding a solution.     64.  At the inquiry by the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1914 it was pro-posed to provide for  this  by bringing the Tunnel to the surface in the face of theDover Cliffs and then running it  along a viaduct before turning inland, and by atower  in  the sea of  lighthouse type, which could be connected with  the  Tunnelby a shaft.  The object of both these proposals was to ensure that, even  if by a coup de main an enemy succeeded in occupying the bridgehead, it would be withinthe power of our own  ships to destroy both the viaduct and the tower, the destructionof the latter involving automatically the flooding of the Tunnel.   These methods,however, were rejected by the Home  Defence Committee in  1919, on  the ground thatthe Tunnel would be too vulnerable to enemy attack by sea or by air when we  desiredto use it ourselves.     65.  Yet another plan which has been proposed  in  the past and has been carefully considered during the present inquiry is to flood both the &quot; dip &quot;  and,  ifnecessary, the Tunnel itself, not from the sea, but from a reservoir.   In order  toprovide safety in time of peace, it would be  desirable that the pipe-line should not join up with the reservoir, but that it should enter a cavity close  to it.  Floodingwould then be started by blasting away the division between the reservoir and thecavity  by means  of explosives brought to the spot on the  occasion.  This methodshould overcome in some degree the objections raised by  the  Ministry of transport in 1919 and quoted below, that the Tunnel might be flooded accidentally, and wouldenable the flooding to&apos; be controlled,  which would not be the case if the method  of admitting the sea by an explosive charge was relied on.  It  has been calculated that,in order to fill the dip  only,  3,600,000 cubic feet of water would be required, involving a reservoir 40 feet deep and 100 yards square.  In order to flood the whole Tunnel,111,000,000 cubic feet of water would be needed, and  a  reservoir 40 feet deep and550 yards square would be required.  It appeared to the Home Defence Committee outof the question  to  recommend so  expensive  a method unless no  safe and effective means of letting in the sea could be found.     66.  The method tentatively favoured by the  Home Ports Defence Committee  in1919 was that contemplated in previous inquiries, namely, to provide for putting theTunnel permanently out of action  by means of explosive charges placed in chambersmidway between the bottom of the sea and the crown of the Tunnel,  the explosion  ofwhich would admit the sea  into the Tunnel.   But they made the following pertinentcomment on the proposal:          &quot; In connection with  any proposal  to rely solely  on explosive  charges for     flooding purposes the Committee feel bound  to draw attention  to the fact that     numerous instances have occurred in the past of the failure to fire explosive     charges  at the critical moment, or of  their failure, when fired, to effect the     purpose for which provided.  The risk of such failures is greater in view of the     possibility, even  though remote, of a  sudden coup de main against  the English     end of the Tunnel and the consequent possibility of  the enemy being  able  to     anticipate the laying of the charges.&quot;     67.  The observation  made above in paragraph 25 of this Memorandum,  in discussing the possibility that the Tunnel might be attacked by a charge laid aboveit on the bed of the sea, namely, that the effect might only  be to block it with chalkwhich could be fairly rapidly cleared, is applicable also to the case under considera-tion. For  this reason there must  be a considerable element of doubt as to whetherthe Tunnel would be  flooded by an explosion between the crown and the sea bottomand destroyed beyond possibility of repair during the war.     Taking  all these objections  and  uncertainties  together, the  Home  DefenceCommittee, though reluctantly, have decided to recommend the rejection of the plan of flooding the Tunnel by an explosive charge.     68.  A second method for admitting the sea that has been proposed in the pastis the permanent flooding of the Tunnel by means of sluice gates, the sluices being
[controlled from a fort on the English coast.  The Home Ports  Defence Committee in 1919 pointed out the following objections to this plan :          &quot; The  Committee have been  favoured with the views  of  the  Ministry  of     Transport on this question, and are informed  that that  Department  are  of     opinion that, if provision were to be made for letting in the sea at short notice     and that the public were aware that such arrangements were in  existence, strong     pressure might  be brought to bear upon the Government to see that no undue     risk was taken of the Tunnel being accidentally flooded, and  further that the     machinery would have to be tested frequently, which would not only dislocate     traffic but  might involve considerable risk.         It is understood that for  these reasons the  Ministry of Transport are  of     opinion that any  arrangement for letting in the sea by sluices would become     ineffectual after a short time, and that it would be preferable not to have any     sluices at all by which the sea could be admitted.&quot;     The Committee  are informed that, judged by the experience of the Admiralty, adequate  safety would  be  given by  the provision  of controlling  valves, which could be afforded full security by being located underground.  These valves could be sited either close to Dover Harbour  or inland and connected by a small culvert to the main tunnels, through which the water would be conducted to the clip.  The further inland the valves are sited the greater the  length of culvert, and  consequently the greater the cost.     89.  The method which the Committee are inclined to  favour  is one suggested by Dr. F. E. Smith, the Secretary to the Department  of Scientific and  Industrial Research, and  is based on the principle of the syphon.  One arm  of the proposed syphon would terminate in Dover Harbour below low-water  spring  tides,  and the other in the Tunnel, being so arranged as to enable either the &quot; dip &quot; or the whole Tunnel to be flooded.  Until  the air in the syphon above the surface of the sea was replaced by water up to the crown of the syphon pipe, which would be accomplished by filling the head of the syphon with water from a priming tank at a higher level, there would be  no possibility of the Tunnel being flooded. Further, the amount and rate of the flooding could  be controlled by valves and all risk of premature  or accidental flooding would be avoided.  The water would be led  to the main tunnels through culverts of  sufficient size  to  provide a. greater  intake  of water than the drainage pumps could pump out.     70.  At first the Committee contemplated siting this apparatus inland so as tohe secure  from the risk of bombardment.  They were informed, however, that, for technical reasons connected with flow of the water through the connecting pipes and syphon, the apparatus must be located close to the shore, as  well as, of course, above sea level.  This entails the disadvantage that it would be exposed to attack of various kinds, and it would be necessary either to place it inside the cliffs or  to protect it with concrete or armour plate.     71.  At present the  information at the  disposal  of  the Committee is  not sufficiently detailed to  enable them to put  forward definite proposals.  They think it probable that a scheme could be worked  out on the  lines proposed, above in para- graphs 68 or 69.  From the point of view of defence, the plan of simple 1-turn valves, which could be  duplicated and  arranged  so  as to  avoid  malicious or  accidental flooding, offers attractions, for the  reason that the whole apparatus could be placed underground and, if so  decided, inland.   On  the other hand, the  principle of the syphon is preferred by the Ministry of Transport for the reasons of safety quoted in paragraph 68.     72.  Until detailed information is available as to  such matters as the position of the dip, the feasibility of constructing the flooding shafts, the  practicability of using the main tunnels as conduits, &amp;c, the Home Defence Committee cannot express any confident opinion in regard to these alternative schemes for flooding the tunnel, although, as already stated, they favour the  principle of  the  syphon.  Whatever system is adopted, however, in this most essential feature of the defensive arrange- ments,  it  is vital that,  firstly, the  flooding arrangements  should  be  adequately protected by judicious siting if possible and/or by concrete or  armour from enemy bombing,  gunfire, raiding attack and sabotage; secondly, that adequate communica- tions should be  provided to ensure that the Officer Commanding will  be able to control the flooding; and, thirdly, that the quantity of water  that can be admitted to the tunnels shall greatly exceed the capacity of the drainage pumps.   Owing to the many uncertain factors no estimate of the cost can be given at the present  stage.
                        Duplication of Means of Protection.     73.   The Home  Defence Committee  concur generally in the following  recom- mendation of the Home Ports Defence Committee in 1919 :           &quot; All the arrangements  for putting  the  Tunnel out  of service,  either     temporarily or permanently, and all the machinery installations vital to  its use     to be duplicated and put, so far as practicable, underground;  each installation     being separate, guarded at all times, and surrounded by obstacles; and electric     lights to be  provided to illuminate the ground in the vicinity by night.&quot; Duplication, however, may not in all cases be feasible or necessary, and, in applying the above rules, each case must be considered on its merits.  The Committee  do not concur in the recommendation contained in the same Report that the entrance to the Tunnel on the English side must be duplicated.  In Case &quot; A &quot; the additional tunnel mouths  would add to the difficulties  of the  defence,  as double the number  of tunnel entrances would need closing to  the invading enemy;  in Case  &quot;B&quot;  the Committee consider that the probability of damage to the tunnel mouths would be small, as they would present a difficult target to aircraft and are unlikely to be hit by a bombarding vessel.  Further,  the work  of  repair could be effected easily and expeditiously.                        The Pumping Station  and Shaft.     74.  It is observed that in the plan annexed to the Report of the Channel Tunnel Sub-Committee the pumping shaft is shown at the  foot  of  the east mole of  Dover Harbour.  The Committee consider that the pumping-station for  the Tunnel  should be  located within the defence area, and be adequately protected against  bombard- ment and raiding attack.                                   PART V.                        PRECAUTIONS AGAINST SABOTAGE.     75.  Sabotage might be resorted to  by an enemy in order to supplement a surprise  attack (Case &quot; A &quot;) by putting out of action some of the mechanical  means for denying the use of the  Tunnel to an  enemy.  In Case  &quot;B,&quot; an enemy  might resort to sabotage with the  object of  derailing a train  in the  Tunnel  or  its approaches;  wrecking a train by  explosion  in the Tunnel; or  destroying some essential part of the  workings, such as the transformers  or generators.   Sabotage might also  be directed against the  power-stations in  Brighton, Barking  and Richborough,  if  constructed, against the high-tension power lines in Sussex  and Kent, or against  the lines of railway leading towards the Tunnel.    76.  The protection against sabotage of all vulnerable points connected with the working of the Tunnel, and of the means for denying it to an enemy,  would be under the general supervision of the General Officer Commanding, and  would beundertaken  by the garrison,  except in  so far as  provided  for  by the Railway Company.   The  Home Defence  Committee recommend  that the  War  Office, in examining the designs for all such vulnerable points, including ventilation shafts, should give special attention to tihe provision of suitable military obstacles.    77.  The responsibility for preventing unauthorised persons from entering anyof the tunnels from the British end or any part of the premises would rest with the Southern Railway Company, who have their own police, but the arrangements shouldbe subject to the approval of the General Officer Commanding, who  should have theright to supplement  the Company&apos;s arrangements by armed guards or patrolswhenever he deemed necessary.    78.  The Committee recommend that  the immediate approaches to the Tunneland the exchange station should be surrounded by an unclimbable wall or fence inorder to  exclude unauthorised persons.  The charge for this would  presumably fallon the Companies responsible for the Tunnel.    79.  The protection against sabotage of vulnerable points outside the area ofthe Command should be arranged  for in  times  of  peace  by the Home  Defence Committee,  who  have already rendered a Report on the protection of vulnerable points in time of war, and have provided machinery for  keeping the axrangementsup to date.
     80.   The safeguards against sabotage with the object of wrecking a passenger or  goods  train  inside  the  Tunnel have been  examined   on the  assumption that  the  enemy  agent  would  seek  to effect  his  purpose by  means of  an explosive  charge  loaded  on  to  a  train  and  detonated  while the  train was passing through the Tunnel.   No particular assumption has been made  as to the quantity of explosives which might be used or as to the damage which might be caused to the fabric of the Tunnel, because it seems clear that the mere wrecking of a train,  with consequent stoppage of railway transport and possible damage to the permanent way in one  of the  tunnels,  would  in itself  be  a sufficiently serious consideration if the act were well timed.     81.   The problem of prevention falls  into two parts, as respects (a)  goods trains and (b) passenger trains.     As regards goods trains, it seems clear that one of the principal dangers to be guarded against  would be  the loading of a package  containing explosives and a time  fuse  in the Tunnel marshalling yards.   It would be useless  to  consign the package containing the explosive from, say, Birmingham  or even London,  because the consignor would have no notion of, nor any means  of finding out, the time that this particular package would in fact enter  and leave the  Tunnel.   In  order to wreck a goods train in the Tunnel a package  would,  therefore, have to be loaded surreptitiously in the marshalling yard and preferably when the train was about to leave the yard for the Tunnel.  To guard  against surreptitious stowage of this kind would require careful supervision while the trains were being made up and started. This  should not present any special difficulty, assuming that the Southern  Railway Company would be able to rely on the trustworthiness of their servants  employed in and around the Tunnel.   Otherwise  sabotage by such means would be very  difficult to guard against.     82.  As regards passenger trains-the problem is more  complicated.   In the case of  these trains  it would generally  be possible  for  anyone to  forecast with tolerable  accuracy,  from the time  tables, when any particular  train might be expected to be passing through the Tunnel and to set the time fuse accordingly. It would be possible to upset calculations of this kind  by merely  upsetting the time  table workings  of the trains,  and  this  expedient  might  in  itself  serve to safeguard the Tunnel against sabotage by  this particular method.  But it would not safeguard the trains or guard against an attempt to wreck a train in the Tunnel by a person who was prepared to actuate the mechanism  for  detonating the explosive whilst he himself was on board.  At ordinary times there is no  examination of passengers&apos; luggage, nor any means  of preventing, say, a suit case or  cabin trunk containing explosives  and  a time  fuse  or other apparatus  for  detonating the explosives being loaded in the ordinary way as passengers&apos; luggage in London or elsewhere.  To guard against this sort of thing it would  be necessary to introduce a careful examination of passengers&apos; luggage,  which, presumably, would be best carried out at the exchange station  by  Customs officers, diverted from their usual duties under arrangements  previously made for the purpose.   This would  have to be subject  to the  consent  of the Foreign  Office lest diplomatic negotiations should be prejudiced.    83.  In  the  preceding paragraphs the possibility of sabotage  by explosives placed either in goods or passenger trains has been discussed on the assumption that a time-fuse would be used or the apparatus be actuated by a passenger  The attention of the Committee has, however, been drawn to the fact that the same object  could be achieved by using a  fuse  operated by air  pressure, with equal certainty with that obtainable by the former method and without the personal risk involved by the latter.    84.  The depth  of the bottom of the Tunnel below sea level would be 360 ft. This depth would be reached about 10^ miles from the English entrance.   A  train passing through the Tunnel would,  even  with  a speed of  only 20 m.p.h.,  descend from  125 ft. above sea level to 360 ft. below sea level in approximately 31 minutes. The  increase in air  pressure so caused would  be approximately 17 millibars, and would be far in excess of  any barometric changes which have been observed to take place naturally in this country in so short a time.  About once a year  a change of6  millibars in two hours is recorded in  South-East England.  The effect on theatmospheric pressures  by  the passage of the trains in the tunnels  is an uncertainquantity, particularly  as  each of the railway  tunnels is  connected by ventilationpipes with the pilot  tunnel, and it is therefore recommended  that trials should bemade with an atmospheric pressure fuse when the tunnels  have been completed.
     85.   The fuse required to take advantage of this relatively rapid increase o pressure would take the form of an air chamber communicating through a very smal aperture  with  the outside air.   Changes of air pressure would cause air to flowl into and  out of the chamber, and it would be arranged that air flowing into theS chamber would impinge upon a vane,  which, when turned sufficiently, would makd&quot; an electrical connection and explode the detonator.  The aperture and the amount^ the vane had to be turned to operate the fuse would be so proportioned that      (a) Normal, rates of change of  pressure would cause  air to leak through th           aperture too slowly to turn the vane.     (b) A rate of change of the nature of 15 millibars in 30 minutes, maintained fo           (say) 10 minutes, would operate the fuse.  The exact  time  for which the!           vane would have to be turned could be  easily worked  out so as to ensured           that the comparatively short railway gradients outside the  Tunnel dicip           not operate the fuse.     86.   Against an attack of this nature it is difficult to see what provision could be made, except by the search of every single package entering the Tunnel, whether by goods or passenger train.   It is considered impracticable for a search to be carried out of all  packages on goods trains passing through the Tunnel and the only means of preventing damage by this means would be to prohibit the transport through the Tunnel of all excepting military stores and special packages; it  is, however, highly improbable that the Government of the day would ever permit so drastic a curtail- ment of the use of the Tunnel before the actual outbreak of hostilities, by which time the damage might have been done.    87.  The Home Defence Committee recommend that, if the  Channel Tunnel is constructed, arrangements as contemplated in paragraphs  80 to 82 of  the present Memorandum should be worked out in detail and included  in the War Book.  The Committee draw attention to the fact that corresponding arrangements ought to be made at the Continental end of  the  Tunnel,  but  the question of whether His Majesty &quot;s Government would permit such arrangements to be concerted in time of peace or during the period of strained  relations, involves political  considerations and lies outside the scope of their inquiry.                                 PART VI.                      MISCELLANEOUS RECOMMENDATIONS.                            The Provision of power .    88.  In  1919  the  Home Ports  Defence  Committee  recommended that  the electrical power for the whole Tunnel should be provided from the English side of the Channel, and the Home Defence Committee have given careful consideration, in consultation with a representative of the Electricity Commission, to the question of whether this particular precaution is necessary.    89.  As  the  scheme  discussed  in  the  Report  of  the  Committee  of  the Economic  Advisory Council contemplates the construction of the  French half of the Tunnel by a French Company, and that the agreement with the French Government would  provide that  French sovereignty would begin at a point  to be fixed in the Tunnel, it  is presumed that,  in the absence of any agreement to the  contrary, the electric power in the French part of the Tunnel would be provided from a French power-station.    90.  The Home Defence Committee are informed, however, that it would  be practicable to supply all the power required for working the Tunnel from the British side.   In this event  it would  be necessary to lay a 33,000 volt main right along the j Tunnel to supply the transformer stations at the French coast, and these would have to be under the same supervision as the remainder  of the electrical power supply of the Tunnel.  The Home Defence Committee are informed  that  the capital cost of laying high tension mains from Dover to Calais for the purpose  proposed would be about  150,000.   This expenditure would be obviated if half the supply were taken from the French side into the Calais sub-station.  Some saving in  the operating costs might be effected  by  taking the whole of the energy from one instead of  two points, but the Committee are informed that such saving  would not be nearly sufficient tocounterbalance the annual charges (i.e.,  9,750 on   150,000, assuming interest at 5 per cent, and sinking fund at 1^ per cent.) on the capital expenditure  involved.   If the whole  supply is  to be from the English side, reasons other than financial mustbe produced to justify that policy.
    91.  It has been shown in this Memorandum that by careful organisation an enemy could deliver his initial attack in Case &quot; A &quot; with the use of locomotives that are  not  dependent  on  the  regular  power  supply.   Nevertheless,  it   would increase  his difficulties if the electric power supply of the whole  Tunnel were generated on the English side, and the Home Defence Committee would prefer that this  should be the case,  although in the situation obtaining in Case  &quot;B&quot;  the additional source of electricity supply from a French station would be an advantage.IPersonnel of the Garrison.    92.  The Committee of Imperial Defence are no doubt aware that the personnel )f the coast defences and anti-aircraft defences of the United Kingdom are supplied n the main from the Territorial Army, an arrangement that has been made since he War, and  for reasons of  economy.  Although  the  mobile  force proposed in )paragraph 34 (e) and the artillery personnel of the 6-inch guns mounted to command he mouth of the Tunnel would be composed of regular troops, unless and until sent abroad as part of the Expeditionary Force, the whole of the coast defences and anti- aircraft defences proposed in this Memorandum (Appendices 1 to 3)  would, in the absence of some special provision, be supplied by the Territorial Army.  Arrange- ments should be made for the personnel of these Territorial Army units to be enlisted under conditions similar to those under which the personnel of Territorial Army anti- aircraft units are IIOAV enlisted, so that they could be mobilized by order of the Secretary of State for War, without it being necessary to call up the whole Territorial Army.The Committee are informed by the Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence that in 1914, when the precautionary stage of the War Book was put in operation a few days before the outbreak of war, the Cabinet refused to sanction the calling out of any Territorial troops whatsoever,  including the &quot; Special Service &quot; sections for which special arrangements had been made.   Having regard to the fact that, if the Channel  Tunnel is constructed, a new factor will  enter into the  Home Defence problem and Dover will become a great key fortress liable to surprise attack as a first act of war, the Home Defence Committee  feel it incumbent upon them to draw the attention of the Committee of Imperial Defence to this aspect of the defence problem. In doing so they observe that the provision of regular troops  for the coast defences and anti-aircraft defences would add considerably to the estimates  for upkeep inthe Appendices.  If the usual procedure is followed and Territorial troops are used, it is  of the first importance that there  should be no hesitation on the part of the Government in calling up the Territorial Forces concerned at the first hint of strainedrelations.              Effect of the Tunnel on the War Book A rrangements.    93.  Another point to which the Home Defence Committee desire to draw atten- tion  is the effect  of the construction of  the  Tunnel on  the basis  of certainarrangements incorporated in the War Book.   The plans for the precautionary stage of the War Book are based on the assumption that they must be as non-provocative and as unobtrusive as possible, in order  not in  any way to prejudice diplomaticnegotiations at  a  critical stage.   Even  so, important precautions, apart fromthose  referred  to in the  preceding paragraph,  were rejected by the Cabinet in 1914.   It is a matter for serious consideration whether, in the anxious days before an outbreak of war, which, from the point of view of  the defence of the Tunnel, may be the most critical stage of all, the precautions necessary to bring up to concert pitch the arrangements for the  safety of the  bridgehead (Case &quot; A &quot;), or  of the Tunnel(Case &quot; B &quot;), the latter including  the searching of passengers&apos; baggage, would be sanctioned by the Government of the day.                      Private or Government Oivnership.    94.  The Report  of  the Home Ports  Defence Committee in 1919 included the following recommendation :           &quot; As  regards the responsibility  for putting into  action any means  for    putting the Tunnel out of service,  the Committee are of opinion that it is of    vital importance that this responsibility should be clearly defined.  This would    be simplified if the Tunnel were Government-owned.&quot; The  Committee of  Chiefs of  Staff  made  a  similar  recommendation  in 1924 (C.I.D. Paper No.  125-A).
     95.  The Home Defence Committee agree with their predecessors that defence interests would be better served under Government than under private  ownershipbut they observe that this is directly contrary  to the views,  on economic grounds, ofthe Sub-Committee of the Economic Advisory Council.   The Committee therefore donot feel justified in  going further  han to  draw the attention of  the Committee ofImperial Defence to this  aspect  of the  question.   They  regard  it  as essentialhowever, that the Government should  have the power to take over the English halof the  Tunnel, either in an  emergency  or permanently, if experience should renderthis desirable, and it should be made clear that no undertaking  could be  given tpay compensation for damage.                           Possible Future Developments.     96.  The Home Defence Committee observe that future developments, either inthe  political  or technical sphere, might  necessitate  an entire reconsideration othe  defensive  arrangements  now  proposed.   They  ought  to  be  re-examinedcomprehensively at intervals.                                   Estimate  of  Cost.     97.  Only the roughest  estimate can be given at the present stage of the cost ofthe  measures recommended, which  are given in  detail in the  Appendices.   an accurate estimate of the cost cannot be worked out until detailed proposals aravailable for  the defence of a definite  tunnel lay-out.  It will be noticed,  however that they vary  considerably according to  the position  of  the lay-out.  The cost of the  different schemes may be summarised  as follows :  Folkestone Site.

It will be noted that no attempt has been made to compute the cost of the means for putting the Tunneleither temporarily or permanently out of action, as it is impossible to estimate the sum until final decisions are arrived at regarding the location of the dip and drainage arrangements : all that can be said at present is that a very considerable sum will have to be allowed for these and other safeguards  recommended in theMemorandum.    NOTES :        * See paragraph 51.1       f If flooding arrangements  are located close to the shore additional beach defences may be required.
                                PART VII.                           GENERAL  CONCLUSIONS.    98.   The conclusions of the Home Defence Committee as to the forms of attack and the defences required to meet them may be summed up as follows :     (1) Although the  information regarding the Channel  Tunnel project is fuller          than has been available at previous Inquiries, it is not sufficiently detailed          to enable a  final  scheme  of defence to be  prepared.  The  present          proposals, therefore, must only be regarded as a general, outline, subject          to review if and when detailed specifications are available (para. 2).    (2) In accordance with a principle that  was adopted in 1905 and has frequently          been reaffirmed by the Committee of Imperial Defence as appropriate to          any  question affecting the  problem of invasion,  whose true solution          involves such a  vital issue as national independence, all possible and not          merely probable forms of attack  have been considered (para.  16).                            Possible Forms  of Attack.    (3) The  possible forms of attack have been  considered  under the  following          two heads:           Case &quot;A.&quot; An enemy in possession of the Continental end of the Tunnel                         wishes to use it himself.          Case &quot; B.&quot; The British Expeditionary Force, involved on the Continent,                         is  using or  about  to  use  the  Tunnel as  a line  of                         communication.  The enemy wishes to deny the Tunnel                         to the Expeditionary Force (para. 17).    (4) Case &quot;A.&quot;          (a) A surprise attack, as a first act of war, is the most probable and the                most dangerous contingency to be provided  against (para. 18).          (b) The possible forms of attack include any one, or a combination, of the                following : -                  (i)  Parties landed from  ships.                 (ii)  A troop train substituted for a normal train.                (hi)  Sabotage directed against our ;own safeguards.                (iv) Parties landed  from  aeroplanes (para.  19).          (c) Attacks would probably be  accompanied by an intensive bombard-                ment either by  air or sea, or both, of the defences and barracks,                aerodromes,   men-of-war  in  harbour,   &amp;c,  with   a view  to                disorganising the defences (para. 20).          (d) As much as a brigade might debouch from the Tunnel by piling up                trains head  to  tail in  the Tunnel,  just within its mouth.  This                operation would probably be  accompanied by the landing of troops                at points on the coast (para. 23).    (5) Case &quot; B.&quot;  The following attacks would be open to an enemy desirous of          preventing  the  Expeditionary Force from using the Tunnel :           (a) Bombardment of the exchange station from the  air and from the sea.          (b) Landing of  a raiding force to put the Tunnel or its  workings out of                action.          (c) Sabotage  against  the Tunnel or some part of the  workings which                would put it permanently  or temporarily out of action.          (d) Destruction of the Tunnel by explosive charges placed on the bed of                the Channel (improbable,  but perhaps not impossible) (para, 24).          (e) Attacks on objectives outside of the zone of local defence, such as                     The power  stations  at  Barking,   Brighton,   and  at                Bichborough  (if constructed).                    The  high-tension cables carried across-country on pylons.                    The lines of railway leading to the Tunnel (para, 26).                    NOTE. Attacks  on  the  Continental   end   of  the  Tunnel                delivered with the same object are beyond the scope of the Home                Defence Committee&apos;s inquiry (para. 27).
    (6)  The strength of a sea-borne raiding attack would not be likely to exceed one          Division, but the scale of such attack requires to be kept constantly under          review  (paras.  28 and 29).                                 Forms of  Defence.    (7)  The  following forms of  defence  are applicable  to both  Case &quot;A&quot;  and          Case &quot; B &quot; :           (a) Anti-aircraft defences to protect                    (i)  The whole railway lay-out (Tunnel mouth to exchange station1                       inclusive).                  (ii)  The local defences of these places.                 (iii)  The  barracks housing the  defensive mobile  force,  head-5                       quarters, &amp;c.          (b) Medium anti-ship defences (9-2-inch gun armament*) to protect the                 whole lay-out from bombardment from the sea, and as a defence                 against landings.          (c) Close defence of landing beaches within reach (say,  5 miles) of the                 Tunnel  mouth  and  exchange  station  (6-inch   armament  and                 machine guns).          (d) Scrutiny of traffic.          (e) Local  defence of  the  whole lay-out  by  a  mobile  force  (al ready J                 available) (para. 34).    (8)  The following measures of protection are peculiar to Case  &quot; A &quot; :           (a) Fixed defences around the  Tunnel mouth.   Fixed  gun  positions                 (6-inch) to fire direct on the Tunnel  mouth and machine-gun  &quot; pill                 boxes &quot;; obstacles.          (b) Clearance area of 1,000 yards radius round mouth.          (c) Means for stopping traffic instantly.        &apos;  (d) Means for prolonging this stoppage  for a period of days.          (e) Means for prolonging this stoppage for a period of weeks or months.          (/) Permanent flooding (para. 37).                 For details of (c) to (/), see (14) below.    (9)  The following measures of protection are peculiar to Case  &quot; B &quot; :           (a) Rendering inoperative  our own mechanism for putting  the  Tunnel                 out of  action.          (b) Suitable  safeguards,   whether  by  siting  or  protection  for the                 transformer stations supplying current to the Tunnel.          (c) The possession  of  a practicable  alternative railway route  between                 London and the exchange station.          (d) Patrolling of Tunnel alignment in the Channel by vessels and aircraft                 (para. 38).   (10)  From the point of view of resistance to the shock of an explosion of a charge          placed  on the bed of the sea,  it is preferable that the Tunnel should be          lined with steel rather than cast  iron, but, in view of the remoteness of          this form of attack, the Home  Defence  Committee  do not  press this          proposal if any  considerable additional cost or technical difficulties are          foreseen.  They  recommend,  however,  that the point should be looked          into further by the engineers if and when it is decided to proceed with          the Tunnel (para. 39).                     Protection Outside the Local Defence Area.   (11)  The protection against air attack of pylons,  high-tension cables and power          stations is part of the general air defence arrangements of the  country.          The  Ministry  of  Transport,  however,  should be  asked  to  assume          responsibility for ensuring that arrangements are made by the authorities          concerned for rapid repairs  in  case  of interruption  on or  immediately          before the outbreak of war (para. 40).   * NOTE. In referring to a 9-2-inch gun armament, the Committee in no way desires to prejudge theissue regarding the medium anti-ship defence for  defended ports which is at present under examination bythe staffs of the War Office and Air Ministry.
                       The Lay-out of the Tunnel.(12) The most effective defence against all forms of attack, except sabotage, is       a proper siting,  from the military point of view, of  the Tunnel mouth       and all its appurtenances  (para. 31).   The site at present contemplated       for the mouth and the exchange station, east of Sandling Junction, teems       with disadvantages from a military point of view.  It is so near to the       shore  as  to  be open to raids from forces  landed on the  coast, and to       facilitate observation by aircraft assisting a naval bombardment, and is       difficult to  defend  from  air attack  (para. 45).  Some  of  the same       objections apply, though in a slightly less degree, to  an alternative  site       west of Sandling  Junction,  at Westenhanger, which necessitates  the       defence of a  very long line  from the Tunnel mouth to the exchange station       inclusive, with consequent increase in  cost (para. 46).  Both the above       sites are thoroughly unsound, from a military point of view (para. 48).(13) It is suggested that, if there is any prospect  of the Channel Tunnel being       sanctioned and proceeded with, a lay-out in the Shepherdswell area, which       promises to be suitable from a military point of view and can be protected       at far smaller cost than either of the other sites suggested, should be fully       investigated by railway engineers.  The most obvious objection to  this       site is  that  it would entail either the  use of the London-Chatham  line       for  the Continental traffic and considerable improvements  to this route       would be necessary if it is to  be made capable of taking fast traffic, or a       line would have  to  be  constructed connecting Ashford with Shepherds-       well (para. 50).           Should  the Shepherdswell site be adopted  it is  recommended that       the Langdon Battery at Dover (3 9-2-inch guns), instead of being disposed       of, as recommended in Addendum No.  1  to  C.I.D. Paper 158-A, should       be retained and given mountings with 350 of elevation (para. 51). Means for putting the Tunnel temporarily or permanently out of action.(14) (a) Means for stopping traffic instantly :              (i)  Switch spur  rails from the entrance of the Tunnel mouths to                 bring an arriving train to rest in a convenient position for the                 defending forces.            (ii)  A  gate or portcullis  near the Tunnel mouth that can be closed.           (iii)  Means for switching off the current.           (iv)  Means for effecting a sudden increase in  the voltage sufficient                 to burn  out the electric motors.       The above to be capable of being actuated by the Officer Commanding the       Defences (para. 54).           NOTE. The electrical devices are  uncertain, as the enemy could use       forms of locomotive independent of electric power (para. 53).           As a further safeguard  against surprise, provision should be made       in the construction of the English half  of the Tunnel for an examination       post, provided with an alarm signal, where trains  could be stopped for       examination in times of international tension (para. 55). (b) Stoppage for a  period of days :            The provision  of  a slight &quot;dip&quot; in the  Tunnel, which could be       flooded rapidly (paras. 58, 59).           NOTES. (1) It is  not certain that the dip can be constructed, owing       to the thinness of the layer of lower chalk through which the Tunnel must       be driven, a  point that cannot be decided until the pilot tunnel is driven       (para. 60).           (2) The use of poison gas would be  contrary to the Geneva  Gas       Protocol, and is not recommended (para. 61). (c) Stoppage for a  period of weeks or months :             Derailing  a train  and  wrecking  other  trains behind  the  first       (para.  62).
 id) Permanent flooding :             Neither the provision of a reservoir for flooding the Tunnel nor the        explosion of a mine placed between the bottom of the sea and the crown        of the Tunnel are recommended, for reasons given in paragraphs 65 to 67.            It is  considered that the flooding of either the  dip or the whole        Tunnel could be carried  out  by admitting the sea  through a group of        several sluice valves or by syphoning it down to the main tunnels,  whence        it would be conducted to the dip.  The plant for the former system could        be located inland  at additional cost, whereas the latter must be  located        in Dover near the  shore.  Provision must in any event be made  for the        protection  of the  plants  against  bombardment and  raiding   attack        (paras. 68 to 70).            Until detailed information as  to  the location of the dip,  &amp;c,  is        available,  it is impracticable to state which system would be the best or        what the cost would be, though the syphon system is preferred for  reasons        of safety to the traffic normally using the Tunnel.  Whatever system  is        adopted, in this most essential feature of the defensive arrangements,  it        must be capable of letting in a  far greater quantity of water in a given        time than  the drainage pumps can pump out (paras. 71 and 72). (15) All the arrangements for putting the  Tunnel out of service, either tem-        temporarily or permanently,  and all the machinery installations vital to its        use, so far as practicable, to  be duplicated and  put underground; each        installation  being  separate,  guarded at  all times,  and  surrounded by        obstacles; and electric lights to be provided to illuminate the ground in        the vicinity by night. The provision of duplicate entrances to the  Tunnel        is not recommended,  as the Tunnel mouths are not considered vulnerable        to attack,  and the  provision of additional exits from  the Tunnel would        add to the d difficulties of the defence.            In applying this rule,  each case must be considered on its   merits        (para. 73). (16) The pumping-station, which, in the plan annexed  to the Channel Tunnel        Committee&apos;s Report, is situated at the foot of the eastern mole of Dover        Harbour, should be located within the defence area and be adequately        protected against bombardment and raiding attack (para. 74)                                  Sabotage.(17)  The protection against sabotage of all vulnerable points connected with the        working of the Tunnel and of the means for denying it to an enemy would        be under the general supervision of the General Officer  Commanding  and        would be undertaken by the garrison, except in so far as provided  by the        Railway Company.   In examining the designs for all  vulnerable  points        the War Office should consider the provision of suitable obstacles  (para.        76).(18)  The responsibility for preventing unauthorised persons from entering  any        of the.Tunnels from the British end or any part of the premises  would        rest with the Southern Railway Company, but the arrangements  should        be subject to the general supervision of the General Officer Commanding,        who should have the right to supplement the Company&apos;s arrangements by        armed guards and patrols, whenever he deemed necessary (para. 77).(19)  The immediate approaches to the  Tunnel  and the exchange stations to be        surrounded by an  unclimbable wall  or fence  to exclude unauthorised        persons.   The charge for this should  fall on the Railway Companies        concerned (para. 78).(20)  The protection against sabotage of vulnerable points outside the area of the        commands, such as the power-stations, forms part of the standing inquiry        by the Home Defence Committee into the question of the protection of        vulnerable points (para. 79).(21)  Safeguards must be provided against sabotage by enemy agents (Case  &quot; B &quot;)        with the object of wrecking a train in the Tunnel.  In the case of goods        trains,  responsibility for  this would  be entrusted to the Railway Com-        pany&apos;s employes in the marshalling yard, for the reason? given in para-        graph 81.  In the case of  passenger trains, the  only safeguards would be
          the upsetting of the time-tables and a careful examination (subject to the          consent of the Foreign Office) by Customs Officers of passengers&apos; luggage          (paragraph 82).   The  necessary arrangements would  be incorporated          in the War Book (para. 87).   (22)  In order to protect the Tunnel against sabotage it is essential that further          safeguards, as effective as those used  at the English  end,  should be          provided at the continental end.  The question of whether His Majesty&apos;s          Government would permit  such arrangements to be concerted in time of          peace or during the precautionary period involves political considerations          and lies outside the scope of this inquiry (para. 87).   (23)  The above arrangements, while providing some measure of security against          an explosion operated by a time fuse would not be effective against a fuse          set  in motion by air pressure resulting from the rapid descent of the train          to a depth of 360 feet below the  sea.   Against this form of attack the only          safeguard appears to be the search of every package,  which,  in the case          of goods  traffic, would be quite  impossible.   It is recommended trials          should be made with a fuse of this nature when the tunnels are completed          (paras.  84 to 86).                           Miscellaneous Recommendations.   (24)  There  would be some advantages  in generating the whole  of the electrical          supply for the Channel  Tunnel on the English side (para. 91).   (25)  The Home Defence Committee desire to draw the attention of the Committee          of Imperial Defence to the fact that,  in accordance with  the  general          arrangements  for the  manning  of coast  defences  and anti-aircraft          defences in the United Kingdom, the defences of the Tunnel  (except the          mobile force and the guns mounted to  command the entrance)  will be          manned by troops of the Territorial Army who can  be  called up by the          Secretary of State for War.  In view of the reluctance of the Govern-          ment  in 1914  to  call up the special service sections  of the  Territorial          Army,  the  Home Defence Committee  observe  that  it  is of  the first          importance that there should be no hesitation in calling up the Territorial          Forces required  to man the defences of the Tunnel  at  the first hint of          strained relations.   The  provision  of  regular  troops  would add con-          siderably to the expense (para,  92).   (26)  Attention  is drawn to the difficulty  of reconciling the readiness  of  the          defensive arrangements to meet  a sudden attack with the  War Book          principle that  the arrangements for the  &quot; Precautionary Stage &quot; must be          non-provocative and  unobtrusive (para. 93).   (27)  From the point of view of  defence it is preferable  that the Channel Tunnel          should be owned by the  Government, but this conflicts with the views of          the Channel Tunnel Committee of the Economic Advisory Council.  It is          essential that  the Government should have  the power to take over the          Tunnel either in an emergency or permanently, if experience should show          this to be desirable, and  it should be made clear that no undertaking could          be given to pay compensation for  damage (para. 95).   (28)  Future political  or technical  developments  might  involve  an  entire          reconsideration of the defensive arrangements now proposed (para.  96).   (29)  A summary of the proposed gun  and searchlight defences  and  a  very          approximate estimate of their cost is given in para. 97.   A considerable          sum would have to be added to provide for the mechanical means for          putting the Tunnel out of  action and other  safeguards  recommended in          this Memorandum.    100.  The Home Defence Committee have done their best to devise a  practicablejeheme for the protection and defence of  the Channel  Tunnel if it is constructed.f hey are aware that the scheme submitted,  as must be the case in any scheme to meetSuch peculiar conditions, contains elements of weakness, to some of which attentionlas been  drawn  in this Memorandum.   There  is  one  contingency  which  theCommittee have not investigated, because it appears  premature at this present stage,lamely,  the readjustment  of  the personnel  arrangements  in  the event  of  the expeditionary  Force and part  of  the Air forces  having  been drawn  off to some! istant  theatre, as occurred during  the  war  in South Africa,  when  only  a few
thousand regular troops were left in Great Britain.   That is a contingency whichwould have to be considered before the Channel Tunnel was completed.  There are,however, some additional safeguards which lie outside the strict interpretation of theCommittee&apos;s  Terms of Reference, to which they  desire to draw attention.  Forexample, the  provision of a good system of Intelligence in order to provide  theearliest possible warning of danger;  plans for prompt counter-attack against anenemy who has succeeded in effecting a lodgment in the Tunnel bridgehead, includingair attack against the Tunnel workings and communications on the Continental sideof the Channel.     Finally,  much  depends upon a proper allocation of responsibility for puttingin  operation  the  various  measures. If this is provided, the success  of any arrangements for the defence of the Tunnel will turn, in the last resort, on  the personal factor and on the right decisions being taken promptly by the right persons at the right moment.  Any failure in this respect might invalidate the whole plan,                                   Signed on behalf of the Committee,                                             M. P. A.

[This Document is the  Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.].  Printed for the Committee  of Imperial Defence.  January 1929.COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.   THE  CHANNEL  TUNNEL.(Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 129-A.)            SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS PROCEEDINGS.(Prepared by the Secretary,  Committee of Imperial Defence.)    1.   AS the question of the Channel Tunnel has been under frequent and close examination for  over fifty years, it is thought that a summary  of the results of previous enquiries may be of value to the Committee of Imperial Defence at thepresent time.    2.  As regards the historical aspects of the project, it appears that the proposal for a  Channel Tunnel is over one hundred and twenty years old.  In 1802 a French raining engineer, M. Mathieu, presented to Napoleon a scheme for a submarine tunnel, which Avas supported by Charles James Fox.  A similar proposal by M. Thome de Gamond in 1859 for a tunnel from Eastware Bay to Cap Grisnez was  approved by Brunei,  Locke  and  Robert  Stephenson.   Tunnels  were  also  suggested  by J. F.  Smith,  in 1861, and later by Thomas Payne and others.  The idea was again prominently brought forward in 1867, when a definite scheme was laid before the Emperor of  the French by an Anglo-French  Committee.  In  1870 the French Government enquired whether the British  Government would support the  scheme, and in 1872 the Foreign Office, on the advice of the Board of Trade, informed our Ambassador in Paris that, while opposed to the establishment of any monopoly, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be well satisfied to hear  that the British and French railway systems were likely to be connected by means of a tunnel.  In 1874 a French Committee having  reported in favour of the granting of a contingent concession, Her Majesty&apos;s Government stated that they had no objection  to the scheme, and acquiesced  generally in the French Committee&apos;s report.  In  1875 Bills facilitating preliminary operation were passed by the British and French Legislatures.  On the 2nd August, 1880,  as no arrangement had  been come to with an authorized British company, the concession granted to the French promoters lapsed, and an extension of three years was applied  for.  In the  same year  the  South-Eastern Railway Company  brought  out a  rival scheme  to that  of the  original Channel  Tunnel Company, and proceeded to make experiments by sinking shafts between Folkestone and Dover.    3. At this stage military objections were raised, and an Inter-Departmental Committee, representing the  Admiralty, War Office,  and  Board  of  Trade,  was appointed to  consider the military aspects  of the question.   The War Office repre-sentatives, Sir Garnet WTolseley and Sir John Adye, differed in their views, and theCommittee reported that it was desirable to take further military and naval evidence.Accordingly, on the 23rd February, 1882, the Secretary of State for War appointedSECRET.164-A.Early History of the Channel Tunnel Scheme.[18755]B
a Special Committee, consisting of six military officers and three civilians,  to con-sider the practicability of closing the submarine tunnel in the event of war.  On the17th May of the same year this Committee made various proposals  for closing thetunnel, but concluded their report with the statement:          &quot; That even the most comprehensive and complete arrangements which can     be devised could not be relied upon in every contingency.&quot;     4.  On the  17th April, 1883, the general question as to whether sanction shouldbe given to the Tunnel project was referred to a Select Committee of  both Houses  ofParliament, presided over by Lord Lansdowne. The Committee could not agree upona form of report, but the majority considered Parliamentary sanction should not  begiven.  The  Select  Committee  had before them  a memorandum  by  Sir  GarnetWolseley, dated the 16th June, 1882, which had originally been communicated to theDepartmental Committee referred to above and appointed on the 22nd August,  1881,and which had  also been submitted to the Scientific Committee assembled on the27th February, 1882, to decide upon the best means that could be provided to ensurethe destruction  of a tunnel under  the English Channel, supposing permission were granted for  such an  undertaking.   This memorandum  presented  an  exhaustivereview of the whole question, and in it Sir Garnet Wolseley stated that the report  ofthe Scientific Committee had greatly strengthened his conviction that the hour  whenthe Tunnel is sanctioned will  be for England a most disastrous one.  (Sir GarnetWolseley&apos;s report was reprinted as C.I.D. Paper 61-.4.)   In consequence  of this opinion, Government opposition to the Tunnel was consistently offered, and successiveBills or motions  introduced in  1883, 1884, 1885, 1886, 1887, 1889, 1890, 1891,  1892,1893 and  1894 were either  defeated or withdrawn.   The last division was taken onthe 5th June, 1890, when the Bill was rejected by  234 votes to 153.   Sir HenryCampbell-Bannerman,  Mr.  Asquith,  Mr.  Lloyd  George  and Lord Morley, who supported the Bill on  that occasion, were  all subsequently associated with the rejection of the project by the  Committee of Imperial Defence in 1907 and (with theexception  of Sir Flenry Campbell-Bannerman,  who had  died  in 1908)  again   inJuly 1914.                          Lord Wolseley&apos;s Objections.    5.  Lord Wolseley&apos;s objections to the Channel Tunnel project  exercised   sofar-reaching  an  influence that  they are worth  referring  to.  His  Memorandum,which deals with every aspect  of the question in great detail, takes up 23 pages offoolscap print (C.I.D. Paper 61-A), but he precedes it with his own summary, whichis as follows :      &quot;Summary  of Objections to the Channel Project.        &apos;&apos; That  by the  construction of  a tunnel between England and France you    destroy the  great defence  of the country, upon which we have hitherto entirely    depended; that is,  you destroy the value of the Channel.  You  completely put    out of action the use of the fleet, which has always been hitherto our first line    of defence.   You  join us on  to the continent,  and we must, in my opinion,    when so  joined on  to the continent, sooner  or  later,  if  we wish to remain  an    independent people, become like  the  continental nations a military  Power.     Although a  soldier, I  should be very  sorry indeed to see this  country bowed     down beneath the weight  of the  burdens which all continental nations   at     present suffer  from owing  to universal military service, and  also from the    enormous expense  attendant  upon  those great standing armies which  they    keep up.  As regards the direct danger which I dread, it is this, that, were the    Tunnel  once  constructed,  you would  have between  England  and France  a    line of  communication which, speaking  in a military sense,  is  the  most     indestructible in the world, for, whatever line of communication you establish    between  your base of operations and your army in the front, in any campaign     or in  any possible country, that line of communication,  when above ground,  is     liable to be  attacked.  It has to be protected by large forces on its flanks,  often    by great armies; but this Tunnel  bored down beneath  the sea  can neither  be     touched by  an army nor  by a navy unless you  destroy  it before  war actually     comes upon  you, which I think would be  a very unlikely event.  Looking  to     the nature  of our laws,  and  our customs,  and  our entire unpreparedness for    war, and the instinct which underlies all our feelings in England against war,
a Special Committee, consisting of six military officers and three civilians,  to con-isider the practicability of closing the submarine tunnel in the event of war.  On the!17th May of the  same year this Committee made various proposals  for closing the!tunnel, but concluded their report with the statement:          &quot; That even the most comprehensive and complete arrangements which can     be devised could not be relied upon in every contingency.&quot;     4.  On the 17th April, 1883, the general question as to whether sanction shouldbe given to the Tunnel project was referred to a Select Committee of  both Houses ofParliament, presided over by Lord Lansdowne. The Committee could not agree upona form of report,  but the majority considered Parliamentary sanction should not begiven.  The  Select  Committee  had before them  a memorandum by  Sir  GarnetWolseley, dated the 16th June, 1882, which had originally been communicated to theDepartmental Committee referred to above  and appointed on the 22nd August,  1881,and which had also been  submitted to the Scientific Committee assembled on the27th February, 1882, to decide upon the best means that could be provided to ensurethe destruction of a tunnel under  the English Channel, supposing permission were granted for  such an  undertaking.   This  memorandum  presented  an  exhaustivereview of the whole question, and in it Sir Garnet Wolseley stated that the report ofthe Scientific Committee had greatly strengthened his conviction that the hour  whenthe Tunnel is sanctioned will  be for England a most disastrous one.  (Sir GarnetWolseley&apos;s report was reprinted as C.I.D.  Paper 61-4.)   In  consequence of this opinion, Government opposition to the Tunnel was consistently offered, and successiveBills or motions introduced in  1883, 1884, 1885, 1886, 1887,  1889, 1890,  1891,  1892,1893 and  1894 were either defeated or withdrawn.   The last division was taken onthe 5th June, 1890, when  the Bill was rejected by  234 votes  to  153.   Sir HenryCampbell-Bannerman,  Mr. Asquith,  Mr.   Lloyd  George  and Lord Morley,  who supported the Bill on that occasion, were all subsequently  associated with the rejection of the project by the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1907 and (with theexception  of Sir  Henrv Campbell-Bannerman,  who had  died  in 1908)  again  inJuly 1914.                          Lord Wolseley&apos;s Objections.    5.  Lord Wolseley&apos;s objections to the Channel Tunnel project exercised  sofar-reaching  an influence  that  they are worth referring  to.  His  Memorandum,which deals with  every aspect  of the question in great detail, takes up 23 pages offoolscap print (C.I.D. Paper 61-A), but he  precedes it with his own summary, whichis as follows :      &quot;Summary of Objections to the Channel Project.        &apos;&apos; That by the construction of a tunnel between England and  France you    destroy the great defence of the country, upon which we have hitherto entirely    depended; that is, you destroy the value  of the  Channel.  You  completely put    out of action the use of the fleet, which has always been hitherto our first line    of defence.   You  join us  on  to the continent,  and we must, in my opinion,    when so  joined  on to  the  continent, sooner or later, if we wish to remain  an    independent  people,  become like  the  continental nations a military  Power.     Although a soldier, I should be very  sorry indeed to  see this  country bowed     down beneath the weight  of the  burdens which all  continental nations  at     present suffer  from owing to universal  military service,  and  also  from the    enormous expense attendant  upon  those great standing  armies which  they    keep up.  As regards the direct danger which I dread,  it is this, that, were the    Tunnel  once   constructed,  you would   have between England  and France  a    line of  communication which, speaking in a military  sense, is&apos; the  most     indestructible in the world, for, whatever line of communication you establish    between  your base of operations and your army in the front, in any campaign     or in  any possible country, that line of communication, when above ground, is     liable to be attacked.  It has to be protected by large forces on its flanks,  often    by great armies; but  this Tunnel bored  down beneath the sea  can neither be    touched  by an army nor by a navy unless you  destroy  it  before war actually     comes upon you, which I  think would be a  very unlikely event.   Looking to     the nature of our laws, and  our customs, and  our entire unpreparedness for    war, and the instinct which underlies  all  our feelings in England against war,
    which  prompts us to believe that war is almost an impossibility,  I do not    believe that we should ever be so prepared beforehand for an emergency as  to    have the Tunnel destroyed in time  to ward off  the danger which I foresee.    That danger is briefly this, that the French, or whoever for the time being held    the Calais end of the Tunnel, could by a  coup de  main seize  our end of it, and    the very moment they had done so, Dover  would become a tete du pont for their.    army, from which they could issue forth with any large army  they chose to bring-    through the  Tunnel.  In other words, from that moment we should cease to be an    independent Power, as we have no army in England, nor could we raise an army    that would have the slightest possible chance, under any circumstances whatever,    short of the direct interposition of God Almighty, of enabling us to withstand    a French  army of the character  that would be poured into the country.  As    regards the  seizing of the Tunnel by a coup de main, it is, in my opinion, a    very simple operation, provided it  be done without any previous warning  or    intimation  whatever by those  who wish  to invade  the country.&quot;    (C.I.D.    Paper 61-A.)                            The Enquiry in 1906-7.    6.   The next attempt to induce His Majesty&apos;s Government to give its consent tothe Channel Tunnel Company to resume work was  made  in 1906,  when  a newChannel Tunnel  Bill  was introduced, and, early in the following  year, was referred by the  Prime Minister to the Committee of Imperial Defence.  The question was accordingly reviewed for the first time by that Committee at their 96th Meeting,held on the 28th February, 1907, when  the  strategic aspects of the  project were discussed.   The Board  of  Trade  furnished  to the  Committee  a memorandum(C.I.D. Paper 40-A) dealing with  the  economic aspects.  The Secretary  to theCommittee of Imperial Defence (Sir George Clarke, now Lord Sydenham) circulated a Memorandum (C.I.D. Paper 37-A). in support of the proposal.  The views of theAdmiralty are contained in a Memorandum dated January 1907 (C.I.D Paper 68-A),the last six paragraphs of which are here reproduced :         &quot; 14.  From the point of view of the defence of the shores of Great Britain,    both naval and military, it would appear  that the construction of the Tunnel    would add to our responsibilities and would swell the estimates for the defensive    forces  of this  country, while it  would introduce,  without a doubt, a possible    source of danger from raid, invasion, or treachery.        15. As  a set-off  to this,  we  have only increased facilities for  inter-    communication with  the continent, and for the transit of goods and passengers.        16. The possible gain under these headings is not an equivalent compensa-    tion for the  risk we should run by giving up the advantages  of the sea frontier    we now possess and creating a means of approach by land to  our shores, thereby    bringing upon ourselves to some extent the obligations inseparable from a land    frontier obligations from which we  are at present free.        17. The defence of the Channel and the securing of the United Kingdom    from invasion is,  and has been for centuries,  the task of  the navy.   If the    Channel Tunnel  should be made, the navy can no  longer be held responsible for    this task; the responsibility  will be divided, but the  navy  could  not on that    account be reduced in the smallest degree.        18. The construction of the Tunnel would,  therefore,  involve  divided    responsibility, increased  danger, and diminished  security.        19. When the above  are weighed in the balance against possible commercial    gain,  in the opinion of the Admiralty the balance is altogether  in  favour  of    non-interference with the natural sea frontier, which has been one of the main    factors in the creation and maintenance of the British Empire.&quot;The detailed views of the General Staff were not placed on record on this occasion,but it is clear from the conclusion quoted below that  they were of  an adverse nature.    7.   The subject was discussed at the 96th  Meeting of the Committee of ImperialDefence on the 28th February, 1907, the Minutes of which were as follows: -        &quot;The Prime Minister (Sir  Henry Campbell-Bannerman) considered that    our general policy with reference to the Tunnel should be based on the  decisions    as to its naval and military aspects.  He understood  that both the Admiralty    and the General Staff were opposed to the construction of  the  Tunnel.  The    economic side of the question was not a matter for discussion by the Committee.&apos;&apos;      [18755]         -                                              B 2
                                  Conclusion.         &quot; The Committee note that the Admiralty and the General Staff are opposed    to the construction of the Tunnel.&quot;    8. , The decision  of  His Majesty&apos;s Government  was  communicated to bothHouses of Parliament  on the 21st March, 1907, when  the following statement wasmade in the House of Commons by the  Prime Minister  (Sir  Henry  Campbell-Bannerman) : 1         &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government fully recognise the deep concern felt in this    matter, and have  no  other  desire than  to  take  the House fully  into  their    confidence, even in anticipation of the early stages of the Bill.   Briefly,  I may    say that our view of the public interest leads us to be opposed to this project of    a  tunnel.   Even supposing the military dangers involved were  to  be  amply    guarded against,  there would exist  throughout  the  country  a feeling of    insecurity which might lead to a constant demand for increased  expenditure,    naval and military, and a continual risk  of unrest and possibly alarm, which,    however unfounded, would be most injurious in its effect, whether political or    commercial.  On the other hand, there has not been disclosed any such prospect    of advantage to the trade and industries of the country as would compensate for    those evils.  As to the personal convenience of passengers and the transit of light    articles, it seems well that further consideration should be given to other means    of conveyance,  such as are used in the ferries across great channels of the sea    in other parts  of the world.  These considerations lead us, while rejoicing in    anything that facilitates the communication with  our neighbours, to view this    project with disfavour.&quot;    Mr.  Balfour, speaking on behalf of the Opposition,  expressed &quot;great satisfac-tion at the declaration  of policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government have just made.&quot;                             The Enquiry in 1914.    9.  On the 5th August,  1913,  a deputation, representing  a  committee  ofmembers of the  House of Commons in favour of the  construction of the ChannelTunnel, submitted to the Prime Minister a memorial on the subject, and in Octoberof the same year  the  Prime Minister  (Mr.  Asquith)  directed  the  Committee  ofImperial Defence to reconsider the strategical aspects of the  Tunnel.    10.   The question was  discussed by the Committee at  three meetings the125th  (the  3rd  March, 1914),  the 126th  (the  14th  May,  1914)  and  the  128th (the 14th July,  1914).   The proceedings of the Committee on  these occasions revealconsiderable differences of opinion.    11.   Thus,  the Admiralty began by circulating the following note,  dated the27th February,  1914, signed by  Sir Henry Jackson, the Chief of the Staff:          &quot;The Admiralty consider it indispensable that a  Channel Tunnel  should    be capable of being flooded or otherwise effectually cut at  any time by the Navy    through the gunfire or other action  of warships without military  assistance,    even though both  ends of the Tunnel are in the hands  of the enemy.  It is for    the promoters  of the scheme and their engineers to satisfy this vital  condition.    If  they are able  to  do so,  the project offers  various important  strategic    advantages, including  a greater assurance for our  food  supply.  If  they    cannot do so, the Admiralty would be compelled to oppose the scheme.&quot;    12.   A few weeks  later the  Admiralty recirculated  their Memorandum  ofJanuary 1907 (see  above, paragraph 6),  but with a covering note to the  effect thatthey still adhered to the note quoted above in paragraph 11. Later on, the FirstLord of the Admiralty (Mr. Churchill) circulated a note elaborating  the idea thatthe Tunnel should  be capable of destruction  from  the sea, suggesting  that  itshould be brought to the surface of the ocean not less than a quarter of a mile fromthe shore, and that the railway should run from the Tunnel-mouth to the shore ona bridge.   There were further  precautions,  such  as  running the line  along thecoast for some  distance,  fitting it with drawbridges, flooding arrangements, &amp;c. (As will appear  later  (paragraph 23),  these proposals,  which  conditioned the
 Admiralty support to the project for the Tunnel in 1914, were  objected to by the Home Ports Defence Committee after the war in 1920.)     13.  The  General Staff  were  opposed to  the   scheme  for  the  following  easons:          &quot;The construction  of a  Tunnel between  England  and Trance will add     something to the  cost  and will  add much to the anxiety of the military and     naval authorities who are responsible for the defence of this country.         The disadvantages,  serious  as they are, may be outweighed by the fact     of the increased facilities gained by the transport  of our troops and stores to     the continent of Europe, if His  Majesty&apos;s  Government had  such an operation     in view.         In  short, from a purely military  point  of  view,  if our  troops  are  to     become  engaged in a European  war fighting alongside  the  French, the more     tunnels  we possess between  this country  and France the better;  if,  on  the     other  hand, no  such operations are  in contemplation,  then we  shall  be  far     better off without any Tunnel at  all.         As  Colonel Seely said  at  the 125th meeting of the Committee of Imperial     Defence on the 3rd March, 1914,  &apos; only if it could be assumed that the two     countries  (England  and France)  were on such  intimate terms  that in  the     event  of war they could  be regarded as one nation would  there be a sound     reason for making the Tunnel.&apos;         On the other  hand,  even  if  we assume that these conditions now prevail,     there is, of course, no certainty  as to how long they may continue  to prevail.     The question is,  therefore,  ought we to  saddle ourselves permanently with  the     increased  military responsibilities  and  anxieties involved  by the  construction     of a Tunnel merely for  the sake of  the advantage to be derived from one set of     conditions  alone,  which, in  the  nature of  things, is liable  to  undergo a     complete change at any moment?        In  the  opinion  of  the General  Staff  the answer  is  in  the  negative.&quot;     (C.I.D.  Paper 69-A.)     14.  Sir John French,* however, did not agree with the General Staff.   his view is stated  briefly  in the following  extract  from  a Memorandum  which hecirculated at the time:         &quot;8. To put  the matter briefly  : I hold  that the Straits of Dover, regarded     as a military obstacle to the invasion of this country, will in the not far-distant    future altogether lose  their  maritime  character,   and the  problem of  their     successful  passage  by  an invading  force  will  present  features  somewhat     resembling  those  involving the  attack  and defence of great  river lines or    operations on the great lakes in a war between Canada and the United  States.        The main object to be attained in trying to secure the passage  of a great    river line is to  gain possession of  the  opposite bank and establish a strong    bridge-head.        In accordance with  the  views  enunciated in  this paper,  I apply  the    same principle to the Straits of Dover, and hold that the only reliable defence    against a powerful attack by hostile aircraft and submarines in vastly superior    numbers is to possess  a  strong  bridge-head on  the French  coast with  an    effective  means of passing and repassing across the Straits, which would only    be secured  by the projected Channel Tunnel.&quot;  (C.I.D. 77-A.)    15.  Lord  Kitchener was opposed to the scheme.  He strongly objected to anytunnel  unless it could be shown that its  construction  was vital to the country.He thought that if it  could be proved that in time of war the Tunnel offered a safeavenue for  the supplies of food and raw material, and that these  supplies could bebrought through French ports and over French railways to  the  Tunnel, then the project  might be one to  consider; but he  regarded  it as  unthinkable  that any private  company, for its own  ends, should be allowed to embark on an  enterprisewhich in any way endangered the position of this country.  In his  view, it would put us  in the position of a continental nation with a land frontier,  and we  shouldbe faced with all the disadvantages which land frontiers entailed.  He  felt that   * It has been stated recently in a letter to the &quot; Times &quot; that Lord French revised his view as a result3f his experience in the war (see Appendix III).
the Tunnel would  have to be totally destroyed if  destroyed at all, because anypartial destruction could  be  repaired.  He envisaged  conditions obtaining fortyyears hence, when many developments might  have taken.place in naval warfare,and. the command of the sea might depend upon other means than battleships.    16.   The Board of Trade examined the question at great length,  and arrivedat conclusions rather adverse to the Tunnel (C.I.D. Paper No. 64-Aj.  They thoughtthat the construction of a Channel Tunnel       would probably have but  little effect on the foreign  trade of this country.    Indeed the question of passenger traffic is alone important, and by it the Tunnel    scheme as a commercial enterprise must  stand or fall. ...&quot;   Whilst  the    possibility of reaching this  country without  incurring  the  discomforts of the    Channel crossing would no doubt attract  a number of foreign visitors who  do    not now cross the Channel, it is to be remembered that the route thus provided    would afford only an  expensive mode of travel, and  it  would still  leave this    country and France separated by 30 miles of tunnel.  For passengers the saving    of time involved would be small, though business men would find it convenient    to  accomplish the  journey  between  London  and Paris  by  night  without    interruption.&apos;&apos;    The main increase in trade  was considered likely to  take place in perishableproduce and fragile articles (pottery and glass), which might compete more severelyon the British market with British manufactures.  The  Board of Trade consideredthat the amount of shipping likely to be displaced by the Tunnel was insignificant,and that c&apos; financially there is serious reason to doubt whether the scheme could be successful.  It is improbable that the  Tunnel could be utilised effectively for thepurpose of bringing into the country any large supplies of food and raw materials intime of war.&apos;&apos;    17.   The Prime Minister  (Mr.  Asquith) in summing up the discussion quotedwhat  Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman had  said in 1907, namely:          &apos;&apos; Even  supposing  the  military  dangers   involved  were  to be amply-    provided against, there would exist through the country a feeling of insecurity    which might lead to a constant demand for increased expenditure, naval and    military,  and a continual risk  of unrest and  possible alarm, which,  however    unfounded, would  be most injurious  in its  effects,   whether  political  or    commercial.&quot;    No one, said Mr. Asquith, had been able to refute that dictum.  He pointedout that  the  advocates  of the  project wanted the Tunnel to be indestructible,whereas the First Lord  of  the Admiralty&apos;s  condition  was  that it should  bedestructible.    18.  The Conclusion of the Committee was as follows :          &apos;&apos; The Committee are of opinion that the strategical conditions  have not    so altered  as to justify a reversal of the Conclusion reached by His Majesty&apos;s    Government in 1907.&quot;    The First  Lord  (Mr.  Churchill) and  the First Sea Lord  (Prince  Louis ofBattenberg) expressed their dissent,  giving as their reason  the statement quoted above in paragraphs 11  and 12,  namely,  that  complete security could be obtained by exposing the exits of the Tunnel  to sea-power, conditions  which, after the war,were rejected.  Sir John French also dissented*; but the Second Sea Lord (Sir JohnJellicoe),  the  Chief of the Staff  Designate (Admiral- Sir  Frederick Sturdee),  theChief  of the Imperial General Staff (General Douglas) and the Director of MilitaryOperations (General Henry Wilson), as well as Lord Fisher and  Lord Nicholson,were among the parties to the Conclusion.    Within a few days  of  the above  Conclusion  being  reached,  by the Committeeof Imperial Defence the war clouds  had gathered.   The public mind was occupied with other events, and no announcement was made in Parliament.  It was not untilthe 26th  October,  1916,  that Mr.  Asquith made  that Conclusion  public  whenreplying to  a deputation from a House  of Commons  Committee on the ChannelTunnel.   * It has been  stated recently in a letter to the &quot; Times &quot; that, Lord French revised his view as a resultof his experience in the war (see Appendix III).
                    The Channel Tunnel during the War.    19.  The question of the Channel Tunnel was raised once again by Mr. Fell,[he Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee, during the War.  Consultation withihe Departments produced no change of view, and naturally the general desire wasthat the question should be  postponed  until after the War.   Mr. Asquith  received Deputation in October 1916, and seems to have been friendly but non-committal.                           The Enquiry of 1919-20.    20.  The subject of the  Channel  Tunnel  was again brought forward by the hannel Tunnel Committee  in 1919.  The subject was considered in a preliminary ay by the Cabinet on the  11th November, 1919.  The  Conclusion  recorded  is asfollows :         &quot; Subject to there being no danger as to the security of the country, a point    on which the view was expressed that further technical enquiry  was necessary,    the general trend of opinion in the Cabinet was in favour of not opposing the    construction of a Channel Tunnel.&quot; (Cabinet 5 (19),  Conclusion 4.)That was the general line taken  by Mr. Lloyd George, who received a deputation onthe subject on the following day, an account of which is  given in the Memorandumsent to the Prime  Minister  by the Channel  Tunnel Committee.   (C.I.D. Paper121-A, p. 9.)    21.  The technical enquiry which the  Cabinet had considered  necessary wasbegun  by the Home Ports Defence Committee  (since re-named &apos;&apos; The  Home DefenceCommittee &apos;&apos;), which was asked  to advise not on the general question as to whetherthe construction of a Tunnel  was desirable or not, but as to what conditions were necessary from a naval, military and air point of view to ensure the  security of theexit of the Tunnel if it were built.    22.  The Memorandum by the Home Ports Defence Committee deals exhaustivelywith the question  referred to it (C.I.D.  Paper 92-A).  The Conclusions of theCommittee are as follows :          &quot;21.  To summarise, the Home Ports Defence  Committee are of opinion    that the following conditions should be complied with :         (a.) The scale  and forms of Defence (Naval, Military and Air)  must be              such as to deal effectively with a raiding attack by such force as may              from time to  time be considered possible, and also other forms of&apos; -              attack to which  the British end of a Tunnel,  the Tunnel works and              the  Tunnel itself may be exposed, i.e.:               (1.)  Bombardment from the sea or from the French or  Belgian coasts,                    or bombing by aircraft;              (2.)  Surprise attacks carried, out by small raiding  parties landed                    from the sea or from aircraft;              (3.)  Sabotage;              (4.)  Attempts to destroy the Tunnel by means of explosive charges                    placed on the bed of the Channel or by boring;              (5.)  Attempts by  secret  agents  to place  explosive charges  with                    clockwork mechanism in trains passing through the Tunnel.        (&amp;.) Means to be provided for putting the Tunnel out of service temporarily,              or permanently, or both, as desired :                (i.)  Permanent Flooding. Sluices to admit the sea and arrangements                    for quickly placing explosive charges  in a chamber midwajr                    between the sea and the top of the Tunnel have been suggested,                    but until the actual plans of the Tunnel are available, and the                    question can be  considered as an engineering proposition, no                    final decision as to the precise method of permanently flooding                    the Tunnel can  be  arrived at.  Some effective means must,                    however, be provided for flooding the whole of the Tunnel in                    the last emergency, and in any case chambers for  explosive                    charges must be  provided.
                (ii.)  Temporary Flooding. A  &apos; dip &apos;  in the Tunnel to be constructed                       within three miles of  the British coast, and arrangements to                       be made for flooding this  &apos; dip &apos;  either from the sea or from                       a reservoir.                        .          (c.) All the arrangements  for putting the  Tunnel out of service, either                temporarily or permanently, and all the machinery installations vital                to its use to be duplicated and put so far as practicable underground;                each installation being separate, guarded at all times, and surrounded                by obstacles;  and electric lights  to  be provided to illuminate  the                ground in the vicinity by night.          (d.) The Tunnel to be  constructed at such depth below the bed of the  sea                as will ensure its immunity from damage by explosives placed on the                bottom of the sea.                                 .,          (e.) The entrance of the Tunnel on the British side to be :                   (i.) Duplicated.                    i                 (ii.) So situated and constructed as  to render its  destruction from                      the sea or from the land on the opposite  side of the Straits                      extremely improbable.                (iii.) So far as  practicable away  from the coast and hidden from                      observation.                (iv.) Protected by obstacles as well as  by armed troops.          (/.) Some guns to be so mounted as to be capable of firing on the Tunnel                entrances.          (g.) Important yards and junctions to be sited well inland;  and one or                more yards to be constructed  in preference to one large one, viz., one                for up traffic, one for down traffic, and one for locomotives.          (h.) An obstacle and a blockhouse in rear of it to be provided at the English                end of the  Tunnel; and other  simple methods (such as engineering                science  may devise)  for temporarily  preventing, if necessary, the                progress of trains in the Tunnel to be  provided, e.g., taking up or                short-circuiting  rails,  impassable  ditch or drawbridge  near the                British exit and  under gun fire.          (i.) The power station to be sited on the English side.          (j.) Arrangements to be made for the scrutiny, in times of strained relations.                of all packages and luggage  before loading on trains about to pass                through the Tunnel;  and also for an examining  post within the                British end of the Tunnel, where trains could be stopped.         22. As regards the responsibility for putting into action any means for     putting the Tunnel out of service, the Committee are of opinion  that it is of vital     importance that this  responsibility should  be  clearly defined.   This  would be     simplified if the Tunnel were Government-owned.         23. The Committee are unable at this juncture to make any recommenda-     tions further to&apos; those enumerated above  for securing the safety of the United     Kingdom against the use of the Tunnel for  invasion purposes, and  for safe-     guarding the Tunnel itself against being put out of service.  They are of opinion     that  the resources of engineering science may devise other methods, and, if so.     that  these should be carefully considered and adopted if found effective.         24. Whilst they are of opinion that  the mechanical  devices outlined above     would ensure the security of the Tunnel in theory, they recognise that in practice     the personal factor will always introduce a certain element of danger.         They accordingly desire to lay stress on the fact that the ultimate security     against an enemy in occupation of the continental end of the Tunnel being able     to use it for invasion purposes rests on the fundamental condition of  its being     possible to ensure that the British end should not be seized by  a raiding  force.     Only armed force can  absolutely  secure this, and it is consequently essential to     provide for the garrisoning at all times in the vicinity of the Tunnel entrance of     a mobile force sufficient to deal successfully with a raiding attack, the strength     of which will have to be kept  constantly under review.&quot;     23.  There  are two points in the Report of the Committee to  which reference should perhaps be made : 
     First, the  Committee  rejected the  proposals on  which  the  Admiralty  had insisted in 1914 for enabling the Tunnel to be put out of action by our fleet by the construction of  a lighthouse some way out in the Channel, the destruction of which would flood the Tunnel, and by bringing  the line  at the point of emergence within range of the guns of our fleet.     The reason for the rejection of these proposals was that, owing to the experience of the war, it was thought these safeguards might be destroyed by an enemy, whether by submarine or aircraft attack, and that the Tunnel might be flooded at a time when we wished to use it ourselves..  Thus the measures which  had been regarded by the Admiralty(a^jndfspensable  in 1914 were already out of date in 1920.     24.   The second  point to which  attention is directed is that,  although the expenditure  involved  in most of the  recommendations  of the  Committee would presumably be borne by the Company^ which constructed the Tunnel, the additional garrison  and defences of  Dover involved in recommendations (a) and (/) would presumably have to be borne by the State unless  paid  for  by a special  tax on the Tunnel traffic.   If the State itself built the Tunnel, presumably the  cost of the garrison  and defences would  be  a first charge  on  any profits  earned from  its operation.     25.   In  addition  to the report  by  the  Home  Ports Defence Committee,  a number of departmental Memoranda were prepared in 1919-20, and these will now be summarised.     26.   The Admiralty in 1920  advised  that,  &quot;subject  to the conditions for security enumerated in  H.P.D.C. Memorandum  No. 40-M (C.I.D.  Paper 92-A) being adopted, the Admiralty see no objection to the scheme.&quot;     27.  The Air Council expressed the opinion  : &quot; That the aerial interests of this country  would  not  be  affected  either  favourably or  otherwise  by the  construction of a Channel Tunnel.&quot;   (C.I.D.  Paper 95-A.)     28.  The Secretary of State for War (Mr. Churchill) forwarded two Memoranda by the General Staff signed by Field-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson.  The first dealt with the probable effect which the existence  of  a Channel Tunnel would have had in the recent war.   Sir Henry Wilson found  it difficult to say what would have been the general effect had the Channel Tunnel been in existence  in 1914.  He had no doubt, however, that as regards mobilisation  there would have been a gain  of  at  least forty-eight hours in the Expeditionary  Force  reaching  the French coast if the Channel Tunnel had  existed.   From  the  enemy&apos;s  point  of  view he  considered that the  Channel  Tunnel  would have formed  a strategic objective  of the first importance.    The  Germans might have concentrated  their initial effort  on the capture and occupation of Calais and the Tunnel mouth, and probably Boulogne, prior to an  advance on  Paris.   Thus the Tunnel would have acted as a magnet drawing the  enemy in a direction which would have proved most fatal to  the Allies.  The British, in  the Field-Marshals view, would  hardly have consented to any  operation which left the Tunnel  mouth  uncovered.   Unless the  French had been willing  to  modify their plans so as to ensure  that the  left of  their forces always kept in touch with our troops  instead of our right keeping in  touch with their left (a fundamentally different conception),  the result would have been that the Expeditionary Force would  have been  separated from  the French army.  If the opening weeks of the campaign had turned out as unfortunately as they  actually did in&quot; 1914 we should have run a grave risk  of losing the greater  part of  the Expeditionary Force and the exit of the Channel  Tunnel as well.  &apos;&apos; With a force of only  six Divisions under the conditions given and under the opening moves of the campaign in 1914  as they actually took place, it is not too much to say that the existence  of the Tunnel in  that year  would  have lost us the campaign.  It is probable, however, that the  French would have  realised in advance the enormous importance of  the  Channel Tunnel,  and would  have remodelled their plan  of campaign accordingly.&quot;   The  late  Field-Marshal&apos;s  views  appear to  be fairlysummed up in the following paragraph ::          &quot;In general,  therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the existence  of    the Channel Tunnel would have eliminated  the  delay  in mobilisation  caused    by the uncertainty in the minds of the Government, the subsequent speed  of      [18755]                                                         c
    concentration would have  been  increased by  two or three days,  and the first    battles of  the campaign would  have been fought when the Allied forces had    been  fully concentrated in Belgium,  and consequently in  circumstances less    unfavourable than actually occurred in 1914.  Had the battle ended decidedly    in our favour the whole strategy, and possibly the duration, of the campaign    would have been altered, whilst if it  had been indecisive  there is some reason    for supposing that the end of 1914 would have found the  Allies holding a line    considerably in  advance of the one actually occupied, and the resources of the    areas which include coal and iron products from Bruay to  Charleroi would have    accrued to the Allies instead of to the Germans.  If, however, the Allies had    suffered a  decisive defeat,  there is every reason to suppose that the  British    Army would either have been driven past the exits of the Tunnel and left the    enemy established at  Calais  and Boulogne,  or that the  British and  French    Armies would  have  retreated  in  different  directions.    In either  case it  is    difficult to see how we could have escaped disaster.&quot;    29.   In a  second Memorandum, containing  notes  on the  military advantages and  disadvantages  of  the  Channel  Tunnel, Field-Marshal  Sir  Henry  Wilsonreached the following conclusions :      &quot; (i.)  Assuming  France to be  friendly, the  Tunnel  is  highly desirable  on            economic grounds as affecting the  development  and maintenance  of            military forces in war.     (ii.)  If our policy is irrevocably bound to the defence of  France  and Belgium,            it is essential on military grounds.     (iii.)  Such a policy  entails the maintenance  of  military  forces  on a scale             commensurate with  that of  our potential enemies,  both as regards             numbers and  degree  of  readiness.   It  further  requires  a firm            determination on  the  part  of  the Government to  mobilise  at  the            same time as our Allies and enemies.     (iv.)  The  Tunnel contains  an  element of  danger,  however  perfect  the            security  arrangements,  owing  to   the   personal  factor.    These             dangers increase by so much  as our  standard of military preparedness             falls, whilst the  military advantages of  the Tunnel correspondingly            decrease.     (v.)  Unless we are prepared to  intervene on the  continent on  a continental            scale,  the military advantages  of  the Tunnel do not  outweigh the            military  disadvantages;  that is to  say, for an  offensive war  on the            continent we want the Tunnel,  but  for a defensive  war in England            we do not.     (vi.)  The  maintenance  of  the Tunnel cannot be  absolutely  guaranteed, and            therefore it  is  essential  to have a  second (and  purely  sea) base  at            the same time.    (vii.)  Government ownership of  the Tunnel,  if  constructed,  is  strongly             advocated, as tending to facilitate  the taking of measures either for            its security or destruction.&quot;  (C.I.D. Paper 98-A.)    30.  Mr. Churchill in his  covering note,  commented as follows on the GeneralStaff Memoranda :         &quot;In  these  circumstances  it   would  appear   that,  if  the  commercial    advantages are  sufficient in themselves, the  War Office would not be justified    in vetoing  the project on military grounds.&quot;    31.   The  Chancellor  of the Exchequer (Mr. Austen  Chamberlain), however,after a careful analysis of the Chief of the Imperial  General Staffs Memoranda,drew special attention to the following hypotheses adopted by Sir Henry Wilson :     &quot; (i.)  That had the Tunnel existed, our obligation to France  would have been             of a  more  definite  nature,  and one which would  have  exerted  a             stabilising effect on the attitude of Belgium.     (ii.)  That &apos; our forces are proportionate to  our responsibilities,&apos; which  he             interpreted  to involve  conscription  and  an  army  on  the  pre-war             continental model.     (iii.)  That the  Tunnel is  constructed  and owned by Government.
     (iv.)  That alternative sea bases  and means of  transport must be maintained             to take the place of the Tunnel if destroyed.      (v.)  That  French strategical  plans  are  so  re-cast  as  to  secure  French             co-operation in the defence of the Tunnel.&quot;    To  these five conditions Mr.  Chamberlain  added the recommendation of theHome Ports Defence Committee in favour of &quot;an extended naval defence and landdefences, the garrisoning  at all times of a mobile  force in the vicinity, and theprovision of an efficient air defence and anti-aircraft defence,&quot; as well as &apos;&apos; that theTunnel must be placed so far below the bottom of the Channel as to guard it againstdestruction by explosive charges placed on the bed of the sea.&quot;    &quot;These requirements,&quot; wrote Mr. Chamberlain, &quot;when thus placed together,make the  Tunnel so completely master of both our military and  political futurethat they  seem to me conclusive against its construction.  It is scarcely  too muchto say that, if we accept them all, England would exist for the defence of the Tunnelrather than the Tunnel for the defence of England.&quot;  (C.I.D. Paper 99-A.)    32.   The considered view of the Foreign Office was forwarded to the Committeeof Imperial Defence by Lord  Curzon, the general tenor  of  which is shown by thefollowing extracts :         &quot; The pith  of the question appears to  be whether it is desirable to construct    a tunnel under  the Channel, costing  anything between thirty and fifty millions    sterling,  which  may conceivably within a few years  have to be destroyed at a    moment&apos;s notice when war  is thought to be impending or  has been declared.    The whole question is dependent upon the  stability of friendly relations between    France and  this country.   If  we could be convinced that we  and the French    would  maintain a perpetual friendship and never quarrel, then it  is obvious    that there would be a distinct advantage  in having a tunnel,  although the    economic advantages to be obtained from it are not so real as might be imagined.    Consequently, the question resolves itself  into that of the relations in the near    and distant  future between England and France.        It must be remembered that until a century ago  France was England&apos;s    historic and natural enemy, and  that real friendship between  the inhabitants    of the two  countries  has always  been  very difficult owing to differences  of    language, mentality and national  character.   These differences are not likely to    decrease.  The  slightest incident may arouse the resentment or jealousy of the    French and  fan the latent embers of suspicion  into a  flame.   Nor can Great    Britain place any reliance upon public  opinion  in France being well balanced    and reasonable.   It is within the memory of many of us that in 1893, when there    was trouble with France over the boundaries of Siam, war was within an ace of    being  provoked  by the aggressive  entry of Admiral Humann with his gunboats    into the Menam River, and by his passing with his  ships cleared  for action a    British  warship  stationed  in those waters.  It  was only the  coolness and    self-restraint of the British officer in command that prevented a conflict.  Then    again, in 1898,  relations between England and France were at breaking point    over the Fashoda incident.  Lastly, it must not be forgotten that the attitude of    France towards this country during the Boer war could hardly have been more    hostile without  a positive  rupture.         ^                                             -Jfc           -7?        Nothing can alter the fundamental fact that we are not liked in France,    and never will  be, except for the advantages which the French people may be    able to extract from us.        These  considerations  point  conclusively to  the  imprudence,  and  even    danger, of increasing  at enormous cost the facilities of communication with    France by means of a tunnel under the Channel which may have to be destroyed    at any moment  as a military measure to secure the safety of  this country in the    event of France assuming a hostile and aggressive attitude.  The destruction of    the tunnel at such a moment, however necessary,  might do more permanently to    embitter relations between the two countries than its construction could ever do    to cement them.   The Foreign Office conclusion is that our relations Avith France    never  have been,  are not, and probably never will be,  sufficiently^ stable and    friendly  to justify the construction  of  a  Channel tunnel, and  the loss of  the    security which our insular position, even in spite  of the wonderful scientific and    mechanical  developments  of  recent  years,   still   continues  to   bestow.&quot;    (C.I.D. Paper No. 101-A.)      [18755]                                                       c 2
    33.  The President of the Board of Trade (Sir Auckland Geddes) considered it unnecessary to review the economic considerations  bearing on the proposals fora  Channel Tunnel which had  been  considered  by  the Government  on previous occasions, since, in the opinion of the Board of Trade, &quot;the encouragement of suchan undertaking during  the  financial  stringency which  must continue  for, someyears to come would be  entirely unjustifiable.&quot;   The President  of the  Board ofTrade considered that it would be madness to recommend the locking up  of a verylarge sum, which  he considered might amount  to as  much as  60,000,000,  in an enterprise of this character.  (C.I.D.  Paper 94-A.)    34.  The  Minister of Transport  (Sir  Eric  Geddes) (C.I.D. Paper No.  97-A)advised that a double tube tunnel as  proposed would  cost  60,000,000, but that asingle tube with crossing places could  be built for  38,000,000, to which  3,500,000would have to be added for approach lines, marshalling yards, alterations to SouthEastern  and Chatham Railway, rolling-stock, &amp;c.   Without committing himselfdefinitely, he thought it possible that a tunnel might pay with an all-round 5^ per cent.interest on the capital invested,  unless the naval and military requirements  addedmaterially to the cost or  rendered the tunnel  unpopular owing to the arrangementsfor its  drastic and  immediate destruction.  After  commenting  on the  differencebetween the British and  Continental gauge, he continued :           &quot;As regards passengers this  could  easily be arranged, at a cost of some     2,500,000 which is included in  the estimated figures given above by an    alteration  of  the South Eastern  line  to  London, where  passengers  would    naturally tranship.         As regards goods vehicles, transhipment would  be necessary, and  in  the    case of our rolling-stock  going  to the  Continent  the differences in the buffering    and coupling would  prevent free exchange.  Moreover, there is no likelihood of    alterations in rolling-stock which would eliminate this factor.&quot;Sir Eric Geddes&apos;  conclusion was as follows :          &quot; Apart  from these unknown  factors, however, and  assuming that naval    and military opinion does not condemn  the scheme,  I should advise its very    favourable consideration and further investigation as to cost of construction,    cost of working, depreciation  and maintenance,  and investigation as to  the    revenue obtainable.&quot;    35.  In   addition   to  the  Departmental  Memoranda  summarised   above,Mr. Balfour,  the Chairman of the  Committee of  Imperial Defence, in a brief  but very searching examination of the problem, reached the following conclusion :          &quot; On the whole, after considerable hesitations  and some vacillation of    opinion, I am inclined to think that the old decision should be upheld.&quot;    Mr. Balfour&apos;s Memorandum hardly lends itself to summary, but a few extractsmay be of interest:          &quot;I  do not dwell upon the  risks which are  inseparable from  the most    cunningly devised schemes  for denying, at the right moment, the use of  the    Tunnel to an enemy.  All such schemes  may  be defeated  by some accident    happening to a complicated machine, or a nervous official losing his head.          *          *           *          *           *          *         The  dangers I  have adverted to are known,  and in a certain  sense  are    calculable, but I am even more afraid  of  the  dangers which are not known    and which are not  calculable.   All  that has happened in the last  five  years    in  the  way  of  military and  naval  development- submarines, aircraft and    long-range guns have tended without exception to render the Channel Tunnel    a more dangerous experiment.  These have  all made  it more difficult  for us    to be sure that it will be open when we want it open,  and closed when we want    it closed.         And have we the least ground for  thinking that  the process is going to    be reversed ?  And  if it is  not, if  after  the economic and sound habits of the     world have adjusted themselves to this  new mode of access  to the Continent     we find that it  is fatal to our safety, what are we going to do 1  Destroy the     Tunnel in times of profound peace ?   Impossible!  Wait till its dangers have    been proved by  a disastrous war ?  Still more impossible!  The riddle will be    insoluble.
         It may of course be said  that  the unknown dangers which  I  fear may    possibly be of a kind which will put an end to our position as an island Power,    and make the command of the sea useless as a means of defence.   It may be    so; but let  us wait till it is so&apos;,  and so long as the ocean remains our  friend do    not let us deliberately destroy its power to help us.&quot;   (C.I.D. Paper 96-A.)    36.  It is perhaps worth mentioning  that the Minister of Health (Dr. Addison)circulated a Memorandum to the Committee of Imperial Defence in which he statedthat he had begun with a prejudice in favour of the Channel Tunnel, but that, afterreading the various Memoranda on  the subject, he had come&apos;to the  conclusion thatthe matter was attended  with real risk,  &quot; and that  we might in consequence find ourselves hereafter  involved in the adoption  of compulsory military service or inrunning serious risks in the absence of its adoption.&quot;  (C.I.D. Paper 100-A.)    37.  The  numerous  Memoranda of  1919-20 referred to above  were  neverdiscussed by  the  Committee  of  Imperial Defence or the Cabinet.   The pressure from the promoters of the scheme relaxed, possibly owing to the financial stringencythen existing.  The scheme on examination had been found much less  attractivethan it had appeared at first sight.  It had been criticised  on  grounds of foreignpolicy, cost  and  financial expediency.   Military opinion, if less pronouncedlyopposed  to the scheme  than in  the  past, was not  very encouraging.   In thesecircumstances no one wished to raise the question,  which was allowed quietly to drop without a formal decision being reached, and no announcement was made inParliament.                               Discussion in 1922.    38.  In February  1922  the Foreign Office  forwarded to the Committee ofImperial Defence a note from  the French Ambassador  stating that the FrenchGovernment had  been informed by the International Chamber of  Commerce thatthe proposed construction of the Channel Tunnel was approved at their  Congressheld in London in  July last, and  enquiring  whether His  Majesty&apos;s  Governmentwould now agree to a suggestion already made  by the French Government that ajoint Anglo-French Commission should examine the question (C.I.D. Paper 104-A).The question was brought before the Committee of Imperial Defence on the  14th May,1922, when the following Conclusion was reached :          &quot; The  Committee concurred  in  Lord  Curzon&apos;s  proposal to reply  to the    French Ambassador to the effect that, in view of the present financial  situation    in this  country,  His Majesty&apos;s Government are not  at present  prepared to    consider  the question of a joint Commission of  Enquiry&quot; (Minutes  of the    156th Meeting of the  Committee of Imperial Defence).                             The Enquiry of 1924.    39.  The question of a Channel Tunnel was next raised in 1924, when the labour ministry was in office.  All the Departments were once more  invited  to express theirviews, which will now be summarised.    40.  As regards the Foreign Office,  Sir Eyre Crowe  informed the Committeethat their Paper of  May 1920, summarised above in paragraph 32, still represented the views of the Office.  He added, however, the following :          &quot; The  Secretary of  State, however,  regards this  question primarily as    military,  and,  secondly,  as one involving  considerations  of  transport and    commerce.  The Foreign Office as such ought, therefore, he considers, to have no    over-riding views.&quot;   (C.I.D. Paper 123-A.)    41.  The Minister of Transport (Mr. Gosling) did not feel it necessary to addmuch to the letter of Sir Eric Geddes, quoted above in paragraph 34, but  he added the following :          &quot; I desire,  however, to call attention to the fact that the direct advantages    to be derived from  the scheme, if carried out, would  accrue almost entirely to    passengers, though some advantage would be gained by the easier importation of    merchandise  by passenger train,  such as fruit and flowers from the  Sout^ of
    France.  From my point of view, as Minister of Transport, I should much    welcome the undoubted increase  in  facilities which would be afforded by  the    Tunnel,  even though those facilities  might  be rather for pleasure than  for    commercial purposes.&quot;  (C.I.D. Paper No. 124-A.)    As regards the cost, Mr. Gosling was     &quot; not prepared to say that the promoters&apos; estimate (now  29,000,000) would    necessarily be very much exceeded.   As, however, Sir Eric Geddes pointed out,    additional expenditure would be necessary in  any case on the Southern Railway,    and  further considerable expenditure on that railway would be necessary if the    full  advantages of through running were to be obtained.&quot;Mr. Gosling thought that the promoters should be pressed to explain in detail their proposals for enabling Continental rolling-stock to be conveyed on their lines oralternative arrangements for constructing special  rolling-stock which could  be usedon Continental lines.    42.  The President of the Board of Trade (Mr. Sidney Webb) adhered generally to the Board of Trade Memorandum of 1914, and stated that         &quot; There do not appear to be any new developments calculated to reduce    materially the force of the statements .... as to the relatively small extent to    which the Tunnel is likely to be utilised for the transport of merchandise.  The    aggregate value of  the imports of Dover  and Folkestone were smaller in 1922    than in 1913, in spite of the general rise in prices in the interval, and the same    is true of British exports shipped outwards at  these ports.        As regards the obstacle  to trade in certain classes of articles which is    imposed by the risks of loading into and unloading from ships, or by the cost of    the packing necessary to obviate these risks, the experience gained during  the    War in the  operation of train-ferries appears to indicate that the breaking of    bulk could be avoided by  the development of that mode of transport.  Further    experience with the Harwich-Zeebrugge ferry will furnish additional evidence    on this subject.        I do not think  that there  are any new reasons which I should urge,  in  the    interests of the country&apos;s trade, why obstacles  to the construction of the Tunnel    should be over-ridden.&quot;  (C.I.D. Paper No. 126-A.)    43.  The Chiefs of Staff  Committee  circulated  a  Report  (C.I.D.  PaperNo. 125-A), the general  tenor of which is shown by the following extracts :          &apos;; 2. The principal military advantage to  be derived from the construction    of a Channel Tunnel would be a  gain of not much exceeding 48 hours as corn-    pared with  uninterrupted sea transport in the  concentration  and deployment,    as in  1914,  of  an Expeditionary Force of, say,  six Infantry  and one Cavalry    Divisions on  the continent of Europe.        3. From a naval  point of  view there would be the disadvantage that if  the    Channel Tunnel were constructed, in all probability  a  large proportion of  the    cross-Channel  steamer  services  would  disappear.   These  services  include a    number of fast, small craft and a personnel which, as was shown in the late War,    are of  great value both to  the  Fleet and  for combined  operations.   The    disappearance  of the cross-Channel services, therefore,  would  deprive us of an    &apos; important element in  our sea-power.        4. It also appears probable that the construction of a Channel Tunnel would    have an adverse effect on the development of the cross-Channel air  services,    and, by injuring civil aviation, would  weaken one of the  supports of  our    air-power.        5. From the point of  view of security we do not wish to over-state the risk.    In the past  the principal  danger alleged has been that  an  enemy who held  the    Continental end of the Tunnel might, by  a  coup de  main, seize  the  British    entrance before it had been  put out of action.  He would then be in possession    of a bridgehead with a secure military line of  communication behind him  for    the invasion of  this country.  This presupposes a seaborne raid on Dover, possibly    accompanied by the  passage, by  stratagem,  of an  armed force through  the    Tunnel and  supported  by concerted operations in the  air, with the object of    dislocating the defence and interrupting the arrival of reinforcements.&quot;
 After discussing the possibility  of a  raid as a  &quot; bolt from the blue &quot;  in time  of profound peace, which the Committee of Imperial Defence had repeatedly declared to be &quot; not sufficiently remote to be ignored,&quot; the Chiefs of Staff continued :           &quot; 8. In the event of strained  relations the risk would be considerably less,     particularly if the Precautionary Stage of our War Book and Defence Schemes     had been put in operation.  The principal danger would be that the enemy might     precipitate hostilities and deliver a raid simultaneously with  the outbreak  of     war, as in the  case of  the surprise attack on Liege  on the night of the     3/4th August,  1914.         9. Wide differences of opinion have existed  in the past between the highest     naval and  military authorities as to the degree of importance to be attached to     these risks and as to the extent to which the problem is affected by the possible     failure at the critical moment either of the human element or of the mechanical     devices for putting the Tunnel out of action.  On this subject we do not wish to     dogmatise, but we concur with the view  expressed  by Sir Henry  Campbell-     Bannerman in his announcement in Parliament on the 21st March, 1907, that              &apos; Even  supposing the military dangers involved were to be  amply         guarded against, there  would exist throughout the country a  feeling  of         insecurity which might, lead to a constant demand for increased expenditure,         naval  and military,  and a continued risk of unrest and  possibly  alarm         which, however unfounded, would be most  injurious in its effect, whether         political or commercial.&apos;         It is by no means  unlikely,  for example,  that  the  existence of a Tunnel     (particularly in the event of an  international  crisis) might lead to a  public     demand for measures, whether of naval, military or air defence, which  would     tend to concentrate an  undue proportion of our limited defensive resources  in     the region  of the Tunnel to the detriment of the general defence of the country.&apos;&apos;     After expressing their agreement with Lord Balfour&apos;s Memorandum, summarised above in paragraph 35, the  Chiefs of  Staff also expressed their concurrence  in theview of the Home Ports Defence Committee and of Field-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson,that, if the Tunnel were constructed, Government ownership would tend to facilitate the taking of measures whether for its security or destruction.     44.  Mr. Ramsay MacDonald decided to deal with the  question outside  of the sphere of party politics, and, accordingly, at his invitation,  the following ex-PrimeMinisters attended  the 186th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence,  heldon the 1st July, 1924 : Lord Balfour, Mr. Baldwin, Mr. Asquith, Mr. Lloyd George.A copy of the Minutes, which are of considerable interest, is attached to this summaryas Appendix I.  It will be seen that the Committee of Imperial Defence recommendedunanimously  that at the present  time the Channel Tunnel should not be proceeded with.    45.  This  recommendation  was  adopted,  and on   the 7th  July,  1924,Mr.  Ramsay MacDonald made, in the House of Commons,  the announcement  con-tained in Appendix II.

Minutes 156th Meeting, Minute 4.)    THE COMMITTEE had under consideration the proposal for the constructionof a Channel Tunnel (C.I.D. Papers  Nos. 92-A,  93-A, 94-A, 95-A, 96-A, 98-A,99-A. 100-A,  104-A,  121-A, 122-A, 123-A. 124-A,  125-A, 126-A, 127-A and128-A).    THE PRIME  MINISTER  said that  on the  26th June he  had received  adeputation of members of the House of Commons Channel Tunnel Committee, whoclaimed  that virtually some 400 Members of the House of  Commons had declared their  intention to  support  the  scheme for a  Channel Tunnel.  The deputationconsidered that conditions affecting  the  tunnel had  so materially changed since1914 that they had  requested the Government to  reconsider the problem.  He had felt that a decision on this  question should be kept clear of party politics, andconsequently he had invited the  ex-Prime Ministers who  had been Chairmen  of
the Committee of Imperial Defence,&apos;and most of whom had considered this question in the past, to attend this meeting and to be good enough to assist the committee with their advice.     LORD BE ATT Y stated that the Chiefs  of Staff Sub-Committee, under theChairmanship of Lord Haldane, had lately gone thoroughly into this, question, andtheir Report had been circulated as C.I.D.  Paper No.  125-A. The Military dangerof a tunnel was not serious,  but a slight danger must necessarily exist;  that factalone made them feel that the great advantage possessed by this country of  beingsurrounded by water should not be  foregone unless there were great advantages to be gained.  The  Sub-Committee had  taken into consideration the views expressed  bythe Foreign Office  and other Departments, and there did not appear to be anysufficient compensation which would enable them to advise in favour of constructionof ;a tunnel;  in  fact, the  views of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee were wellexpressed by  Sir  Henry  Campbell-Bannerman&apos;s statement in  1907, that &quot; Evensupposing the Military dangers  involved were  to be amply guarded against,  therewould  exist throughout the country a feeling of insecurity which might lead to a constant demand for  increased expenditure, Naval  and Military, and a continuedrisk of unrest and possibly  alarm,  which, however unfounded, would  be   mostinjurious in its effect, whether  political  or commercial.&quot;  In times  of  strainedrelations the  existence of  a  tunnel might lead to a public demand for defence measures which would tend  to  concentrate an undue proportion  of our  limiteddefence resources in the region of the tunnel to the detriment of the general defenceof the  country.  From a  Naval  point of view there  would  be  the  additional.disadvantage  that  if  the  Channel Tunnel were constructed  the cross  Channelsteamer services would disappear.  These services form a magnificent auxiliary, bothin material and personnel, to the  Naval  Forces of the Empire.  They had  beenproved to be of great value during the late war and  formed an important part  ofthe Naval Reserve.  The construction of a tunnel would probably have an adverse effect on the development of civil aviation and would weaken one of the supports  ofour  Air power.  He considered that Lord  Balfour had summed  up  the whole situation in his  Memorandum (C.I.D.  Paper No. 96-A),  in which he stated that&quot; So long as the  ocean remains  our friend, do not let. us deliberately destroy its power to help us.&quot;    LORD CAVAN stated that from, the purely Military point of view he would prefer that a tunnel should  not be constructed.  The existence of a tunnel was boundto add to the  anxieties of those in  control, was bound to add to our commitments,and consequently was bound to add to our expenditure on defence forces.    SIR HUGH  TRENCHARD  concurred that  the existence of the  ChannelTunnel would be an added danger and an added commitment from the defence  pointof view.  He pointed out that the best laid schemes for putting the tunnel out  ofaction might be dislocated  by a  determined enemy.  He considered that the  largeAir Forces in being on the Continent made the possibility of a &quot; bolt from the blue &quot;more probable, in which case a  small and determined force of the enemy might conceivably gain possession of our  end of  the  tunnel, and, supported by a strongconcentration of their  Air  Force, might successfully hold the Tunnel exit for twoor three days, during which time the passage of considerable forces could have takenplace.    LORD  BALFOUR stated  that in  1920  he  had written a  Memorandum(C.I.D. Paper No. 96A) which expressed his opinion on the subject.  He still adhered to those views.  They had  been arrived at with some hesitation, since, during thewar, he had sometimes been inclined to consider  that the existence of a tunnel wouldhave been of the greatest assistance to our Army  in France, but, on further reflection,after the war,  he had reverted with undiminisned strength to the opinions which hehad previously held on the subject.    MR. ASQUITH  said  that he  was in complete agreement with the opinions expressed by Lord Balfour in the  Memorandum to  which the latter had referred.He himself had  taken part in two  inquiries on the  subject; firstly,  under theChairmanship of Sir  Henry Campbell Bannerman in 1907, and secondly, in  1914,when he was himself Prime Minister.  Both these inquiries had  arrived at the sameconclusion, and  all naval  and military  authorities,  with the  two  exceptions  ofSir John French and Prince Louis of Battenburg, had been opposed to the project.He had, however, been of the opinion that changes in the strategical situation migHt
.at  some future date  militate  against  the  naval and military objections.   He considered, however, that at the present time the changes in the strategical situation had strengthened rather than lessened such objections.     MR.  LLOYD GEORGE stated  that he  was entirely in  agreement with  the opinions expressed by Lord Balfour and Mr.  Asquith.  In 1919 the Government of the  day had been  rather disposed to  regard the problem with favour, but this fact was largely due to the atmosphere resulting from war.  The matter had then been referred to a special inquiry, which  had undoubtedly started  with a prejudice in favour of the construction of a tunnel, but, as the inquiry had proceeded, it had been found that the objections from the  point of view of  the defence  of the country outweighed any advantages which might be expected to accrue.  He expressed  the opinion that many  of  the  400 Members of  Parliament, who were  stated by  the Chairman of the Deputation which had been received by the Prime Minister to give their support  to  the project,  would, after due reflection and after hearing  the objections to the proposal, hesitate to pledge themselves to a scheme which might prove detrimental to the safety of this  country.  So far these Members of Parliament had only heard one side of the story.  He considered that not only were there military reasons against the scheme, but also psychological reasons which would tend to alter the conduct of our foreign policy and  our diplomatic negotiations.  The Committeehad  listened to the views expressed by the naval, military and air experts, who hadall agreed  that no guarantee could be given with regard to the defensibility of  thetunnel. He pointed out that the French experts would in all probability reach  thesame conclusion, and would advise their Government to that effect, so that the french would  always have it in mind that they could strike a sudden blow at this country.If the tunnel was  constructed,  therefore, it might tend to weaken our diplomacy.He considered that the possibility of an attempt to seize the British end of the tunnelbeing backed up by strong aerial attacks, to which the Chief of the Air Staff had called attention, added additional arguments against the construction of the tunnel.In short, he looked upon the tunnel as a very dangerous experiment, which shouldbe postponed  until all possibilities of conflict with a European nation haddisappeared.    MR. BALDWIN stated that he had never been directly concerned in any previousinquiry in  connection with this  subject.  The  opinion expressed in Lord Balfour&apos;smemorandum, however,  entirely represented his own views on the subject.  He wasin agreement with Mr. Asquith, that the reasons against the construction of a tunnelwere stronger now  than they had been when the question was previously considered.He also agreed with Mr. Lloyd George that there were psychological reasons againstthe  construction of the tunnel,  and he considered the House  of  Commons would oppose the construction when they were in  possession of all the arguments against such a  course.     LORD BALFOUR enquired as to whether the  statement  put forward by theBoard  of Trade with regard to  the economic aspects of the Channel Tunnel schemewas not in  reality a new argument against the tunnel.     MR. LLOYD GEORGE stated that the same argument was used in 1920, andMR.  ASQUITH pointed out that it was also employed in 1907  and 1914.     THE  PRIME MINISTER stated that his own predisposition in viewing this problem was  the same as that which had been held by Mr. Asquith and Mr. LloydGeorge, namely, favourable  to  the scheme.   On that basis he. started with theassumption that, if no overriding reasons could be adduced against the tunnel, hewould  be inclined to favour its construction.  He considered that the ordinary manin the street would be inclined  to favour that view.    He himself had been much impressed  by Lord Balfour&apos;s Memorandum.   He pointed out  that the committee might  take one of  three positions :  firstly, favourable to the construction; secondly,to oppose  the scheme most decisively;  or, thirdly, to adopt a middle  course that, inspite of the military reasons against its construction, the arguments adduced by thebusiness world in  favour of the scheme should be permitted to outweigh military considerations.   The whole opinion, however, of the meeting appeared to be opposedto the project.     MR. WEBB stated that he had  approached the subject with  a similar pre-disposition in favour of the Tunnel, but as he went into the question it seemed to him that all the arguments were  against the proposal.  From a Trade point of view the
 existence of a tunnel would dry up the present cross-Channel services and  would provide no counter-balancing advantages to trade of an appreciable character.  He pointed out that the tendency during the last few years had been for a falling-off in the use by trade of the fast cross-Channel services.   The value of the imports and exports by cross-Channel steamers had lessened considerably of late.   Consequently! in the opinion of the Board of Trade, the Tunnel would receive a very small revenue from goods services but considerable revenue  from a luxury passenger service, which, if it took place, would kill the cross-Channel services.  There would, however, be no trade advantages.   One of the arguments for a tunnel commonly put forward was the desirability of not breaking bulk during the  transit of goods.   He pointed out that the use of train ferries, similar to those running between Harwich and Holland, met this argument.  He considered that  the estimate of  revenue by  the promoters was extremely sanguine,  but he was doubtful whether the scheme could be made a success financially.  The present cost of the  construction of the Tunnel was largely in excess of the original estimates, and he expected that the promoters would require both the British and Trench Governments to provide them with a financial  Grant m Aid.     THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that  the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee in their Report (C.I.D. Paper No.  125-A) had expressed the view that if the tunnelwere  constructed  Government ownership would  tend to  facilitate  the taking of measures, whether for its security or destruction.  To sum up, it appeared that the unanimous opinion of the Committee was against the construction of the tunnel atthe present time.                                Conclusion.    THE  COMMITTEE OE  IMPERIAL DEFENCE  recommend that at  the        present time the Channel Tunnel should not be proceeded with.(Lord Balfour, Mr.  Asquith, Mr. Lloyd George and Mr.  Baldwin then withdrew.)&apos;    (2.) THE PROCEDURE TO BE ADOPTED WITH REGARD TO PUBLICATION OF THE                CONCLUSION AS REGARDS THE CHANNEL TUNNEL.    THE PRIME  MINISTER stated that he  wished to ask  the advice of the-Committee with regard to the procedure to be adopted in making public the decision which had been arrived at.  He suggested that a communique should be issued  to thepress stating that a meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence had been held toconsider this question, and that Lord Balfour, Mr. Asquith, Mr. Lloyd George andMr. Baldwin had been present.  He considered that the arguments employed by theA^various speakers should not be allowed  to appear in the communique, but that thequestion should be considered by the Cabinet.    After some discussion, it was agreed that Lord Balfour&apos;s memorandum (C.I.D.Paper No. 96-A) should be circulated to  the Cabinet, and that the question should beconsidered by the Cabinet at their meeting, to be held the following day, Wednesday,.the 2nd July,  1924.    2,  Whitehall  Gardens,  S.W. 1,            July 1, 1924.APPENDIX II.Statement by the Prime Minister (Mr. Ram say Mac Donald) in the House of Commons         on Monday, July 7, 1924, on the Subject of the Channel Tunnel.    THE PRIME MINISTER :  The Government have had  under consideration thequestion of the Channel  Tunnel, which was brought to their notice by the Membersof the House of Commons  Channel Tunnel Committee.   In a Memorandum  withwhich the Committee were  good  enough to furnish me,  it is  stated that virtually400 Members of this House have now declared their intention to support the scheme.Some Members  attached the condition, to  which the House of  Commons Channel
Tunnel Committee assented, that the approval of the naval and military authoritiesand of the Committee of Imperial Defence should first be given, and the Committeegave me to understand that the promoters would, in the absence of such approval, be unwilling to launch the project.    I accordingly decided to refer the matter to the Committee of Imperial Defence,and, partly in order to  reinforce the  Government by the opinion of those who hadbad the responsibility of deciding this question in the past, and partly with a view toremoving it  altogether from the sphere of party politics, I invited  the four formerPrime Ministers, who had been chairmen of the Committee of Imperial Defence[Lord Balfour,  Mr. Asquith, Mr.  Lloyd  George  and Mr.  Baldwin], to attend ameeting on the subject.    The members  of the Committee of Imperial Defence,  including  the  formerPrime Ministers, were given all possible information bearing on the subject.   Apartfrom  several  communications from the  House of  Commons Channel  TunnelCommittee, including some notes on French official opinion, and the verbatim notes of their  deputation to myself, the Committee of  Imperial Defence were furnished with  an  exhaustive summary of the earlier history  of the question.  In addition,they had before  them a series of Papers on the subject prepared in several of theGovernment Departments in the  year 1920.  These  included  Memoranda  by theGeneral Staffs of the three Services, as well as a  very complete Report prepared in1920 by the Home Ports Defence Committee on the safeguards to be imposed from a defensive point of view, if the tunnel should be built, and the considered opinions ofa number of Ministers.  Memoranda on the  commercial  and transport aspects ofthe scheme were furnished on the  present occasion by the Board of Trade and theMinistry of Transport respectively.   Finally, the  Committee  of  Chiefs  of Staffmet a few days  before  the main Committee, and furnished a Joint Report  on themilitary  aspects  of the problem.   They supplemented this Report  by verbal state-ments at the meeting.    Thus the Committee had before them, not only the views of their predecessors,but a series of Memoranda on the latest aspects of the project, prepared in the lightof war experience and  post-war conditions.   There was, therefore, no  side of thequestion on which the fullest possible information was not available.    I think that most  of those present,  like myself, had approached  the subject with a certain pre-disposition in favour of the Channel Tunnel.  When the evidencecame  to  be discussed, however, it  was found that everyone had been forced to anopposite conclusion.  The advice of the staffs of the Admiralty, War  Office,  andAir  Ministry was against  the project.   While the scheme  offered  very slightattractions from a military  point of view, it was found  to  involve considerablemilitary disadvantages.    From the point of view of security, the Committee of Imperial Defence do not wish to overstate the risk.  But they are advised, as their predecessors were advised,that  there  is  unquestionably an element of  danger involved.   While naval andmilitary opinion in the past has differed considerably as to the extent of this danger,there appears no room for doubt that the existence of a tunnel would be bound to addsomething to the anxieties of those responsible for national defence, to our commit-ments, and to our expenditure.     And, as pointed out by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, in a statement on thesubject in this House in 1907 :          &quot; Even supposing the military dangers involved were  to be amply guarded     against, there would exist throughout the country a feeling of  insecurity which     might lead to a constant demand for increased expenditure, naval and military,     and a continued risk of  unrest and possibly alarm, which, however unfounded,     would be most injurious  in its effect, whether political or commercial.&quot;     The Committee were also advised that, if ever the tunnel was built, Governmentownership would tend  to facilitate the taking of measures whether for its  security or destruction.     Having examined  the defence aspects  of the question,  the Committee turned to its civil aspects, in order  to ascertain whether there were overriding advantages which would justify them in  advising that the military risks involved should be run.     The Committee were informed that the construction of the Channel Tunnel wouldhave but little effect on the foreign trade of this country.   The question of passenger traffic is alone important, and by it the  Channel Tunnel Scheme  as a commercialenterprise must stand or fall.  If,  however, the tunnel, when completed, succeeded
in attracting passenger traffic to the extent which its promoters hope for, one result would be the gradual disappearance of the cross-Channel steamship services.    As  regards relief  to  unemployment,  the Parliamentary Committee estimate that on the tunnel itself about 2,500 men would find employment on the Englishside, and an equal number on the French side of  the Channel.   There would, inaddition, be consequential employment elsewhere, and one of the estimates in thememorandum of the Channel Tunnel Committee was for an over-all figure of 12,000workers in  Great Britain and 12,000 in France.    The Committee of Imperial Defence were unanimous that the advantages of theChannel Tunnel were not commensurate with the disadvantages from a defence pointof view.  Further, they  took the view that all that has happened in  the last fiveyears in the way  of  naval,  military and air development has tended,  without exception, to render the Channel Tunnel a  more dangerous experiment.    That was the unanimous opinion of the  Committee of Imperial Defence, whoaccordingly recommended that at the present time the Channel Tunnel ought not tobe proceeded with.    In view of this, the Government had no alternative but to accept the advice ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence.APPENDIX III.               Extract from the &quot; Times,&quot; dated January 3, 1929.                        To the Editor of the &quot; Times.&quot;Sir,    IN view of the resuscitation of the Channel  Tunnel question,  it may be ofinterest to relate the purport of a conversation with the late Lord French shortly after  his return from France on  relinquishing the  command of  the  british expeditionary Force in the  Great War.  I asked him whether he maintained hisopinion concerning a Channel Tunnel in view of his recent experiences.  His reply was in the negative,  as he said that formerly he had not sufficiently appreciated either the effective  transportation  or the  extreme  mobility  of sea-power.   It will  berecollected that our  base had to be changed, both suddenly and rapidly,  soon aftercontact with the Germans had been established. He further  informed me that if aChannel  Tunnel had been  in existence  at the beginning of the war it would  have affected the strategy of the operations consequent on the retreat from Mons.  In hisopinion,  the tunnel  would have had  to be destroyed  when the Allied armies were driven back by the  Germans, or would have anchored his army  to  the west andpermitted of  the wedge being driven in between the French and English armies,which was an objective of the Germans.  He  remarked also that with a ChannelTunnel in existence it would  constitute one of the terms to be demanded by an enemy in any unfavourable negotiations.    History relates how British troops have repeatedly fought on the Continent andshows  how certain   areas,   for strategic  and topographical  reasons,  inevitablyconstitute the battlefields.                                                 I am, Sir, &amp;c,                                                       CECIL B. LEVITA.    6, Brunswick Square, Hove, January 1.
