ilS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY  OP  HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) . EGRET..P.  168(30)                 CABINET.             REPORT OF  THE  COMMITTEE ON&apos; AGRICULTURAL  RESEARCH                         ORCANISATIOlfTo*PTlSiTsoTl .           Memorandum  by the Minister  of Agriculture and Fisheries.                    While I accept  the  main recommendation of  the           Committee, viz., that there  should be  constituted an           Agricultural Research Council composed as  the  Committee           suggests, and charged generally  to consider the development           and needs of agricultural research,  nevertheless there are           some  parts of the  Committee&apos;s proposals to which I  am bound           to talcs strong objection.               (l)   The Council  must be advisory  to the Ministers           concerned with agriculture.   I  rather  think that this is           intended by  the  Committee;  hut  sometimes  phrases are used           (e.g.,  at the beginning of paragraph 18,  &quot;The  Agricultural           Research Council should be entrusted,  in general, with  the           development  of agricultural  research&quot;, etc.) which  suggest           that  the Council would be directly executive.   It is           impossible to contemplate the  creation of another executive           agency side-by-side with Ministers of  the Crown, and using           public money for the  same purpose:   but recognition of  this           fact  is quite compatible with an arrangement under  which           the Council  would substantially  have at its disposal           an annual sum for expenditure  in the development of research.               (2)  I cannot agree that  the  Council should be appointed           by and responsible to a-Committee of the Privy Council,  of           which the Lord President would be Chairman, and that the                                    &apos;  1.COPY NO.it
Agricultural Research Council should &quot;be attached to the                  -             -     -        . &apos;  .         &apos;Lord President..   The Privy Council has nothing whatever          - -to do with agricultural research, and the proposal rests,I think, on an entirely false analogy.  There is no particular Minister concerned with  scientific andindustrial research in general, in  the sense in which a minister of Agriculture is concerned with agricultural research;  and medical research similarly is far moreseparate from the functions and daily work of anyparticular Department.  Agricultural  research is anessential instrument and part of agricultural policy,which is confined to a special Minister.  Again, nine-tenths  of agricultural research is, and  (so far asanyone  can foresee) always will he, conducted by the research Institutes;  it is impossible to contemplate that the Ministers of Agriculture  should be responsiblefor  the Research Institutes while  another &quot;Minister is responsible for  &quot;the development of agricultural  research.&quot;I  think that the proposal of the Committee on  this point is wrong in principle, and bound to lead to the greatestdifficulties in practice.  In my view, the Councilahould  be appointed by,  ana  responsible  to, the Ministerof Agriculture,  the Secretary  of State for Scotland,  theSecretary of State- for Dominion Affairs, and  the  Secretaryof State  for Home Affairs  (as  representing NorthernIreland),  jointly.  It is a minor  point  whether thosefour Ministers should be formally  constituted  as  aCommittee for  the purpose of appointing&quot;the Council,  and receiving its  reports, etc. -
    (3)   For the sane reasons  I feel  hound to  objectstrongly to the proposal that  Parliamentary responsibilityfor the Agricultural Research  Council should &quot;rest withthe Lord President of the Council,  and,  in his absence,with the Minister of Agriculture and  Fisheries&quot;.    Thevast bulk of the expenditure on agricultural research(namely, the normal cost of maintenance  of the Institutes)is to be borne on the Votes of the Departments ofAgriculture; and it. is regarded by the Committee as atleast possible (see the last sentence of paragraph 19)that the Agricultural Research Council&apos;s own expenditure should similarly be borne on the Votes of the Departments.In these circumstances, I am quite unable to understandhow Parliamentary responsibility could rest with anyoneexcept with the Ministers responsible for agriculture.    (4)  The. proposal that the Secretary to the council should be a person possessing high scientific qualificationsappears to me most questionable and might be dangerous,if it means that he is to be a whole-time officer with a status and salary roughly corresponding to those of the -Secretary to the Medical Research Council,   He would inevitably tend to attempt to become a kind of scientificinspector of Research Institutes.  It must be rememberedthat directors of Research Institutes are probably, eachin his own line, the most eminent experts in this country,and in some cases in the world;  the idea that the scientific work for which they are responsible should besubject to inspection and criticism by a permanentofficial, even if originally possessing high scientificqualifications, seems to me quite impracticable and couldonly lead to dissatisfaction and resentment if an attemptware made to put it into practice.-
                There are various minor points in the CommitteeTs         report which seem to require some modification,  e$g.,         the report refers to &quot;the promotion of the fundamental         sciences that serve the interests of agriculture&quot; as  one         of the functions of the Agricultural Research Council;         ta.:cen..in its literal sense, this would enable the Council         to intervene in a very large part of the whole range  of         science, e.g.  chemistry and physics^ as well as the         biological sciences.  Nor am I clear what exactly is         meant by the recommendation that the Council &quot;should  act         as the channel of communication of the Government in  the         field of agricultural research with scientific organisations         in the Empire and with the scientific world generally&quot;;         I presume it does not mean that the Ministers concerned         with agriculture would not be able to communicate as         the mouthpiece of the Government with such bodies as         Universities or the Royal Society except through the         Council.  But these and other minor points are matters  of         comparative detail, which it would be easy to settle  as         soon as the main questions are determined.                                          (Intd.)  N.B.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries,         6th May, 1930.
