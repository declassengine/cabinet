THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1930.SECRET.                                                    Copy No.CP.  151 (30).38CABINET.PALESTINE : STATEMENT WITH REGARD  TO  BRITISH POLICY.         Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    AT the Special Session of the Permanent Mandates Commission,  which openson the 3rd June,  it will be necessary for the British Accredited Representative tomake a statement with regard to British Policy in Palestine.   An intimation hasbeen received that the Commission would like to have the text of this statementcirculated to them in advance, if possible a fortnight before the meeting of theCouncil.    I  annex a draft of the statement which, subject to the  concurrence of mycolleagues, it is proposed should be made by Dr. Shiels.  As it appears preferable that the outline of policy which it embodies should  be in the  hands of Membersof Parliament and of the general public at the same time as it is communicated tothe Permanent Mandates Commission, I propose to arrange for its publication in a parliamentary Paper.    In most respects the statement may be regarded as self-explanatory.  I would,however, invite attention to a point arising out of paragraph 4.  It may perhaps beconsidered unnecessary to give so much prominence to Mr. Snell&apos;s reservations withregard to  responsibility for the disturbances and for the innovations introduced inthe neighbourhood of the Wailing Wall.  On the other hand, there is on these pointsa definite division of opinion,  and I know that Mr. Snell attached  a very high degree of  importance to his reservations.  The question of the responsibility of theGrand Mufti and of  the Moslem religious authorities generally is one which has attracted much attention, and I think it should be made clear that on these pointsHis Majesty&apos;s Government have not failed to take into account the views expressedby Mr. Snell as well as those of the majority of the Commission.    May 9, 1930.  Palestine :  Draft Statement by British  Accredited  Representative for              Circulation to Permanent Mandates Commission.    1.  The Permanent Mandates Commission are aware of the  circumstances inwhich a Special Commission, under the Chairmanship of Sir William Shaw,  wasappointed by  the  British  Government in September last,  &apos;-&apos; to enquire into theimmediate  causes  which led to  the  recent outbreak in  Palestine and to make recommendations  as to the steps necessary  to avoid a  recurrence.&quot;   After  an exhaustive investigation conducted on the spot, the Commission presented its reporton the  12th  March,  1930.  The Report was  published  in Great Britain  as  a parliamentary paper at the beginning  of April, and copies were at the same timeforwarded to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, for distribution to members of the Permanent Mandates Commission.      [21051]                                                        b
    2.  Following upon the publication of the Report, the Prime Minister of GreatBritain made a statement in the following terms in the British House of commons on the 3rd April, 1930 :-         &quot; His  Majesty&apos;s Government  will  continue  to administer  Palestine  in    accordance with the terms of the Mandate as approved by the Council of the    League of Nations.  That is an international obligation from which there can    be no question of receding.         Under the terms of the Mandate His Majesty&apos;s Government are responsible    for promoting &quot; the establishment in Palestine  of a National Home  for the    Jewish people, it  being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which    might  prejudice the civil and religious rights  of existing  non-Jewish com-    munities in Palestine or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any    other country.&quot;         A double undertaking is involved, to  the Jewish people  on the  one hand,    and to the non-Jewish population of Palestine on the other; and  it  is the firm    resolve of His Majesty&apos;s Government to give effect, in equal measure,  to both    parts of the Declaration, and to do equal justice to all sections of the populations    of Palestine.   That  is  a duty from which they will not shrink, and to the    discharge of which they will apply all the resources at their command.         The report of the Shaw  Commission, which is  in the hands of Honourable    Members, covers a wide field.   The Commission was  appointed to consider the    immediate causes of the  deplorable  disturbances of August last, and to  suggest    means of preventing a recurrence.   In endeavouring faithfully to  carry out the    terms of reference, the Commission must have found it difficult to draw lines    very rigidly.   The government is now studying the various  recommendations    of the  Commission, with a view to dealing with the immediate causes of the    outbreak and to preventing a recurrence, and is in consultation with the interests    concerned.    I  wish  it  to be understood that this statement  includes the    immediate  provision of the police forces required to secure Civil peace under    existing circumstances.&apos;&apos;    3.  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government have now  given further consideration to thevarious conclusions and recommendations of the  Commission of Enquiry.  But before proceeding  to the discussion  of details, they would wish  to offer some preliminaryobservations of  a  more general nature.  The difficulties arising out of the peculiarcharacter of the Palestine Mandate are well known.  There is no need to labour this aspect of the  question, since it  is one  with which the  Permanent   mandates commission are already familiar.  It w7as discussed  in detail  in the course of the observations recorded by the Commission (in November 1924) on the first report onthe administration of Palestine that came under their examination.   The Commissionthen remarked that, whereas all the other mandates the application of which theyhad hitherto examined were only intended to  give effect to  the general  principlesof Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, the  mandate  for palestine was &quot;of a more complex nature,&quot; in that it imposed upon the Mandatory Power a&quot;twofold duty,&quot;  viz.,  that of promoting the establishment of a National Home forthe Jewish people,  in addition to that of administering the country in conformitywith  the interests of the population as a whole.  The result, as the Commissionpointed out, was to create a  &quot; conflict of interests &quot; between  which the balance hadto be  held.   The observations recorded by the Permanent Mandates Commission  inNovember 1924 have lost none of their relevance at the present time.  The conflict ofinterest remains,  and the task of holding the balance has certainly not decreased indifficulty.  The situation is one of great delicacy,  calling for the exercise of  allpossible patience  and circumspection.  That it has certain unsatisfactory features,as is pointed out  in the Report of the Commission  of Enquiry, His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment  are  not concerned to dispute.  Rather,  they  are more  concerned  toprovide a remedy; and to this task they mean to address  themselves with all  theresources at their disposal.   They do not underrate the difficulties.  The  conditions under which remedial measures can be applied are strictly limited;  they are governed by the terms of the Mandate and by the dual obligation which it imposes.  such measures cannot be devised or introduced at a momenfs notice.  Caution is essential,and the ground must be carefully examined before an advance can safely be made.For these reasons His Majesty&apos;s Government  are not in a position  to formulateprecise and concrete proposals in regard to all  the points that the Commission have raised.    On some at least  of these  points they can do  no more than  indicateprovisionally the lines on which  they hope to  proceed.
    4.  Turning  to  question  of  detail,  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  acceptgenerally  the findings  of  the Commission of  Enquiry  under the  following  fiveheads, viz. :        (i) Nature of the outbreak (p. 158);      (ii) Zionist  complaints  against  the  Grand Mufti of  Jerusalem  (pp.  158             and 159);      (iii) Zionist complaints  against the Palestine Arab Executive (p. 159);      (iv) Zionist complaints against the Government (pp. 159 to 161); and       (v) Minor Arab grievances (p. 163).His Majesty&apos;s Government do not consider that these conclusions in themselves call for special  action on  their part.   It will be noted, in  connection with (ii), thatMr.  Snell,  one  of the three  Commissioners,   in  his  Note  of  Reservations,  hasattributed  to the  Grand  Mufti a greater share  in  the  responsibility  for  the disturbances than  is attributed to him in the Report,  and has expressed the viewthat the Mufti must bear the blame  for his failure to make any effort to control thecharacter  of  agitation conducted in  the name of a religion, of which, in Palestine,he was the head (p. 172).  As  to this, reference  is invited to the statement made onp. 77 of the Commissions Report to the effect that, whatever activities he may haveindulged in outside the knowledge of the Government,  in public the Mufti,  both at noon on the 23rd August and  thereafter throughout the period of the disturbances,exerted his influence in the direction of promoting peace and restoring order.  Onthis point, the Report states, there was  an absolute unanimity of opinion among the many official witnesses  with whom  the  question  of the Mufti&apos;s conduct was raisedduring the course  of the Commission^ enquiry.  Mr. Snell  also dissents from theconclusions in the Report &apos;&apos; acquitting the Moslem religious authorities of all but the slightest  blame for the innovations  introduced in the neighbourhood of the WailingWall.&quot;  On this point it is to be observed that the Report (paragraph 7 on p. 159)does  not  purport  to assign  any specific degree  of  blame  to  the Mohammedanauthorities.   The conclusion which  it records is that &quot; in the matter of  innovationsof practice little blame can be  attached to the Mufti, in which some Jewish religiousauthorities also  would not have to  share.&quot;  His Majesty&apos;s Government do not  feelthat they can usefully offer any further  comments on this  branch of the question.    5.  It may be  convenient to deal-in one paragraph with two important economic questions which  are closely inter-related, viz., those concerning Immigration and theLand problem. The Conclusions and recommendations of the Commission of enquiry on these questions appear on pages 161,  162, 165 and 166 of their Report.  Mr. Snellhas also  expressed certain views and  has made supplementary recommendations with  regard to  these  questions  in  his  Note  of  Reservations.    It  is  inrelation  to  these  questions,   and   to  that  of  immigration  in  particular,  thatthe dual  character  of  the Mandate assumes  its most  significant  aspect.   Thiswas   recognised,  in effect,  by  the   Permanent  Mandates Commission  when,in the course  of  the  Observations of  November 1924,  from  which quotationhas  already  been  made,  they selected  the  problem  of immigration  ( i perhaps the   dominant  issue  of   the   present  situation   in   Palestine&quot;)   as  bestillustrating  their  general  exposition upon the  operation of the Mandate.  Thefollowing passage  from the Observations states the problem so clearly that it maybe quoted in full: &quot; It is obvious  that if the Mandatory Power had only  to take into consideration  the interests of the population, its immigration policy ought to bedictated  primarily by considerations of the economic needs  of the country.  It is,moreover, equally clear that if the Mandatory Power had not to take into account theinterests of  the Arab population,  and  if its sole duty  was  to  encourage  Jewushimmigration in Palestine, it might be in a position to pursue an agrarian policy whichwould facilitate and expedite to   a  greater  extent  than  its present  policy  thecreation  of a Jewish  National Home.&quot;  That, stated succinctly,  is the dilemmawhich has  confronted,  and  still  confronts,  the Mandatory Government.  Thepolicy which they  have adopted, and  which they  had endeavoured to follow, isbased upon the  principle that  immigration   snail   &quot;not  exceed the  economiccapacity  of  the country at  the time  to absorb new arrivals.&quot;   The soundness       [21051]                                                        B 2
of this principle will hardly  be challenged; but  its  practical  application  isnot  WITHOUT  difficulty.   The   absorptive  capacity of  the  country  must   becorrectly gauged; everything turns upon  that.  But to  gauge it correctly,  manyintricate considerations of land  settlement,  development,  &amp;c, must be taken intoaccount; and the margin for  miscalculation is necessarily wide.  If there have beenmistakes in the  past, they must be  avoided in future.   But the question is  tooimportant, and  too  vital  to  the  prosperity  of  Palestine,  to  be tackled hastily  or without due consideration.  His Majesty&apos;s Government have felt unable to formulatespecific proposals without further expert examination of the whole problem in  all  its aspects.  A highly qualified  investigator has accordingly been appointed to proceedto Palestine on a temporary mission, in order to confer with the High commissioner and  report to His  Majesty&apos;s Government  on  land  settlement,  immigration, anddevelopment.  For this mission Sir John Hope-Simpson, who  is employed under theLeague of Nations  as Vice-Chairman of the Refugee  Settlement  Commission  in greece, has been selected.  He is now on his way to Palestine.  The whole questionof future policy in regard to immigration, laiid settlement and development will beconsidered and  determined on receipt of Sir J.  Hope  Simpson&apos;s report.   In themeantime, temporary measures  are being taken with a view to  safeguarding theposition of certain  elements in  the  population of Palestine.  The question of atemporary suspension of immigration is under examination; and legislation is to beintroduced with the object of controlling the disposition of agricultural lands in such manner as to prevent the dispossession  of the  indigenous agricultural population.These temporary measures will be superseded in any  case by such permanent  enact-ments as may be decided upon when future policy is determined in  the light of Sir J.Hope  Simpson&apos;s report.     6.  His Majesty&apos;s Government are also making enquiries with regard  to thestatement on page 161 of the Report (paragraph 30), that the selection of immigrantsunder the Labour Schedule ought not to be entrusted to the General Federation of jewish Labour in Palestine.   They are further in consultation WITH the High Com-missioner for Palestine regarding the question, referred to at  (e) on  page 166  of theCommission^ Report, of providing credit facilities for Palestinian agriculturists.     7.  On the  important subject of  constitutional development, the Commission ofEnquiry have made  no  formal  recommendation, beyond urging  that  when  thequestion again comes under review, regard should be had to their conclusion that theabsence of any measure of self-government greatly  aggravated the difficulties  of thelocal administration.  This is a question in which the Permanent Mandates Commis-sion have from the first displayed an  active interest.  In their original observations of November 1924 they expressed their appreciation of &quot; the persistent efforts of  theHigh  Commissioner to secure the co-operation of the Arab majority  in the central administration of the country.&quot;   A year later, in October 1925,  they expressed  thehope that, &quot; an  extension of co-operation, particularly in the conduct of municipaland  district affairs &quot; might become possible  in the  near future. Further references to the subject appeared in the Commission^  &quot;Observations &quot;  both of June 1926 andof July 1927. The position, stated  quite briefly,  is as  follows :  The questions of&quot; self-governing institutions  &quot;. and of &quot; local  autonomy &quot;  are dealt with in Articles 2and 3  respectively  of the Palestine Mandate.  Article 2  makes the mandatoryresponsible for  placing  the country  under  such  political administrative  and economical conditions as will secure (inter alia) &quot; the development of self-governing institutions.&quot;  Article 3  requires the mandatory, so far  as circumstances permit, toencourage local autonomy.  The steps taken  for the establishment of municipal andlocal Councils in Palestine are well known to the Commission.   Nor is it necessary torefer in detail to the attempts that have been made in  the past  to introduce a measureof self-government for the country as a whole.  These attempts are fully described inthe  Report of  the  Commission of Enquiry.  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  desire,however, to emphasize the point that  the absence of any such measure of self-govern-ment in Palestine is directly due to the failure of the Arab representative leaders totake advantage of the opportunities that have been offered them in the past.  It mustbe a primary  condition of any constitutional  change in Palestine that the mandatoryGovernment  should  reserve   to  itself the power of  carrying out  the obligationsimposed upon it by  the Mandate.  The  question formed the subject of conversationwith the Delegation of Palestinian  Arabs  AVHICH  lately came to England for  the
purpose of representing their views on future policy in Palestine. It has been made clear to the Delegation that no measure of self-government could be considered whichwas not compatible with the requirements of the Mandate.  The matter is, of course,one which also deeply concerns the Jewish Agency.    8.  On page 163 of the Report, the Commission expressed certain views  on thedifficulties inherent  in  the mandate.   Their  recommendations  on this point, as recorded on pages 164 and 165, include the issue of a clear statement of policy     (1) containing a definition in clear and positive terms of the meaning  which          His Majesty&apos;s Government attach to the passages  in the mandate for          the safeguarding of the rights of the non-Jewish community in Palestine;          and    (2) laying  down, for the guidance of  the  Government of Palestine, directions          more explicit than any that have yet been given as to the conduct of policy          on such vital issues as land and immigration.    The statement of British policy in Palestine, of which a copy is reproduced on pages 196-199 of the Report of the Commission, was issued in 1922.  The adminis-tration of the country has since been conducted on  the general lines laid  down inthat statement, except that, for reasons already explained, the proposed LegislativeCouncil has never been brought into being.   His  Majesty&apos;s  Government do notchallenge  the view that  a further and more explicit statement of policy is required;and it is their intention in  due course to issue such a statement.   Since, however, nosuch statement could be adequate or complete which ignored the vital questions ofland settlement, immigration  and development, it will  be necessary  to await theReport of Sir  J. Hope Simpson before giving effect to the  Commission^  recom-mendation.  Their further recommendations relating to the functions of the zionist organisation and to the Palestine Zionist  Executive (page 167 of the Report) willalso be adopted when the proposed statement is drawn up.    9.  As  regards  defence  and security, the Commission  on page 163  of theirReport have expressed the view that the policy of reducing the garrison in palestine and Trans-Jordan was  carried out too far.   In this connection the  remarks madeon page 157 of the  Report should be borne in mind.   As is there admitted, thepresence of troops or of British police in larger numbers on the 23rd August, 1929,would not necessarily have prevented an outbreak.  The experience  of April 1920and May  1921, when  racial  disturbances occurred despite  the strength of theGarrison,  points the other  way.   His Majesty&apos;s Government have at present under their  earnest consideration the question  of  the composition and  strength  of thegarrison to be retained  in  Palestine in  the future.  In  the meantime, they  do not propose to disturb the existing garrison of two battalions of infantry plus units ofthe Royal Air force. Arrangements have also been made with a view to ensuring the despatch of reinforcements  to Palestine with the least possible delay if needshould  arise.   As   regards   the  police, effect   has  already  been  given  torecommendation (c) on page 168 of the  Commissions Report, that an independent enquiry should  be made  by  an experienced police officer from some other dependency-into the organisation of the Department of Police in Palestine.  The officer selected for this enquiry, Mr.  H.  L. Dowbiggin,  Inspector of Police,  Ceylon,  arrived inPalestine in January, and his final report is expected shortly.  In the meantime, anadditional 400 British police have been recruited for Palestine, and steps have beentaken to increase the mobility of the British police.  Mr. Dowbiggin has presentedan ad interim  report on the specific  subject of the  protection of outlying JewishColonies;  and action is being taken on  the lines recommended by him.  A further increase in the number of British and Palestinian police is involved, and a. schemeof defence,  including the establishment and control of  sealed armouries,  is being brought into force.  His Majesty&apos;s Government are fully satisfied as to the needfor sealed armouries; without them,  the  adequate defence of the  Colonies  can be ensured only at a prohibitive  cost.   The  question  of improving  the intelligence service and of  forming  a reserve of special constables, which formed the subject ofthe recommendations in  paragraph 53 on page 167 and paragraph 55 (d) on page 168,are being  taken up with the High Commissioner for  Palestine.
    10.  With regard to  the recommendation in paragraph 50 on page 166, thePermanent,Mandates Commission are no doubt aware that the Council of the Leaguehave approved of the appointment of a Commission to define and determine Jewishand Moslem rites at the Western or Wailing Wall.    11.  There remain the recommendations in paragraph 52 on page 167 under the heading  &quot; Press  Incitement.&quot;   The  High  Commissioner  has at  present underconsideration the enactment of legislation to provide  for the better control of thepress.  The suggestion made in paragraph 52 (6) will be duly considered in this con-nexion.  The High Commissioners attention will also be drawn to the remarks onpress incitement included in the Note of Reservations by Mr. Snell (page 181).    May, 1930.o
