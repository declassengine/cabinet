I. INTRODUCTORY   1.  On the 13fch September, 1929, the Prime Minister appointed a  Sub-Committee  of  the Committee of Civil  Research* with  thefollowing Terms of Reference :        To  consider the  Third  Report  prepared by  the Research   Co-ordination Sub-Committee of the Committee of Civil Research   (C.R. (C.) 86) and to submit recommendations thereon.   2.  The Committee is constituted as follows :    Sir Warren Fisher, G.C.B., G.C.V.O., Secretary to the Treasury       (Chairman).   Sir Walter Fletcher,  K.B.E., C.B.,  F.R.S., Secretary, Medical       Research Council.   Sir Robert Greig, M.C., Secretary,  Department of Agriculture       for Scotland.   Sir Daniel  Hall,  K.C.B.,  F.R.S.,  Chief  Scientific  Adviser,       Ministry  of Agriculture and Fisheries.   Dr. F. B. Smith, C.B., C.B.E., Sec.R.S.,  Secretary, Department       of Scientific and Industrial Research.   Mr.  A. F.  Hemming,  C.B.E.,  Assistant Secretary  to  the       Economic Advisory Council, Secretary to the Committee.   3.  The Third Report  of  the  Research  Co-ordination  Sub-Committee dealt exclusively with the question of the organisation ofagricultural research  under Government.    We have accordinglyinterpreted our  Terms of Reference as directing us to re-examine this whole question and to submit our recommendations thereon.   4.  In the course of our inquiry, we received oral evidence fromrepresentatives of  the Departments (other than those represented on our Committee)  that would be likely to be affected by any material change in the existing organisation of agricultural research and also from persons having experience of the organisation of research suchas members of consultative Committees and as Directors of ResearchInstitutes.   Full particulars regarding the witnesses who appeared before us are given in the Appendix.      II. THE  DEVELOPMENT  OF  AGRICULTURAL                RESEARCH  ORGANISATION.   5.  There was little organised agricultural research before  1909,when the Development and Roads Improvement Act, passed in thatyear, brought into existence the Development Commission.   6.  On their appointment, the Development Commission carriedout as rapidly as possible a comprehensive review of the then state ofagricultural research and education in England, Scotland and Wales,and drew up  a programme of development  to meet the needs of thecountry as a whole.  This programme consisted of    (a) the creation  of a group of Research Institutes to work on          specific branches of agricultural science;   (b) the formation of an  Advisory (or  Consultative) service to          assist   in  bringing  Colleges,  Research Institutes and          farmers closer together;   (c) the provision of Research Grants to assist  scientific workers          not on the regular staff of  any Research  Institute;   (d) a Scholarship scheme to assist in the training of new workers          in  agricultural science.   *  Note. By  Treasury Minute, dated the 27th January,  1930, theCommittee of  Civil Research was absorbed   in the Economic AdvisoryCouncil, of which this Sub-Committee became  a Committee.
   7.  Under the terms of the Development Act, the funds providedby Parliament for the  development of agricultural research  were paid into the Development Fund created by that Act.   Applicationsfor grants are considered by the Development Commissioners, whosubmit their recommendations to the Treasury.   When treasury approval has been obtained, the Development Commissioners makea grant from their fund to the  Ministry of Agriculture  and Fisheriesif the research in question is to be  conducted in England or Walesor to the Department of Agriculture for Scotland if it is to be con-ducted in Scotland.  This system has been maintained  to the present day  except that,  after the  exhaustion  of the  original grant to theDevelopment  Fund, the resources  of  that  Fund have  only  beenrenewed  from year to year.   Under this system, responsibility foragricultural research in Great Britain is shared in varying degreesbetween the  two Departments of Agriculture and the development commission.   8.  By 1914 the initial steps had been taken to give effect to theprogramme drawn up by the Development Commission, but the out-break of war put a temporary  stop to its development.  The present organisation,  which  includes  twenty-four Research Institutes and experimental stations, is therefore largely a post-war development.   9. In  1926 there was constituted  a quite separate body, theEmpire   Marketing  Board,  which  though  making  large  grants towards agricultural research,, has  at its  disposal no authoritativeadviser on applications  for such grants.  Further, in 1929 Parlia-ment created the Colonial Development Fund, which has power tomake similar grants for development in the  Colonies.   10.  As its name implies,  the Development Commission set upin&apos; 1909 was essentially  a pioneer body whose main function, so faras agriculture is concerned, was the organisation and developmentof a research  system  covering the whole  group  of fundamentalsciences that serve the  development of agriculture.   The imposingchain of Institutes now engaged on agricultural research is a strikingtestimony to the  success with which the Development Commissionin conjunction with the English  and Scottish Departments ofAgriculture  have accomplished  this task.   HI.-THE  NEEDS  OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH.   11.  Now that the provision of Agricultural Research Instituteshas been  effected and  the mechanism available  for  agricultural research has been brought into  line  with that existing  in medicineand industry, we are satisfied that what remains to be done is theestablishment of a central scientific body responsible for consideringthe needs of agricultural  research  in this  country  and  of thefundamental sciences that  serve the development of agriculture.   12.  Such bodies in the sphere of medicine and industry  already exist as part of the organisation of Government.  We  refer to theAdvisory  Council  of  the Department  of Scientific  and industrial research  and to the Medical Research Council, both of which have represented to us the importance, from their respective points  ofview, of the creation of a parallel Council for Agricultural Research.Once  in  being,   this body would   be the  natural  channel   ofcommunication of the  Government  in  the  field  of  agricultural research with scientific  organisations in the Empire and with the scientific world, generally.   13.  The functions indicated in  the preceding paragraphs canbe best performed by a body  mainly  composed of men of highscientific standing in one or other of the basic sciences on which the scientific development of  agriculture depends.   The development commission  was   designed  for  the  discharge of many duties  inaddition  to  those connected  with  agricultural research.    It  is essentially a lay  and not a scientific body.  We are satisfied thatit would not be possible within  the terms of existing legislation  to convert it  into a scientific body of the kind we have in mind.    [20928]                            -               b 2
   14.  Agricultural  research forms  one of the three main  fields of scientific endeavour applied  to  practical problems  with whichthe State is concerned.  In considering the form of the organisation for the furtherance  of  agricultural  research,  we have therefore thought it  convenient to consider the existing arrangements in the fields respectively of  industrial and medical research.  The efforts of Government for the furtherance of industrial research are con-centrated in the Department of  Scientific and Industrial  Research,the scientific policy  of which  is guided by  an Advisory  Councilconsisting  of  persons of great  experience  in  the  scientific andindustrial  world.   The Advisory Council reports to a Committee  ofthe Privy  Council, the Chairman of which is the Lord President  ofthe Council.   This  Committee  includes  among its  members thePresident  of  the  Board of Education, the President of the Boardof Trade, the Secretary of State for Scotland and other high officersof State.  Parliamentary responsibility for the work of the Depart-ment rests with the Lord President of the Council.   15.  In the  field of  medical  research, the  organisation  is substantially  the  same.  The work is conducted under the controlof the Medical Research Council,  a body incorporated  by RoyalCharter and consisting mainly of men of high scientific attainments.Like  the  Advisory Council  of the Department of  Scientific andIndustrial Research, the Medical  Research Council is responsible  toa Committee  of the Privy Council, of which the Lord President isthe Chairman.   This Committee includes among its members theMinister of Health,  the  Secretary of State for  Scotland  and  other high   officers  of  State.    In  this  case  also,   Parliamentaryresponsibility  for  the work  of  the  Council  rests with  the  lord president,  and, in his absence, with  the Minister of  Health.   16.  The  present organisation  of agricultural  research differsin one important respect from that of  industrial  research and medical research. - In  those cases,  the  Department of  scientific and  Industrial Research and  the  Medical  Research  Council areresponsible respectively for the Institutes connected with them.  Asubstantial part of the work  of these  Councils is conducted throughUniversities and other independent institutions; but in agriculture,research is almost confined  to Institutes  founded by Governmentin the last  twenty years.  The agricultural Research Institutes have therefore  naturally been attached  in England and Wales to theMinistry of  Agriculture  and Fisheries  and in  Scotland to theDepartment of Agriculture  for Scotland.   Those Departments  are thus  in the  anomalous position of  having to obtain  the  funds for their   Institutes  through the  hands of another Governmentbody,  viz., the Development Commission.    17. It is essential that  in any new arrangements for the pro-motion of agricultural research,  care  should be  taken not to impair the close relations between the Departments of  Agriculture and the research  Institutes.   We   consider  that  under  any  scheme  of reorganisation, the Development Commission should be relieved ofits present responsibility in connection with agricultural research.  Ifthis were done, we suggest that the funds required for the financing of the normal requirements  of the  Agricultural  Research Institutesin England and Wales and in Scotland should be provided in futuredirectly on the Vote of  the  Ministry of  Agriculture and fisheries and on the  Vote of the Department of  Agriculture for Scotlandrespectively.   For the  development of  agricultural research,  wesuggest  that there  should be  established  a  body  called  the&apos;: Agricultural  Research  Council&apos;&apos;  which,  like the organisations for  industrial  and  medical  research,  should  be  attached to  theLord  President of the Council.  In  order to emphasise the close association of  the  Departments of  Agriculture  with agricultural research,   we recommend  that  the  Minister  of Agriculture andFisheries should be the Vice-Chairman of the Committee of the privy council to which the  Agricultural Research Council would be respon-sible.  The other members of the Committee should be the Secretaryof State for  Scotland, the Secretary  of  State for Dominion affairs and the Colonies and the  Secretary  of  State for Home  Affairs  (as representing Northern Ireland).  Parliamentary responsibility for the
 Agricultural Research Council would, under this scheme, rest with the  Lord President of the  Council and, in his absence, with the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.    18.   The Agricultural Research Council should be  entrusted, in general, with the development of agricultural research and with the  promotion of the fundamental sciences that serve the interests of agriculture, and, in particular, it should be directed to consider the  developments  and  needs  of  agricultural research  in  this country.   Power should be  given  to it  to initiate  new  lines  of research  into problems  of  agricultural  science  and  to develop existing lines of  research at  Research Institutes,  Universities and elsewhere.   Provision should also be made to enable the Council to make grants for approved  research by individual workers.   The Council should act as the adviser of the Departments of Agriculture and those Departments should be required to  submit to it reports of  the Agricultural  Research Institutes  and  of their financial requirements.  Similarly, it  should  be  the adviser of the Empire Marketing Board and of the Advisory Committee of the  Colonial Development Fund  on all  applications  to  those bodies  for grants towards agricultural research. Further, the Council should confer with the  Medical Research Council  and the Advisory Council for Scientific and Industrial Research  for  the purpose of  concerting plans for research into scientific  problems  having in addition to an agricultural  also  a  medical  or  industrial  aspect,  and  should be available  for  consultation on  questions of agricultural research by the  Ministry of  Agriculture  and Fisheries,  the  Department  of Agriculture  for Scotland, the Treasury,  the  Colonial   Office  and other Departments of  State,  and  by the  Ministry of Agriculture and other Departments  of Northern Ireland.   The Council should also be  available for consultation by Departments on such economic applications of the biological sciences as are not more appropriately dealt with by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and the Medical Research Council.   Finally, the Council should act as the  channel of communication of the Government in  the field  of agricultural research with scientific organisations in the Empire and with the scientific world generally.    19.   The members of the  Agricultural  Research Council should be appointed by the Committee of the Privy Council for Agricultural Research.   The Council should be small, consisting of, say, eleven persons, of whom  eight  should  be  appointed  in  respect  of  their qualifications in  one  or other of  the  basic  sciences  underlying agriculture,  after  consultation  with the  President  of   the Royal Society.   The other  three  members  should  not necessarily  be appointed in respect of their scientific qualifications  but should be. men of wide  experience, and in their selection, regard  should be had to  their interest  in  agriculture.  The  members of the Council should  be appointed  for a  fixed  term of  years, but  should  be eligible for re-appointment.   The  Agricultural Research  Council will  need  to work  in close  contact with  the  Medical Research Council  and  the Advisory  Council  for Scientific and  Industrial Research and it would be of advantage to all if some of the members of the Agricultural Research Council were  also members  of the two other scientific Councils.  The Council should have the power, with the approval of the  Committee of the Privy Council for agricultural research,  to appoint one  of its  members  as Chairman  of  the Council.  Also, with  the  approval of the Lord President and  after consultation  with the President of the Royal  Society, the Council should have power to appoint a Secretary to the Council, who shouldbe a person  possessing high scientific qualifications.  The Councilcharged with the duties  indicated in paragraph 18 above, would be  able to  exert  a real  influence on the  scientific policy  of theAgricultural  Research  Institutes.   It would be  the  responsibleadviser  of the Ministry  of  Agriculture  and Fisheries and of the Department of Agriculture for Scotland on all matters affecting thedevelopment of agricultural  research  in England and Wales and in Scotland.   As the adviser of  the Empire Marketing Board  and ofthe  Advisory Committee of the Colonial  Development  Fund, itsviews would  carry great weight in the consideration of all  applica-cations  to those bodies for grants  for  agricultural  research.  In     [20928]                        .                    B 8
addition  we think it essential  that there should be  placed at thedisposal  of  the  Council a sum of money  for  expenditure  at itBsole  discretion by way  of grants or otherwise in the furtherance  ofagricultural research.   We  have not  thought  it  necessary  toconsider  whether  the  sum required for this purpose  should beprovided by a separate Vote for the Council or whether it wouldbe more  convenient to secure the  same end by earmarking for theuse of the Council specific items  in  the  Votes  of  the Ministry  ofAgriculture and  Fisheries and of the Department of Agriculture forScotland.   20.   As in the case of the Department of Scientific and Indus-trial Research and of the Medical Research Council, a report shouldbe prepared  annually  by  the Agricultural  Research Council  for submission to the  Committee of the Privy Council  for agricultural research and should be presented to Parliament  as a command paper.   21.   In the  course  of our  inquiry, we  reached the  conclusionthat the  scientific work of the Agricultural Research Institutes ishampered by the present system under which the  Directors of theInstitutes are required to devote an unduly large part of their timeto correspondence on  matters  of  administration and finance withthe Departments of Agriculture, to the prejudice of their scientificoccupations.  We recommend that the Treasury should confer withthe Departments of Agriculture and with bodies that  give  grants for agricultural  research (e.g., the Empire Marketing Board, theAdvisory Committee of the Colonial Development  Fund, &amp;c.) witha view to  simplifying  the present methods of accounting and  toplacing a larger measure  of responsibility in the governing bodies of the Agricultural Research  Institutes.          IV. SUMMARY  OF  CONCLUSIONS  AND                    RE COMMENDATIONS.   22.   We summarise our principal conclusions as follows :    (a) There is a clear need for the  establishment by the Govern-          ment  of a central scientific body            (i) charged  with  the duty of considering the develop-                ment and  needs of agricultural  research in this                country and of the fundamental sciences that serve                the interests  of agriculture;           (ii) capable of  co-operating with the scientific organisa-                tions   already  existing  under   Government  in                research of  interest not  only to agriculture but to                medicine  and industry;          (iii) capable of  acting  as  the  channel of communication                in the field of agricultural research for the Govern-                ment with the scientific world generally and with                corresponding   scientific  organisations   in   the                Empire.    (b) The functions  outlined in conclusion (a)  above could best          be performed by a body mainly composed of men of high          scientific standing in one  or other of the basic sciences          that serve agriculture.   28.   We summarise our recommendations as follows :     (a) That  there should  be  appointed as  soon  as  possible  a          Committee of the Privy Council for Agricultural Research          similar  to the  existing Committees  of  the  Council for          Medical  Research  and for  Scientific  and  Industrial          Research.    (b) That  the Committee of the  Privy  Council referred  to  in          (a)  above should consist  of  the Lord President  of  the          Council  (Chairman), the  Minister of  Agriculture and          Fisheries  (Vice-Chairman), the  Secretary of State for          Scotland, and Secretary of  State for Dominion Affairs and          the Colonies and the Secretary  of State for Home Affairs.
(e) That there should be established by Royal Charter a body       corporate under the name of &apos;&apos; The Agricultural Research       Council,&quot;  which  should be  responsible  to  the  above       Committee of  the  Privy  Council.(d)  That, in general, the Agricultural  Research Council should       be entrusted with  the  care and development of  agri-       cultural research and of the fundamental sciences serving       the interests of  agriculture, and that, in particular, the       Council         (i) should be directed to consider the developments and              needs of  agricultural research in this country;       (ii) should  have  the power  to  initiate  new lines  of              research  into problems of agricultural science and              to  develop   existing  lines   of  research,  such              research  being undertaken through  existing agri-              cultural Research Institutes  or at Universities  or              elsewhere;       (hi) should  have  power to make  grants  for approved              research  by individual workers;       (iv) should  act  as  the advisers   of  the  Ministry  of              Agriculture and Fisheries and the  Department of              Agriculture   for  Scotland,   which  Departments              should be required to submit to the Council annual              or  periodical reports of the Agricultural Research              Institutes and of  their financial requirements, and              similarly should act  as the advisers of the Empire              Marketing  Board and of the  Advisory  Committee              of  the  Colonial  Development  Fund   on   all              applications  to those  bodies for  grants  towards              agricultural research;         (v)  should confer  with the Medical Research Council and              the Advisory  Council for Scientific and Industrial              Research for  the purpose of  concerting plans for              research into scientific  problems,  having in addi-              tion  to an agricultural, also a medical or industrial              aspect;         (vi) should be available for consultation on  questions of              agricultural research by the Ministry of Agriculture              and  Fisheries, the Department of  Agriculture  for              Scotland,  the Treasury, the Colonial Office  and              other Departments of  State,  and by the Ministry              of Agriculture and other Departments of Northern              Ireland; and should also be available for  consul-              tation by  Departments  on  such  economic appli-              cations of the biological sciences as are not more              appropriately dealt  with by the  Department of              Scientific and Industrial Research and the Medical              Research Council.        (vii)  should act as  the  channel of communication of the              Government  in the  field of   agricultural research              with scientific organisations in the Empire  and              with the scientific  world generally.  (e) That the members of the Agricultural Research  Council        should be appointed by the Committee of the Privy Council        for Agricultural Research.  (/)  That the Agricultural  Research  Council should consist of        eleven persons, as follows :          (i) eight persons selected on  account of their qualifica-              tions in one  or other of the  basic sciences  under-               lying  agriculture,  after  consultation  with   the               President of the  Royal Society;         (ii) three persons not necessarily  appointed in respect of               their scientific qualifications, who should  be men               of wide  experience,  regard being  had  in then-               selection to their interest in agriculture.  (g) That the Agricultural Research Council should have  power,         with  the approval of the Committee of the Privy Council         for Agricultural Research, to appoint one of their members         as Chairman of the Council.
(h)  That, with the approval of the Lord President of the Council      and  after consultation with the President of the  Royal      Society,  the Council should have power to appoint a      Secretary  to  the  Council,  who  should  be a  person      possessing high  scientific  qualifications.(i) That Parliament should be  asked to provide a sum sufficient      to cover the cost of the necessary administrative expenses      of the Council and to provide a sum for expenditure by      the Council on the furtherance of Agricultural Research      whether  by grants or otherwise.(j) That  the Agricultural  Research  Council  should  prepare      annually a Report for submission to the Committee of the      Privy  Council  for  Agricultural  Research,  and   for      presentation to Parliament as a Command Paper.(fc)  That the necessary powers should be obtained for :        (i)  the termination of  the system under which money             for  Agricultural Research  is voted by Parliament             to  the Development Fund  from which, with the             approval  of  the   Treasury,  it  is subsequently             transferred to the  Ministry  of Agriculture  and             Fisheries or to the Department of Agriculture for             Scotland;      (ii)  the funds required for financing the normal require-             ments of the Agricultural Research Institutes in             England  and Wales and in Scotland to be  pro-             vided in  future  directly  on  the Vote  of  the             Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and on the             Vote of  the Department of Agriculture for Scot-             land respectively.(I) That the  Treasury  should  confer  with the Departments of      Agriculture and with the Empire Marketing Board  and      other  bodies  which  give grants  towards  agricultural      research with a  view to simplifying the present  methods      of  accounting  and  to  placing   a  larger   measure of      responsibility on the governing bodies of the  Agricultural      Research  Institutes.(Signed)N.
