(30)CABINS T.IRAQ, TREATY NEGOTIATIONS.         2J ^)COPY NO-____/             y             y            /Msmorandum hy the Seeretary Of State for the Colonies.     The following heads of policy on the question of theposition of the British Forces in Iraq after 1932, whenIraq enters the League of Nations, are suggested by LordThomson and myself for consideration by the Cabinet  :&apos;-     (1) The view of the High Commissioner that, even in opposition to the wishes of the Iraq Government, a british force must be retained in Central Iraq, if not permanently,at any rate for the duration of the new Treaty,  should notbe accepted.     Under the High Commissioner1s proposal we should remain morally responsible for maintaining internal  security in Iraq without either  legal  sanction  or  adequate means  fordischarging that responsibilityc   Moreover- whereas  theretention of a force in Central Iraq might be  desirable  incertain circumstances  (e.g.,  if the good  will  of the  IrQqGovernment were assured, and  thetr had  shown themselvescapable of maintaining  internal order  unassisted),  such  anarrangement would be indefensible in the&apos;  face  of hostilityby the Iraq Government, or in the absence of evidence  thatthe Iraq Government could manage  their own affairs  without our assistance.     (2) The Iraq Government  should be offered the  followingarrangement.   The Royal Air Force to  remain at  Hinaidi  forthe first five years after the entry into force  of  the                             -1-
     Treaty and at the expiration of that period  (i.e. 1937),     if the Iraq Government so desired, to withdraw to Basra,     or, with the consent  of  the Iraq Government,  to  acquire, in     addition to Basra, another station possessing a  better     climate, such as Habbaniya, the process  of withdrawal in     either case to  be  completed so  scon  as  alternative     accommodation was  available and within  a period  not  exceeding     three years  (he., by 1940).      (IT.Bo The  period might possibly be reduced  to two  years if     the Iraq Government  pressed for this,:)           The above  proposal  would  allow  time to  test the stabilit:/     of  the Iraqi Administration and the  local Government1s     ability  to preserve  internal  order.    At the end of  the five     years&apos; period His  Fa;] e s b y&apos; s Government would be  in a position     to  judge whether  their forces  In  Iraq could  safely be  divided     between  Central and  Southern  Iraq,  or whether it would be     wisor to  concentrate those forces at Basrai           (3) A permanent lease of en air and seaplane base at     Basra must in  any case bo obtained from the  Iraq Government.      In  the  Interests  of  Imperial  defence, it in  essential that     His  Iv&apos;a jesty&apos; s  Government should be assured  permanent occupation      of  an air  base  at  the head of the Persian Gulf.           (4) The  arrangement with the Iraq Government should provide      that  Iraq  would contribute to the cost of the alternative      accommodation  required by the Royal Air Force on withdrawing      from  Kinaidl,  the  contribution taking the form of compensation      for the  cantonments, etc. to  be relinquished by the Royal  Air     Force at Hinaidi and Mosul,  which were constructed at the  cost      of  Imperial funds .                                            P.Colonial  Office.      27th  May,  1930.
