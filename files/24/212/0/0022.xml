Copy no.^p0i?s  (SO)                        THE ROMAN WALLo         Memorandum; bjrthe^J?irstj3omm^^^ ^^- IL^SESS.0          1 wish to report, for the information of mycolleagues and for a Cabinet decision as to future actionsthe position as regards the Roman Wall, the surroundings ofwhich along a portion of its extent * in Northumbsriand? are threatened by a proposal to carry out quarrying operations0A Mr. Wake of Darlington has acquired a lease of the mineral rights over an area of land about five miles long? where the wall runs across a great ridge of whine-bone.  The ridge dropssteeply to the north and the wall follows the line of thecliffo  In many respects this is the most impressive stretchof the Roman defensive system in this region.  The generalaspect of the countryside is little altered from what it wasduring the Roman occupationa          Mr. Wake is working in conjunction withMessrsc William Shepherd &amp;  Sons? Ltd.? tarmacadammanufacturers of Rochdale and elsewhere? in the  promotion ofthe  scheme for starting quarrying operations on  a large scaleon part of the area over which Mr.Wake has the mineral rights the  promoters claim that the stone  of the ridge  will provideroad material of excellent  quality, that It can  be workedcheaply;, and that they will be able to provide work for somehundreds of men who are at  present  unemployed.         - Mr.Wake has already been  operating a quarry  of  an experimental character, for a few years past, at a break  inthe  whinstone ridge * not far from the place where he nowIntends to begin quarrying.  No  outcry was raised at the  timebecause the quarry was  at  the end of the ridge and seemed  tobe harmless.  I gather  that it is on the strength of the experiments carried out at  this  quarry that MroWake hasdetermined to embark on operations  on  a larger scaleo          Prom the walls which looks northwards  over a sheercliffs the whinstone slopes towards the south? and it  is  onthe  southern  side  that Mr.  Wake  proposes to quarry.  On this side of the wall runs the  vallum or ditch? which is  earlier in date than  the wall?  and  between  the ditch  and the wall  isthe  Roman military road  (via Militarist   The proposedquarrying  operations will  take place between  the Wall  and theVallum, which here run  at  some distance apart.   Mr.  Wake  isunder  contract not  to quarry within ten feet  of  the  wallitself, and he is  quits willing  to  extend  the ten feet to  a.reasonable distance.  Neither will  his operations interferewith the vallum,  and he  states that he does not  think  that thmilitary road will  be  interfered with  and  certainly  will  notbe destroyed.  He  estimates that in the 48 years of  his lease                                                        his
Ills quarrying operations will be conducted within an area ofabout 100 acres between wall and vallum, but as this includes the land to be left between the wall and the quarry face and between the vallum &quot;and the quarry floor, the area to beactually quarried will be lessffl  Mr. Wake has given theDepartment to understand that he would be content to confinehis operations to this area of 100 acres, and he was understood to say that the area to be actually covered by thequarry would be round about 40 acres $          In order to make the position clear9 1 attach a mapwhich shows in pink edging the area over which Mr. Wake hasleased the mineral rights from Sir Hugh Blackett for 21 years,?with an option of renewal for another 21 years a  The portioncoloured pink represents the area of about 100 acres referredto above *  1 attach, also a copy of a letter from Mra Wake,dated the 20th February$ 3.9SO, which contains a brief statementof his cases          Mra Wake claims that he has found in the whinstonein this particular place the best&quot; material for road makingthat, in the course of years of experience^, he has yet seezuHe has made careful and thorough plans for working it? and Inorder to avoid competition has acquired rights over a farlarger area than can ever be quarried in his lifetime.  the enterprise includes not only arrangements for quarrying andcrushing materials at the quarry but transport by wire ropesto a point on the railway at Melkridge Village nearHaltwhistle Station (where grading plant will be erected) andquay accommodation at Gatesliead for the unloading of bitumen(used in the process)) from abroad and for the transport ofthe finished road materials   He reckons at present to proceed at the rate of 200 working days a year? getting 1?000 tbns aday, ioeo he expects to quarry 200,000 tons a year0  Thebuildings for receiving and crushing the whinstone at thequarry will be some 60 feet high and 200 feet long of steelconstruction, covered with galvanised sheetings  Mr0 Wakesuggests that he will be able to make them fairlyInconspicuous, but there is bound to be some disfigurementto the landscape and a certain amount of noise,s  More seriousstill,, the quarrying as it progresses will tend to create ameaningless cliff on the southern side.? quite inaccessiblefrom the souths and out of all relation to the natura-lfeatures which dictated its line when the frontier of the roman Empire was being marked out9          The siding to which I have referred has, I gather,just been shut down owing to trade depression and Mra Wakemakes the serious point that he will be able immediately to employ a number of men, round about 200, who are  (at any rate,many of them) definitely out of work  This is confirmed bythe local Labour Party who have made strong representations to me on the subjects  The latest resolution that I havereceived from them is to the effect that s&apos;We urge theGovernment to give immediate consent for quarrying to be commended in view of the need for employmente believing as wedo, that the principal portions of the Wall ca-n be preservedwithout danger by quarrying operationsGw          It is probable that the area between wall and.vallum cannot be regarded as scheduled under the Ancient-Monuments Act, but only the actual structure of wail., road andvallumc.  On this point I am obtaining the advice of the LawOfficers of the Orownj &quot;but it seems certain that I. mustultimately
ultimately ask for special legislation to enable mydepartment to protect tlie wall and its surroundings as awholes  The immediate problem^ however^, is whether or notMr. Wake Is to be allowed to proceed with quarrying at all9and9 if he iss to what extent?   I have examined thequestion on the spotP and having regard (i) to the fact thatthe quarrying will not affect.a very large area, (II) thatthe work, if successful^ will give &amp; measure of badly-needed employments, and (ill) that,, unless the scheduling can.be held to cover the whole of the area between wall andvallum, I cannot take any effective action except after acomparatively long period,, in which matters would have toremain In suspense % my own persons.1 opinion is that It willbe impossible&apos;to try to atop the work and that thereforeMr. Wak^. might be told at once that he may proceed with thequarrying in the limited area in question^ on theunderstanding that It may be necessary to impose some reasonable restrictions to prevent the ultimate effect from being too unsightly*   It may even be found practicable to limit Mr. Wake to a smaller area t3aan 100 acres, perhaps tothe amount of stone that could be worked within the nextSI years.          If the line of action which I have suggested were agreed upon, there would be time to consider properly what further legislative action is needed,, and on what lines thequestion of compensation either to Mr. Wake or to the owner of the mineral royalties should be dealt witho  On thequestion of compensation., I cannot say much at present j ast have not yet asked Mrc Wake to divulge full details ofhis actual and prospective commitments^ neither do I know .the terms of his agreement with the mineral owner0   ButsIf he is willing to give this Information^ I will endeavourto frame an estimate of the probable compensation toMr, Wake and to the mineral ownero          The course I am recommending will not commend itself to archaeological opinion  in this or other countries?Indeed? my advisers on ancient monuments in my own department do not see eye to  eye with me in this matter and consider that no new quarrying operations should be allowed in the vicinity of the wall.   I  attach a copy of a reportby Mr * CJ*R* Peers, the Ghief  Inspector of Ancient Monuments,in which he summarises the advise&apos; which he has felt boundto give me in the mattere   I also annex b, copy of aResolution which I have received  from the Ancient MonumentsBoard for Englandc  I desire  the  Cabinet clearly tounderstand that., were I considering the question solely asFirst Commissioners I should  unhesitatingly support these views.  But I am charged with a certain degree ofresponsibility for dealing with employment in the Countrysand I must look at the subject from a wider angle.   I amImpressed by the claim of Mra Wake and his associates thatthey are promoting a new enterprise which? it is claimed,,will create employment in an  area where there is acuteindustrial depression^,   The  enterprise iss I know,, acommercial speculation and doubts have been raised&quot;as to theprospects of success? &quot;but the promoters have faith in the enterprises, and seem to have  laid their plans with greatthoroughness o  As I have already  saidj, local labourassociations have urged on me the Importance of not standing in the way of a project which will lead to increasedemployment in the neighbourhoods  If the enterprise shouldfails it Is possible that very little permanent damage wouldhave been donecThere
            There  Is  a  further point.   Mr0 Wake9s scheme for  quarrying  has  already reached  an advanced stages,  He has, it  is understood, sunk a considerable sum of money  ( 20,000 has  been mentioned)  on  the purchase of sidings at Melkridge and  a wharf  at G-ateshead, and in other directions *   I gather thatj  be expects that  the initial capital  expenditure  required for  the  enterprise will be In the  neighbourhood  of  48,000, but  I have no  very definite  figures*  The money.spent has, of  course,  been spent  from  Mr0 Wake*s point of  view in a  perfectly  legal  and proper manner and with an entirely  legitimate objects  &apos;l am advised that be cannot  now be  restrained from  carrying on his business without legislation,  although it is possible  that we might negotiate  a settlement  on restricted  lines as has already been suggested, and I  need hardly stress  the objections In principle to attempting  to pass  restrictive legislation of . an&quot; adJajoc character  dealing  with an  individual enterprise even though means be  provided for the payment of compensation.    The  whole  subject  of compensation  in respect of capital already sunk  and  for  prospective profits and. mining royalties would also  raise a  difficult issueo  There is also the  question of  Parliamentary  time  which is a  very serious considerationo            As I have already saldj, the course of  action which  I recommend will, if  adopted,,  most likely arouse vehement  criticism, and we shall  be charged with allowing one of the  great monuments  of  history, to  be tampered with in a way which  other countries, proud of their national possessions, would  not  toleratoo    My  reasons for recommending  this course of  action are founded  on the great need that exists for giving  our  people employment and on the practical difficulty of  using the  recognised  legislative methods of  this country to  deal with  the  situation  in any. other way   I am  also  Impressed  by the fact that, if the course I  have outlined is  not  taken, I must ask for authority  to pay. compensation not  to save  the actual  wall  and vallum,  which are not in any  danger present or prospective, but to preserve their  surroundings only in  one rather restricted areae   The  remaining  part of the wall and its approaches, which I  personally consider to be of as great historical interest,  can  be preserved for  all time  by legislation            I can  only  sketch in outline the kind  of  legislation that would be required^  It seems clear that  what is  wanted is power  to- plan the  area on  either side of  the  wall so as to give reasonable protection to  It at points  vrhere it might be threatened by damage or Inappropriate  development0   Until a plan were drawn up by  experts it  would not  be possible to say how great an area should be  kept free  from development and what  compensation, present  or prospective,  would be involvedo   But any  proposals for-  legislation would be  framed generally on lines which have  become familiar  in  connection  with Town Planning, and 1  oannot at  present enter  into detailso            It may be sufficient if  I  conclude by  putting the  three possible solutions of the present problem  side by  side0(1)    I  might  prepare, and present  to Parliament  a Bill the  object of  which  was to restrain M:c  Wake from proceeding  further  with his enterprise, and to  compensate him for his  loss,,  I do not  know  that there is any precedent for such  a course,  and  I  am  not at all  clear  what kind of reception  such, a Bill would be  likely to meet.
(S)     I  might  negotiate  a settlement -with Mr. Wake on the  lines that  he oould operate  over a very restricted area  subject to  very definite conditionso   Compense/tion might bo  involved as well,  and even legislation to  confirm the  settlement? but,  at any rate?  Mr* Wake would not be left In a  state of uncerte,inty and there would  be ample  time to promote  legislation),  whether merely  to confirm the agreement or to  protect the wall  as a whole.,(S)     As regards this latter  point, it appears  to me that  whatever sortition is adopted,  I must  Introduce a Bill to  enable  me to  protect the surroundings of  the wall, and, x  think,  of other ancient monumentsa           The Cabinet ma,y like to know that I  am considering,  in consultation with the Minister of  Healthy the insertion.  In the  new  Town Planning Bill, of provisions enabling my  Department  to co-operate with Planning Authorities in the  protection  of the surroundings of ancient  monuments *  In a  separate Bill, or possibly In the Town Planning Bill, I  should  like to take powers to plan, on the initiative of my  Department, the area immediately round a  monument with the  view to the preservation of  its amenities^ If a settlement  is made with.&quot;Mr.  Wake on the lines suggested in the second  solution put  forward ahove,  1 might deal  with  the problem of  the wall as a whole under the powers  to which  1 have  just  referred, and there might be no need  to promote a Bill to  deal specially with the wall,,           It  will he evident that the course I have suggested  for dealing with Mr. Wake *s  enterprise has the merit of  simplicity  and of speedinesse  It definitely limits the amount  of damage as  well as of oompensation0 Its demerit  Is that  it falls short of perfection..H.M.

The course of the Wall is 73 miles longs a great part of it is obliterated by modern buildings and modemroads,  This applies chiefly to its east and west ends? themiddle section, running through thinly populated country.,being the best preserved,,   Here the chief danger has beenfrom farmers in need of stone for sheds and boundary walls,the general aspect of the countryside being little alteredfrom what it was during the Roman occupation.   How much longer this may be the case it is hard to say, but sofortunate a survival is rare, and deserves to be jealouslyguarded.   The best, and also the most significant part ofthe wail is the 10 mile stretch between Sewingshields andGreenhead, where the wall runs along the crest of the WhinSill, visible from a long distance, and proclaiming itsdefensive purpose in the clearest manner^  To the north thewhinstone falls steeply, and often precipitously?  to thesouth it slopes downwards in broad green &quot;hillsides,, at the foot of which, runs the frontier dyke which marked, for a fewyears the northern frontier of the Roman Empire, untilexperience showed that the northern tribes would only respect j:a line which they could not cross with impunity.   The lie of [the land tells its own story*   Into this setting has come in modern days the road called after General Wade, though not constructed till after his death? it brings traffic but little building, so faro  To the south of it runs theHewcastle-Carlisle railway, a more potent factors   Just tothe west of Greenhead, where the Whin Sill ends, the railwaycrosses the line of the Wall, and for several miles east ofthat point it runs at no great distance to the south of it.The result is plainly to be seen.   At Walltownf and atOawfields, 3 miles to the east of Walltown, quarries havebeen established to work the wbinstone, being within easyreach of the railways-  They work slowly, but what they domeans the complete obliteration of the history andsignificance of the placeo   The damage must be acoepted, butit has gone far enoughc  The new threat to the wall and Itssurroundings9 a far more dangerous one, arises from the same-cause - nearness to the railways   The &quot;fact that a lease hasbeen obtained over the mineral working as far east as MossKennels beyond Eousesteads shows what is in the minds of itspromoters, though they may never be In a position toexercise their powers over the whole area   The new point of attack is to the east of Oawf ields, and its line ofdevelopment must be eastwards?  If It comes Into being, morethan a third of the ten mile stretch will have been invadedoOnly extreme national urgency should condone thisdestruction of a national monument.   And no such urgencyexists a   The matter is a commercial speculation, arid onfuller information It Is very doubtful whether thepromoter5s statements are really justified.   Even if theywere, the matter amounts to nothing more than this, thatthe financial results of such an enterprise  -  If he beallowed to proceed  -  are to be held of more importance than the preservation of a monument which has not only been scheduled as of national importance,  but isknown throughout the civilised worlds
125,  Victoria Road,  DARLINGTON.     20th February,  T930The Secretary,  HoMo Office of Works,      Storey1s Gate,           SoW. 1Dear Sir,         I have your letter of the 11th instant, with maps,  whichI beg to acknowledges         Unfortunately, the area marked on these maps covers thewhole of the Basaltic Whlnstone ridge that I have acquired,  and IfI am prevented from working this, I should sustain very serious losses.  I have already spent many thousands of pounds in connectionwith this scheme which is an important one, and upon which I have spent a great deal of time.         I acquired the rights on this Basaltio.Whinstone some time ago and did not expect that there would be any difficulty such as you now raiseB         My scheme comprises the working of the rock at one or two points on the ridge.  The rock is to he roughly broken at thequarry sites and finished at the Blackett Sidings, Melkridgevillage, which I have bought for this purpose.         The operations will be fairly extensive and about 200 men will be employed in a district where a. great deal of unemploymentexists.         A great deal of work has already been done In connectionwith this scheme, and, as above stated, considerable expenditure has been Incurred.and other large&apos; commitments have been entered into         I may here state that I have an expert knowledge of thepreparation of materials for road making and am the inventor of new types of machinery and processes for preparing  such materials.         The design, of the new machinery, plant, etc., to be usedin this scheme is of the latest type and will,  it is expected, be one of the most efficient In Great Britain.         The quality of the rook on this ridge  is one of the bestin England, for road making, and I have a number of reports fromexperts together with  tests made by the National PhysicalLaboratory and chemical analyses which confirms these statements.         I believe that I shall be able to produce road materia.1of the best quality, in large quantities and at low prices, by thisscheme, and such material is badly needed for the roads.         The position  of the quarry that I propose to work on thisridge  in the first instance is one of the least interesting in thearea marked on the maps sent by  you.  I have personally visitedthis site at least one hundred times during the past three years                                                             at
at various periods of the year and at different times of the day,and I have never seen during these visits any tourists on this area.         Ho possible damage can be done to any of the Romanremains, and the plant that is to be erected will not interferewith the public&apos;s inspection of the Wall and Roman remains andwill not be unsightly.         The quantity of stone in the area marked by joti isenormous, and there is sufficient stone in this area, which is covered by my lease, to last for a thousand years, at a largerate of output.  The area that it is possible to work, to meet all demands, within the next fifty years is very small indeed in comparisona         I personally am very interested in the Roman remainsand will take care not to damage or destroy anything of interest or allow anything to be done which will restrict the access ofthe public to see these remains.         If a representative of yours could visit the place with me I Gould point out to him what is proposed.         If my scheme is stopped a considerable amount ofpermanent work for men will be lost, a very large sum of moneywill have been thrown away and fine prospective business, ofinterest to the whole community will be destroyed and heavy losses will be caused, I believe unnecessarily.         I hope that matters will be considered from all points of view before any attempts are made to stop this scheme.  With afull knowledge of the subject, in my opinion, there Is no reasonable  justification for interference and an Impartialenquiry will, 1 think, confirm my views.         I may say that the plant will all be driven electrically,and. the power will not be generated on the spot.         The structures will be of substantial character and notunsightly.         It is proposed to bring the workmen to the  quarry bymotor omnibuses and not to erect workmen*s cottages  on  the  site.                     Yours truly,(Sgd)  JOHN Fo ,WAKE.
Copy of a resolution from the Ancient Monuments  Board                     for England         The Board respectfully advises the first commissioner that in its considered opinion no quarrying,building or other works likely to alter or deface thenatural setting of the best preserved portions of the RomanWall should be permitted between the Wall and Vallum andfor a reasonable distance on either side of both.  TheBoard fully realise that such an area cannot be protected by existing legislation and it feels very strongly that power should be obtained for dealing with this and othercomparable cases.         The Board considers that the quarrying operationsproposed by Mr. Wake should not be permitted to materialiseeven in a modified form, as the particular stretch affectedis the most impressive and the best preserved of the wholeline of the Wall,  There is already a large and importantbody of public opinion opposed to the continuance of theexisting quarries on the line of the Wall.  If a new under-taking of this description be allowed to proceed theeffect would undoubtedly be to discredit the general administration of the Act and create a precedent that wouldhamper future progress in the protection of ancient monuments.         The Board realises the difficulties which willhave to be  faced as regards  compensation and some possibleloss of employment, but  in view of  the immense  importanceof  the whole Wall and  its unique Interest, it is unanimous in  recommending  that  every effort should be made to preserve  this historic area  intaot.
