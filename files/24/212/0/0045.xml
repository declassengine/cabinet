PHIS DOCUMENT  IS THE P2QP3RT:f OF HIS BRITAIN 10 MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)E C R E T               CABINET.     NAVAL CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMME, 1950.REPORT BY THE COMMITTEE ON THE FIGHTING SERVICES.1.     The preliminary note by the First lord of the Admiraltyaccompanying the Naval Estimates for 1930 contained thefollowing statement         &quot;As to future ship building the Government have          decided not to formulate any proposals until          the results of the Naval Conference are known          and have been fully considered.   No provision          is therefore made in these estimates for          commencing an3r further new construction in 1930,&quot;         &quot;As soon as the Government are in a position to          inform Parliament of their intentions a statement          will be made on the subject and if necessary, a          supplementary estimate will be presented.&quot;2.     The Admiralty have now reviewed the general position..in the light of the London Naval treaty and have put forward a provisional programme covering the financial years 1930-31-32 and 33 which years govern the complete tonnage figures tobe reached in 1936 in accordance with the provisions of... theTreaty.3.     Briefly.the Board of Admiralty make the following proposals: -  (a)  Cruisers.  That 3 6-in. cruisers should be laid down       in each of the programme years 1930-31-32-33,         (If the Australian Government are unable to lay down          cruiser in replacement of II.M. S. &quot;Brisbane&quot; , the          Admiralty would propose to lay down an additional          ship in one of the years .1931-33).
         No new construction of cruisers carrying a gun         over 6.1 in. will &quot;be necessary during the years under         consideration.     (b) Destroyers.   That a programme of one flotilla         a year should he adopted.         In making this suggestion the Admiralty have         accepted the risk of not possessing a fully         efficient destroyer force in the matter of age, of         a tonnage allowed by the Treaty, before the end of         1941, but they are prepared to accept this risk,         subject to the satisfactory outcome of the Franco-         Italian negotiations.     (c) Submarines.  That 3 submarines should be laid         down each year-.     (d) Vessels not covered by the London Naval Treat?/.         That 4 sloops should be laid down in 1930 and 5 in each of         the following years, and one net layer in 1930-   it         is stressed that many of the sloops are of         considerable age and that an adequate programme for         their displacement is essential.4.     In considering the Admiralty&apos;s proposals the FightingServices Committee have taken into particular account thefollowing points:-  (l)  The undesirability of committing ourselves too far       ahead before knowing the outcome of the Franco-Italian       negotiations.   It would be undesirable to run the       risk of having to increase an already published       programme in the event of these negotiations reaching       an unsatisfactory conclusion.  (2)  On the other hand the Committee consider it important       to counteract., at this juncture, the idea which was
   - prevalant, particularly among the French Delegation at    the Naval Conference, that we cannot,  for- financial    reasons, construct up to the tonnage accepted at the    Conference. (3)They also consider it desirable to avoid excessive    dislocation, of labour in the dockyards hy too sudden    a drop in the construction programme.   Even with the    proposals now made it will be necessary to discharge    about 1,000 men charing the current year.5.     The Fighting Services Committee therefore proposethat only the 1930 construction programme  should now bedecided, upon and. that no commitments for future  years,except in so far as the latter will be affected bjrconstruction started in 1930, should now be entered into,and. in view of the considex-ationsAentioned in the preceding paragraph, they agree to accept the Admiralty&apos;s proposalsfor the present year, namely:-Cruisers.Destroyers.1 Flotilla (1 leader and 8 T.B.Ds)Submarines3.Sloops.net layer.1.This programme will involve a supplementary estimateof about  30,000.
