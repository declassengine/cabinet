REPORT.THE SELECT COMMITTEE appointed to consider the possibility of    this House meeting earlier in the day and rising at a more    reasonable  hour- in the evening  and to recommend, if they    think fit, the necessary., alterations in the Standing Orders    have agreed to the following report      . .  1. Your Committee met five times for the purpose of hearing-evidence,  and  examined  seventeen witnesses,  including  Mr.Speaker, Lord  Ullswater, a  former  Speaker, the Leaders and chief Whips of the three principal  Parties in the  House, and representatives  of the Scottish Labour, Welsh and LancashireParliamentary Groups.  2. By their very limited &quot;Perms of  Reference the recommenda-tiong  which  your Committee are empowered to make  are re-restricted to the question of the hours at which the House  should meet  and rise  uhde$&apos;&apos;the present conditions - regulating Parlia-mentary business. &quot; And although, both in question and answer,certain far wider issues were touched upon to which allusion willbe made in a later paragraph, the examination of witnesses was mainly focussed upon two points, namely :     (i)  Whether the House  could advantageously  meet at an          earlier hour and rise proportionately earlier; and    (ii) Whether there was any  simple means of avoiding  very          late sittings..............................  3. As regards the first  point, only one of the witnesses, therepresentative of  a Parliamentary  Group,  proposed that theHouse /shohldLmeet: in::the::morning.  The great bulk-  of theevidence went  definitely  against such; a  proposal, both on theground  of the  difficulty  that,  under  such an arrangement,Ministers would have  in attending to the work of their Depart-ments, and on  the ground that professional men would thereby be practically debarred^ from &quot;becoming  Members of  Parliament.  4. The possibility of a definite change resolved itself, therefore,into that of  meeting at  two o&apos;clock instead of at 2.45,  and  ofnormally rising at  10  or  10.15 instead of at 11.  Although theGovernment  Chief Whip supported it, the weight of  the evidence was against  this proposal also on the ground that  the possible advantages were outweighed by the probable disadvantages.  Theattitude of some of,the witnesses&apos;who spoke from the point ofview of those Who are, or have been, responsible for  the arrange-nient. Of Parliamentaryr business may shortly be summarised- asbeing theoretically in&quot;favour.:  They were, however, not all con-vinced that it would be possible in practice..  ;  It was contended that  no advantage could be gained by sittingthree-quarters of an hour earlier,,unless the normal hour of risingwas correspondingly  advanced. &apos; With regard to  the question  The cost of printing and publishing this Report is estimated bythe Stationery Office at  1  0s. Od.
whether  sittings  after  midnight, through  suspension  of  theStanding Order, would  be made  less  frequent, all the witnesseswere invited to give then opinion.  They replied that the change would not have this desired  effect.  The evidence that carriesgreater weight on such  a question is,  obviously, that of party leaders and Whips.  Your Committee are bound to record thatthe evidence of these was almost unanimously to the effect that,if the normal  hour of suspension  of business under the standing order were changed to 10 or 10.15, suspensions of the standing order  might  be more, rather than less, frequent, and  that thechange would  do nothing to diminish the possibility of all-nightsittings.   These witnesses generally affirmed that the occurrence of all-night sittings was not affected by the time of the suspension of  business, but by other and more general considerations.  5. As regards the second point, the prevention of  very late, or all-night,  sittings,  witnesses with most experience  were agreedthat the only  decisive method of  accomplishing this would be to diminish both the  amount of  business taken on the floor of theHouse, and,  by some  means or other,  to shorten procedure.Various interesting suggestions of a far-reaching character weremade by important witnesses,  which will be found in the Minutesof  Evidence.   Your  Committee were, however,  debarred by thelimitation  of  their  Terms of Reference from  considering,  ormaking any   recommendations  on,  such proposals as that  toincrease the powers of the Speaker or  Chairman of  committees to  close debates,  the limitation  of speeches, or the devolution to  other bodies of  certain business now  done in the House itself.  They are bound,  however, to record their opinion that thequestion of the  hours of meeting and rising is only an Infinite-simal part of  a wide and pressing problem into which  inquirymust  be made  as a whole.   They consider that  the  time is rapidly approaching when an  exhaustive review of the whole ofParliamentary procedure  will  have to be  made  by a Committee-with  appropriate  and wide terms of reference,  an opinion inwhich they are fully supported by the  evidence given before them.  6. Notwithstanding the preponderance of the evidence actuallygiven against  any change  at all in  the  hours  of meeting  and rising  of the  House, your Committee  are convinced that thereexists  a  strong feeling among many Members  in favour of anormally earlier hour of meeting and rising ; and they feel thatthe convenience and  health  of   Members  are  very important considerations.  For this reason  they recommend that Governments should be strongly  discouraged as  much as possible from  suspending the eleven o&apos;clock rule.  They further recommend,  especially for  the  convenience ofMembers  living at a distance, that the  normal hours of meeting and rising on Fridays  should  be changed to  10 o&apos;clock and3 o&apos;clock  respectively, and that  the  Standing Orders should  be amended  accordingly.
