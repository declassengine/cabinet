Report by the Colonial  Office  delegates  to  the    Pre limlnar y  Conference held  at  Paris  on          May 12th and  13th,  1930.          Before proceeding  to  report  on  the  proceedings  ofthe Conference it will be convenient to recall  thecircumstances which led up to the  issue by  the  FrenchGovernment of invitations to the  Conference  to  theGovernments of the other Colonial  Powers.     2.   In June 1929 the International  Labour Conferencediscussed a draft Questionnaire on the subject  of forced labour, the replies to which were  to form  the basis  of  a&apos;  draftConvention to be discussed at the  Conference  in June 1930.Various of the Continental Colonial Powers  were obviouslyapprehensive as to the effects  of  such a  Convention  and inDecember last we learnt that there  was a movement afoot to getthe five Powers principally  concerned  to agree  among themselves as to a joint policy and to  preserve a united front  at  Geneva.The idea appears to have originated with  the  InternationalColonial Institute at Brussels  and the suggestion was put tothe French Government by the Belgian Ambassador at Paris.     3.   The next move was  an  intimation  that  the portuguese government were very desirous of having a  private exchange of views with other Colonial Powers  on the answers to bereturned to the Questionnaire,  and a note  was received  fromthe French Ambassador on the 3rd  of January,  indicating thatthe French Government were disposed to agree.          On the 14th of February  a note  was  received  from theFrench Ambassador asking if  His Majesty&apos;s  Government would be disposed to participate in a Conferencevof  Colonial  powers at Paris to study &quot;dans un reunion prive^e  ......  &quot;I1 attitudea adopter lors de la discussion ou Conference des questionsposees&quot;.     4.   There is little doubt that Portugal,  France  (andprobably Belgium) would have very much preferred theConference to have taken place  before  Governments were  publiclycommitted to any definite views by replying to  the I.L.O.Questionnaire.   But owing,  no  doubt,  largely to the difficulty which was experienced by ourselves and by  the other  Governmentsmainly  concerned, in formulating replies  to the Questionnaireby the date at which they were  required by the  I.L.O.,  andalso owing to the delay which had  occurred before a  definiteproposal for a Conference had. been put forward, the  Conferencedid. not materialise at this  stage o  Mr.  Vernon, however, on several occasions had conversations with  the  PortugueseAmbassador and with a member of the Italian Embassy. Alsoadvance copies of our replies to  the Questionnaire were communicated to the French,  Portuguese, Dutch and belgian governments.     5.   Actually, by the time the Conference  assembled, notonly had the views of all the Governments  concerned  been disclosed by the publication of their  replies to the questionnaire, but the draft Convention produced by  the I.L.O.had been In their hands for  some  weeks.26253 - 100 E J1.FORCED LABOUR .
      6.    The British Government&apos;s attitude towards the proposed Conference was that they could not agree to participate in a reactionary &quot;bloc&quot; at Geneva, but that,  on the  other hand,  it would be useful for them to be represented at the  preliminary Conference as it was felt that their representatives  might be able to exert a moderating influence on the  other Colonial Powers and also because we should learn a good  deal about the attitude of the other Powers, which would be useful  to our representatives at Geneva in June.  At the  suggestion of H.M.G. (which had to be pressed somewhat strongly on the  French Government) the I.L.O. was also invited to send  representatives to the Conference.      7.    The instructions to the  British delegates at the&apos; Paris Conference took the form of Notes on the Articles of the draft Convention with directions as to the amendments desired by the  British Government, and as  to the attitude to be adopted  towards  amendments which it was contemplated would be put  forward..by other Governments.      8.    The Conference assembled in Paris on the 12th of May,  and a list  of the delegates is annexed (Appendix I). It will  be seen  that M.Albert Thomas, the Director of the I.L.O.,  attended personally and was accompanied by Mr. Weaver (who  had produced the &quot;Blue Report&quot; and was mainly responsible for  the  draft Convention).  Italy and Spain were represented by delegates as  well as the five principal &quot;Colonial&quot; powers. On Mr. Vernon&apos;s  motion (which was  carried unanimously) the Chair was taken  by M.Jules Gautler (France), who had presided over  the Committee which had dealt with this question, at the International labour Conference at Geneva last year.      9.    On arrival in Paris vre enlisted the good offioes of the British Embassy to ask for  adequate arrangements for interpretation at the Conference.   No professional interpreter was however present at the meetings and in tho circumstances we waived our request that speeches in French should be translated into  Englishe   In order however not to be put at a disadvantage Mr. Vernon explained  that he proposed to speak in English  and certain of the delegations asked that his speeches should  be interpreted in French.  The task was undertaken by a  member of the French Foreign Office, but  as he was not accustomed to interpretation, and as he was also engaged  in taking notes of the proceedings, the arrangement was not  altogether satisfactory.     10.    A copy of the minutes of the proceedings is annexed.5 As a  record of the discussions they are rather inadequate, but we  do not feel that it is necessary in this report to elaborate them in detail except in connection with the more important of the points discussed.  They give the impression, which is not in  accordance with the facts, that amendments to the  draft Convention were formally proposed and put to the  Vote.     11.    Generally speaking the &quot;alignment&apos;&apos; of the various delegations at the Conference was  very much as might have been expected from the published replies of their respective Governments to the Questionnaire.   The Portuguese Representative opened  the discussion by a general attack on the idea of  a Convention on forced labour, which, he urged, was neither necessary nor desirable.   Ultimately, however, after it had  been pointed out to him that even apart from the merits(s Not reproduced).
of the question various  opportunities  afforded by the  Leagueof Nations and L.L.O. procedure for  &quot;blocking&quot; the  Conventionhad not been  taken by his Government,  he  tacitly  abandoned  this attitude.  Nevertheless  he  continued  throughout the  conference to oppose the provisions of  the draft  Convention  Article by article.          The British delegation was  the  only one to express,on behalf of  its Government, any enthusiasm for the  draftConvention, or to propose any amendments  designed to tightenup its provisions.  There is no doubt  that the French  and belgian Governments share,  to a very  considerable extent theviews of the  Portuguese  Government,   On the other hand theirrepresentatives were clearly fully alive  to the hopelessnessat this stage  (especially  in the. presence of the Director  ofthe I.L.O.) of attempting any whole3ale weakening of theprovisions of the  Convention, and their efforts even to securesupport for amendments designed to entrench specific forms  offorced labour were much  less vigorous  than might  have  been expected.   This was quite  obviously due, to a very  large extent,to the very plain indication which was given by Mr.  Vernonof the determination of His Majesty&apos;s  Government  not to bedrawn into any concerted attempt to weaken the Convention buton the contrary to endeavour to strengthen it.  Moreover,although there was an ostensible display  of the frankness andplain speaking which might be regarded as appropriate  toa &quot;private&quot; Conference of the Colonial power, it was  clearthat the presence  of M.  Thomas had a moderating influence which,while it did not obscure the fundamental  divergence  of viewsrepresented by the British  delegation  on  the one  hand,  and  bythe Portuguese), French and Belgian delegations on the  other,nevertheless made  the position of the  British delegation lessuncomfortable than it might  otherwise  have been.    12.   M. Albert Thomas  found himself  placed in the agreeableposition of being able to assume an attitude of judicialmoderation between the &quot;die hard&quot; conservatism of Portugal  andthe attitude  of Great Britain which was clearly regarded by therepresentatives of the other Powers as unduly progressive if not actually&apos;quixotically impractical.   In the circumstances heY/as able to defend the provisions of  the  draft Convention asbeing not only reasonably progressive  but also practical.As indicated  above, this undoubtedly had  the effect  of stiflingany extensive attempts to weaken the  draft.    13.   In  the course  of  the Conference it was  agreed thatM.Thomas should report to the Committee of Experts on  NativeLabour (which was due to meet at Geneva on Hie 15th of May) thevarious views expressed  at  the Paris  Conference in order thatthey  could consider them when examining the draft Convention.After that he hoped to submit to the  Conference in June, a revised draft of the Convention which would be prepared by  theI.L.O. in the  light of the  observations  of the Committee  of experts.  We  gathered that  M.Thomas  hoped that before  theConference assembles, it will be possible to  produce a draftacceptable  to all  the Colonial  Powers.     14.   The discussion on Article  1 afforded  an early ^     ] opportunity  of indicating  the  general attitude  of His  Majesty s Government  towards  the draft Convention.  Mr.  Vernon made  it quite  clear  not only  that  His Majesty&apos;s  Government consider that an International  Convention on Forced Labour  is  desirable,
but that  the  Idea  of  the  indefinite  continuance  of  forced labour is so  distasteful  to  them  that  they had hoped  thatit would  be possible  to fix  a  definite  period within  whichall forms of  forced labour should  be completely  suppressed.In fact His Majesty&apos;s  Government might  feel  it incumbenton them to propose at  Geneva in June that the Article  shouldbe amended to provide  that the &quot;transitional period&quot;  shouldnot exceed 5  years .          This announcement  produced a  marked effect  on theConference.   It removed  at  the very outset  any hopeswhich the other delegations  may have had that it would bopossible for  the Colonial Powers to agree on a commonreactionary policy which  they  would maintain at  Genevawith a united front.   Beyond, therefore, a  few  protestationsthat the abolition of  forced labour in  five  years wasimpossible, there was  little further disoussion  on  thisArticle, and  the Conference  proceeded with the examination ofthe Convention, Article by Article , In  a rather  subdued andpessimistic atmosphere.    Nevertheless it was felt that toretreat from  this position prematurely might give the .Conference an inadequate  impression of  the determination of His Majesty&apos;s Government  to press for a strong convention.No indication was therefore  given  during the first day.of the Conference that His Majesty&apos;s Government would  beprepared to agree to a less  drastic provision.          A3  the discussion  on the following Articlesproceeded, however, it became  clear that the proposal  was generally regarded as  so  fantastically  impracticable  as to invest the discussion  on  the conditions to be observed duringthe transitional period with an air of  unreality.  Mr. Vernonaccordingly took an early opportunity  on. the second day ofthe Conference to enquire whether  the  other  Powers  would \agree to an Article in. the terms set out in  the  Instructionsto the British delegation (see Appendix II). This  enquiryhad an immediate effect in relaxing  the tension  (which had become rather oppressive) and  a lively  discussion followed.There was no  opposition to the principle of  the  clause, butthe other delegations  were unanimous in declaring that no useful purpose would be served by  a re-examination  oftho subject by the Conference  in  so  short a  period  as  5 years.   M. Thomas pointed out that  the proposed Articlewas flexible, in that  it  would rest with the governing body to say whether the progress  which  had  been made  had been sufficient to justify  their  placing  the subject  on  theAgenda of the Conference  in  5  years&apos; time.    nevertheless there was still a  general demand  for a  ten year  Intervaland as M. Thomas was  disposed  to  support this on the analogy of Articles inserted in other  I .L.0.Conventions,Mr. Vernon ultimately  intimated that,  provided the  viewsof His Majesty&apos;s Government  on the other articles ofthe Convention were received by the  other  Colonial  lowersin a  liberal  spirit,  he would  recommend His  Majesty sGovernment to agree to the proposed  Article  being amended to provide for a further  discussion  in 10  years   time.    15.   Article  2.           There  was  some  discussion on the  comparatively minor  points  of  (a)  the  use  of the term &quot;forced  labour&quot;and  (b)  oh an amendment to  paragraph (b)  proposed by theBritish delegation,  and M.Thomas  promised  to examine the drafting of  the  Article in the light of the  views  whichhad  been expressed.
          There was however  (as  we  had  expected)  a  fundamentaldivergence  of views between  the  British and  French  delegations,,on  the question of military  conscript labour,  and the  Frenchview received a considerable measure of support from other delegations.          The French  delegation  made it quite  clear that  notonly were they not prepared  to accept Mr,  Vernon&apos;3  amendment to  secure that conscript  labour  should  be  used exclusivelyfor military and not  for  public  works purposes, but also  thatthey would  not agree  to such labour being  limited to a periodof  12 months, as proposed in the  draft  Convention.   Moreover(after several attempts at evasion) Mr. Vernon succeeded  inextracting  from them  the  admission  that their  acceptance  ofthe stipulation that  the  provisions of  the Convention should apply to such labour, did not extend to the  payment of themarket rate of wages.          After a lengthy discussion which completely failedto move the French delegation from  the  position which theyhad taken up, Mr. Vernon  made it  clear  that  their intransigenceon  the questions of wages would  leave His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  no alternative but to  propose at  Geneva  the amendment&quot;which he had indicated,    M. Gautier accordingly intimated that the Conference could do no more than  to take note of theviews which had been  expressed.     16.    Article 5.          A3 instructed Mr. Vernon  pressed for the  earlyabolition of the employment of forced labour for  contractorsengaged on  public works,  and under  Government  supervision.Hone of the other delegations were  prepared  to accept this amendment.  In fact the Belgian  delegation argued that, by imposing stringent conditions in their  contracts, it wouldbe  possible for Governments  to  secure better conditions forforced labourers employed by Contractors  than  were  in factlaid down in the Convention for  observance by  Governmentsemploying such labour direct.  They promised however to reconsider  the question in the light of a  suggestion byMr. Vernon  that no new contracts  involving the employmentof  forced labour should be entered  into.     17.    Article 7.          There was unanimous  opposition to  the  British proposal to delete the words  &quot;in the exercise  of  their dutyof  encouraging the populations  under  their charge to engage in  some form  of  labour&quot;.   Even M.Thomas supported  theretention  of  these words  on  the  ground  that the  I.L.O.jdid not wish  to  confine  itself  to the  negative role of&quot;assisting  in  the  suppression of  forced  labour, but  regarded it a s  its  duty to encourage  habits  of  free labour.   he pointed  out that  in  spite of the opposition of the  WorkersGroup  the  Conference  last year  had decided to retain  these words.   He indicated howover  that he  would consider  thequestion  of modifying the drafting of  the Article.      18.    Article  10.           Various  of  the  other Delegations  criticised this Article on the grounds that its provisions are much too rigid. In accordance with his  instructions, however, Mr.  Vernon explained that,  generally speaking, it was  in accordance with the  views  of His Majesty&apos;a  Government  who are  anxious
iJ) 0 2that  the  control  of  the employment  of forced  labour  should rest  in the hands  of  the  central authorities  to as largean extent as is practicable particularly  in cases wherethe employment involves the workers sleeping  away from  their home a .    In accordance with this view, His Majesty&apos;3Government would  wish the  last sentence of the Article(which allows the  central  authority to delegate to subordinate authorities power to requisition  forced  porterseven v/hen the work will entail their sleeping away fromtheir homes) to be amended in such a way  as to ensurethat  the powers so delegated to subordinate authoritiesare only exercised in exceptional circumstances, and  thatthe ultimate responsibility should rest with  the centralauthority.          M. Thomas undertook that the InternationalLabour Office would reconsider the text of this article in the light of the views  which had been  expressed.    19.   Article  11.          The Portuguese Delegation urged the deleoion  ofthis Article, and  in  particular of stipulation (c)  (i.e.that no recourse  should be had to forced  labour unless  ithas bean found impossible  to get voluntary labour at  theCURRENT rate of wages).  Mr. Vernon, however, explainedthat His Majesty&apos;s Government could not possibly accept such an amendment  as  they  attach the greatest importanceto the principle  involved. .    20.   Article  12.          The expedient adopted by the International LabourOffice in lumping  together, in one Article, the regulations to be applied to  labour in lieu of a tax  (&quot;prestation&quot;)and labour for Chiefs who  exercise administrative functionsdid not commend itself to  any of the Continental Delegationswho, in fact, were unanimous   in urging  that &quot;prestation&quot;labour should not  be  regarded as &quot;forced&quot; labour, butas a fiscal measure and so should be exempted completelyfrom the operation of  the  Convention under Article 2.          Mr. Vernon, however, pointed out that if yet another category  of exempted labour were  added to Article 2,the Geneva Conference would lay itself open to the accusation that It was, in effect, declaring  in one Articlethat forced labour 3hould  be abolished and in the nextArticle exempting  so  many  forms of forced labour that theConvention would be valueless.  He explained  that this sort  of criticism  would be peculiarly liable  to arise inEngland where the  conception of prestation is not understood.He also said that  His Majesty*3 Government felt that  therewere no grounds for exempting prestation labour from  (atany rate) the safeguards  incorporated in  Article 12.  Therepresentative of  the  Netherlands was in  agreement with thisview though for somewhat different re as ons .    He thoughtit desirable to maintain  the principle that the &quot;prestation&quot;system should ultimately be abolished.           Eventually, as  a compromise to meet the suscep-tibilities of the  Continental Delegations, it was agreedthat  prestation labour should be taken out of Article 12and added to the  list of exceptions in Article 2, with,however, a proviso that such labour should be subject to the safeguards at present incorporated In Article 12.
9 .0    21.   Article 14.          Mr. Vernon explained that His Majesty&apos;s  government feel very strongly that the employment  of forced  labour should not in any circumstances  be permitted for  a  period in excess of 60 days in any one  year.   To have to  resort to such labour for prolonged periods  could only be  regardedas a confession of failure by the Administrations  concerned,since in such cases which by their very nature  involvemuch detailed organisation in advance,  they ought  certainlyto be able to make arrangements  for recruiting  the  labour required through the normal voluntary channels.  He  pointedout that in Article 1, it is laid down,  that recourse  toforced labour is only to be regarded  as an exceptionalmeasure.   To provide for such labour to be employed for prolonged periods would be quite  contrary to  the  spiritof Article 1.   The use of the word &quot;normal&quot; in the first paragraph of Article 14 was open to the same objoction.His Majesty&apos;s Government would accordingly feel obliged  topress at the Geneva Conference for the deletion of  thesecond paragraph of this Article and  of the word  &quot;normal&quot;in the first paragraph.          A prolonged discussion followed in which thoFrench and Belgian representatives made it clear  that theywould find it very difficult to  agree to such an  amendment.As neither side would give way,  the President intimated  thatthe Conference could do no more than take note of  thedivergence of views which existed between the British andthe other Delegations.    22 .   Article 16.          Mr. Vernon explained that the proposal  in theInternational Labour Office draft that  labour for  Chiefswho exercised administrative functions  (Article 12) shouldbe  exempted from the stipulation as  to the payment ofwages was due to a misunderstanding of  the reply  returnedby His Majesty&apos;s Government to the relevant question in the Questionnaire.    While, it is  true that  it is  not atpresent possible in all cases for such  labour to  be paid at the full market rates, labour of this kind in  the  british colonies invariably receives some form  of remuneration,  andIt is the desire of His Majesty1 s Government  that the.Convention should include a provision to the effect that payment for such labour at full  market  rates should bointroduced as noon as possible.          There was no opposition to  this proposal, and  therepresentatives of the International  Labour Office undertook to prepare a revised draft,    23.   Article 20.    Mr. Vernon explained  that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would wish  this  Article  to be amended to provide that where medical&quot; examination  of  forced porterswas not practicable,  the  person  employing  such  labour should be held responsible for   ensuring  that  the personsemployed are  physically fit,  and not  suffering  from anycontagious disease.  After  some  little  discussion the other delegations  acquiesced  in this  proposal.     24.   Article  21.          Mr.  Vernon1a  intimation that  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment  do not  regard  compulsory cultivation as ameasure  of  agricultural education to be justified was, (as  had been anticipated)  received with much concernby the  Belgian Delegation,  who attach very considerable
imp or tance to the principle, which they regard as entirelysalutary in, the interests of the natives thorns elves j  aidit cannot be denied that there was a strong feeling  (whichwas but thinly disguised) that In this matter the attitudeof His Majesty&apos;s Government was that of &quot;a dog in the manger&quot;.It was, in fact, practically suggested that the  system havingbeen successfully employed In British Protectorates  when.conditions were less advanced, and having served its  purposeof inducing habits of industry and providence (for exumple,in the native cotton industry in Uganda) the BritishGovernment now wishes to prevent other more backward  tropicaldependencies from benefiting in the same way, and thusbecoming economic competitors of our own dependencies.          The Belgian view as to the justification of takingforcible measures to inculcate industrious habits receiveda certain amount of support from M. Thomas.          Mr. Vernon explained that he fully appreciated  thepoint of view of the Belgian Delegation, but he  asked whether,If they were not prepared to agree to the Immedlateprohibition of forced labour of thi3 kind, they  would beprepared to agree to its abolition after a fixed period offive years.  The Belgian Delegation replied that the  verynature of the circumstances in which they contemplate theemployment of such a system (i,e., the backwardness  andindolence of the natives concerned) renders it extremelydifficult to lay down any definite period of time withinwhich they would be prepared to give up the system.   in response, however, to a further appeal by Mr. Vernon, theBelgian Delegation promised that before the Geneva Conferencethey would consider, in as sympathetic a spirit  as possible,the possibility of agreeing to the abolition of  this  formof forced labour In a period of (say) ten years .     25.   Article Y and Z.          There was some discussion as to whether these articles are not mutually contradictory, and also as  to theterms of Article Z, but as the Portuguese  representative  hadalready at an early stage of the Conference tacitly  abandonedhis objections to the idea of a Forced Labour Convention,the discussion on these Articles did not amount  to  verymuch, and no amendments were suggested.     26.   In connection with the draft Re commendationconcerning indirect compulsion to labour,  the French delegateexpressed, the view that it raised large questions of generalColonial policy which were not suitable for discussion at an.International Labour Conference.  M. Thomas   thought thatrecommendations  outlining a general policy had  proved valuablein  the past but he appreciated the force  of  the  Frenchcriticism.   He  suggested that the recommendation should  boredrafted in a form which would instruct  the  I.L.0.  to draft a statement  of the principles which  should determine thepolicy  of Governments  in  connection  with  the  development  oftheir Territories.  M. Moresco,  the Dutch delegate  said  thathe  thought  that  this was assigning  to  the  I.L.O. a  task  out-side  its  proper  functions.  Mr. Vernon said  that theBritish  Government was  quite  satisfied with  the  re commendationas  drafted,  and  this appeared  to  be  generally accepted.Colonial Office,   24th May, 1930.
