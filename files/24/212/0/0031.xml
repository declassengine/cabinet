2U  5b&quot; DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC H*UfESTYaS QOTERMMEHT.                         G A B I g g T.                Transport and Road Development.P.            memorandum by the Minister&apos; of Transport.  1(30).              The  Cabinet may like to have before thern a brief note     on the  position of Unemployment Schemes affecting transport and     electricity.         2.   Under the Home Development  Act,  schemes  in respect of     undertakings  for which, as  minister  of Transport, I am     responsible,  have already been approved to the following amounts            Railways (excluding  railway-owned  docks)   20f millions            Railway-owned docks    ...    ...    ...       3^ millions            Other  docks and harbours     ...    ...       3f millions            Electricity undertakings     ...    .vu       11  millionsTotal      39  millions    (A further  10 mi111on definite applications are under          c consideration de rat ion) *     So  As regards Roads, In addition to  4% millions approved in respect of unclassified roads through the Unemployment GrantsCommittee, schemes have been approved for commencement under the trunk Road programme up to an amount of about  3,400,000 andfurther schemes have been approved in principle to an amount of nearly  9 millions, making total approvals of over  12 millions.I have made suggestions for some further expansion of this programme,     4U  Under the Five Years programme and under the ordinaryannual programmes of improvement and new construction ofclassified roads we have approved for commencement schemesamounting in all to  9,800,000 and have approved in principle(under the Five Years programme) further schemes amounting to 11J millions, making total approvals of  21 millions^   These
latter works will be executed by the  local  authorities  over aperiod of five years and only a  proportion  of  them will giveemployment in the next year or so.     5,,  The rate of progress depends upon  the local authorities-Ho opportunity is lost of urging and assisting them  to  attain asatisfactory rate of execution but it is not possible to startmodern road works without proper engineering preparations and insome cases parliamentary powers are reqiiiredc     6.  At the request of the Lord Privy Seal, I have  especiallyconsulted Sir Henry Maybury and asked him what further  expenditurewe could hope to achieve in the next two or three years if we wereprepared to anticipate still further traffic needs and to find thewhole  of the cost.   It will be seen from the annexedcorrespondence that in his opinion the most we could hope to attain would be an expenditure of  20,000,000 over the  next three to four years..   An expenditure on this scale would provide workfor between 20,000 and 25,000 men a year directly and indirectly..We should however encounter great difficulty with those authorities who have already agreed to put substantial works in hand and tobear a proportion of the cost themselves;  many local authoritiesbefore starting work have pressed for an assurance that no better terms  would be available.   Any additional employment resultingfrom the offer of 100/? would therefore be heavily discounted bythe suspension or retardation of the rest of the road programme-.,It may safely be assumed that many looal authorities would staytheir  hands in the hope that they,,too, will get the fall 100,CWe must expect j. too, that a grant of 100$ would nave its reactionson other programmeso         Moreover, I am in.principle opposed to 100$ State grants and I  have in all negotiations kept this view clearly in mind.
                          c                          Q ea         Any suspicion that we were even contemplating a departure of policy in this matter would have an tinfortunate effect and Iam sure that my colleagues will regard Sir Henry MaybupyBs report as very confidential.

m CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION              3,8, Ahingdon  Street, OF THS CABINET.                               Westminster, S.W.I.                                        27th May,Dear Ministers         X Lave your letter of even date, wherein you refer tothe schemes of road construction and improvement towards the costof which Very considerable grants have been indicated  from theRoad Pundo   The amount of money which it is contemplated to expend upon what is described as the 55?unk F^o&amp;d programme is LVj? million poundso   This sum makes provision for the re-construction of trunk roads(including the construction &amp;fby-passess and the strengthening of weak bridges on the line ofthese roads) and yoxi inform me that these works have been selects&apos;and decided upon, in consultation with the Local Authorities ofthe countryj who are contributing some proportion of the COSTO         In addition you have approved the expenditure of afurther  22 * millions upon a five years programme   The worksprovided for herein ere of major importance $ quite a number ofthem being situate %n Counts?- Boroughs,, or in proximity to largepopulous centreSo   The grants under this programme ensure to theLocal Authorities interested an additional  15% above the normal 5,conditionally that the Authority undertakes to find employment for an agreed number of men from the depressed mining aa?eas0         You are good enough  to invite my  opinion as to whetherfiii my view,, yo\ir programmes are on a proper scale for thedevelopment and improvement of the higbwajr system of the country5,and as to whether thej?- m&amp;y be considered sufficient to meetreasonable transport reguirementso   My answer to this enquiry is in the affirmative.   in my view9 if these very necessary workflare undei^taken and pursued with due diligence p then indeed greatSir Henry Maybury has assumed THAT the increase in the     mi-lliox originally sanctioned for the Trunk Road Programme will be met by a corresponding reduction in the Five Year Programme, ( NTDO)H.MJ
 ijsapiNjvements will  be  effected,  with the result that  the  roads  wii; he widers sefer5 stronger and more  durable *         I find  it difficult  to make any suggestions which would lead to  greater  expedition in the execution  of these workssbecause although ;something may   be done by  personal  interview end influence with the leaders of the  Highway Authorities  and their officials, the pace at which  work, proceeds ir  almost entirely in their hands-.         In addition,  to  the schemes already  enumerated^  I know., of course, that you have sanctioned expenditure upon, certain special  works s such as the Dart ford - Purfleet Tunnel, which whilst not only having a considerable unemployment value,, will, when completed, be of much assistance to transport movements         You tell   me that it has been suggested in  certain quarters that a much  greater  expenditure s to be financed byborrowingo could and  should &quot;be  incurred In connection with the road system9 and. that this expenditure could be concentrated in a short  period of  time aad so provide &quot;immediate employments   There is no doubt that,  if  money were availableg something additional to sliar you have already sanctioned could be undertaken s much upon the iiri.es of the procedure which,  the Department  followed,  -JJS the earlypost-war years..    Those  works included new schemes in which thelocal Authorities  evinced but little interest, but which., whenput lii hand, did in fact provide a  considerable amount of additional employment..    Amongst these were  the construction of the Sonthend Road  with its tributaries;   the opening up  and reconstruction of  the Vatling Street in Kent?   the enlargement of parts of the Dover Jioad  to Grave send;:   the enlargement and reconstruction of  the London  -  Folkestone Load from  Footscray  toWrothaa Heath6 with Les  by-passe sj   the Sldcup,, Orpington^ Grays9 and similar By-Passes;   the East Ham and Barking By-Pass;,   Watford    Barnet JBy-rasssuj   works  in Buckinghamshire s  eta, , etc*
            Towards the cost of the.se s the Local Authoxdties in    whose areas the works were situate merely made token votes, the    greater- part of the cost, falling upon the Road Fund.8   There are    many such works in various parts of the country in which the    Local Authorities take little more than an academic interest at    the present time, hut whichwhen carried outs would mot fail to    he as useful as many of the works which I have enumeratedo             Seeing that practically all the Highway Authorities    in the country have acceded- to your requests and have undertaken    to carry out works of considerable magnitude and cost., they woulc    consider, no doubts that their resources were already heavily    pledged, and I should not be surprised to know that in the event    of their &quot;being asked to make contributions to these further    schemes they would feel themselves compelled to decline    Therefore., if any of these additional works be put In hands, in    all probability the whole cost would have to be found by your    Ministrys with an undertaking from the appropriate Local    Authority that,, when completed, the road or roads should be    taken over as part of the system of the administrative area,             Without binding myself too closely (becausef obviously s    time has been too short since the receipt ?,f your request to go    into much detail) I am of opinion that works such as I have    described might be put in hand to the value of  20 million* and    as the direction of operations would be in the hands of the    Ministry  i&quot;t&quot;&quot;Ts&apos; quite safe to assume that practically the whole    of the above-named sum could be expended within a period of, say,    three years from the date when contracts were let.   Obviously    the survey work and necessary negotiations must take some time f    but r should imagine that, with the display of considerable    energy6 it might be possible in a few cases to mak** aThe London County Council made a substantial contribution to certain  works in the neighbourhood of London conditional upon the  employment of London men (intd,) H,M,
                                                                -    commencement in the early autumn or winter  of  this year9  though    1 should not expect that such employment would be afforded  until    this time  next year,,   The  top of the  curve of  employment    might he expected to he reached, in. the  early summer  of 1952?    and the whole of the work completed some time  in 192%.,    This    procedure may have some slowing down effect upon the  operations    of the Local Authorities,, some of -vrhoni  might he  of opinion  that    they had. not made very provident &quot;bargains when they  agreed,  tr,                           -    make contributionso             I do not think that more than  the  amount I  have    suggested could usefully and economically be exper.ded upon  the    highways of the country in addition to  that already  sanctioned    by yout, and. to which the Local Authorities  are making    contributionsf and therefore I see no justification  for the    proposal ths.t a large sum of money should, be raised  by loan    because in my view there is no immediate transport demand..                                      Yours sincerely,,                                  (Sgdo ) HENRY  1L  ::.TAir.::.H-^Y.                                       Consulting  Engineer0The KTC Hon.R, Zex-bert So Morrison,, Ji&apos;0p.
