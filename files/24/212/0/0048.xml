The positive  recommendations of the Committeeare :     (l)  That the hours of sitting on Fridays should          be from 10 admu to 3  pd.m.     (2)  That the Government  should be strongly          discouraged as much  as possible from          suspending the Eleven O1clock Rule.     20   Fr id ay S i 11 ingsIt  i s already difficult toensure an adequate attendance  at 11 o1clock on Fridays,particularly when there has beon a late sitting on the night before.   Late sittings  are net likely to be abolished except by a drastic  overhaul of the existing system and this proposal of the Committee is not in isolation an attractive one,
see     3,    Suspension of the Eleven Orolock p,ule .          The Suspension of the Eleven O1clock Poule deesnot necessarily involve a late sitting in the sense that members are detained boyend 12.30, when the last trainshave gone.    In this session up to the 4th June inclusive,the rule has been suspended on 44 occasions and the Plousehas sat after 12.30 on 14 of those.   Exempted Businesshas involved sitting after 12.30 on 3 occasions .          There have been 3 sittings beyond 4 a^,:-       Yilidows Pensions;   Committee.......... 0,20 a,ric       Lienta.1 Treatment:  Lords amendments.,... 4.330 a*mo       Finance Bill:  Committee............... 8o5&apos;  a0EicThe Eleven 0Tclock Boole is most frequently suspended  forCommittee work, either on a Bill or  for supplementary estimates.   This class of caso accounted for 20 out  ofthe 44 suspensions this session, and in present circum-stancos suspensi n is the s-nly weapon short of  the guillotinet  ensure the reasonably expeditious despatch of business.It is nut so much the actual, time gainec. that is ofimportance;  rather the effect of the knowledge that progress in Committee cannot be retarded merely byprolonged discussion until 11  orclock, when business  isantomatically interrupted.     In these circumstances;  itis not t? be expected that suspension of the Eleven 0Tcl:ckRule can be dispensed with, or even  considerably curtailed,while the situation remains as at present.     4.   Proposec wider enquiry,          She Committee are right in pointing out that theonly effective method of preventing  late sittings would beto diminish the volume of work, on the floor of  the house and to devise some method of shortening procedure.    Thoexperience  of the present session shows that about one day                            8.
In four devoted to legislation is spent in Committee onthe floor of the House,          One of the most effective ways of relievingcongestion would be to make more use of procedure inStanding Committees.This could be done if(a)  Chairmen were given tho power to select amendments,     and(b)  the size of Standing Committees were reduced and     thoir number increased,A. Select Committee empowered to suggest these and similaralterations in the Standing Orders night do good servicebut I must point cut that there is a risk that unless theterms of reference are strictly drawn such a Committeewould afford an Opportunity to air a number of schemesfor Counittee Government which arc alien to the present practice of Cabinet responsibility.
