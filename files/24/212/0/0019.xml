(Received May 13.)(No. 19.)Sir,                                                     Geneva, May 9, 1930.    I HAVE the honour to inform you that at the final sitting of its fourth sessionthis morning the Committee on Arbitration and Security approved the text of theDraft General Convention for Strengthening the Means of Preventing War, and theterms of its report explaining in what manner and to what extent it has succeeded indischarging the duty imposed upon it by the Assembly in September last.   I enclosecopies of both these documents.    2.   The text of the  draft convention suffers from the obvious blemish that itsprincipal articles Nos.  2 and 3 consist of parallel and largely conflicting  texts.It may be a matter for congratulation that discussions which showed at first so manyand various currents of opinion should have been canalised finally into not more than two streams.   But there is no disguising the fact that the parallel texts represent a fundamental  divergence of view.    3.   It  is unnecessary and might only be confusing to attempt to reproduceat any  length the discussions which took place in the Plenary Committee and in the drafting Committee, or to touch on any but the more important points of differencethat arose.    4.   In the first place, some delegations expressed doubts as to the necessity for and even the wisdom of converting  the model  treaty into a general convention.Prominent  among these were the Japanese, Italians,  Belgians and Poles, and  someat least of  them, while joining in the detailed discussions, maintained to the endtheir doubts on this point of principle.    5.   Apart from that, the main  difference manifested  itself  as  between what may be called the French and the British schools of thought.    6.   At an early stage M. Massigli,  the French representative, made quite  clear the  position of his Government. In the first place, he insisted that,  if the conven-tion was to register any advance on existing obligations, the rule excluding  the votes of the parties to the convention must be  so extended as to apply to all its provisions.Further,  he produced the not unfamiliar  argument  that, if we  conferred on theCouncil fuller powers,  the Council would thereby be  invested with greater  responsi-bility.  If the Council may order one party to a dispute to withdraw its troops, that party must (a) be assured that  its adversary will also carry out the behest of theCouncil, and (b) be entitled to expect that, if his adversary refuses to do so, the latter will inevitably be exposed to sanctions.    7.   I urged  M. Massigli  not to endeavour to devise any  complete  or  rigidformula; it was useless, and  indeed dangerous, to  attempt to do everything at  once.What we contemplated was less ambitious, and yet it might be a real contributionto the work of safeguarding peace.  In a word, all the members of the League were bound, under  article 11 of  the Covenant, by  a moral obligation;  what  we  were seeking to do was to make that a  contractual obligation,  and thus render the pre-preventive action of the Council more certain  and more efficacious.   As  regardssupervision, we must trust to the discretion of the  Council.  The Council had in thepast adopted measures of supervision;  we must expect that it would do so in thefuture  in any case where it might think fit.  As for sanctions, that was going outsidethe  scope of our  convention.   If a  State  evidently  and deliberately flouted theCouncil,  that would be a valuable element in  determining the aggression, in casearticle 16 should come into play. But when we came to the application of article 16we  should obviously have passed right  outside the scope  of article  11, which thisconvention  was designed to reinforce.    8.   Apart from his doubts as to the wisdom of a general convention, the Italiandelegate inclined to the logically complete formula of M. Massigli.    9.   The  German delegate  adopted a half-way position, agreeing  with hisFrench colleague that the actual measures which the Council might prescribe shouldbe defined,  while rejecting the idea of sanctions.       [116 n-1]                                                      B
     10..  The above is a very short summary of the main points dealt with  at theopening discussion in plenary session.     11.  The Drafting Committee, composed of the Czechoslovak, Swedish, German,British, French,  Italian,  Japanese,  Belgian,  Spanish, Polish, Netherlands  andUruguayan delegates, subjected the articles of the draft to a closer scrutiny.     12.  The  Belgian  delegate (Baron  Rolin-Jacquemyns),  who was  appointedrapporteur, produced a  new article 1, which  was in  effect a  combination of theoriginal articles 1  and 2, and  which now refers explicitly and  specifically to non-military measures.  His draft raised no  objection and was  adopted.   He thenproposed that our article 2A should be combined with article 3.   This, of course, atonce raised for me  the difficulty that I was authorised to agree to the application ofarticle 5 (rule of voting)  to article 3 but not to, article 2A.     13.  The  situation  was complicated  by  the  production  at this  stage  byM  Massigli of  an  article in three parts which now appear (in  a slightly modifiedform) in the left-hand column under articles 2, 3 and 3 bis of the final draft.     14.  I  at once declared that I could not discuss this French proposal.   I  hadgrave doubts about the first  part: I pointed out serious  objections to the second,  andI indicated that there was no possibility of my agreeing to the third.     15.  It was thereupon agreed to resort to the usual  device  of drawing up&quot; synoptic texts &quot; of the conflicting proposals, for consideration at a later sitting.     16.  It was then that I came to the conclusion that the only possible basis for agreement might be something on the lines of the text which I submitted to you in my telegram No. 26 (L.N.), and which was approved in your telegram No. 32.   This was,therefore, included in the &quot; synoptic text.&quot;  It failed  to meet with approval fromthe French delegate, whom I believe to have been bound by rigid instructions.  In anattempt to make it more palatable, the rapporteur asked me whether, though I mightbe opposed to prescribing in detail action which the Council might take and  whichmight be imposed on the  parties, I might nevertheless agree that in a case where one party had made an incursion  into the territory of another the former  might becalled upon to withdraw his forces.   I could not but agree that this was justifiable,and I consented therefore to a redraft, which now appears in the right-hand columnunder article 2.     17.  The remaining articles gave rise  to no great amount of discussion.  my instructions now allowed me to agree with the unanimous desire of my colleagues that article 5 (now article 4) should apply to the whole convention,  provided  the formof article 2 was such as I had suggested.     18.  For the final articles (7-14) I submitted a new draft based on the finalarticles of the Nationality Convention signed at the Codification Conference at TheHague, which, I take it, affords the latest model of the  form considered suitablefrom our point of view.  The only point in wdiich they  differ  from the model isthat, at the French request, the third paragraph of article 11 was inserted.     19.  At the final sitting this morning a number of  delegates made declarations,some reiterating their doubts as to the wisdom of attempting to establish a general convention.   Those delegations which are  in the habit  of endorsing in chorus theutterances  of their  French  colleague  duly  played their part  and  indicated theirpreference for the French draft.     20.  I expressed the hope that  in the interval that would elapse before the draftconvention  came to be  examined by  the  assembly   reflection might bring  thedivergent views closer together, and, in the hope that  it  might contribute to that end, I read the following statement  of the British view :      (1) We  are  prepared  to  accept  the obligation of  complying  with  any           recommendation  of  the  Council  designed  to safeguard peace,  provided           we are satisfied that it is not inconsistent with national  safety.     (2) We are averse to doing anything which would directly or indirectly restrict           or interfere with the existing powers of the Council under article 11.     (3) We could not agree  to any extension of sanctions beyond those now provided           in the Covenant.     21.  You-will  observe  that I  was not  able to secure the adoption of certain amendments which  I was instructed to move.     22.  In  the first place, as  explained in  the report,  it  was decided,  afterconsiderable discussion, not  to insert into the preamble any reference to the Pact of paris.     23.  Further, I was unable to convince the committee of the necessity of makingthe addition proposed to  the original article 7.   The explanations which I was able
to afford of the intention of this proposed addition did not, in their view, prove itsutility, and they considered that the object for which it was designed was sufficientlyachieved by the original text as it stood.    24.  I regret that it has been impossible to arrive at a text commandingunanimous assent.  If the Assembly could be brought to  accept the text  shown inthe right-hand column  (which is the most that His  Majesty&apos;s Government could accept), I  believe that that would represent some small, though definite,  progress.At first sight it might seem that it did not amount to very much, but in reality Ibelieve that it would present considerable advantages.   At present, under article 11of the  Covenant,  either  of  the  parties  can prevent  the  Council  making  a recommendation.  Under this text the Council can face the parties with a unanimousrecommendation, the moral force of which would, I believe, be of great value, and if either of them desired to protest against it, their protest  must be based on the one particular  ground   of  national security,  accompanied,  of  course, by  seriousargumentation which would be exposed to examination  and discussion by the Council.M. Massigli, in private conversation, told me that though a convention drawn on british  lines would be, in his opinion,  of  little value,  he  should himself  see noobjection to signing it.                                                           I have, &amp;c,                                                                    CECIL.

Should one of the parties concerned be guilty of a  deliberate  and  persistentviolation of  the prescribed  measures and open  or resume hostilities, without  theCommissioners appointed by the Councilfinding  the  other party  guilty  of asimilar  violation of  the CounciPs pre-prescriptions, the high contracting parties shall  consider  the action so taken as aflagrant and unprovoked act  of  aggres-sion and as  a resort  to war within  themeaning of  article 16 of the Covenant.In such case they agree for their part tocomply  Avith the provisions of the saidarticle, as against the offending State.

Enclosure 2 in No. 1.    LEAGUE OF NATIONS :  PREPARATORY  COMMISSION FOR  THE DISARMAMENT           CONFERENCE.   COMMITTEE ON ARBITRATION AND SECURITY.Preliminary Draft General Convention to Strengthen the Means of Preventing  War.          Report submitted by his Excellency Baron  Rolin-J aequemyns.(C.A.S. 109.)                                            Geneva, May 9,  1930.     THE  Committee on Arbitration and Security was requested by the assembly and the Council to consider whether it would be possible to  prepare a draft general convention on the lines of the model treaty to strengthen the means of preventingwar; this draft might be submitted to the Governments soon enough to enable themto state at the eleventh ordinary session of the Assembly whether they are preparedto accept it.     It is, perhaps, desirable to recall the fact that the  question of strengthening themeans of  preventing war was examined by  the Committee on Arbitration  and security at its second and third sessions on the basis of the suggestions submitted bythe German delegation.  It did not appear  possible at that date to frame  a draftgeneral convention, and the outcome of the committee&apos;s examination was a model treaty, in regard to which the  Assembly of 1928 expressed the hope that it might usefully serve as a basis for States desiring  to conclude a treaty of this kind.   Theresolution  of the Assembly of 1929  instructing the  committee  to re-examine  thequestion was the outcome of the British  delegation^ initiative in the matter.     At its fourth session the  committee examined at  considerable length  the  con-ditions under which it could best  carry out  the  task entrusted to it by the  lastAssembly.  This examination was based on the model treaty itself and on  variousobservations and proposals transmitted to it by a number of Governments both beforethe opening of the session and during the discussion.     The lengthy exchange of views which took place in the committee revealed thefact that the transformation of the model treaty into a general convention raised acertain number of problems of great importance and of  an extremely delicate nature.Certain delegations even  doubted the desirability of converting the model into ageneral convention.     As regards some of these problems, the  committee succeeded in reconciling thevarious points of view, but in the case of others, and in particular the problem ofthe more or less compulsory character of the military measures recommended by theCouncil and  that of supervision and sanctions,  it  was unable to  make uniformproposals.     Owing to these difficulties, the committee could only prepare a preliminary draftconvention, setting out the texts representing the two main  tendencies in regard to articles 2, 3 and 3 bis.  Each of these two texts was  supported by a number of delegaTtions;  other  delegations  made  intermediate  proposals,  or  abstained,  or madereservations.Preamble.     Certain delegations propose that the preamble of the convention should  include a reference to the Paris Pact  signed on the  27th August, 1928.  The  committeeunanimously found that any action designed to strengthen the means  of preventingwar was necessarily in accordance with what was intended when the Paris Pact  was drawn up and signed, but it did not think it desirable to include an explicit reference
to this  matter in the preamble of a  convention  which  relates  primarily to thepacificatory and conciliatory action of the Council of the  League of Nations,  moreparticularly since a number of States members of the League have  not yet acceded to the Paris Pact, and, moreover, some  of the Powers which signed the pact are not members of the League.Article  1.    The committee decided to combine the provisions of articles 1 and 2 of the model treaty into a single article.   The high contracting parties thus agree to  obey any recommendation of the Council designed to prevent the aggravation of the dispute.The committee was anxious, however, to make it clear that the conservatory measures in question must relate to the actual subject of the dispute and must be of a non-military character.  Military measures form the subject of article 2 of the convention.    It was proposed  that the committee should include in article 1 a provision tothe effect that the conservatory measures prescribed  by the Council should have alimited  duration, e.g., three months.  The committee agreed that  the measures con-templated  in  this article are of an essentially  provisional character,  and  must therefore be of limited duration.  It did not, however, think it possible to  lay downin the convention itself a maximum period to be applicable in all contingencies whichmight arise, as these might take most varied forms.  It must therefore be left to theCouncil to fix the duration in each individual case; moreover, the duration can always be prolonged if circumstances render it necessary.    The committee&apos;s  attention was  further drawn to the  fact that article 1  might involve  a duplication of powers if the Permanent Court of International Justice, anArbitral Tribunal or a Conciliation Committee were asked to deal with a disputeand if, under an existing agreement between the high contracting parties concerned,those  organs  were empowered  to order  conservatory measures.   The committeedesires to point out in this connexion that article 1 cannot come into play unless thedispute has been  referred to the Council, and that the convention is not intended to change  in  any way the  conditions under which a dispute may be referred to theCouncil; these conditions are the outcome of the Covenant and cannot be limited byparticular  conventions.   In most  cases  the  Council will very  possibly  find theconservatory measures ordered by the court, by an arbitral  tribunal, or by a concilia-tion commission to be quite  sufficient.  The Council, however, must be allowed theright  to contemplate other  conservatory measures,  in view of the  different andessentially political character of its intervention.Article  2.    Two main currents  of  opinion were revealed in the  committee regarding theprovisions to be  included in this article.    Recalling the German suggestions to which the draft owes its origin and which involved very important preliminary undertakings,  certain delegations expressed theview that, while  they thought it impossible to  assume  indefinite obligations inadvance, they nevertheless considered it essential, if real progress was to be made inregard to the present  state of affairs, that the convention should include limited butprecise  undertakings, the general powers  as to recommendations conferred on theCouncil by article 11  of  the Covenant being in any case safeguarded.   They would,therefore, have to be simple and clear measures, easy to supervise, and such that, ifviolated, there would be no uncertainty  as to the consequences.    The delegations  in  question  further pointed  out  that,  as  it  is a general convention and not a  model regional treaty, the measures in question would have toapply to all  cases which might arise and must, therefore, relate not only to land forces, but also to naval and air forces.    It is with a view to  these considerations that the wording in the first column ofarticle 2 is drafted.  It was  proposed  by  the French delegation and supported by certain  other delegations.    Further, a number of delegations, although prepared to accept the obligation tocomply  with  all  the recommendations of the Council for safeguarding peace whichwere not incompatible with the national  security, expressed  the  fear that  if themeasures which  could be taken by the  Council were enumerated, there might be a danger of weakening the general powers devolving upon the Council under  article 11of the Covenant.  If  the Council were led to recommend measures not explicitlyprovided  for  in  the  convention, the parties might,  by  appealing to the definite
 engagements contracted by them, refuse to apply such measures, and might thereby weaken the moral obligation incumbent upon them under article 11 of the Covenant.     A few delegations, therefore, proposed the text given in the second column of article 2.  The choice of measures capable of diminishing the threat of war or ending it  is left  to  the discretion of the Council.   The  parties&apos;  undertaking to  comply therewith is absolute  as regards the measures prescribing the withdrawal of forces having penetrated into the territory of another State or into a zone demilitarised in virtue of international treaties.  As regards the other measures, the parties cannot refuse  to obey the Council unless they consider that the measures are incompatibleI with their national security.   In such a  case  the  parties  must, however, at onceJ inform the Council of the reasons for their refusal to comply with its recommenda- tions.     One delegation also proposed that the parties might take the same attitude if! they thought their case was one of legitimate self-defence.  This suggestion, however, was not supported by  other delegations.     The two  texts proposed  thus  agree in providing  that  the measures to beI prescribed by the Council for the withdrawal of forces having penetrated into theJ territory of another State or into a zone demilitarised in virtue of internationalI treaties must be binding upon the parties  in all  circumstances.     The committee also unanimously agree that whatever the  wording ultimately- adopted for article 2,  the general powers held by the Council under article 11 of the Covenant cannot be restricted or weakened by the convention.   Such is the  object of article 6.Article 3.    The question of the  supervision  of measures  recommended  by the Councildepends largely upon the solution adopted for article 2.    Proposal  A  is, in the  opinion of  the  delegations which supported it, thenecessary outcome  of  the new responsibility devolving upon the  Council  underarticle 2.  In all  cases the Council will supervise the carrying out  of the measuresit prescribes.    Proposal B regarding article 3 is connected with proposal B of article 2.   Thehigh contracting parties agree to comply with any action on the part of the Councilconsisting in the  despatch to the spot of  representatives to ensure the execution ofthe measures prescribed.   It is for the Council to determine in what cases it will consider  recourse to such  supervision necessary.Article 3 bis.    The delegations which proposed the texts  appearing in  the  first  column ofarticles 2 and 3 considered it essential to specify in the convention the consequences of a violation of the measures recommended by the Council; these consequences may,in certain particularly serious  cases, involve an obligation on the part of the highcontracting parties to consider the violation as a flagrant and unprovoked  aggression and as a  recourse to AVAR within the meaning of article 16 of the Covenant.    Other  delegations considered that the proposed convention must  necessarilyretain its preventive character and must therefore not contain any stipulation whichwould come within the province of article 16 of the Covenant.Article 4.    The committee was of  opinion that the provisions  regarding  the  Council&apos;smethods of vdting should be extended not only to articles 2 and 3 but  also to article 1.If this stipulation were not extended  to article 1 that article would have  littlepractical value, since the  parties AVOULD retain the power to stop  any useful  action by the Council simply by voting against it.    One delegation  proposed the addition  to article 4 of  a provision whereby anyjuridical disputes  which  may  arise between the Council and  any of  the highcontracting  parties  should be referred  for an advisory opinion to the PermanentCourt of International Justice.    The committee did not see its AVAY to adopt this suggestion, as it might give riseto difficulties of a constitutional nature.
    This article  lays  down  the  principle  of  reciprocity.   One  government proposed that  the  committee   should  establish  in  this  article   that   theprovisions  of  the  convention   should   apply  not  only  between  the  highcontracting parties themselves but also between the high contracting parties and anyStates which, on the invitation of the Council, may have assumed the obligations ofthe convention for a  special case.    The committee  could not see its way to accept this suggestion.  It did  notconsider  it  desirable  to  allow States  to accept  the  obligations imposed by  theconvention only for  certain concrete cases.  The formal  clauses of the convention,moreover, are so drafted  as to make accession possible at any time, even after  theconvention has come into force.  Such  accession, however, must  be a general one i,e., it must  apply to all cases which may arise during the period of validity of  theconvention.Articles  7 to 14 (Formal Clauses).    The  text of the formal clauses (embodied in articles 7 to 14) was prepared on the model of other general conventions recently approved.    The  committee could not see  its way, however, in the present circumstances todecide how many ratifications or accessions would  be required in order to bring theconvention into force.  As, however, it is a convention on security,  the committee thought it necessary to include in article 11  a provision whereby each of the highcontracting  parties may, setting aside any other reservations, render the entry intoforce  of  the convention, in so far  as  it  itself is concerned, subject to ratification oraccession by certain States named  by it.    One  delegation proposed the inclusion of a clause whereby the convention couldbe signed by the delegates at the Assembly of the  League of Nations.  The committee thought,  however, that there was no need to include such a clause in the draft as theGovernments would be wholly free to give their delegates full powers in this respect;this, indeed, has already been done in several cases.    The  Committee on Arbitration and Security, having thus acquitted itself, as faras possible,  of  the task entrusted  to  it  by the Assembly&apos;s  resolution, would suggestthat the  preliminary draft convention, the committee&apos;s report and the minutes  becommunicated to the members of the League for their information.
