(JBSG-^t^l.?30jliUomorandua &quot;by tho Parliamentary Secretary tc  the  Treasury      circulated to tho Cabinet by direction  cl tho               Prime olinistor.        (SGG Cabinet 31 (30) Conclusion 4). /iToto: In this memorandum tho  term Session is  used        throughout  in  its strict  sense,  viz.  tho period        hotv7oon the  opening  and prorogation oi  parliament^&quot;   1.  On tho most  favourable assumption,  the House of Commonscannot complete essential financial business, and all the bills now before it  (except  Coast  Protection, Hours ofIndustrial Employment,  and the  later stages of  tho LandValuation Bill) before  tho 14th August.          It is necessary to pass  the  Finance Bill by 4thAugust, and to complete Supply  by  tho  same  date.  ThoConsumers1 Council  Bill cannot, therefore,  roach tho Lordsbefore 7th -august and  it is  extremely  doubtful  whether thoLend Drainage (ill)  Bill could pasc  through  StandingCommittoo in time to bo sont hack  to tho Lords  by tho 14thAugust.  Tho Land Valuation  Bill  cannot  got beyond oocond                                      /Reading.                              ^              ^                (Soo Table x annexed).   2,  I have, therefore, prepared,  (Table  B) for thoconsideration oi the Clbinot, tables shoeing in detail the 3Courses which appear tc no to be  open  to the Government.The date of rising  this summer  has  in  each  case booncalculated without  allowance lor  special debates on o.g.India or Palestine.
   &quot;3.  G our co I involves the prorogation, of Parliament this summer.  On the assumption that tho Cabinet will authorizethe dropping of Bills which havo no chance of passage this session, (viz. Land Valuation, Consumers1 Council, land drainage (ILL)) as well as the Coast Protection Bill and hours of Employment Bill) tho Session might bo concluded at earliest on the 5th August.          Tho nest Session (11th November 1930 to 31st July1931) would provide lor legislation, roughly, 42 full days and 6 Fridays, after allowance for routine and iinaneialbusiness and for the Bills dropped this Session.  these bills would make serious demands on standing Committees, and thereby &apos; further impede new legislation.   4. Course II.  Tho prolongation of the Session until19th December, and tho postponement till the ^utumn of theReport and 3rd Reading of Consumers&apos; Council and land drainage (HL) Bills, and all xurthor stages oi the education and Land Valuation Bills, would admit of an earlier dateof rising for the Summer Recess, possibly tho 30th July.          In this event I suggest that Parliament should re-assemble on 4th November until 19th December.  Thoeffective time for legislation would admit oi thecompletion ox all tho postponed Bills, and would leave 9full days and 2 Fridays lor new work.          Tho next eossion (27th January 1931 to 31st July1931) would afford 32 full  days and 6 Fridays for legislation; but the 9 days end 2 Fridays gained this session could bo added as a credit, making the now session,for purposes of comparison, equivalent to 41 days and 3Fridays ior legislative purposes.  The Standing committees would bo entirely free for now work, and I suggest that thefirst business in the now Session should be Bills that could be sent upstairs.
           5.   Course  Hit,  is  a  oompr oniiso  between Course  I and        Course  II,  namely to adjourn-on the (5th  august,  rc-asscmble        on  21st October, prorogue,  say,  the 13th November, and        open tho new Session on  23th  November.                 This would involve  postponing  until  October the        Report  and  3rd Reading ol tho Consumers1  Council and land        Drainage (EL)  Bills, and the  later  stages in the Lords  of        the Education  Bill.  It  would also  involve dropping the        Land Valuation Bill until the Next  Session,                 Tho  objection  to  this  course is that  it  gives        the Commons rather  too much time in the  Autumn,  but barely        sufficient  time  for tho  Lords.   Tho spare time  in  the        Commons would  not suffice for anything of importance.                 Tho  New Session (25th November 1930  to 31st July        1931) would afford  47  days  and 9 Fridays for Legislation,        less, say,  4 da.ys and  1  Friday for  the dropped  Land        Valuation Bill,  or  43  days  and 8 Fridays not.   Tho Land        Valuation Bill would sterilize a Standing Committee for        other business until well into March.           6.   I prefer  Course II to  either of the others  as being        on  tho  whole the most  economical of Parliamentary  time.           7.   I understand that it has  been suggested  that, by        special Resolution  of  the House, Bills that have already        proceeded through somo  stages  this Session should bo carried        over into next Session at tho stage they have  now  reached.        I am strongly  oi opinion that this  is  impracticable.  The        last time it was attempted  (in respect of tho  War  Emergency.        Laws Continuance Bill  en 23rd December 1919) the proposal        was strongly condemned in all quarters oi the  House,and        the motion  &quot;was withdrawn.   Even if  the Commons  agreed        (which  I think unlikely) tho  House  of  Lords would  almost        certainly refuse.                                 (ItId.)
