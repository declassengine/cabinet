Q.. A.JL XX S..JL-.                                THE OHaHN&amp;L TUNNEL.     Meraorandum &apos;by the^Prec^ldj^nt of the^Board^of Trade.   1,  I concur in the view expressed by the Channel TunnelCommittee (C.P.7S) and the Channel Tunnel Policy Committee(CP. 114) that H.L . Government should not on economic grounds refuse their assent to the construction of theTunnel if sufficient evidence is forthcoming to satisfythem that the funds required for the construction of theBritish Section can be provided by private enterprise, onthe distinct understanding, as the Channel Tunnel PolioyCommittee state in their Report, &quot;that if private enterprisecommences the operations and fails to carry the venturethrough, they cannot call upon H.M. Government for a subsidyor for financial support&quot;.   2,  It seems to me extremely unlikely that thenecessary funds &quot;will be provided by private enterprise,and the Report of the Channel Tunnel Committee is notcalculated to induce any great eagerness on the partof investors.   With regard to the attractiveness orotherwise of the proposal financially, the Committee arcextremely reticent.   They conclude:- &quot;Whether the risks involved are commensurate with or disproportionate tothe financial reward likely to accrue to those embarking on the enterprise is largely a matter of personal feelingand is an aspect of the problem upon which we do not feeloalled upon to express an opinion&quot;,                          -1-  -
3.  The question may he raised whether it is desirablethat capital should he sunk in such an enterprise at thepresent time, having regard to the small effect uponemployment, to the fact that the investment could not evenbegin to fructify for a decade, and to the body of opinionthat when the rationalisation and reconditioning of Britishindustries (from which a speedier return can be secured) is seriously undertaken, it will be found that the capitalavailable is barely sufficient.  How far the liquid capital resources of the country are adequate, it is for the treasury to say rather than the Board of Trade\ but it will be agreedthat in present circumstances, if it were a question of choice, investment in the industries of the country would bemore profitable nationally.   4i  I also concur in the view of both Committeea thatJi*M. Government would not be justified on any evidencehitherto produced in itself constructing the Tunnel orgiving financial assistance to enable It to be constructed,,   5.  I cannot, however, agree that the qualificationscontained in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of the Report of theChannel Tunnel Policy Committee are necessary.  The Committeesay that they have given a negative answer to the questionwhether the Government should furnish financial assistancesolely on the basis of the evidence contained in the Reportof the Channel Tunnel Committee and add that this evidence is not sufficient to enable them to decide whether theTunnel would be of such general economic value to the country that some assistance would be justified.  They conclude:-&quot;If the construction of the Tunnel could be shown to be in tha national interest there would be a strong case forH.M.Government undertaking or participating directly in the enterprise&quot;.  They are not satisfied that the Channel TunnelCommittee has said the last word as to the types of new
 traffic that might he created by linking up the British rail-way system with the Continental railway system.   6.  It is extremely improbable-that the Trade Associationswho have considered this matter have not had before them thepossibility of new traffic, and it is noteworthy that little support was obtainable from them.  In this connection the Channel Tunnel Committee report          &quot;In the hope of obtaining the views of. the trading       community, we invited the assistance of the Association       of British Chambers of Commerce, which at our request,       communicated a number of questions on the subject to its       constituent Chambers of Commerce throughout the country.       From the replies received it appears that on the general       question, with the exception of the Birmingham Bradford       and Doverta Chambers of Commerce, the Chambers favour the       construction of a Channel Tunnel, provided that a       satisfactory financial scheme can be evolved and that       its construction would not adversely affect the trade       of the country.  The Chambers are doubtful whether a       Tunnel would confer  any substantial benefit on the       export trade.  They consider that an3r advantage derivable       from the construction of a Tunnel would be enjoyed by       foreign competitors of this country and would prove a       further handicap to the British trader in maintaining       his hold on the home market.  They add, however, that       a Tunnel would probably increase the passenger traffic       between England and the Continent, but that as regards       goods traffic the advantage would lie with the       importer of foreign goods rather than with the British       manufacturer.&quot;     The significant qualification &quot;provided.........thatits construction v/ould not adversely affect the trade of thecountry&quot; should be noted.  The Committee further add:-          &quot;We have found great difficulty in obtaining       expressions of opinion from representative bodies       of manufacturers.  Such expressions of opinion as       we have received are, for the most part ,.. either adverse       or indifferent to the idea of a tunnel&quot;.Again, as regards agriculture, the most the Committee are ableto say is that British producers of certain classes of producewould not be hurt much, or so much as some people supposed.    On this, one general observation may be made - that thearguments for a Channel Tunnel have usually and rightly been based on passenger traffic, not on goods traffic considerations.In general,  transport by sea is the cheapest form of transport,and the personal reasons that impel a passenger to prefer rail
 traffic that might be created by linking up the British rail-way system with the Continental railway system.   6.  It is extremely improbable- that the Trade Associationswho have considered this matter have not had before them thepossibility of new traffic, and it is noteworthy that little support was obtainable from them.

The Committee further add:-          !,-?e have found great difficulty in obtaining       expressions of opinion from representative bodies       of aianufacturers.  Such expressions of opinion as       we have received are, for the most part ,.. either adverse       or indifferent to the idea of a tunnel&quot;.Again, as regards agriculture, the most the Committee are ableto say is that British producers of certain classes of producewould not be hurt much, or so much as some people supposed.    On this, one general observation may be made - that thearguments for a Channel Tunnel have usually and rightly been based on passenger traffic, not on goods traffic considerations.In general, transport by sea is the cheapest form of transport,and the personal reasons that Impel a passenger to prefer rail
transport do not affect goods traffic.   I am not surprised,therefore, to find very little evidence as to types of new,as compared with transfers of existing, goods traffic thatmight he created by the proposed Tunnel.   7.  The Cabinet has to be guided by reasonableprobabilities and everything points to the tunnel provinga greater boon to the importer than to the exporter, at anyrate in the future so far as it can be envisaged.   Withregard to imports, as the Committee say, a tunnel wouldprobably secure a substantial traffic at present rates inview of the greater speed and regularity of its servicecompared with that of its competitors, though bulky and lessprofitable traffic would continue to use the sea route.  but with regard to exports, though the same factors would operate,it would be &quot;perhaps to a less extent&quot;, according to theCommittee.   It is true, as they point out, that the factthat on the Channel routes imports largely exceed exports&quot;might well prompt the companies operating the Tunnel tooffer specially attractive rates to exporters., moreparticularly as they would otherwise have to return trucksempty to the Continent&quot;;  but it does not follow that the traffic so attracted would be new traffic.   The low ratesmight mereijr be svifficient to cause a certain transference of old traffic from old routes.   And in so far as it was newtraffic, there would remain the possibility of itsencouragement being counteracted  by increased Import duties on the other side.   This is recognised by the Committee which only claims substantial benefits for British manufacturers onthis account &quot;provided they (the low rates) were not offset by a corresponding increase in tariff barriers abroad&quot;.1 Cj. M*
   8.  It must be borne in mind that even if no charge weremade for the use of the tunnel, the outgoing traffic  woulistill be limited by the fact that the greater part  of our exports to the Continent wrould not be able to bear  the expenseof the extra railage to reach the tunnel or to go from thetunnel to their destination, which in many cases would be involved in taking the route.   Sea transport tends to becheaper than land transport and though the reduction  of  thenecessity for handling might attract goods to the tunnelroute, yet goods tend to travel by the route which  is most convenient both for the place of manufacture and for  theultimate market.   The great mass of the products ofindustrial North and Middle England which are destined forexport will seek exit by the. port which offers the  shortestrail route from the place of manufacture (subject,  of course,to the consideration of the destinations of any given placeof ultimate consumption from the various ports of landing).It appears unlikely that the construction of the ChannelTunnel would stimulate materially British export trade,  in what have hitherto been typically British manufactures,  tothe Continent of Europe - a trade which is at present on thewhole remarkably well served.   This follows from the natureof our typical exports and the geographical conditions of theUnited Kingdom.   On  the other hand there is no doubt thatit would facilitate the existing Continental competition inEngland in respect of numerous manufactures.   9.  As regards the possibility of a stimulus being givenby the construction of a tunnel to trade in goods of  a&quot;perishable, valuable or fragile&apos;; description&quot;, it  should benoted that at the present ,time the import trade from  theContinent of Europe in goods coming within that category
preponderates greatly over the export trade  to  theContinent.   Putting aside perisahle goods (agricultural produce), as to which any appreciable increase  in the  exports from this country to continental Europe is not  to beanticipated, and confining consideration to  goods which arevaluable or fragile, which are largely of a  luxury  character,it appears likely that the facilities offered by the ChannelTunnel would have some effect in stimulating London&apos;s  exporttrade, as London is an emporium of all kinds of goods  of this class.   But any substantial increase of the exports ofBritish manufacture of this kind to the Continent of Europeappears to be unlikely, because the same kind of manufacturesare produced on a large scale in Continental countries and areas a rule, well protected.   It cannot be anticipated  that any increased transport facilities would materially help theindustries producing electrical apparatus or radio  apparatus,or the artificial silk industry, or the fine chemical  and dyewares industry, or the progressing optical and  scientificinstrument industries, to improve to any appreciable extenttheir export trade to Continental Europe where  they havepowerful and firmly established competitors, which  are indeedcompeting strongly with them in the United Kingdom  market.The same consideration applies to such goods as glassware andchinaj for which in present conditions of transport, cost ofpacking and risk of breakage are important factors.   Inneither case can, in any circumstances * any  large increase inthe export trade to Continental Europej so far  as it could be served ecdhottically by a Channel Tunnel service, be looked for:  only the highest qualities of British  goods of thesekinds have any real chance in Continental markets as againstdomestic or other Continental products, and  the demand therefor such British goods will probably always  be  limited.
   10.  Further the effects on shipping must not he overlooked.The Committee report:-  &quot;In general, the shipping companiestook the view that the question whether the Channel Tunnelscheme is to go forward, should he determined onconsiderations of the national interest, hut that, as itwould benefit the railways with which they compete, adequate safeguards should be provided to protect their interests.It is not possible for us to anticipate the nature of thosesafeguards, but it may be that a solution would be found  inthe extension of the arrangements which we understand havebeen adopted in the past in rush seasons, whereby traffic is allocated by agreement between the railways and theshipping companies&quot;.   It is feared by the shipping companiesthat the tunnel &quot;would be able, with the aid of throughrates, to secure a large part of their (the shipping companies) present business, and would, in any case, be sure of obtaining a considerable part of the perishable and high-paying traffic&quot;.   11.  To sum up, the Channel Tunnel Committee and theChannel Tunnel Policy Committee are agreed (a) that assent to the construction of the Tunnel by private enterpriseshould not be refused on economic grounds and (b) that theGovernment should make no contribution to the cost - thoughthe latter Committee qualifies this second conclusion by  thestatement that their vie?/ is based solels? on the evidencelaid before them which in their opinion was incomplete.I agree with both (a) and (b) .   The only questions on -/jhichthere can be any dispute are (i) whether the tunnel mightnot prove to be in the national interest eventually and(ii) whether in that event a government contribution wouldbe justified.   The Channel Tunnel Policy? Committee think
the tunnel might possibly be in the national interest,  andif that could be demonstrated they would recommend a government contribution.   The Channel Tunnel Committee think there willbe a national advantage - they do not say by what date  orprecisely estimate the initial hardships - but do not recommendany government contribution.   I can see no prospect of a balance of advantage over such a period as the Government inpresent circumstances ought to take into account - though in adistant future it might be realised.   My examination of theevidence leads me to fear that at the outset the facilitiesafforded by a tunnel would at what might still be a difficulttime, add to our economic difficulties - and the more sohaving regard to Continental tariff policies.   Beyond  that we need not look for the purpose of framing a decision, and I donot think that a further Inquiry would serve any useful object.I am strongly of opinion that, while not on economic groundswithholding assent if adequate funds can be obtained by privateenterprise, we should make it quite clear that we offer noencouragement and that in no case could the Governmentcontemplate making any financial contribution.                                               w&quot;.G.Board of Trade     13th Kay, 1930.
