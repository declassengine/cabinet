Proposals for an International Convention regulating the  hours of salaried employees will  oome  before the  International  labour Conference at Geneva nest  June,  ai;  which I hope to be  present.       The stxbject  was discussed at the  International Labour  Conference in June of last year.   As  a result of that discussion  a detailed. Questionnaire was forwarded to the Governments,   After  the view of the Trades Union Congress  General Council and the  National Confederation of Employers1  Organisations had been  ascertained and carefully considered,  the Cabinet decided  (Cabinet 52(29))  that we should send to Geneva by way of reply the  statement reproduced in the Appendix to this Memorandum.    This  takes the line that it would be impossible to embrace in one  international instrument, whether Convention or Recommendation,  the great diversity of occupations covered by the term &quot;salaried  employees&quot;;  and that, neither in this nor, we believe, in  other  countries is sufficient information available to  justify an  attempt to draw up a Convention at this stage.    The statement  suggests accordingly that the Conference  should content itself  with elaborating a Recommendation providing for an enquiry  being  undertaken by the various State Members in their  respective  territories into the conditions of employment in  the distributive  trades, or possibly covering a wider  field, if this is found to  be generally acceptable.   At the same time emphasis is laid upon  the desire of the Government to safeguard the hours and conditions  of work of all classes of employees,  and  on the fact that their  present decision is prompted solely by anxiety to achieve concrete  results.
     This statement, which &quot;by direction of the  Cabinet was shown to the Trades Union Congress  General Council before being dispatched to Genera, provoked serious  remonstrances in that quarter, but the Government adhered to  its view and the reply was despatched on 25rd January0   It has been published by theInternational labour Office along with  the replies of otherGovernments in a Blue Report that will  be  the basis of dis-cussion at the forthcoming Session of the  Conference,,   Thisreport concludes with the draft of a proposed Convention onhours of work in commerce and offices and  two draft Recommenda-tions providing for enquiries and reports  from  the variousState Members to the International&apos; Labour  Office on conditionsof employment in hotels and restaurants on the  one hand, andtheatres etc. on the other.     I wish now to direct the attention of my colleagues tothe question of the line to be pursued  by  the government delegates at the forthcoming Session of the  Internationallabour Conferences   Considerable pressure will be put upon us by the representatives of the Trades Union Congress general council, by the Workers1 Group at the Conference and by theDirector of the International Labour Office, to modify theattitude taken up in our reply to the Questionnaire.   I am convinced, however, that to yield to this  pressure will layup for us in the future embarrassments  far more serious than anything we may have to face as a result of  maintaining ourposition.   We have told the International Labour Office thatwe do not know enough of the facts  to enable us to assist indrawing up an international Convention.   We have already started to remedy that defect by the appointment of a selectCommittee of the House of Commons to enquire into the hours and working conditions in shops.   Cur  good  faith, therefore,cannot be impugned, nor has anything arisen  since our reply was despatched to afford grounds for modifying our  attitude.  If,
therefore, it is agreed that the instructions to the delegates should be based upon the reply to the  Questionnaire I suggestthat the following is the best line of procedure.   First ofall, in the general discussion in full Conference before thesubject is remitted to a Committee I should make a statementexplaining fully the point of view of  the  Government and making it plain that it is due to no desire to  delay progressor avoid legislation but is prompted solely by  the wish tosecure international standards suited  to the  facts and capableof being uniformly observed.   We should propose to attend the Committee set up to deal with the  subject and follow its proceedings with interest, but we should naturally be unableto make any great contribution to its  work nor  should we feel justified in voting upon the various issues that would come upfor decision from time to time.   I should point out to theConference that Recommendations on the lines  proposed by uswere now being suggested for hotels and&apos;restaurants and fortheatres and places of amusement, and  that our  proposal would merely extend these enquiries to cover other  classes ofemployment so that the difference between  us  is in degree andnot in kind.     One of our representatives, as I  have alreads^ said, would attend the Committee set up to deal with this subject, butthough not actually bound to silence would not  take any active part in the proceedings and, in particular, would not getinvolved in the discussion of controversial points.   Hewould abstain from voting throughout,  and  the same policy would be followed when the draft Convention emerged from theCommittee for consideration by the full Conference.   Ourdelegates would, however, keep In mind the possibility of putting before the Conference our proposal for  a recommendation in favour of an enquiry into the distributive trades.   If the                             3.
Q ^draft Convention fails to secure the necessary two-thirds majority a favourable opportunity may occur for presentingthis Recommendation as an alternative.   Other circumstances may arise which might equally make it seem worth while toput forward a formal proposal to the same effect, hut itwould he clearly understood that this course would  only headopted if it were evident that it would command asubstantial body of support from the Conference and Ifthere appeared a reasonable hope that it might be successful.     Accordingly, I invite my colleagues to decide  -     1.   That we should maintain the position which we          took up in January.     2.   That I should put our point of view before the          Conference in a statement such as I have          outlined above.     3.   That we should attend the relevant Committee,          but not take any active part in the discussions          and abstain from voting both there and in full          Conference.     4.   That if a favourable opportunity occurs we should          formally propose the adoption of the Recommenda-          tion suggested in our reply to the Questionnaire.     I have consulted the Home Secretary in regard  to thismemorandum and he agrees with its terms.                            Clntd.)  M.C.3.Ministry of Labour.17th May, 1920.
APPENDIX.Reply of H.M. Government to the I.L.O. questionnaire.     His Ma majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom of GreatBritain and Northern Ireland is most anxious to join in taking all possible steps to safeguard the hours and conditions of workof all classes  of employees.    It wishes, however, to avoid any action which will not produce effective international results.It is of opinion that the  conditions of those employed in the wide range of miscellaneous occupations of very different kindscovered by the  Questionnaire are not susceptible of being dealtwith  in a single instrument, whether a Draft Convention&quot; or aDraft Recommendation,    It feels that, if a workable convention or Recommendation Is to be achieved, a closer and more detailed examination must be made of the circumstances in which each class of work is carried on and that more adequate considerationmust be given to those circumstances before proposals for theinternational regulation of hours can be formulated.    Thenecessary amount of information is not in the possession of HisMajesty&apos;s Government and, therefore, they are not in a positionto make detailed proposals, as required by the Questionnaire, onthe method of regulating hours of work.     His Majesty&apos;s Government has come to the conclusion,therefore, that it is not in a position to furnish detailedrepl5.es to the Questionnaire, and that it is not practicable for it at the present time to proceed further than to attempt tosecure the adoption of a Recommendation providing for an inquirybeing undertaken by the various States Members in theirrespective territories into the conditions of employment in the distributive trades.    It would, however, be prepared to givefavourable consideration to such extension of the scope of inquiry as may be generally agreed upon.    In reaching thisdecision His Majesty&apos;s Government is actuated by a desire to make effective progress in the application of internationalstandards of working conditions.
