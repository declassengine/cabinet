(C.I.D. Papers Nos. 976-B, 986-B, 987-B and 988-B.)          (Previous reference C.I.D. Minutes, 238th Meeting, Minute 15.)    THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a report of the Sub-Committee onthe Reduction and  Limitation of Armaments covering a proposed  redraft of the model Treaty to Strengthen the means of preventing War (C.I.D. Paper No. 976-B),together with the  following connected papers :     (a)  A report  by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 986-B);    (b)  A historical note by the Secretary to the  Committee of Imperial Defence           (C.I.D. Paper No. 987-B);    (c)  A series  of telegrams, dated the 1st to the 5th May, from  Geneva (C.I.D.           Paper No. 988-B).*                            CONCLUSIONS.THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed (1)  To recommend approval of the following redraft of Articles 1 and 2, on the      understanding that it is not intended to apply to any dispute susceptible      to treatment under the Optional Clause :            &quot; High Contracting Parties undertake,  in the event of a  dispute      arising between them and being brought before the Council of the League      of Nations, to accept and  apply  such conservatory  measures of non-      military character relating to the substance of dispute as Council, acting      in exercise of its powers under Covenant of the League, may recommend      for the purpose of preventing aggravation  of dispute.&quot;(2)  To recommend approval, subject  to  the  reservations  which are specified      below, of Lord Cecils proposed alternative  to Articles 2A and 3 of the      Draft  Convention, which reads  as follows :           &quot;Article  3. In  any  case  where the  Council,  acting  under the      provisions of Article 11 of the Covenant of the League of  Nations, shall      be of opinion that a threat of war exists, and shall, in consequence, make      recommendations  with a view to diminish or put an end  to that threat,      the High Contracting Parties  hereby undertake to  comply  with such      recommendation;          Provided always that nothing in this article shall compel any High       Contracting  Party to comply  with any  such recommendation of the       Council which the High Contracting Party shall deem to  be inconsistent       with  its national  safety;  but in that  case it shall forthwith  furnish to       the  Council its  reasons  for  refusing to comply  with  the  Councils       recommendation.&quot;  [21033-&apos;2]
                                 Reservations.               The Committee&apos;s  approval to the above is subject to the under-          standing that           (a) it means precisely  what it says and no more.  That is to say, it does                 not  entitle the  Council to  enforce  a  recommendation  against a                 High Contracting Party which has  refused to comply, nor  to                 order suspension of  movements judged  necessary  to national                 safety.  Nor should refusal to comply with a recommendation  be                 regarded as a test of aggression;          (b) movements undertaken to protect  our  nationals in any part of the                 world, such, for example, as the despatch of reinforcements  to                 Shanghai in 1927, are not interpreted as &quot; a threat  of  war.&quot;     (3) To recommend that the application of  Article 5 to Article 3  (Lord Cecilys          draft) need not be opposed, provided that the reservations specified  in          Conclusion 2  above  are accepted.    If,  however, the  application  of          Article 5 to the original Articles 1 and 2A (of Paper No. 976-B) is raised          as an issue, our Delegate should be instructed to dissent;     (4) to recommend approval of Article 7 in principle; but that it  should  be          suggested,to Lord Cecil that its meaning -would be less obscure if the          word &quot; the &quot; were omitted after the words  &quot; in accordance with &quot;;     (5) to recommend approval of the attitude adopted by Lord Cecil towards the          redraft put forward by the French  Delegate (C.I.D. Paper No. 988-B,          Telegram No.  III).     THE PRIME MINISTER authorised the Foreign Office to despatch  a telegram on the above lines to Lord Cecil forthwith.

Telegram (by Telephone) to His Majesty&apos;s Consul, Geneva.(No. 32.)                                           Foreign Office, May 5, 1930.    FOLLOWING for Lord Cecil :-        &quot; The Committee of Imperial Defence have this afternoon considered the    Model Treaty and your telegrams up to and including your telegram No. 27.        &quot; The Committee  prefer the new draft of Article 3  as  set forth in your    telegram No. 26 to Articles 2A and 3 of the draft convention.  They are prepared    to accept this new draft on the understanding that  it means precisely what it    says and does not entitle the Council to enforce a  recommendation against a    High Contracting Party which has refused to comply, nor to order suspension    of the movements judged necessary to national safety. Nor should refusal to    comply with a recommendation be regarded as a test  of aggression.  A proposal    was made to  add the words &apos; or of  its  nationals &apos;  after  the words  &apos; national    safety,&apos; but it was felt that movements legitimately undertaken, as at Shanghai,    in order  to protect nationals, were not to be regarded as a threat of war.        &quot; The Committee agreed with new  draft of Article  1 contained in your    telegram No. 25, taking it for granted that this Article cannot be used to prevent .   us from having recourse to the Permanent Court of International Justice under    the Optional Clause.        &quot; The Committee did not feel  able to approve the extension of Article 5 to    cover Articles 1  and 2A in the original draft, and if  this were still a live issue.    would be compelled to maintain their objection.  But in view of the terms of    the new Article 3 they assume that this issue no longer arises.        &quot; It was felt that Article 7 was somewhat obscure, and it  was suggested    that it would, perhaps,  be an  improvement to omit the word &apos; the &apos;  after the    words &apos; in accordance with.&apos;        &quot; Your attitude towards redraft by French delegate (see latter half of your    telegram No.  25) was generally approved.&quot;

REPORT.                              INTRODUCTION.    1.   THE subject of this Report is the Model Treaty to Strengthen the means of preventing War.  The original proposals for this Treaty had already been examined by a Committee  in  the  Foreign Office  prior to our  appointment, and  we  were presented with the results of their deliberations.    2.   We have attached to  this report, as Appendix I, the draft of this model treaty as originally  proposed, the amendments suggested by the Foreign Office, andour recommendations, arranged in parallel columns to facilitate reference.  We alsoappend a print of the Treaty (Appendix II) incorporating such amendments to theoriginal draft as  appeared to us desirable.   In this connection, however, we would draw especial attention to certain reservations made in connection with Articles 1,2A and 5 (see paragraphs 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 23 and 24).                               HISTORICAL.    3.  The Model Treaty was approved by the Assembly in September 1928.  In itsthen form it was designed to serve as a model which any two or more States mightadopt and put into force as between themselves and not as a General Treaty to which any member of the League might adhere. The idea underlying this Treaty was that,in any case where there was a danger of  war,  or  even where war had  actuallymaterialised,  the  parties to  it should undertake to accept and put in force anydirections given by the Council of the League under the provisions of the Covenantwith a view to prevent hostilities or restore peace.  At present the Council can give such directions, but  there is no explicit obligation resting on  the members of theLeague to carry them out.    4.  In September 1929  the United Kingdom Delegation proposed, and theAssembly directed,  that  the Treaty  should be  referred  to  the   Committee  onArbitration and Security with the objects of (1) converting it into a General treaty and (2) suggesting such other amendments to  it as they might  think desirable.  Itwas further proposed that the various Governments concerned should give powers totheir  Delegations  at the next  Assembly to  sign  the Treaty  if  the Governmentsapproved it.    5.  The main  point of the  amendments  suggested by the Foreign Office was tomake the Treaty effective for the prevention  of war as well as for the restoration ofpeace, when war had actually broken out;  it was  felt that this  was desirable,  since it is easier to prevent war than to stop it.    6.  In addition, certain changes were proposed in the formal articles at the endso that they would be suitable for a General Treaty.        SUGGESTED  AMENDMENTS TO THE MODEL  TREATY.Article  1. The  High  Contracting Parties  undertake,  in  the  event  of  a dispute        arising  between them and being brought before the Council of the League        of Nations, to accept and apply provisional recommendations by the Council        relating  to  the substance of the dispute  and  designed to prevent any        measures being taken by the parties which  might have a prejudicial effect        on the execution of an arrangement  to be proposed by the Council.    1.   The Foreign Office proposed to delete the words &quot; relating to the substance of the dispute and.&quot;  The idea underlying their  proposals is to limit the  powers of      [20508]                           -                           B 2
the Council to preventive measures, leaving all questions affecting the substance ofthe dispute to be dealt with later on.    8.  The Admiralty expressed some apprehension lest the deletion of these wordsmight give a  loophole through which purely  defensive movements of war vesselsmight be challenged.  They urged that the words &quot; relating to the substance of thedispute and,&quot; which it is now proposed to delete, had been added so as to exclude the possibilities of the signatories to the Treaty being bound  to accept a recommenda-tion regarding the re-establishment of the military status quo normally existing intime of peace.  It was pointed out that, by reason of the peculiar situation of GreatBritain and the Dominions,  any  proposal which could in  any way restrict the defensive  movements of the Fleet might have  serious  consequences.    9.  The majority  of the  Committee  are satisfied, however,  after careful con-sideration, that there is no  ground for these apprehensions, and that we could not be prejudiced in  taking  any  genuinely  defensive measures.   The point is further discussed under Articles 2 and 2A.Articles 2 and 2A.     10.   Article 2 of  the original draft treaty reads as follows :   &quot; In  the  caseprovided for in Article 1, the High Contracting Parties further undertake to refrain from any measures which might aggravate or extend the dispute.&quot;     11.   The Foreign  Office have recommended  the insertion  of  the following additional article as Article 2A :  &quot; The High Contracting Parties undertake, in theevent of a threat of hostilities between them;  to accept and apply such precautionary measures as the Council, acting in exercise of the powers of the League under thefirst paragraph  of Article 11 of  the  Covenant, may recommend with a view  to preventing an outbreak of hostilites.&quot;     12.  Of these two articles, Article 2 speaks for itself.  The object of Article 2Ais to increase the effectiveness of Article 11 of the Covenant for the prevention of war.By that Article, in case of any threat of War, the Council is directed to &quot; take any action that may  be deemed wise  and effectual to safeguard  the peace of nations,&quot;and  the  Council  and  Assembly have recently  agreed  on a number of precautionary measures, such as recommending the withdrawal of troops from the frontier and the like, which,  among others, might be taken when  a  crisis occurs.  But no obligationis explicitly placed on  the members of the League to obey such recommendations,though it would  seem that the duty of such obedience must be taken to have beenimpliedly accepted by all those who  are bound by the Covenant.  The  purpose ofArticle 2A is to make explicit this implied obligation.  It is thought that, thoughsuch a provision will make little difference to the more law-abiding Powers, it mightbe useful in dealing with others.     13.  The  Admiralty expressed  their concern  as to whether  movements ofH.M.  Ships might not be challenged under  the provisions  of these Articles.   Itwas  pointed out to  us  that  the  peace and  war time locations of the  Fleet werenaturally, in our case, greatly dissimilar; and that, so long as the possibility of  warthreatened, then, unless our Fleet could take up its strategical stations unquestioned,the keystone of our safety would be destroyed.     14.   We realise fully the importance of this consideration.  But the majorityof the  Committee have no doubt that  no Fleet movement, unless it were of a clearlyprovocative and aggressive character,  could be objected to under these  Articles.     15.  The Air Ministry representatives would also wish to see Article 2A deletedfrom the draft Treaty.  This new Article appears  to them to involve  a  definiteextension of our obligations under Article 11 of the Covenant.  The Air Ministry
are also of  the  opinion that, notwithstanding  such interpretation as may  begiven to Articles 2 and 2A of the Model Treaty, there is no question but that underthese  two  Articles the Council would have power  to make and  we  should  be bound to comply with recommendations  for action or inaction which might makeit impossible to carry out precautionary measures indispensable to safety as regardsair defence.    The gravity of these objections would be still further increased were it decidedto make the provisions of Article 5 applicable to Articles 2 and 2A.    16.   The doubts  of the Admiralty  and  the Air Ministry  were shared  bythe  Colonial Office  and  some other  members  of  the Committee,  especially with  regard  to  Article  2A.   But  if  it  be  true,  as  we  think  it  is,  that article   2A  imposes  no new  obligation  on  us  which would  not  impliedlylie  upon  us  under  Article  11,  it  is  not easy  to see how  these  provisionscould  be  used   to  our   detriment.   It   must   be   remembered  that  any direction by  the Council to which this Treaty applies must be agreed to by all ofits  members, except those  actually  engaged in the  dispute  under  consideration.Further, we shall always be present when any such direction is being discussed, both because  this country is a permanent member of the Council, and because any countryinterested in a question has a right to sit as a member of the Council during  itsdiscussion.   We should therefore be able  to clear up any possible misapprehensionabout the movements of our Fleet or Air Force.   To imagine that in the face of suchexplanation the other members of the Council  would unanimously give directionswhich, if obeyed, would compromise our safety, seems an extravagant apprehension.The object  is to prevent the outbreak of hostilities, and the Treaty only applies todirections which would have that effect.    17.   It is hoped that the danger to this  country from  the Council straining  its powers  is not appreciable.   On the  other hand, if war breaks out in any part ofEurope, or, indeed,  of the world, it may involve the British Empire, as we found in1914.  The essential thing, therefore, in our interests is to increase by every possible means  the guarantees of  peace.   It is for  that reason that the  approval  ofArticles 2 and 2 A of the Draft Treaty is recommended.    18.   We may add that it is not only the right, but the duty, of every member ofthe League  to resist aggression so  that  genuinely  defensive action  is  clearlylegitimate.   In order to prevent any possible misapprehension on this point,  and inorder that Nations may have no claim  to challenge action taken in accordance  withthe recommendations of the Council of the League, we recommend the addition of thefollowing words  to Article  7 : &quot; nor  as imposing  any  obligation on  the HighContracting Parties to cease or refrain from action  taken in accordance with therecommendations of the Council.&quot;Article 3. &quot; In the event of hostilities of any hind having  broken out, without the        possibilities of a peaceful settlement having,  in the Council&apos;s opinion,  been        exhausted, the High Contracting Parties undertake  to  comply with the        recommendation which the Council may make to them for the cessation of        hostilities, prescribing,  in  particular,   the  withdrawal  of forces having        penetrated into the territory of another State, or into a, zone demilitarised        in virtue of international treaties, and  in general inviting them to respect        each  other&apos;s  sovereignty  and any  obligations  assumed  in  regard  to        demilitarised zones.&quot;    19.   The  Foreign Office  proposed the deletion  of the words &quot; without  thepossibility  of  a peaceful  settlement  having,   in   the  CounciFs  opinion,   been exhausted,&quot; since these words appeared to be superfluous, even undesirable, in viewof our signature of the Kellogg Pact.  We endorse this proposal.    20.   Further,  in view of the  fact that this Article appears to  ns to be designedprimarily to safeguard frontier  incidents,  we recommend  the  substitution of thefollowing words in the opening phrase : &quot;In the event of hostile acts of any kindhaving been committed by one High Contracting Party against another.&quot;
Article 5. &quot; Inthe cases referred to in Articles 3 and 4, the High Contracting Parties         undertake to act in accordance with the recommendations of the  Council,         provided that  they are concurred in by all the members other than the         representatives of  the parties which have engaged in hostilities.&quot;    21.  The Foreign  Office have  suggested that  this  Article  should  refer to articles  1 and 2 A, as well as to Articles 3 and 4, and that, to effect this additionalapplication, the last words of the Article should be amended to read &quot; representativesof the parties to the dispute.&apos;&apos;    22.  The main point in  this Article,  to  which our  attention was directed,concerned the question of whether parties to any dispute,  who might be actuallyengaged in hostilities or might at least be in such a position that hostilities, to whichthey would be a party, were imminent should have the right to vote.  To give themthis right might easily mean that they would have the right to veto any recommenda-tions of the Council which either of them might dislike or disapprove.    23.  The Admiralty were  unable to accept the application of Article 5  to articles 1  and 2  (A)  in the Draft Convention,  and  pressed that the  BritishMember of the Council  should  always  have a vote when  questions that might affect the movements of the Royal Navy might be before  the Council, i.e., that thereshould be the same full unanimity required with reference to Articles  1 and  2 (A)  ofthis Draft  Convention as  is required for Article 11 of the Covenant, the purpose  ofArticle 2 (A), as stated in paragraph 11, being to make explicit the implied obligationin Article 11 of the Covenant.    The Admiralty feared that Article 1 might be interpreted as meaning that theCouncil of the League should recommend an arresting of precautionary movementsb)^ the  Fleet,  the  withdrawal of ships from positions  that they  were in or there-establishment of something corresponding to what might,  by the Council,  beregarded as the peace-time  distribution of the Fleet.   Certainly  Article  2  (A)definitely seemed  to  them  to involve the possibility  of the  arresting  of navalprecautionary movements.  The peace-time distribution of ELM.  Ships  on the variousseas is practically always different from what it would be  under a threat of hostilities,and the freedom to take timely action as a matter of self-defence in the interests  ofthe scattered parts of the Empire is imperative.    The  Admiralty  would   like  Article  2  (A)   deleted  entirely,  but   do not press for  this;  but  they do press that the operation of  Article  2 (A) shouldnot absolutely  be  taken out of the hands of the British Member  of the Council,i.e.,  that Article 5 should not be applicable to Article 2  (A) .  Otherwise there wasa surrender of what might be the only possibility the Admiralty  had of satisfactorilysafeguarding this  country and other  parts of the Empire, and particularly perhapsof preventing or being capable of neutralising possible attacks, raids or invasions  ofdistant parts of the Empire.    24.  The Air Ministry, who share the apprehensions of the Admiralty withregard to the provisions of Article 5, also wished to see the application  of thisArticle restricted to Articles 3 and 4 only.    25.  It seemed to many of us that to permit a State contemplating aggressionto veto any action by the Council would be, in effect, to take away the power of suchaction.    26.  Whilst we are in agreement that Article 5 can apply to Articles 3 and 4, wesubmit for decision whether Article 5 apply to Article 1 and the proposed  newArticle 2 (A) .
Article 7. &quot; The present Treaty may not be interpreted as entailing any change in        the task of the Council of  the  League of Nations as laid down in the        Covenant.&quot;    27.  As stated in paragraph  18, we have recommended the addition of thefollowing words to this Article :   &apos;&apos; nor as imposing any obligation on the HighContracting Parties to cease or refrain  from action taken in accordance with therecommendations of the Council.&quot;    28.  The changes proposed by the Foreign Office in Articles 8, 9, 10 and 11are those which are necessary in order to convert the Treaty from a Model treaty which might be accepted by any two  or more Powers as between themselves into aGeneral Treaty to which all may adhere.

Report  by the  Chiefs of Staff  Sub-Committee  on the Report of the        Sub-Committee oh the Reduction  and Limitation of Armaments                          (C.I.D.  Paper No. 976-B.)    THE Chiefs of Staff Sub-Commitcee have carefully examined the Report of theSub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the Model Treaty  toStrengthen the Means of  Preventing War  (C.I.D.  Paper No. 976-B),  and,  inaccordance with the terms of  the Warrant issued to  them by the  Prime Minister(C.I.D.  Paper No. 714-B), feel it their duty to submit the following observationsthereon.    2.  The Model Treaty, then in a form  entitled &quot; German proposals for theprevention of war,&quot; was considered by the Chiefs of  Staff Sub-Committee in June1928.   Some of  the points to  which the Sub-Committee then took exception were removed during the subsequent discussions at Geneva, but the fundamental disadvan-tages  remain.    3.  The  Report  of  the  Sub-Committee  on  Reduction  and  Limitation  ofArmaments (C.I.D. Paper No.  976-B)* submits in Appendix II a proposed re-draftof this Treaty.  The covering Report does not attempt to deny that it is possible forthe Council of the League to impose restrictions on the free movement of our forces during a period of tension, or, as terms of an armistice, after hostilities have actuallybroken out.  What it seeks to argue is that we may trust the Council to recommendterms which will be reasonable and fair to both parties  to the dispute.  This is apossibility which it is not for the Chiefs of Staff to weigh;  it is their responsibility to point out to the Government the risks which this country will undoubtedly  run  in accepting this Treaty as now  drafted.  These risks have already been emphasisedduring the discussions in the Sub-Committee, and also in a previous Report  by theChiefs of Staff (Paper No. C.O.S. 167).    4.  The fundamental objection is that the Treaty operates unequally as between nations.   It is, indeed, probable that  no country would be more adversely affectedby its provisions than would Great Britain.  A decision of the Council restricting the movement of ships, troops,  or aircraft  would mean little to a highly centralisedPower;  whereas to us in  Great Britain, with our small forces dispersed  in every part of  the world  and with our traditional unpreparedness for war, it would be aparalysing stroke which might well jeopardise the whole future course  of warlikeoperations, should these eventually become inevitable.  It is only necessary to instancethe concentration of the Fleet and the movement of the main body tp Scottish bases-in the late War  to realise the importance,  from a naval point of view, of retainingfreedom to take  proper defensive measures.  Again restrictive recommendations  ofthe  Council might make  it impossible to charter and  move shipping before war  is      [20999]  21046
declared.   In the case of the Navy this might involve a possibly fatal delay in thepassage of the Fleet owing to its lack of oilers, reserves of ammunition, &amp;c.   In thecase of the Expeditionary Force the consequential delay might be equally  disastrous,as will be realised by those members of the Committee of Imperial Defence who have studied the question of the despatch of reinforcements to India.  The Council might also prevent the essential  reinforcement  of such  fortresses  as  Hong-Kong and singapore, and the preliminary reinforcement of the local Naval  Squadrons bothmatters of the utmost importance from a purely defensive standpoint.    5.  The provisions  of  the Treaty, moreover, would in  most cases  operate infavour of an aggressor.   Any restrictions on movement entailed by the CounciFs&quot;precautionary  measures&quot; under the proposed Article 2 (a)  could hardly  fail tohandicap a State  suddenly threatened with aggression and quite unprepared forwar.  The aggressor, on the other hand, having long anticipated precisely  such a situation, would have so directed and concealed his mobilisation, concentration andindustrial preparations  that any restrictions imposed on him  would be too  late tobe effective. His possession of the initiative would thus be maintained and confirmed by  the action of the Council until the moment when  active hostilities commenced.For example, supposing Japan had decided on  an aggression, a decision  of theCouncil prohibiting the  movement of the British fleet to the Far East might bringabout the very contingency which the decision was intended to  avert, since it would encourage the aggressor  to embark upon action  which he might not  have attemptedhad our fleet moved in time to take up a  strategic position.    6.  For the reasons given in the preceding paragraphs,  the Chiefs of  StaffSub-Committee deem it essential that Article 2 (a) (which does  not form  part of theTreaty  as drafted at Geneva) should either be  deleted or should be excluded  fromthe provisions of Article 5, since the provisions of the latter Article would definitelypreclude pur representative on the Council from recording his vote on the  issue.  Thispoint is raised in  paragraph 26 of  the Report  under consideration, which furthersuggests the possibility  of extending the  provisions of Article  5  so  as to coverArticle 1.  It is recommended that, as provided in the League  draft of this Treaty,the operation of Article 5 should  be restricted  to Articles 3 and 4  alone; this willenable us to retain a voting position on the Council of the League, and thus to  be ina position to veto  any obviously  inequitable measures which might otherwise be imposed on us under Article 1.

Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   May 1930.SECRET.987-B.COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Reduction and Limitation of Armaments.MODEL TREATY  TO STRENGTHEN THE MEANS OF     PREVENTING  WAR (C.I.D. Paper  No. 976-B).             (Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 986-B.)                     HISTORICAL NOTE  BY THE SECRETARY.    THERE is nothing particularly new in  the principle underlying the model treaty to Strengthen the Means of Preventing War.  Attempts have been made inthe past,  by nations desirous of  maintaining the  peace,  to  induce the potentialbelligerents to  desist from measures tending  towards  a state of belligerency.  Tomake any large survey of the subject would involve a greater historical investigationthan is possible at the moment.  Two instances, however, at once suggest themselves,and a summary of those episodes is given below. One relates to the War of 1866, andthe other to the Russo-Turkish War of 1877. In neither case did the good intentions of the mediator produce the desired effect.  On  the contrary, in the state of suspicionwhich then prevailed, and which always prevails just before  the outbreak of war,they merely exacerbated the situation.                              THE WAR OF  1866.     It will be recalled that the main cause of  the War of 1866 was  the breakdown of the German Confederation, due, in the main, to the rivalry  for hegemony betweenAustria and Prussia, contributing causes being the rivalry between the two countriesin Schleswig-Holstein and the Italian desire for Venetia.    On the 8th April, 1866, a secret Treaty was signed between Prussia and Italy,which was to hold good only in the event of Prussia declaring war on Austria within three months from the date of ratification.  On the following day a Prussian project for the reform  of the German Confederation was introduced in the  Diet.   At this time a heated correspondence was passing between Berlin and  Vienna on the subjectof the war preparations on either side.  Bavaria, as the  chief of the secondary states concerned in the project for the  reform  of the Confederation, asked that the twoleading Powers should in the meantime undertake not to attack one another. Austriaat once acceded  to  this request, and  so  forced Bismarck into  giving a  similarassurance. The sequel was as follows :           &apos;&apos; And on the very day, the 21st April, when the Prussian reform proposals    were  referred  to a Committee,  the Austrian Council  of War decided, in    defiance of  an  agreement  just  arrived at  with  Prussia  for a  partial    disarmament, to mobilise the  Army  of the South.  This  apparently wantonly    inconsistent action of Austria was due to  the alarming news from Italy, where    Garibaldi was  once more on the move, and whence ominous concentrations of    troops had been reported.  It was followed on the 26th April by the despatch    of an ultimatum to Berlin,  demanding that, in spite of the Austrian mobilisa-    tion in the South, Prussia should still disarm ....&quot;*                    * Alison Phillips, &quot; Modern Europe,&quot; Chapter XVII.

Thus, owing to the unexpected Italian development, the result of the well-meantintervention of  Bavaria  was  to embitter  the  situation without  stopping  the preparations for war.                              THE  WAR OF 1877.     It  will be  recalled that the War  of  1877  arose out  of  hostilities betweenServia and Montenegro, on the one hand, and Turkey, on the other, a further contri-buting  cause being the &quot; Bulgarian atrocities&quot; of May  1876.   There was a long period of strained relations, during which the Powers made many efforts to avert thewar.  On the 31st March,  1877, a final effort for peace was made.  Under Russianinitiative, the Ambassadors at London of the Powrers who had signed the Treaty of paris held a conference in London, and, with Lord Derby, signed a protocol invitingTurkey to demobilise her war forces, and  to put her  promised reforms into  effectwithout delay;  and these terms,  if acceded to by Turkey, carried with them the demobilisation  of  Russia.   To  this collective  Note,  Russia  added  what was practically an ultimatum.   If the Porte, it said, had any serious intention of carryingout the will of Europe, as expressed in the protocol, let it send a  special envoy toSt. Petersburg to treat for  disarmament.  Any repetition of massacres such as thosein Bulgaria would, however, stop  the Russian measures for demobilisation.   For a mount, even Beaconsfield thought that the protocol had ensured peace, but this wasnot the case. The reply of the Porte, endorsed by the Ottoman  Parliament, was to protest  against the protocol, and more especially against  the offensive terms of theRussian declaration added to it,  and  the assumption that Russian disarmament mustbe made contingent on the cessation of troubles which, as everyone knew,  w^ere causedby foreign agitation.    In  this  case,  also, the efforts of the Powers to secure measures of demobilisation and disarmament failed completely,  though the  ill-advised action of Russia, one ofthe parties  to the dispute, in making a separate  declaration, no doubt  tended to counteract any good  that  might have resulted  from  the action of the mediatoryPowers.    The above examples illustrate how delicate  a matter it is to  interfere in  themilitary precautions of nations on the verge of war.(NOTE.

FOLLOWING from Mr. Cadogan :-        &quot; Security  Committee has now  completed first reading of articles 1-5 of    model treaty, which have been referred to strong Drafting Committee on which    all the more important delegations are represented.  Proceedings have served to    elicit  views  of various Governments, but  have so far  led to very little definite    agreement even on principles of treaty.        &quot; In the course of discussion  to-day French associated delegation  insisted    on:  (1) Sanctions against State which  continues hostilities in defiance of    CounciFs  recommendation; (2) supervision  by Council  of  execution of its    recommendations;  (3) exclusion of  votes of parties in all cases under articles 1-Ax        &quot; On last point Lord  Cecil repeated that, in absence of instructions,  he    must reserve his opinion as to extension of this principle beyond article 3 and    article 4.  German delegate also reserved  his opinion until he could see final    text  as  a whole,  and Italian delegate made general reservation.  Japanese    delegate expressed grave doubts  as  to the wisdom of increasing number of    exceptions to rule of unanimity which is  the basis of  Covenant.  Netherlands,    Swedish and Belgian delegates all supported extension of article 5,  and there    appears to be a majority in favour of this view.&quot;                    Telegram No. II,  dated 2nd May, 1930.(No.  24.  .L.N.)    YOUR telegram No. 31*    Following from  Lord Cecil:          &quot;I very much hope instructions may be sent me on Monday.  Committee    will probably finish discussion of model treaty this week, but it will still be in    session next week, and it would be most useful if I could inform them of final    views of His Majestj^s  Government.  So far as one can judge at present stage    of deliberations  it seems that final draft will incorporate article 1 and article 2    of existing draft:  Article 3 will include something on lines of our article 2A    providing for case of  threat of hostilities  and  article  4 will be  retained.    Question to be decided is whether article 5 is to apply to article 1 as well as to    articles 3 and 4 and whether wre can agree to its application to article 3 if latter    includes  something on lines of 2A.         &apos;&apos;&apos; Those  who urge application  of article 5 to all  three articles argue that    unless we do this we are really doing very little if anything.  They further point    out that  under article 15 of Covenant voting parties are excluded in considera-    tion of disputes likely to lead to a  rupture; they argue therefore that it seems    indefensible to allow them to vote in a case of threat of hostilities when it  is a    question of making recommendations for preservation of peace.                                 * Not circulated.      [21023]
    &quot; I confess that I do not find it very easy to explain why a party shouldbe able to block a recommendation of Council simply because a gun has not beenfired.  It would seem that if one party were refractory his opposition could be surmounted by the other party allowing some of his troops to make raid acrossfrontier, and we might thus be putting premium on hostile  acts.   Indeed, suchan arrangement might lead to the result that directions by the Council where a threat of hostility was made would only be  accepted if hostilities had actuallybroken out.    &quot; Further, I am not quite sure that by keeping articles 1 and 2A free fromapplication of article 5  we should have safeguard of any value.   Apparentlywe should,  by accepting the convention, undertake to carry out recommendationsof the Council of the League of Nations under articles 1 and 2A, with a mentalreservation that we could block any such recommendations by our single vote.When I am asked to explain how draft convention would, in those circumstances,constitute any advance or have any value,  I find it is difficult to reply.    &quot; It really  seems to  me that we do not mean anything by articles 1 and 2Aunless we do make article 5 applicable to  them.    &quot; It is, of  course, true that the Government  may at  a later  stage takedifferent view to that put forward by their representative in the present com-mittee, and in that sense it  is true that the  Cabinet retains control of terms of treaty.  But I submit it  is very undesirable that we should give the impression that our attitude is subject to vacillation.  It was our proposal last Septemberthat model treaty should be made a general  treaty,  and it will be regrettable if our action  now should seem to throw doubts on our sincerity in so doing, and i fear that,  if we take a  line so difficult to  defend as to making  a  distinctionbetween articles 2A and 3, that will be the effect produced.&quot;                   Telegram No. Ill, dated 3rd May, 1930.(No. 25.  L.N.)  R.    FOLLOWING from Mr. Cadogan :-        &quot; Drafting Committee have agreed provisionally upon the following text in    place of article  1 and  article 2, model treaty :  &apos; High contracting parties    undertake, in the event  of a dispute arising between  them and being  brought    before the  Council of  the  League  of  Nations, to  accept  and  apply  such    conservatory measures of non-military character relating to the substance of    dispute  as  Council, acting in exercise of  its powers under Covenant of the    League, may recommend for the purpose of  preventing aggravation of dispute.&apos;        &quot; French  delegate  then  produced draft intended  to  replace  article 2A,    article 3  and article 4, which may be summarised as follows :         &quot;1.  In cases referred to in first  paragraph  of article 11 of the Covenant,    and without prejudice  to eventual application of article 16, high contracting    parties undertake  to carry out measures prescribed by  the Council to ensure    (a) withdrawal of forces from territory of another State or from demilitarised    zone;  (b) withdrawal of naval  forces  behind the line and ensuring to each part    its vital  lines of communication;  (c) prohibition of flight by civil or military    aircraft  over or in the neighbourhood of the frontiers.        &quot; 2.  Fulfilment of the above undertakings might be delayed until the arrival    on the spot of the League Commissioners charged with the duty of supervision.    All facilities to be given to the commissioners on land as well as on board vessels    of war.        &quot;3.  Any refusal to carry  out measures referred to  in (1) reported by the    commissioners and in spite of  the injunction of  the Council, shall be regarded    by the high contracting parties as flagrant aggression, and will entail immediate    application of article 16 of the  Covenant.        &quot; The British delegate at once expressed grave doubts as to the possibility    of 1, and especially 1 (b), being acceptable.        &quot; As regards  2,  he  pointed  out that the provision allowing parties to    suspend  compliance with the CounciFs recommendations pending the arrival of    the commissioners might involve grave consequences.        &quot; He made  it clear that  3 was quite  unacceptable, and went right outside    the mandate of the committee.        &quot; Discussion was then adjourned.&quot;
                   Telegram No.  IY, dated 5th May, 1930.(No. 26.)    FOLLOWING from Mr. Cadogan :-        &quot; Model treaty. &quot;        &quot; At meeting of  Drafting Committee on 3rd May British delegate again    insisted that French draft (see my telegram No. 25) introduced questions which.    were outside the  competence of the committee.  It was ultimately agreed that    the bureau should draw up for submission to the Drafting Committee two texts    in parallel columns representing the two opposing theses, that advanced by the    French and associated delegations and that supported  by the British  among    other delegations.        &quot; Meanwhile, Lord Cecil  is  to-day  circulating the  following draft as a    proposed alternative  to articles 2A&apos; and 3 of the draft convention, in the hope    that it may be possible in this  way to  overcome the difficulties which have    arisen :-        &quot; &apos; Article 3. In any case where the Council acting under the provisions    of article 11 of the Covenant of the League of Nations shall be of opinion that    a threat of war exists, and  shall  in consequence make recommendations  with a    view to diminish or  put an end  to that threat, the high  contracting parties    hereby undertake to comply  with such recommendation;        &quot; &apos; Provided  always that  nothing in this  article  shall  compel  any high    contracting party to comply  with any such recommendation of the Council which    the high contracting party shall deem to be inconsistent with its national safety;    but in that case it shall forthwith furnish to the Council its reasons for refusing    to comply with the Council&apos;s recommendation.&apos;        &quot; Lord Cecil requests that this draft may be taken into consideration by the    Committee of  Imperial Defence at its meeting this afternoon.&quot;                   Telegram No.  Y, dated 5th May, 1930.(No. 27.)    FOLLOWING from Lord Cecil :-         &quot; I  have drafted  article, text  of which is  given in  my  immediately    preceding telegram, with the object  of finding something  which,  while  safe-    guarding so far as possible national security, might provide common ground for    a convention.         &quot; It goes some way towards meeting the French  article 2, as it affords an    opportunity of resisting unreasonable recommendations in the unlikely event    of the Council making such.  It does not,  of  course, attempt to meet French    article 3, and I have made it clear to them that we can have none of  that article.         &quot; I  should make it clear that, if  committee accept this  draft, it would    almost certainly be on condition that votes of parties  are excluded in operation    of whole article.  It remains, therefore,  to decide the question, originally raised    in connexion with application of article 5 to article 2A,  whether we can agree    to exclude votes of parties in case of threat  of war.         &quot; In my  opinion,  provision  that  party  may protest against Council&apos;s    recommendation removes at  least some of  the objections hitherto felt to the    exclusion of votes of parties.         &quot; As committee will resume discussion to-morrow morning, I  felt I could    not wait until this evening to circulate  draft.&quot;2,  Whitehall Gardens, S. W. 1,       May 5, 1930.
