(l)       I have read the papers  that have been circulated              in connection with the Conference of Ministers on              Unemployment Policy, and I have formed a very definite              opinion that only the most meagre results can follow              from the attempt to expedite schemes of work by local              authorities, and that the proposed Conference of Local              Authorities is likely to prove disappointing.  I              suspect that the upshot rill be a substantial increase              In the financial cost to the Exchequer for a very              slight extension of the work set on foot.          (2)      I am disposed to suggest that the only promising              field for schemes  of capital expenditure which has  not              yet been fully explored or exhausted Is that reprosen--              ted by the possibility of speeding up industrial              reconstruction schemes.  It  would not, however, be              possible to secure results under this head, except  by              a plan of a fairly comprehensive character, designed              am^ng other things, to reassure the minds of business              men in regard to such matters as taxation.  I attach              a Memorandum which I.have drafted with a view to              exploring the possibilities  in this connection.                           /                                      -1-COPY NO,
(3)        I think that  the most  serious attention should     be  riven to the  rapidly mounting expenditure on     unemployment benefit, which is enough  in itself to     threaten a  formidable deficit in the Budget.   For the     most part,  of course, this  is attributable to the     increase in the  volume of unemployment.   But an     important part of  the increased expenditure is     undoubtedly duo  to the easier conditions under which     benefit can be obtained as  the result of last year1 a     Act.   In this connection it seems particularly     important that a close watch should be kept on the     extent to which married woiven who worked before their     marriage, but are  not really now In the employment     -market, are obtaining benefit, since, if some succeed     in establishing claims, the practice may spread     quickly and attain formidable dimensions.(3gd.)

INDUSTRIAL RECONSTRUCTION SCHEME.      This nemo random is written on the assumption that unemployment will continue to increase throughout the remainder of the present  year,, and that by the autumn the situation will be  one causing far graver and more  widespread public concern than exists to-day. In this event there will be a real danger of the development of a vicious circle, economic and psycho- logical in character,  which will retard recovery for long after world conditions have talc en a favourable turn.    For  example,  the  growth in unemployment  and, the  accentuated deficit  in the  Unemployment  Fund  will threaten  the  prospect  of a deficit in  the next  Budget and  a further increase  of  direct taxation.   This prospect  will discourage business confidence  and intensify  unemployment  still  further.      It  is there for every  important  to consider  in advance,  freely  andwithout regard  to the limitations  set  by  preconceiveddoctrines, whether  it is not possible  to  do  something to break  through this vicious circle of reactions.I  suggest  that  the  gravity  of the  emergency  situationwhich  confronts us  justifies the  consideration  ofemergency  measures,  even if they  are of a kind  whichwould  not  receive approval  in ordinary times.      I  suggest  the  following scheme as worthy  of consideration in the light  of the  emergency  situationwhich  confronts us  :
1.   There shall he established a special Industrial     Hecdrietruction Fund under the administration of the     Lo rd Pri vy Seal.2.        The revenue of this Fund shall be raised by a     special temporary import duty of 10 per cent, (with a     preferential rebate of one-third on im orts from the     Empire) on all imports of manufactured goods other     than those already taxed at a higher rote.    The imports     subject to the duty would be broadly those  described in     the Board of Trade classification as &quot;articles wholly     or mainly manufactured.&quot;   a drawback on exports will     be payable on the usual principle.     (The  resulting revenue may be estimated at  about  2 5     mi11i o ns p er annum.)3.         The Fund shall be used for the following purposes :     (a)    So lon^. as the Unemployment  Fund is  failing to           make ends meet,  and. so long as the&apos; scheme  lasts,, to           defray tiie excess of expenditure over revenue in the           Unemployment Fund up to a maximum of   10 millions per           annum.     (b)    To stimulate immediate capital expenditure on           approved rationalisation schemes in the following           manner.   Where a rationalisation scheme has been           approvea by the Bankers&apos;  Industrial Development           Company and a loan is to be issued for new capital           purposes in connection with that scheme under the           auspices of the B. I. E. C., the State will grant           special assistance from the Bund, if  the work is
effectively put in hand at an early elate,Theassistance will be calculated so as to reducet.,.e net interest payable by the industry to thefollowing rates :If the work is effectively started within   cne year from the inauguration of tho Fundwithin two years11three   To make similar offers cf financial assistance torailways and public utility undertakings and localauthorities for capital schemes which are startedeffectively at an early date, free from the restrictionsat present attaching to such assistance.     At the end of three y ars, the obligations ofthe Fund under (b) and (c)  will be known;  and theduty on manufactured goods will be brought to an end,when the assets of the Fund are sufficient to providefor those obligations.     This scheme might be associated with a similarAgricultural Reconstruction scheme, under which a Fundderived from a temporary duty of 5 per cent..on importedgrain and flour (with a preferential rebate on imports from the  Empire), yielding say  3^- millions perannum, would be used to make special grants forthe capital equipment of agriculture.
        The above scheme would reconcile variousobjectives which are sometimes regarded as conflicting.It would (a) stimulate capital expenditure of a usefulcharacter, (b) promote rationalization and industrial efficiency:, (c) provide an assurance against the fearof a further increase in direction taxation, (d) contributegenerally to the recovery of business confidence.         It is generally agreed that a large capitaloutlay on the provision of up to date plant is urgently needed in some of our old-established industries,  whichhave been depressed for a prolonged, period.  In thecase of iron and steel, for instance, the capitalexpenditure required is commonly estimated at about 15 millions.   Prom the standpoint of the national economy, it would be clearly desirable that this work should be put in hand quickly, at a time when theconstructional industries are suffering from a lackof orders whrch is likely to involve  Idleness fora large portion of the labour and plant which theyemploy.  But, as matters stand, now, schemes of capitalconstruction seem likely to hang fire.  Trade is bad,and the business outlook for the future is clouded by various uncertainties;  and in these circumstances there is a natural disposition to hesitate beforeundertaking substantial capital commitments,  Moreover,a positive inducement to delay is supplied by the likelihood that the rate of interest will fall over aperiod of years, so that it may be possible to obtain
    the money for capital schemes more  cheaply if they    are deferred, for some years.   Such  delay,  however,.    will &quot;be extremely expensive to the  community as  a    whole (the expense under the  heading of  unemployment    benefit alone -&quot;ill be formidable);   and.  I  suggest that    the most serious consideration should be given to the    question of whether it nay not be possible to&quot;stimulate    the immediate undertaking of  approved capital projects    by some such device as that proposed in  Clause 3(b)    of the scheme set out above,  namely, the offer of    substantial State assistance  on condition  that the    work is put in hand at an early date.  If  it be    objected that such assistance will  place at a competitive    disadvantage enterprising concerns  which have modernized    their plant in recent years,  it may be pointed out  in    reply that this disadvantage  is only what  will occur    in the ordinary coarse if,  as is generally axpeeted,    the rate of interest falls materially in the next few    years, and that, on this assumption, the scheme  serves    merely to obviate the wasteful delay which will  be    entailed if people wait for interest rates to fall.3.         If. however, the State is to grant  assistance    or incur commitments entailing a considerable charge    upon the Budget, it becomes important to provide lor    the raising of the necessary  revenue in  ways which  will    not do more harm to industrial activity  by depressing    business confidence than the  stimulation of capital    expenditure will do good.  This is  the primary object    of the proposal, that the revenue for reconstruction    purposes should be raised by a special 10$ import duty    on manufactured, goods.
4.  -     In this connection the  following  points must,    it seems to me,  &quot;be  taken into  account:-    (a)  The Unemployment  Fund is  piling up  debt at  a very         rapid rate  and a  new Act  will  shortly he necessary to         provide for the deficit,  when  the lately increased         &quot;borrowing limit of  50  millions has been exhausted.         On the assumption that  unemployment continues  to         increase,  it will soon  become  impossible to deal with         the matter  merely by successive increases of the         borrowing limit;   and it  will  he  necessary  to  face         either an increase in the contribution of employers         and. employed or an increased charge upon the Budget.    (b)  There seems to me a strong likelihood y/nat  the         Chancellor  cf the  Exchequer will be  faced with  another         prospective deficit when  he comes to draw up his         Budget for  1931.   The receipts for  income tax, super-         tax, etc.  for  the financial year  1931-32 are bound, to         be seriously prejudiced,  as compared with the  receipts         for the current year, by  the sharp  fall in  prices over         the last six monthss It  seems to me likely that this         will more than counterbalance  the normal buoyancy of         the revenue.  Moreover, though the  new taxes imposed         by the Budget  of  the present year are estimated to         yield  12 millions more in a full year than they will         do this year,  the whole of this  increase will  bo         required to replace the revenue brought in  this year         from the Fating Relief  Suspensory Fund..  On the present         basis, therefore, it seems likely that lurther taxation         will be necessary next  year, even if we can assume         that fresh expenditure  will be fully defrayed  by         economies in other directions.
(c)     A further increase  in direct  taxation  next  year,    following on the substantial increases  in the  present    Budget would,  I believe, be very seriously prejudicial    to  business activity.    Moreover,  if an increase  in    direct taxation comes  to bo generally expected, the    harmful effects will begin to occur, in some degree,    before the event.   I  attach importance,  therefore,    to  giving the  business community some practical    reassurance on this  xaattsr.        In existing economic circumstances, the protective aspect of the suggested import duties can  be defended, consistently with a general Free Trade point of view... It  is  quite untrue to suppose that, in so  far as  the duties served to  replace  Imports by home production, the effect must bo to curtail our exports  to a commensurate extent-   Such a reaction on exports could only work itself out through the following chain of  causation:- the diminution of imports would turn the foreign exchanges in  our favour, hence gold would flow in to London,  hence credit would be oxpanaod, trade would become more active, wages  and prices  would tend to rise,  hence, ultimately our expert trades would suffer from higher costs.   It  would be  absurd to be apprehensive of such reactions,, under present conditions, when  the prevailing weakness  of  the foreign exchanges, and the danger that gold may at  any time flow out on  a formidable scale, are actually among the main sources  of anxiety regarding our  underlying posit ion .        I venture  to doubt whether a single competent economist in the country  would dispute that, under conditions such as now- obtain, the  effects of a 10$
e I) .3   tariff on manufactured imports would be beneficial   to employment;  and I also doubt whether many business-   men, whose general position is that of Free Traders,   won la. dispute that such a tariff would have a materially   beneficial effect on business psychology.7.        If the scheme wore coupled, as suggested, with      Agricultural scheme on the lines suggested, the   preferential arrangements involved would, be greatly   appreciate! by tho Dominions, and, in the present state   of Imperial  sentiment, might lead to a practical   response in the shape of materially lower Dominion   tariffs on our ezoorts.8.        Finally, I urge again that the schema must be   considered, against tho background of the situation   which is likely to develop in the coming winter, in   the absence of any new departure of policy.   The   potentialities of that situation seem to mo very   formidable indeed.  and I have yet to hear of any   responsible person who now seriously entertains a   hooeful view.
