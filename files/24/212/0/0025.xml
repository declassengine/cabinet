THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed, for the Cabinet.  May 1930.SECRET.                                                     Copy No.     4gCP. 175 (30).                                 CABINET.THE  GENERAL ACT OF SEPTEMBER  26,  1928,  FOR THE  PEACEFUL            SETTLEMENT OF  INTERNATIONAL  DISPUTES.       MEMORANDUM  BY THE  SECRETARY  OF STATE  FOR FOREIGN  AFFAIRS.    1.   WE  have.. already  signed  and ratified the Optional Clause,  and I am ofopinion that we should lose no futher time in making a decision as to the procedurewe should adopt iij(aceeding.&apos;to&apos; tlie  General Apt.  Wheh signing the Optional Clauseat Geneva last September, i made it clear that,His Majesty&apos;s Government regardedthis as, only  &quot; the first steptowarcls a complete  and organised system for the peaceful settlement of all international disputes.  Acceptance ,&apos;bf the General Act isthe practical  next step towards, this,goal.  I am therefore circulating&apos;this paper tomy colleagues, and I ask them for their concurrence in the policy which I propose.    2.   The General Act is not an ideally drafted document, and I should perhapsat the outset  define exactly what it provides.   The operative portion of the general act consists of three,chapters, dealing respectively, with  conciliation, judicial settle-ment,  and arbitration.  Although  the  General Act  leaves it. open to any State toaccept  only some of these chapters,, it is necessary to accept them all if an ultimatesettlement of  all the disputes to which the General Act applies is to be assured, and have assumed this to be the policy  of His Majesty&apos;s  Government in  the  UnitedKingdom.                                              i    3.   The  effect of  accession to the whole of the General&quot;Act is as follows:Justiciable disputes go, under Chapter II, to the Permanent Court of  InternationalJustice, unless the parties agree to  have recourse to a special arbitral tribunal, or toa preliminary procedure of conciliation.  Subject to these two possibilities, and to apossible difference between the definition of justiciable disputes in Chapter II ofthe  General Act and that contained in the Optional Clause, the effect of acceptingChapter II is identical with that of signature of the Optional Clause;  but it is to benoted that, while only States which are Members of the  League or mentioned in the annex  to the Covenant can sign the Optional Clause, any State can  accede to theGeneral Act.    4.   Non-justiciable disputes go, under  Chapter I,  to a  permanent or  special onciliation commission, composed of five members, one chosen by each of the parties  the dispute from among their respective nationals, and three appointed by agree-  ent from among the nationals of  third Powers.  If a settlement is not reached by his means, the dispute goes, under Chapter III, to an ad  hoc arbitral tribunal, whose. ecision is binding on the parties.    5.   It  is important  to note that the General Act makes no mention of the ossibility  of non-justiciable  disputes being  brought  before  the  Council in ccordance with the Covenant, and a  literal  compliance1 with its terms would be nconsistent with such action.  This was due  to an  idea  that the omission  of any       [21123]
reference to the Council might induce non-Members of the League to accede to theGeneral Act, but the preamble to the Resolution by which the 1928 Assembly adopted the General Act contained the following paragraph :         &quot; Declaring that such undertakings are not to be interpreted as restricting    the duty of the League of Nations to take at any time whatever action may be    deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of world; or as impeding its    intervention  in virtue  of Articles 15 and 17 of the Covenant, where a  dispute    cannot be submitted to arbitral or judicial procedure or cannot be settled by such    procedure, or where the conciliation proceedings have failed.&quot;    The scope and legal effect of this paragraph  are somewhat doubtful, but it may at any rate be taken as implying that Members of the League who are parties to theGeneral Act retain the right (in the case of disputes likely to lead to a rupture it is adefinite obligation) to bring  disputes before the Council in accordance with theCovenant.    6.  This  being  the scope of the Act,  it appeared to me essential that,  inacceding to it we must  make certain reservations, as we are entitled  to do underArticle 39 of the Act, in  order  to safeguard our position in the following threematters :     (1) His Majesty&apos;s  Government have already signed  and ratified  the Optional           Clause, subject  to certain conditions  and exclusions.  Since Chapter II           of  the General  Act covers the same ground as the Optional Clause, our           acceptance of the former  should  be made in  such a way as to producel           exactly the same result as our acceptance of  the latter.  This involves           making the same conditions and exclusions in the case of the General Act           as  a whole as we did in the case of the Optional Clause.    (2) It is essential to retain the right to bring any non-justiciable dispute before           the Council and to secure the suspension of the General Act procedure so           long as the  Council is dealing with the case.  This is what we  did,  as           regards  justiciable disputes,  in our acceptance of the Optional Clause,           and the case for  so doing is even stronger here, since treatment by the           Council is more likely  to be  suitable for a  non-justiciable than for a           justiciable dispute, while in the case of serious disputes there is an actual           obligation under the Covenant to bring them before the Council.    (3) As  explained above,  any State can  accede to the General Act, whether a           Member of the League or not, and the question whether we should accept           the obligations  of the General Act in relation to any State which may           accede to  it, or whether any class of  State should  be excluded from our           acceptance,  requires  careful  consideration.  The argument  against           exclusion is that, if arbitration is  desirable in itself, it is undesirable tc           distinguish between States and to divide them into  two classes, with one           of which we were prepared to arbitrate while we were not prepared tc           do so with the other; while to exclude a category of States from arbitration:           would not be in conformity with various pledges made by His Majesty&apos;;           Government in the United Kingdom in favour  of  arbitration.   On tht           other hand, if the considerations mentioned in paragraph (1) above an           accepted,  this involves at any  rate excluding from our acceptance of thi            General Act States which  are not entitled to sign  the Optional  Clause           since  otherwise we should be extending  the effect of our signature of thf           Optional Clause, which can only be signed by Members of the League antl            States mentioned in the Annex to the  Covenant.  This point is importan            because the defence of our signature of the Optional Clause in relatioi            to the question of belligerent rights depended  largely on the fact that ii            practice  only Members of the League are  likely to sign  the Optiomi            Clause.   Moreover, while there is no  difficulty as against other Member            of the League  in preserving our  right to bring non-justiciable dispute            before the Council in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant, thi            is by  no means the case as regards non-Members, who are not under an;            obligation to have any  dispute brought before the Council at all  Thi            is an argument for confining our acceptance of the General Act to State            Members  of the League.  Such a restriction would not in any way  affect            our obligation  to have justiciable disputes with any non-Member whie            might sign the Optional Clause decided by the Permanent Court.  Am
          it would, of course, leave us free to conclude bilateral arbitration treaties        .  , with. non-Members of the League, such as the United  States and Russia.          Such bilateral treaties are  in fact the only kind of arbitral engagements          which any State not a Member of the League is likely  to make.    7.   I  am of opinion, in view of the above considerations, that we should exclude from the  procedure  of  the General Act disputes with any State  which is not aMember of the League.    8.   In order to give effect to  these  reservations I have had prepared the attached draft accession  which I would ask my  colleagues to study and provisionally approve.    9.   It appears to me very important to  carry the Dominions  with  us  in thismatter and therefore, early in January, I directed the Foreign Office Committee whoare advising me on this subject,  to concert with  the  Dominions Office in  laying thematter before the Dominion Governments for their observations and at the same time suggested that advantage should be taken of the presence of the Dominion delegates to the Naval  Conference in London to hold informal discussions with them.  two meetings were held and  very useful discussions took place.  Speaking generally, theDominion representatives  raised no objection of principle to the  proposals whichwere explained to them, but  they were in no  case in a  position to express the considered views of their  Governments or to commit them in any way.  I ought,however, to  say that on one  particular point of importance Colonel Ralston, theCanadian  delegate, expressed  considerable  doubt  as to the advisability of indicating,by the  confinement of our acceptance to  States Members of the League or to states which  had signed  the  Optional Clause, that we were not prepared to  apply theGeneral Act as between ourselves  and  the United States.   Moreover,  ColonelRalston made it.clear that the composition of the Conciliation Commission providedfor in Article 4 of  Chapter I of the General Act did not commend itself to him, viz.,the bringing in  of the neutral at the first stage, and that he would prefer conciliation machinery of the  nature of that  provided by the  Boundary Waters Treaty withthe United States  of 1909, under  which all disputes of any kind  arising between canada and the United States may be  referred to an International Joint Commissionconsisting solely of nationals of the two parties, reference only being had to a neutralumpire in the event  of  the members  of the Commission  failing to agree.  Havingregard to  the practical  experience of the  usefulness of this method, the canadian government are likely to press strongly at  Geneva that provision should be made  forthe inclusion of this method as part of  the normal machinery  of  internationalarbitration in  future.   It may,  however,   be possible  to  meet the wishes of thatGovernment by  some  appropriate addition  to the proposed form of accession.    10.  In the meantime information has been received that the Government of  theUnion  of South Africa have doubts as to the advisability of acceding to the general act at all.  These  doubts, however, were expressed before the two meetings referredto above and I trust that in the light of the information then given to the dominion representatives  and of the further information which will  shortly  be available thatGovernment will be  disposed  to alter their views.  The fact, however, that suchdoubts have been expressed strengthens me  in the opinion that no further time shouldbe lost in  taking up the question officially  with the Dominion Governments in orderthat an agreed policy  should, if  possible, be reached before  the meeting  of  theAssembly  of the League of Nations in September.    11.   Acceptance of the General Act by a Government is performed by  simpleaccession  and not  by the process  of  signature  and subsequent ratification.  this being  the case, the  approval of  the  House  of Commons must be secured beforeaccession,  as, once this  country  has acceded,  it could not  withdraw in the event ofthe House declining  to  approve  our policy.  Owing to pressure of business  duringthe remainder  of  the  session, it  will probably  be  difficult,  if  not impossible,  toarrange for a  debate on  this subject before September.   In  the  circumstances,  Ipropose that at the  meeting  of  the Assembly the Representative  of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should not actually accede to  the General Act, but, subject to generalagreement being  reached with  the Dominion  Governments, should  announce  theintention  of His Majesty&apos;s Government  in the United Kingdom to  accede as soon asparliamentary  approval shall have been received.
