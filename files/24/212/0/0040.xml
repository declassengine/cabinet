Me;mora.ndam &quot;by the Lord Privy Seal and                 the President of the Board of Trade.                   *e have not been able to reach a final conclusion         on the question of the publication of the Iron and Steel-         Report.   V.o therefore set out below for the information of         our Colleagues a statement of the considerations that occur         to us for and against publication,                       A,  In Favour of Publication.              1. .   There is a general expectation that the Report         will be published.   The Committee was appointed as part         of the declared policy of the Government for dealing with         Industry, and although employers in the trade would         probably not welcome publication the workpeople will         undoubtedly press for publication,              2,    The Report of the Cotton Committee has been         prepared with a viev to publication, and publication will         be expected.   A very vide circulation of the Cotton Report         will bo necessary if It in to be used as the platform for         a serious appeal to the trade.   The publication of the         Cotton Report would reinforce demands for the publication         of the Iron and Steel Report.              3.    The withholding of the Iron and Steel Report from         publication would lead to suspicions as to its nature and         would give rise to the view that  it recommended uncondi -COPY NO.
     4.  The condition of the industry is so precarious and. concerted action so necessary tnat it might he as well to lot tae public have an informed statement on the true position of the industry which could he used as a basis for a real effort to secure its reorganisation.   It is very important to have it established on the authority of the Report  that, whatever the merits of safeguarding-, it is  no substitute for rationalisation.                E.  Against Publication.     1.  Paragraphs 104 and 161 report the  declarations of the  stoel  males rs that the existing handicaps on the  British industry&apos; are such that,  even if its  equipment v/ere modern  and thoroughly  efficient  it  is  impossible  for it  to  revive  in present  conditions,  and  that  without  safeguarding there  can be no  assurance  of  profit  for the  investor-.   The  public ascription  of  such  an opinion to the  representatives  of  the industry must  inevitably,  despite  the assurances of the Governor of the  Bank  of England as set  out  in paragraphs 170  and  174 (-vi.il) ,. tend  to  check  that  flow  of new capital to the industry which is  clearly very desirable.  These  are integral parts of the whole argument of the Report.  Thereare  a number- of less  important  statements the omission ofwhich would probably be expedient; or for the publicationof which the consent  of the witnesses would be necessary and night be withheld.     2.  The most serious  difficulty arises from paragraphs171  and 172.    The only recommendation made by the Committeeis contained in paragraph 175:         &quot;We recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Government      should take every step  in their power to urge on all      concerned in the conduct  of the iron and steel industry      the importance of proceeding as rapidly as possible with
9 9 Aii t) y      the formation of large regional amalgamations as      the essential preliminary condition to the recovery      of the trade that has &quot;been lost&quot;.        But that recommendation will not and cannot bedissociated from the statements in paragraphs 171 and 172 that many witnesses of great experience held that a measure ofprotection must precede or accompany re-organisation, and that whilst the Committee fear that safeguarding would at presentdelay re-organisation it may be dangerous to await there-organisation of the whole industry to determine if it willbe sufficient to meet foreign competition without safeguarding.Paragraph 172 in fact, read as a whole, definitely- contemplatesthe possibility of safeguarding.  The publication of a reportcontaining these paragraphs and signed by two members of theCabinet might be most embarrassing to the Government, havingregard to our repeated declarations of policy.  On the otherhand a summary of the conclusions of the Report which did notembody the substance of paragraph 171 would be seriouslyincomplete.                            (Intd.) J.H.T.                              &quot;     &apos;7,G05rd June., 1930.
