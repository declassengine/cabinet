OIL POLICY IN IRAQ.         MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE  FOR THE COLONIES.    AT their meeting on the 7th  May the  Cabinet authorised me to  send to theLligh Commissioner for Iraq a telegram instructing him to obtain the views of theIraq Government upon the proposals put forward by Sir J. Cadman for a compre-hensive arrangement with the French Government in connection with the constructionof a  railway and  pipeline  from  Tripoli to Tekrit.  I  now circulate,  for theinformation of  my colleagues, the High Commissioner^  reply to  that telegram(Appendix A).   It will be seen that the Iraq Government are most strongly opposedto the adoption  of an alignment through Syria for  the Iraq Petroleum Company&apos;spipeline and are not prepared to co-operate  in a  comprehensive  settlement with france on any such basis.    2.  I also circulate (Appendix B) a copy of a memorandum  prepared in myDepartment on the 5th  May, which time did not permit of being submitted to theCabinet for consideration when they met on the 7th May.  As will be seen, in that memorandum an alternative policy to that of mere acquiescence in the adoption  ofthe Tripoli alignment of the pipeline is suggested.  The  Department recommendthat His Majesty&apos;s Government should now withdraw their official support from theIraq  Petroleum  Company, leaving that Company to fight its own  battles with theIraq Government, and should, in effect, transfer their support to some other companymore subject to  British influence with the ultimate  object of  securing that  at least one company engaged in the oil development of Iraq constructs a pipeline to Haifa.     3.  Superficially, this proposal has much to commend it, but on the evidence available at present I should hesitate to give a final opinion.  It may even prove tobe impracticable.  But in any case  I think that  it merits consideration and shouldnot be rejected summarily or without careful examination.  It does not seem to menecessarily incompatible with the general line of policy adopted by the Cabinet  attheir meeting on the 7th May. At first sight, at all events, the two policies might  be reconciled.  It should not be impossible to secure an  adequate footing in Iraq forsome other oil company willing to  construct a pipeline to Haifa (either unaided  or with the collaboration of  the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who would  be forced  tosell 25 per cent, of its products to the French Government if these were exportedthrough  a Syrian port),  without  unduly restricting the  operations of the iraq petroleum Company or rendering the construction of a  pipeline to Tripoli financiallyunwarrantable.     4.  Such a  compromise may not, in practice, prove possible; but I feel myselfthat the policy recommended in the accompanying Departmental memorandum andthe  possible  variants thereof should be carefully explored  before  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment  finally identify  themselves with  the policy  of supporting the Syrianalignment against the strongly expressed wishes of Iraq.     I myself was never greatly impressed with Sir J. Cadman&apos;s arguments in favourof immediate action.  I see no reason why we should allow ourselves to be stampededinto a decision which, while obviously&apos;in accord with the wishes and interests of theFrench Government and the Iraq Petroleum  Company,  is not so  obviously in the       [21086]                                                         B                     Printed for the Cabinet.

interests of this country and Iraq.  Apart from this consideration, however, it is atleast open to question whether it would be either justifiable or politic to run counter to the wishes of the Iraq Government in this matter,  and to do so at a time whencritical  and delicate negotiations between the two countries are in progress.    5.   I suggest,  therefore,  that  the whole question should be re-examined by aspecial committee, either of the Cabinet or, in the first place, of officials, and that thiscommittee, in their deliberations, should be authorised  to seek the assistance and advice of technical experts not necessarily  in  Government employ.                                                                           P.    Colonial Office, May  16, 1930.APPENDIX A.  Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary                           of State for the Colonies.                            Dated 13th May, 1930.                      (Received 6 - 34 P.M. 13th May, 1930.)    IMMEDIATE.  NO. 216.    I saw  King Faisal, the Prime Minister  and Ja&apos;far Pasha this morning, and first put to them confidentially question (6) contained at the end of your telegramNo. 165 of 7th May.  I found that they were  already greatly perturbed at a reportpublished  in  the  Iraq press that the  President  of  the Lebanese  Republic had announced recently that a decision had been reached to construct the pipe-line fromMosul  oil-fields to Tripoli.  Prime Minister stated that he  had already drafted aletter of protest to me to  the effect that the Iraq Government could  never agree tothe northern alignment.  He also intimated that  he was on the point of addressinga letter to  the representative of the I.P.C.  stating that the Iraq Government  wouldbe obliged  not only to withhold &quot;their approval to Tripoli alignment but to suspendnegotiations for new  concession pending representation  by the Iraq Government ofwhat they  considered to be their vital interests in  this matter.  The King and thePrime Minister made it quite clear in discussion which  followed that no concessionor safeguard which could be negotiated with the French Government  could induceIraq Government to agree to a pipe-line and railway to Tripoli.  They said that anofficial letter would shortly be addressed to me setting  out their detailed reasons forinsisting in their own interests that the pipe-line and railway should go to Haifa,and requesting that the French Government should be informed in this sense. the answer to your questions (a) and (b) is therefore in the negative.  Personally I am ofopinion that the Iraq Government will not agree  to any revision of I.P.C. concessionuntil they  are satisfied that their own interests in  regard to alignment of pipe-line and railway are met.APPENDIX  B.                               Oil Policy in Iraq.    ACCORDING to Sir John Cadman a decision by the Iraq Petroleum company in favour  of  the northern route for  its pipeline to  the Mediterranean is nowinevitable.   The  present opportunity should, he considers, be seized to attempt by negotiation with the French  Government  to  secure such political and  economicconcessions as might  to some extent counteract the objections to the adoption of aroute through Syria.  It might be argued that the figures produced by Sir J. Cadmanto illustrate the overwhelming economic advantages claimed  for the northern routehave not been subjected to any measure of verification  by  the technical advisers ofHis  Majesty&apos;s  Government, or that his present statement as tc  the certainty of adecision in favour of that route may prove to  be no more  reliable than the equally
confident statements in an entirely contrary sense made by him on past occasions.  Itmight even be suggested that the advice given to His Majesty&apos;s Government by SirJ. Cadman both then and now was prompted as much by the desire to promote thecommercial interests of his company as by any solicitude for British interests.    2.  The  object of this note, however, is not to enquire into the  accuracy, orotherwise, of Sir J. Cadman&apos;s forecast in the matter of  the route to be adopted forthe pipeline, but,  accepting the Syria route as a fait accompli, to  examine theproposals which he  has  put forward  and to consider  whether there  is  not  some alternative course  of action open  to His Majesty&apos;s Government likely to produce more valuable results.    3.  His  proposal for the negotiation of a comprehensive agreement with theFrench Government for the adjustment of outstanding questions in the  Middle Eastis, it is suggested, altogether too nebulous to demand very serious attention.  So faras Iraq interests are concerned, he apparently has in mind the settlement of the Iraq-Syrian frontier and some arrangement whereby the.  French  Government Avouldundertake not to oppose Iraq&apos;s admission to the League  in 1932.   The  first of  thesequestions is admittedly one of considerable importance, but it is not one in regard towhich the Iraq Government need feel unduly anxious.  They have an extremelystrong case to support their demand for frontier revision and it seems probable that,if the matter were referred to the League, this would be recognised.    French opposition to Iraq&apos;s candidature for admission to the League in 1932might well wreck Iraq&apos;s chance of success, but it would  surely be radically unsoundto attempt to buy French support  by concrete economic  concessions, thus indirectlyencouraging similar  blackmailing demands in the future.    4.  The only really concrete proposal put forward by Sir J. Cadman is that forthe formation  of  an  international  company to undertake the construction  and working  of (1) a railway from Haifa to Baghdad via Tripoli, Horns, Tikrit, and (2)a pipeline from Tripoli to Tikrit.   To entrust the construction and working of the pipeline  to an international company of this nature would, Sir J. Cadman suggests,have the effect of limiting the extent of French control  over the pipeline.  But theIraq Petroleum Company itself is an international group and if, as is implied by SirJ. Cadman&apos;s suggestion, a pipeline constructed directly by it would be unduly subjectto French domination, it is  a little  difficult to see how the mere formation of anotherinternational company would have  the effect of securing a greater degree of immunity from  French  control.  Is  it not  possible that the true motive underlying  thissuggestion was Sir J. Cadman&apos;s desire  to disembarrass his company of the extremelycostly and unremunerative duty of constructing a  pipeline to the Mediterranean, a duty to which it is at present committed by its convention with the Iraq Government ?    5.   The  proposal for the construction of a railway  from Tripoli to Tikrit can,it is suggested, equally well be  explained by considerations of  self-interest.   Therailway would follow,  not the most direct line to Baghdad, but the proposed align-ment of  the pipe-line.  It  would not follow the line of the  traditional trade  route to Iraq and  Persia,  which, as Sir J. Cadman himself  pointed out in  his evidence before the Cabinet Committee last August, follows the  Baghdad-Haifa alignment.As Sir J. Cadman knows,  the French Government are  prepared to undertake theconstruction of a railway from Tripoli to Abu-Kemal on the Iraq-Syrian frontier.If that railway ended there, it could  not be a paying proposition.   Moreover, itwould mean that the section of the pipe-line from Tikrit to the Abu-Kemal wouldhave to be constructed without the assistance of a railway.  It seems clear, therefore,that Sir J.  Cadman&apos;s proposal would be of great benefit  to the Iraq  petroleum company, both as facilitating the  construction of the pipe-line and as  ensuring theco-operation of the French Government.  Would, however, this project  equally  serve the interests  of Iraq ?  A glance at the map will show  that if Iraq wishes to havedirect railway communication with the Mediterranean,  by far the cheapest meansof securing that end, and that most likely to increase the revenues of the existingIraq railway system, would be  to link up that system directly  with  the pre-warrailway through Turkey, which at present ends at Nisibin.  By this route eastboundtraffic for Persia and the Persian Gulf would pass over a much longer section of theIraq railways than would such traffic if it entered Iraq via. Abu-Kemal and Tikrit.    6.  Moreover, the Iraq Government had a definite purpose  in  mind  whenpressing for the construction of a railway on the Baghdad-Haifa alignment.   Sucha railway, they rightly considered, would set a definite limit to King Ibn Saud&apos;s      [21086]                                                        B 2
 ambitions for expansion northwards, and would prevent the separation of the States of Iraq and Trans-Jordan.  There is no reason to believe that the Iraq Government would be prepared to accept a railway on the alignment suggested by Sir J. Cadman, much less be willing  to  devote  part  of their slender  financial  resources to its construction.      7.  There  is, however, it is suggested,  an  alternative course  open to His Majesty&apos;s  Government, more  likely to serve  both Imperial and Iraqi  interests. Hitherto  the Iraq Petroleum  Company have  been treated as a primarily British concern, whose interests coincided with those  of His Majesty&apos;s Government.  The Company have always been given the full support  of the British Government in their dealings with the Iraq Government.   On more  than one occasion that support has proved to be of immense value to the Company.   For example, had His Majesty&apos;s Government not intervened with the Iraq  Government in 1925, the Company would never have secured  its  concession at all,  and had not His Majesty&apos;s Government intervened in 1928, it is probable that the B.O.D.  Company (the principal rivals of the  Iraq  Petroleum  Company) would  have secured substantial oil  concessions in Iraq.  The practical effect of our policy of consistent support for the Iraq Petroleum Company has been to exclude all outside competition  and  to secure for the  Company a virtual monopoly in Iraq.      8.  It is submitted that, in the new circumstances, a continuance of this policy is neither  logical nor desirable.  The  Iraq Petroleum Company can no longer  be considered as a British interest.   To all  intents and purposes it is now  a French concern, following a  policy dictated by  the French Government.   Whatever facade of internationalism may be set up,  the  Company&apos;s products will, in fact,  be under effective French control.   On these grounds alone it is submitted that His Majesty&apos;s Government  would  be  justified  in  withdrawing  their  support and  leaving  the Company to fight its  own battles with the Iraq  Government.      9.  The  Iraq Petroleum  Company is by  no means  popular in Iraq.  It  has always been regarded with deep suspicion by King Feisal and his Ministers, who have the strongest objection to giving a virtual monopoly over the oil resources of Iraq to any one international group. A bare hint to the Iraq Government that His Majesty&quot;s Government no longer regarded the Iraq Petroleum Company as a British interest would, it is anticipated, lead to an immediate  change of attitude on the part of the Iraq Government.  They would leap at  the opportunity for opposing an extension of the Iraq Petroleum  Company&apos;s  influence  in Iraq.   The result would probably be that  the  company  would soon  find itself in serious difficulties  with  the Iraq Government.      10.  The company is  at present attempting to negotiate with the Iraq Govern- ment an agreement whereby it would be given an exclusive concession over practically the whole of  the oil producing areas in  Iraq, namely, over an area of 10,000 square miles.  If it secures this concession it will possess what is tantamount to a monopoly of Iraq&apos;s  oil supplies.  The draft agreement  submitted  by the  company  has been referred to His Majesty&apos;s Government for their advice.  No  advice has as yet been given.  It  is  for consideration whether His Majesty&apos;s Government should not now suggest to  the Iraq Government that not more than (say)  half of the area asked for should be granted to the Company,  and that a sufficient balance should  be retained for development by other  Companies.      11.  Quite apart  from the question  of Imperial interests,  there  are serious grounds for doubt whether it  would be wise to entrust so large an area to any one company in Iraq, particularly  when one cannot be sure that it will suit the policy of so cosmopolitan a group as the  Iraq Petroleum Company really to exploit the oil resources  of Iraq to  their  utmost.  A little healthy competition in the Iraq oil-fields could scarcely operate to the disadvantage of Iraq, and by advising the Iraq Govern- ment not to grant a virtual monopoly to the Iraq Petroleum Company, His Majesty&apos;s Government would not be sacrificing Iraqi to  British interests.      12.  Next  month the Permanent Mandates Commission  will be called upon to consider a petition submitted  by  the Iraq Petroleum Company&apos;s rivals, the B.O.D. Company, which attempts to show that the present policy of excluding from Iraq all other oil  companies is delaying  the development of Iraq  and  operating  to  her- disadvantage.  Both Italian and German interests  are  represented in the BOD. Company  (which has, however, a preponderance  of British capital).  There  are
Italian and  German members in the P.M.C., and both this fact  and the nature ofthe question put to the British accredited representative when this subject came upfor discussion before the Commission last year suggests the possibility that theCommission may pronounce in favour of the admission of other companies into Iraq.    13.   It is not suggested that any change of attitude by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment towards the Iraq Petroleum Company or any advice that they may give to theIraq Government would  alter the  Company&apos;s decision in favour of the northernroute  for the  pipe-line,  although,  having reached  an impasse  with  the IraqGovernment, the Company&apos;s attitude even towards this question might  well becomesomewhat less uncompromising.   The policy proposed would have  as its object some-thing rather different, namely, the retention of a substantial portion of the oil-bearingareas of  Iraq for development by some other Company (not necessarily  the B.O.D.Company), which might be prepared to undertake, either acting alone or in collabora-tion with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the construction of a  separate pipe-line to the Mediterranean along the  southern route to Haifa.  It must be rememberedthat some eighteen months ago the B.O.D. Company themselves offered to construct a railway along this alignment, if granted an oil concession in Iraq.    14.   The question arises whether this policy would be inconsistent with theundertaking given to the French Government  in April  1929.   That undertakingwas that His Majesty&apos;s Government would put  no pressure upon the Iraq Govern-ment either to maintain or withdraw the condition to which the French Governmenthad  taken  exception  (i.e.,  a  condition  spontaneously imposed  by  the IraqGovernment, that the Iraq Petroleum Company should carry out a  survey and  submit a project for the construction of a railway from Baghdad to Haifa).  It is understoodthat the Foreign Office are somewhat anxious on this  point and feel that there wouldbe some difficulty in reconciling  the proposed change of attitude towards the iraq petroleum Company with that undertaking.  If  such is the case, it is submitted thattheir  fears  are unfounded.  No  undertaking was given  that  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment would continue to support the Iraq Petroleum Company in its dealings with the Iraq Government, or that, if the Iraq Government adhered to their condition as regards the Baghdad-Haifa route,  His Majesty&apos;s Government would  exert their influence to  secure the withdrawal of that condition.  On the contrary, the verywording of the British undertaking would expressly preclude any such action.  Allthat is now suggested is  that the Iraq Petroleum  Company should no longer be accorded British assistance in  Iraq and that it should  be suggested to the IraqGovernment that their interests might be better served by withholding  from  that company and retaining in their own hands a sufficient proportion of the oil-fields ofIraq to make it  worth the while of some other  company or companies to enter thefield.  It is difficult to see how such action could be held to be incompatible with thestrictly limited pledge given to the French Government in 1929.Middle East Department,    Colonial Office, May 5, 1930.
