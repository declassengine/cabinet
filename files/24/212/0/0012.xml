felg DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJSSTY^S GOVERNMENT. ST^                                               COPY NO._mi 162(30)                                 CABINET,                        Anglo-Russian Commercial Treaty.              Memorandum by the  President  of  the  Board of Trade.             The draft of a Commercial Treaty  between His Majesty1a       Government  and the Soviet Government,  which is to replace  the       modus Vivendi,  has now  been prepared in consultation with  the       departments concerned and, subject  possibly to some further       discussion  in regard to minor points,  is ready for submission to       the Russian negotiators.   Before this step is taken however I       think it desirable that the Cabinet should consider the       programme to he followed.             When the Russian negotiations  first began, it seemed  to       me that  the Russians would be more  anxious to conclude the       Commercial  Treaty than  we were as the  Treaty  could of       necessity be of very little direct  value to our traders.    I       therefore suggested to  the foreign  Secretary  that the Commercial       Treaty might be held back and used  as  an inducement to the       Russians to come to a settlement on other  questions in which we       were more concerned.             I gather now that  negotiations on the question of the        claims of this country, both  public and private,in respect of        debts cannot begin before June 16th, and I should therefore        like the guidance of my colleagues  as  to whether it is desirable        to initiate negotiations  in respect of the Commercial Treaty        at once  or  to postpone  the submission  of a draft until the        deht negotiations have  made some progress  or  have at least been        begun, and  as to how far  it would be desirable to delay  the        Treaty negotiations - so  far  as one party  can control their        course.
     I should add that the draft Treaty in its present  shapeappears to me to raise no question of general principle,  except possibly that of its duration;  and on that I should propose  tofollow the precedent of the Treaty of 1924 i.e,  to  provide  thatthe Treaty should run for not less than three years and be  subjectto denunciation at any time thereafter subject to 12 months noticeBoard of Trade,     16th May, 1930.
