MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.    I CIRCULATE, as requested at last week&apos;s meeting of the Cabinet, a copy ofthe High Commissioners telegram No. 217 of the 14th May (Appendix 1).    I was also directed to discuss the whole question with the Secretary of Statefor Air  with a view to submitting some agreed policy to the Cabinet.   I am seeing the Secretary of State for  Air to-morrow.  Meanwhile, with a view to  clearing theground for our discussion,. I sent the High Commissioner a private and personal telegram, of which a copy is attached as Appendix  2.   His reply (Appendix 3)reached me this morning.    I circulate &quot;these telegrams at once for the information of my colleagues.  I shallhope to be in a position to make a report to them, after discussion with Lord Thomson,at next Wednesday^ meeting.Colonial Office, May 26, 1930.[21130]B                   Printed for the Cabinet.

APPENDIX 1.        Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq  to the                        Secretary of State for the Colonies.                              Dated 14th May, 1930.   (received Part I, 7-35 A.M.  14th May, 1930; Part II, 11-5 A.M. 14th May, 1930.)s     IMMEDIATE.  NO. 217.     Reference your telegram  No.  169  of the 9th May.     Air Officer Commanding returned to Iraq on 9th May, and I have been in clos consultation with him.   I have seen and I concur in his telegram to the Air minister Z.45.J. of 12th May.  I entirely agree with the contention of His Majesty&apos;s Govern ment that  a Royal Air Force station must be  retained I  should prefer to sa; permanently retained in central Iraq  as well as at Shaibah-Basra, but I am unabl to agree that Hinaidi is the best possible site for the following reasons :       (1) Its close proximity to the capital would irritate the Iraq Government, whose^ policy would be to get rid of it, whatever party was in power.     (2) Doubt as to the durability of the site, chiefly due to (1) above, which would discourage  expenditure  on repairs and improvements to its inadequate buildings]     (3) It cannot be contended that in time of serious unrest its nine miles perimetei is defensible by ground troops allotted for this purpose.     (4) Its situation below flood level (in  time of the Turks boats sailed over it) The artificial bank by which it is protected is liable to be breached in time of trouble! It is my belief, moreover, that the Iraq Parliament would decline to pass an Article! involving its retention other than  on a temporary basis.     Lastly I find that I cannot agree with the view that the  removal of the royal Air Force  from the capital  or its immediate neighbourhood would  result in aij increase of the risk of internal unrest or the difficulty in dealing with  disturbances] I anticipate the contrary effect, and I may perhaps be allowed  to add that I aim convinced that the evacuation  of the white population from Kabul would have been quite  impracticable  from a  base near the  capital.   I strongly advise that His Majesty&apos;s Government should abandon the idea of retaining  Hinaidi for  a period longer  than  is necessary to  equip a suitable alternative site.   As Air  Officer Commanding shows in his telegram, such a site is not to be found wdthin twenty mile of Baghdad in low-lying country near the Tigris.  Moreover, the argument that the Tigris is an additional  means of communication with Basra will not hold  good foi long, since the needs of  navigation must inevitably give -way in time to the needs of irrigation.   Again, it would hardly be reasonable to ask  the  Iraq Government tc bear the  cost of  a connecting line railway which had  not been  projected in the! interests of Iraq and which would serve Imperial purposes only.   We must, if the soundness of tihe above arguments is conceded, look for some place centrally situated in the region of  the Euphrates,  which is not too far -from  Baghdad,  on healthy ground, close to a main road, and secure from floods, and in alignment with a railway which the Iraq Government have already projected, and which, if a landing-place for flying boats midway between Mediterranean and tihe Persian Gulf is a considera- tion, should be close to a large expanse of water.   It is confidently claimed that the! plateau situated between falujah and Habbaniya Lake fulfils all these requirements With regard to amenities, there  is almost unlimited space,  an up-to-date water! supply could be easily installed, there is greater scope for sport and recreation than! at Hinaidi, and every indication that the climate is much superior.  The Royal Airi Force would, in my opinion, find it easier in time of unrest to operate efficiently from! this compact, secure and elevated site than from  their present scattered, vulnerable! and potentially waterlogged station at Hinaidi.     I do not,  of course,  suggest the final  selection  of this site without close examination by a Committee of Experts, but I consider that it offers better prospects of permanence, health and comfort than any other site that has come  under notice. I ask. especially, His Majesty&apos;s Government to reconsider the instructions they have a;iven on this point.   Some difficulty is presented by the question of the cost of a move
from Hinaidi.   The analogy of Egypt is surely imperfect.   In Iraq His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are not in a position, as they are in Egypt, to insist on the provision bythe Iraq  Government of an alternative base as a  condition  of withdrawal from capital, and  the Iraq Government (which in future will  have to  pay for british military Mission) might refuse an alliance on such  onerous  terms   Moreover,  Iforesee that even if the cost were accepted by the Iraq Government they would notonly claim to have a voice in inconvenient details but  also would be inclined in future to press for the transfer of the new base to them.   Could not His Majesty&apos;s Govern-uent bear the cost of the move and of the construction  of the new station and at thesame time a diminution of the present burden on British taxpayer be ensured. Therewould in the  first place be the value of the Royal Air Force buildings at Mosul andIso  at Hinaidi  to be paid to His Majesty&apos;s Government, say   200,000.  Then theost of the British officers attached to the Iraq Army, about  60,000 annually, woulde saved.   Further, a considerable  saving on the annual cost of ground protectingroops approved by His  Majesty&apos;s  Government under new  scheme this mightmount to  30,000 annually.  The cost of the new station at Habbaniyah is roughlystimated at   1,000,000,  which,  at 5 per cent., could be amortised in 25 years at annnual cost of about  72,000.   Apart from  the savings indicated above, this wouldappear to be a moderate sum to pay  for two permanent Royal Air Force bases at&quot;abbaniyah and Shaibah and the replacement of the  inadequate quarters at Hinaidiby up-to-date cantonments on a healthier site, whereas I foresee enormous political as well as financial difficulties in inducing the Iraq  Government to pay.   The  financial aspect must  without doubt be left  open for a separate detailedgreement, but it seems to be necessary that the point should be settled in principles soon as  possible;  My telegrams* immediately following give proposed formuleeto cover  all the points in dispute, and I should be  glad  to  receive authority toegotiate on these lines.  I fear that further progress in negotiations will otherwise be deferred either  until a meeting in London or  until King FeisaFs  return to aghdad in the autumn.   The King, whose health is  poor, proposes  to leave Iraq for europe on the 1st June.  He is very anxious that the Treaty should be signed beforehat  date.APPENDIX  2. Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to  the High                           Commissioner for Iraq.                            Dated 23rd May, 1930.                       /  IMMEDIATE,  Private and Personal.  No. 183.  The Cabinet considered  the Questions raised in your telegram No. 217 at aeeting on the 21st May, but, owing to unavoidable absence of the Secretary of state for  Air,  no definite  decision was reached.  Some doubt was expressed as tohether there was much advantage in hurrying the present negotiations as comparedith resuming them  later in London when  Faisal  comes to Europe.  I  proposeowever, to raise the matter again at next Wednesday^ Meeting of the Cabinet.  2.   I  should be glad, in the meantime, to  learn your opinion, after consultationith the Air Officer  Commanding, with  regard to the  proposals for a settlementutlined later in this telegram.  These proposals should not of course be communi- ted to the Iraq Government at the present stage.  3.   I  should explain in the first instance that I am greatly  impressed  by yourievv that it is not desirable on political and other grounds that the Royal Air Force ould be retained at Hinaidi indefinitely against wishes of Iraq Government.   Airtaff. however,  adhere to  their objection  to  Habbaniya as  alternative site,  theistance of which from Baghdad would,  in  their opinion, diminish appreciably theeterrent  influence of  force  and  increase intelligence difficulties  and thus  theifliculty of early intervention in  the event of the outbreak of disorder.  In their inion, this objection must hold good until it has been proved that the Iraq  Govern-                                * Not printed.

merit are capable of maintaining internal order unassisted.  I note your view, whichis shared by the Air Staff, that the withdrawal of British Forces to Shaiba in 1932would involve serious risk of a collapse of the whole fabric of administration of Iraq.     4.  It is clear, however, that the British Forces cannot remain at Hinaidiindefinitely against the wishes of the Iraq Government, and, on the other hand, wecannot  contemplate the continuance indefinitely of a  situation  in which  HisMajesty&apos;s Government are morally responsible for the  internal  security of Iraq,while at the same time they are denied the means for discharging that responsibilityeffectively.     5.  It would  appear probable, however,  that the risk of collapse  which youapprehend would be sensibly reduced in a few years&apos; time.  The Iraq defence forces should in the interval have been developed to a higher pitch of efficiency,  and  theIraq Government would have had more practical  experience of the responsibilities of government.  It may be unlikely that the same standard of government could bemaintained without the moral support of British forces in Central Iraq,  but it doesnot seem to be unreasonable to hope that, given a breathing space of several years,during which the Iraq Government could in emergencies continue to rely upon  theR.A.F., they would be capable, with their own resources, of maintaining a reasonablystable administration on the oriental model.     6.  I incline to the view that in all the circumstances the question  of the ability of the Iraq  Government to manage their own affairs should  be put to  the test  of experience.   A period of five  years after the entry into  force of the Treaty shouldtest  the Iraq Governments capability to stand alone.  If the Iraq Government find themselves unable during that period to carry on without British assistance, theywill  presumably desire that the R.A.F.  should remain where they  are  at the end ofthat period.  If, on the other hand,  no necessity  arises  for seeking the  aid of  theR.A.F. during  that period,   the R.A.F. could on  its termination be withdrawnwithout undue misgiving  and concentrated either at Basra or, if  the  Iraq Govern-ment agreed, divided between Basra and Habbaniya, or some  other location.  It  is,of course, possible that the Iraq Government might during that period be compelledto invoke the assistance of the R.A.F. and yet at the end might still  wish them toleave Hinaidi.     I consider that in that case the R.A.F. should be withdrawn to Basra, it beingmade clear to Iraq Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not be in aposition  at  such a distance  to  take any hand  whatever in  the future in  themaintenance of internal security in Iraq.     7.  A necessary condition of the above proposal in any form would, however,  bethat some definite arrangement should be reached with the Iraq Government, underwhich His Majesty&apos;s Government would be assured of the permanent occupation ofan air base  in the vicinity of Basra.  This  is vitally  important both  (1)  in  theinterests of  Imperial defence, and (2)  from the point of view of our obligations under the suggested alliance with Iraq.     8.  The  concrete proposals to be made to  the  Iraq Government would thus be :(1) The Iraq  Government to grant to His Majesty&apos;s Government a permanent lease of an air and seaplane base at or in the neighbourhood  of Basra  to be selected  byHis  Majesty&apos;s Government;  (2) the British Air Force to remain  at Hinaidi for aperiod of five years  after the entry into force of the new Treaty, and to withdraw toBasra at the expiration of that period if  the Iraq Government so desire,  or withthe consent of the  Government of  Iraq to  acquire, in addition to Basra,  anotherstation possessing a better climate, in either case  the withdrawal  to be carried outwith all reasonable speed as and when alternative accommodation has been provided.     9.  I should be glad to receive your views upon these proposals, and in particular to be informed whether it is considered that (a) the contemplated arrangement wouldprovide adequate safeguard against a collapse of the administration, (6) any shorter period than that of five years suggested  (say, two or three years) could safely  beconsidered, (c) the proposal would be likely to be acceptable to Iraq Government.     10.  I understand that  it is estimated that  the cost of providing  additional accommodation at Basra would amount to approximately  1,000,000.   Clearly from your telegram you would find  considerable difficulty in inducing the Government ofIraq to accept contingent liability  for this expenditure.   I feel sure, on the otherhand, that His Majesty Government would be very unwilling to meet this expenditure
APPENDIX 3. Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commission for Iraq to the Secretary of State                                for the Colonies.                             Dated 26th May, 1930.                      (Received 5-55 A.M., 26th May, 1930.) IMMEDIATE, NO. 234, Private and Personal.     I  have  the following observations  to  offer on  your  private  and  personal telegram No. 183 of the 24th of May.*     (1) On  the  grounds explained at the beginning of my telegram No. 38 of the 24th April it would, 1  feel, be far preferable that a treaty should be concluded at Baghdad before King Faisal leaves for Europe.  As there suggested, His Majesty&apos;s Government  are likely  to  obtain more  satisfactory terms now than later  on,  the reason being that the  early signature  of treaty would  ease  the  present difficult position  of  Faisal  and  his  Government.  Nevertheless, I  appreciate necessity for removing any ambiguity before signature  and in the present telegram I shall attempt to do this.     (2) Both from my  instructions, and  in  particular  from paragraph 3 of your . telegram of  the  9th May, No. 169, I have  assumed throughout that  a necessary condition  of  a defensive alliance  with Iraq was the retention of R.A.F. stations in Central Iraq for the  whole period of the  alliance in  order  that His Majesty&apos;s Government might be enable effectively to implement their obligations.   Throughout the negotiations  I have used this argument.   If it were decided to withdraw the R.A.F. from Hinaidi to Basra after five years  this argument would fall to the ground, and it might be impossible to arrange for their retention at Hinaidi even for this period on grounds of internal security which the Iraq Government decline to admit.     (3) The  scheme outlined in my telegram of 14th May, No. 217, t contemplated R.A.F. remaining at Hinaidi for  (?) seven years from now with full consent of Iraq Government, and then  being transferred  to  Habbaniya  either permanently  or  for duration of the alliance.     (4) In my  opinion, and the  Air Officer Commanding holds the same view, aserious risk  of collapse of  the whole  fabric of  administration would be involved if british Forces were to withdraw to Shaiba as  early as 1940.     (5) Air  Officer  Commanding  agrees  with  me in  considering  that, even  ifassistance of the R.A.F. had not been invoked to preserve internal security duringthe five years following 1932, this  would not imply that internal tranquillity was assured.   The chief value of the R.A.F. in Iraq from the point of view of internal security is the deterrent influence which their  presence in accessible centres exertson  the natural  turbulency and  lawlessness  of the population.  The  Air  Officer Commanding cannot emphasize too strongly  this fact.    In the event of the with-drawal to  Shaiba, this deterring influence  would be removed from those  areas whichare most susceptible to unrest.    (6) Any difficulties regarding intelligence and liaison with which the R.A.F.would be confronted if stationed at Habbaniya could, I consider, easily be overcome.* Appendix 2.t Appendix 1.from  Imperial  funds,  and  would  consider  that the  Iraq  Government shouldindemnify them against the cost of constructing alternative accommodation at Basra.in return for  relinquishing to Iraq the valuable aerodromes and cantonments atMosul and Hinaidi.   The force ultimately to be retained at Basra would be there as much in the interests of Iraq as in the interests of this country, and both on broadgrounds of equity and having regard  to the Egyptian precedent,  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would almost certainly  insist that Iraq should accept this contingent liability.  Is it considered  that the imposition of this condition would be likely tobe an insuperable obstacle to  agreement?  Alternatively, it might  ostensibly be putin the form of the payment of a lump sum in respect of the property relinquished&quot;ontransfer of forces.
oIn the event  of  disorder,  early intervention by the R.A.F. against  Baghdad Citywould be just as difficult  as against Jerusalem.   But it is the tribes that matter,and intervention against  tribes outside would  be  just as easy from Habbaniya asfrom Hinaidi.    (7)  I  consider,  and the Air Officer Commanding agrees,  that if R.A.F. were Iwithdrawn in 1940  to Shaiba, although they would admittedly be badly placed for taking action, it would in practice be quite impossible for them to decline to  take ahand in maintaining security in Iraq, because  (a)  while British lives and property-were in danger they could not look on with folded wings,  and (b) if unchecked byIraq Forces unaided, disturbances would spread and potential extent of our military-commitments under  the new treaty would be immensely increased (in this connection,see paragraph 3 of your telegram No. 169).    (8)  Unless it was clearly laid down in the treaty that a definite (?) term was set to the occupation of Hinaidi  by R.A.F., and  that cost of new station at  Shaibawould  be  borne by  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government,  the arrangements  proposed for evacuation of  Hinaidi in paragraph 8 of your telegram  would  be extremelyrepugnant to Iraq Government.    (9)  I am strongly of opinion that it would be unjust to saddle the Iraq Govern-ment with the cost of new Shaiba  station in view of  the  Egyptian  precedent.My reasons for this view are :  (a) Iraq, unlike Egypt, which we have made rich,  ispoor and hard pressed  for money in  all directions; (b) the proposed  new station atShaiba would be a permanent British possession, whereas the draft Egyptian treatycontains nothing to prevent the cantonments at Ismailia  and elsewhere being handedover to the Egyptian Government at some future date;  (c)  R.A.F. lease of Hinaidiis limited to the period of the present treaty,  which expires  on the  entry of Iraqinto  the League, whereas  the British occupation  of  Cairo and Alexandria  is not limited  by former (? formal) treaties.  Foregoing three  arguments are similarly-applicable to the question  of the cost of a new station at Habbaniya.  Iraq Govern-ment do not admit that retention of Shaiba by  R.A.F. would be in the interests ofIraq, and  therefore they would not admit broad ground of equity.  In my opinion,imposition of condition that  Iraq should  payr this cost  would be an insuperableobstacle to agreement.    (10) If you are unable, as a result of Cabinet meeting next Wednesday, to sendme complete  instructions, there  will be no alternative but to suspend negotiationshere,  resuming  them later in London.   Both Faisal  and Prime Minister have,however, asked  me  to  beg His Majesty&apos;s Government  to  arrange if possible thatfinal instructions should reach me before Faisal is due to leave for Europe early next month.
