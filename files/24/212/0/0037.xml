June 1930.SECRET.                                                     Copy  No.CP. 187 (30).                                 CABINET.NEW  HEBRIDES.      MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  DOMINION AFFAIRS.    IN  connection with my Memorandum (as  Secretary of State for the Colonies)of the 9th January (CP. 11 (30) ) on the New Hebrides,&apos; I circulate to my colleaguesa copy of a despatch from the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australiaenquiring whether any steps have been taken to reopen with the French Governmentthe question  of  the  partition of  the  Group,  or,  alternatively, to  explore  thepossibility of surrendering our existing  rights in the Group, subject to guarantees for the reasonable treatment of British settlers, traders and missionaries, in returnfor some territorial  compensation elsewhere in the Pacific.    No  action  has  hitherto  been taken on these lines  because,  as explained  inparagraph 13 of my  Memorandum of the 9th January, the time has never  beenconsidered opportune  for approaching the French Government.    I propose to defer replying  to this  despatch until a decision has been reached on the questions raised in my Memorandum above referred to.                                                                          P.    Dominions Office, May 30, 1930.Despatch of March 31, 1930, from the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth  of           Australia to the  Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.(Secret.)My Lord,                                    Canberra, F.C.T., March 31, 1930.    I HAVE the honour to refer to Mr. Amery&apos;s cable despatch to his excellency the Governor-General, dated the 17th September, 1927, dealing with the difficulties inherent in the present system of dual control in the New Hebrides, and to the cabledespatch from  his Excellency the Governor-General to Mr.  Amery,  dated  the5th October, 1927, in which the Commonwealth Government advised that they con-sidered negotiations should again be  opened with  the French Government with aview to securing  some  form of partition of the Group, but, in the  event of such proposals being again  rejected,  they agreed that  the alternative of  surrenderingBritish rights in the New Hebrides for some territorial compensation in the Pacificshould be explored. In  the course of the year  1928 the Commonwealth Governmentreceived news of the sale or contemplated sale  of various British-owned plantationsin the New Hebrides to  French companies, and I have the honour to enclose a copyof a despatch I have  addressed  to his Excellency the High Commissioner for  theWestern Pacific enquiring the present position as regards the disposal of Britishplantations to French  interests.   In March 1928 the Commonwealth Governmentnoticed references in the French press to the necessity  for ending the Condominium.The Commonwealth Government feel that time is on the side of the French, and thatthe continual increase of French interests at the expense of British must tend  tostrengthen the belief of the French that they will ultimately be able to take over thewhole administration of the Group and render them less and less inclined to consider any plan for compensation elsewhere should His Majesty&apos;s Government be preparedto agree to surrender  their rights in  the New Hebrides  subject to guarantees  for      [21162]
thr reasonable treatment  of British  settlers,  traders  and  missionaries^ TheCommonwealth Government would be glad to be advised whether any developments have taken place  along the lines suggested in Mr. Amery s cable despatch of the17th September, 1927.                                   I  have,  &amp;c.                                        J. H. SCTJLLIN,                                            Prime Minister and Minister for                                                    External Affairs.The Eight Hon. the Secretary of  State       for Dominion Affairs.Sir,                                                          March 17, 1930.    I HAVE the honour to refer to your predecessor^ despatch of the 13th August,1928, forwarding a copy of a despatch from the Acting Resident Commissioner atVila, in which he  communicated  a list of plantations then under offer  by Britishowners to French companies.  The gradual increase of French interests at the expenseof British is causing the Commonwealth Government some concern, and I would beglad if your Excellency could inform  me as to the present position in this respect inthe New Hebrides.                                   I have, &amp;c.                                        J.  H. SCULLIN,                                             Prime Minister and Minister for                                                    External Affairs.His Excellency the High Commissioner for the        Western Facific, Suva, Fiji.
