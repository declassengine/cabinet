SINGAPORE.           MEkORANDUK BY TPS LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL .       1.    The question of the Singapore Base and its relation to our naval construction programme is among the subjects now sin the Cabinet&apos;s waiting list.   Now that the Naval Conference is over, we have before us new factors which,  I suggest^  render a review of the matter desirable.       2.    The Cabinet approved, on 6th November, 1929, the recommendations of the Fighting Services Committee that, pending the results of the Disarmament Conference, -       (l) The work on the Singapore Base should be slov/ed            down as much as possible.       (2) All work that can be suspended should be suspended:            and       (3). No new w.rk should be embarked on,       3.    In point of fact, as was explained by the First Lord of the Admiralty in his statement accompanying the Naval Estimates, -       &quot;Although no new commitments  are being entered into        pending the result of the London Naval Conference, it        has been found that It would nat be economical to retard        the w?rk contracted for, and,  in accordance with the terms        of the contract, considerably larger payments&quot;  (viz.         220,000) &quot;will have to be made in the year 1930 than in        the current financial year,&quot;       4.    The Prime Minister put before the Committee of Imperial Defence the question &quot;What would be the kind of Singapore Base re- quired if the first-class battleship was materially reduced in size or even ceased to exist?&quot;
The Admiralty, in reply to this question, emphasised that a mere reduction in size of capital ships would not affect theneed fur two docks, but stated that -     &quot;If all capital ships were to be scrapped within the      next few years, the existing commercial docking      facilities at Singaporey. in conjunction with the      Admiralty floating dock, would be sufficient:, assuming      that the abolition of the capital shipi-osuite!      in a proportional result in global tonnage.&quot;      5.  The London jYaval Conference is now over;  and theBritish Government has expressed the view during the conference that the battleship is &quot;a doubtful  proposition&quot;,and has indicated that it looks to&apos; the abolition of this weapon.    A holidayin battleship replacement has been agreed upon,  and thenumber of our capital ships is to be reduced,, within a short period, from 20 to 15.   Might we not, whilst makingreasonable allowance for the possibility that Francemay insist on building a rival to the &quot;Ersatz Preussen&quot;,and that Italy may follow suit.,  show at least somuch confidence in our own policy with regard to abolition ofthe battleship as to modify our policy at Singapore accordingly?      6.   The arguments for abolition of the  battleship andfor curtailment of the Singapore project are political,technical and economic.    I will not here attemptto  summarise the political or the technical arguments (thoughpersonally I believe the political case to be a strong one,having regard to our policy on arbitration, the  amendment ofthe Covenant, and the Kellogg Pact;   I am impressed by the evidences that the battleship is an obsolescentweapon;  and I am not convinced  by the argument set out in cp. 243 (29) (Appendix 1)  that Singapore is well suitedfor defensive, but ill suited for offensive, war).                            -2-
I wish only to remind my colleagues of the extraordinarygravity of the economic problem in regard to naval son-struction which will face us in and before 1936, andwhich would be Immensely aggravated if we should fail tosecure abolition of the battleship (or if a new type wereto replace it),     7.   Our Naval Estimates, even after the recent reduc-tion, stand at no less than  5lf millions.   The cabinet will, I think, agree that it would be intolerable that a figure already so enormous should be substantially increasedby a Labour Government, unless for the gravest reasons,,   yet the fact is that the figure is onl;y so low as this becauseexpenditure on new construction has been reduced to a minimumwhilst we still have the ships built during the war period.The Naval Treat;/- allows us a maximum of 339,000 tons of cruisers, and allows us to build 91,000 tons of replacementcruisers (in addition to those already building ) by the endof 1936,   I would emphasize that we cannot possibly maintaineither this number of modern cruisers or the large corres-ponding numbers of destroyers and submarines allowed by theTreaty without a costly programme of shipbuilding during thecoming years.   Thus a grave problem confronts the Chancellorof the Exchequer, in whatever Government, even if new battle-ships are left out of account.   If on top of this programme for new construction a still further estimate for battleshipreplacement should be superimposed in 1936, the Chancellor1sproblem then would be desperate.     8.   Conclusion.   I suggest for the consideration ofmy colleagues -      (a) that, for political, technical and economic reasons,the policy of HaM.Government should for the present be based
on the assumption that we  desire,  and shall continue to press for, the abolition of the battleship;  and      (b) that further development  of singapore fOJ? $he use  of battleships shouldbe stopped, oi? &apos;;iue assumption  that  this isthe policy of h*.M. Governments                       (Intd.)  P.Privy Council Office,    May 14th, 1950.
