SECRET.                                                     Copy No.   3 8CP.  167 (30).                                 CABINET.TREATY  SETTLEMENT WITH  IRAQ.        MEMORANDUM BY  THE SECRETARY  OF STATE  FOR THE COLONIES.    TREATY negotiations have  been proceeding in  Baghdad for the last  fewweeks.  Considerable progress has been made, and substantial agreement has beenreached on most of the points to be covered in the new Treaty with Iraq.   For all practical purposes the differences between the two parties have been narrowed dowmto one question; the vital one of the retention of British  forces in  Iraq after Iraqenters the League of Nations.  King Feisal himself has stated that  if this questioncan be satisfactorily disposed of, little difficulty need be anticipated in  settling theremaining provisions of the Treaty.  But upon this question something approachinga deadlock has been reached.    2.  My colleagues will remember that the proposals for  a draft Treaty whichthe High Commissioner for Iraq was instructed  to negotiate with the Iraq Govern-ment  contemplated  the retention of British Air  Force contingents, with supporting-ground troops, in three localities in Iraq, namely, Mosul,  Hinaidi (on the outskirts of Baghdad), and in the vicinity of Basra.  When this proposal was put forward bySir Francis Humphrys, it met with the most lively opposition on the part of the IraqGovernment.  They pointed out that it would, in  fact, involve more or less permanentBritish military occupation of the  country, which was not only wholly incompatible with the independent status to which Iraq would attain on entering the League ofNations,  but was, in their  opinion, unnecessary, since they were confident  of their capacity  to  deal with the question of internal security  (as opposed  to external aggression)  with the  forces  at  their  own command, and  without seeking  theassistance of the Royal Air Force.   In particular, the Iraq Government  showedthemselves most strongly opposed to the suggestion for the retention of British forcesat Hinaidi,  in the  immediate vicinity of  the  capital of Iraq.  My colleagues mayremember that the Iraq Governments reaction to this proposal was anticipated inthe memorandum by the Middle East Department, which I circulated to  the Cabineton the 3rd September last (CP. 239 (29)).    3.  At first, the Iraq Government declined to contemplate the retention of  any british forces upon Iraq soil after  Iraq entered the League.  They were ready, they said,  to afford  us every facility that we might  need in peace  and  in war  for thepassage of troops across Iraq and for the use of  Iraq&apos;s aerodromes, but,  rather thanacquiesce in what was tantamount to permanent British military occupation, theywould prefer to dispense altogether with a defensive alliance with this country,  andto content themselves  with  an ordinary treaty of amity. They professed to believethat the danger of Iraq becoming involved in  a conflict with  any of her neighbourswas remote.   Iraq was now on excellent terms  with Turkey and Syria, and, in viewrof the recent rapprochement between King Feisal and Ibn Saud, there was no longer any serious  threat  to Iraq&apos;s  desert  frontier.  They  would, of course, prefer  a defensive alliance,  but even  if this  were concluded,  they  saw no  need  for  thecontinued retention of British forces in Iraq.   The threat of British intervention would, they contended, in  itself  act  as  a sufficiently powerful deterxent  against external aggression.  If, for their own purposes, Flis Majesty&apos;s Government -wishedto retain air forces in the Middle East, why should they not  be stationed either inTrans-Jordan or Koweit,  where there would be  no  question  of  infringing  theprinciple of national  independence?

Ti    4.  At a later stage in the negotiations, however, the Iraq Government made adefinite advance.  Recognising  this country&apos;s  important interests in the persian gulf, they offered to allow a British air force  to be retained  in the neighbourhoodof Basra for the duration of the Treaty (25 years), and suggested that they mightbe willing to grant to His Majesty&apos;s Government the permanent lease of the necessaryaccommodation for an aerodrome  and encampment in this region.  This offer was accompanied by an undertaking  to extend to His Majesty&apos;s Government the free useof Iraqi aerodromes in peace and in war and every facility for manoeuvres, trainingflights. c%c.    5.  There  is much force in  the Iraq Governments contention that it would bedifficult to reconcile the permanent presence of a British force  just outside Baghdadwith  Iraq&apos;s status as a fully  independent  Power.   But the Iraq  Governmentsconfidence in their own  capacity  to  deal unassisted with the potential forces of disorder in the  country is not shared either by the High Commissioner or  by the AirStaff.  In the view of the High Commissioner, if the British forces were to be with-drawn from Central Iraq,  the country would lapse  into chaos.   The same view  is held by the Air Staff.    6.  The  High Commissioner  has  suggested, as a  possible compromise, (1), ascheme for the substitution of Iraqi for British Air Forces at Mosul after a term ofyears,  and (2),  the withdrawal  of the British Air  Force at  present stationed atHinaidi to Habbaniya, some 45 miles  from Baghdad.  The High  Commissioner hasbeen informed that his suggestion as  regards Mosul is acceptable to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.  His proposal for the withdrawal of the Royal Air Force to Habbaniyais  not, however,  acceptable to the Air Staff.   In their view, the most  probablecontributory cause of external aggression would be the outbreak of internal disorder in Iraq, which  would be  greatly increased if the British air force were removed toany distance from Baghdad.  Their  presence just  outside the  capital acts as a powerful  deterrent  to  disorder,  and  would  enable  His  Majesty&apos;s Governmentunobtrusively to influence the course of events in the case of imminent trouble.    7.  As to the Iraq  Governments proposal for the concentration of  all british forces at the head of the  Persian Gulf, the view of the Air Staff is that the absenceof British forces from Central Iraq would prevent prompt and effective interventionon Iraq&apos;s Northern frontier to repel invasion, which, if not checked at the outset, andif allowed to develop, could not be dealt with by air action alone, but would probably  Icall for the dispatch of a British Expeditionary Force to Iraq, and involve a seriousmilitary campaign.  The exclusion  of British forces from Central Iraq would thus,in their opinion, appreciably increase the potential extent of British military commit-ments under the new  Treaty.    8.  My own Department take a  somewhat different view.  They are  doubtfulwhether the removal of the Royal Air Force  from Central Iraq would in fact leadto complete  chaos and the  collapse of the Iraqi State.  They do not suggest thatthe same  standard of Government could be maintained  throughout Iraq  if theRoyal  Air Force were withdrawn to Basra,  perhaps  not even  the  same type ofGovernment, i.e.,  by  Parliamentary  institutions.    They  anticipate  that  thewithdrawal  of  the British air force from Central  Iraq would probably be followedby a period of  unrest and  sporadic disorder throughout Iraq, that parliamentary government might possibly be  demolished and that an admittedly inefficient butworkable system of  Oriental  despotism would  ultimately take its  place.  In theprocess essential British interests would not,  they consider, suffer irretrievabledamage, and the vital interests of Imperial defence could be adequatety safeguardedfrom  Basra.    9.  Clearly, I think the question  whether Iraq can or cannot stand on her ownfeet is, and must remain for some  years, a matter of conjecture.  The Iraq Govern-ment may be right and the Air  Staff wrong.  Obviously we do not want to see theIraq State, which we have established at such cost in effort and money, fall to piecesand the country relapse  into  disorder.  On  the  other  hand,   we may well heunder-rating the capacity of the Iraq Government to run their own show.     10.  The Air Staff, I understand, are prepared to put the  question to the test of experience.  They have suggested as a possible compromise that the Royal Air force should be retained at Hinaidi for the first five years after the new Treaty enters intoforce, oh the understanding that if, at the end  of that period, the Iraq Governmentshould still wish the Royal Air Force to leave the capital, then the forces at present
 at  Hinaidi would be withdrawn to Basra so soon as the necessary accommodation had been made available.  The  Air Staff contemplate that within that period of five years either the Iraq Government will find themselves unable to carry on without our assistance and will then presumably wish the Royal Air Force to remain where they are, or they will manage to carry on without British assistance, in which case there will be no excuse or reason for the Royal Air Force to  remain in Central Iraq, and they could be withdrawn with  a clear mind to Basra.  There is a third possible contingency.  The Iraq  Government might  find themselves forced  to invoke  the assistance of the Royal Air Force,  and nevertheless,. prompted by considerations of amour-propre, they might demand the withdrawal of that  Force at the end of the five years&apos; period.  In  such circumstances the British Air  Force  would,  of course, have to  leave,  and we  should  have to face  the  risk of the country  relapsing into disorder.     11.   It is not unreasonable  to hope, however, that before that time comes the army  and  the  security forces of  Iraq  would  be developed to  a higher  pitch of efficiency than  at present.   The  Iraq  Government  would  have  had  practical experience of the responsibilities of self-government.   There would have been ample time for such political and administrative adjustments as circumstances might show to be necessary. Moreover,  the balance of the probability seems to be either that the Royal Air  Force will  remain at  Hinaidi  indefinitely at the request  of the Iraq Government, or that  when they withdraw7 they will leave behind them  a  reasonably well-ordered and stable administration.  A necessary condition of this proposal is, however, that some arrangement should be made with the Iraq Government whereby His Majesty&apos;s Government are assured of permanent occupation of  an air-base in the neighbourhood of  Basrah.  This, I understand,  is vitally  important in the interests of imperial defence; but it is also essential in order to enable us to discharge our obligations  under the proposed alliance with Iraq.  As explained above, in the view of the Air Staff, our commitments under the alliance would become potentially more onerous in the event of a complete withdrawal to Basrah, since effective inter- vention in the initial  stages of a conflict would be impossible.  But even  from Basrah those obligations could  be adequately discharged, although  possibly at  greater cost.     12.   A proposition on the above lines would, I think, ultimately  be accepted by the Iraq Government, but there remains to be considered the almost equally difficult question of finance.  We had  contemplated  that, if  the  British Forces were with- drawn  from  their  present stations in Central and  Northern  Iraq,  the  Iraq Government, having,regard to  the Egyptian  precedent, would agree to meet the cost of  providing  alternative accommodation elsewhere.   The High  Commissioner  has now informed us that, in his opinion, our hopes were ill-founded.  In effect, he says that there is no prospect whatever of inducing the Iraq Government to accept  any such  contingent liability, and even if the  Iraq Government could themselves be brought  to agree, they would inevitably be disavowed later by the Iraqi Parliament. The Egyptian  precedent, as the  High Commissioner  points out, is not strictly relevant.  In the case of Egypt, the provision of alternative accommodation for our troops is part of the  price which the Egyptian Government  must  pay for the with- drawal of British opposition to  the admission of Egypt to the League of  Nations. This lever can no longer be used in the case of Iraq. We have already unconditionally promised to support/Iraq&apos;s candidature  for  admission to the League in 1932.  We cannot now attempt  to qualify or  condition that promise.   Moreover,  it would be useless to  threaten the Iraq Government  with  the  withdrawal of our  offer of  a defensive  alliance, since, as  has   been  explained  above,   the  Iraq  Government apparently set  little  store  by  the  alliance,  and  do  not  accept the view that  our obligations  thereunder  demand the permanent presence of  British Forces  in Iraq. Apart, however, from this conflict of opinion, there is the practical consideration that the  Iraq Government are  at present in desperate financial straits.  Owing to the fall in the world  price of grain, Iraqi cultivators cannot market their produce. This had a disastrous effect upon the collection of revenue, and the Iraq  Government are now  faced with the practical  certainty of a serious Budget deficit.   In this atmosphere&apos; of acute financial stringenc)r, the Iraq Government would naturally be^the more reluctant to  accept any substantial new financial commitment.    13.  I  do not suggest that this view should be accepted as inevitable  without being put to the test, or  that His  Majesty&apos;s Government should  assume this con- tingent liability unless and until it has been definitely proved that there  is  no chance whatever of inducing  the Iraq Government to accept it.  I suggest, however, that, if       [21094]                                                        B 2
it becomes evident that by no  other means can a satisfactory treaty ,be concluded with the  Iraq Government,  His Majesty&apos;s Government  should  in  the last resortthemselves agree to meet the cost of providing the extra accommodation at Basra, inthe event of our Forces having to withdraw from Hinaidi at the end of the five years&apos;period.    14.   It is estimated that the cost would be in the neighbourhood of  1,000,000,to be spread over some three years; but, against this, there will be certain savings.The High Commissioner  anticipates that  a  reorganisation of the system of  theground  defence for our aerodromes in Iraq, which he has recommended, would leadto an annual economy of some   30,000.   To this must  be added  the amount of thejn-esent  subsidy towards the cost of the Iraq army, viz.,  60,000, which would not becontinued  under  the new arrangements.   Both  these economies  would begin to operate as from the entry into force of the new  Treaty, and thus  a  sum of some 450,000 would have been saved before the time came to consider the removal of our forces to  Basrah.   The High Commissioner anticipates, also, that the value of theRoyal Air Force  buildings at  Mosul and ITinaidi,  to be handed over to the IraqGovernment, would approximate to  200,000,  and this the Iraq Government would,of course, have to pay.  I understand, moreover, that the Air Staff would probablybe prepared to consider dispensing with one squadron, if the whole of the Royal  AirForce in Iraq were concentrated at Basrah.  This would involve an annual saving ofapproximately  130,000.    It  will be realised, therefore, that there are substantial economies  to  set offagainst this contingent liability, and that even if some seven years hence  we are compelled to concentrate our Forces at Basrah and to meet the cost of providing additional accommodation there,  it is unlikely on the  balance  to result  in  anysubstantial increase of our present financial  commitments in Iraq.  In any case it is,I submit,  a relatively small price to pay in return for securing the essential require-ments of Imperial defence.    15.   It may be asked, why do we want an alliance with Iraq at all?   The IraqGovernment do not seem to set much store by it.  It entails the possibility of seriously;defence commitments,  and the  professed policy of His  Majesty&apos;s Government is to liquidate, so soon  as may be, their commitments in Iraq.  Why not abandon the ideaof an alliance and be satisfied with a simple treaty of friendship ?  The answer ti-that question  is,  I think, that an alliance is vitally necessary in order to secureImperial interests.  This was held to be the case in Egypt, and the same considera-tions apply in the case of Iraq.  There is no other means of securing the unfettereduse in all circumstances of our strategic air route, of adequately safeguarding  ourposition at the head  of the Persian Gulf and of obtaining a permanent base for ourMiddle-Eastern air reserve.  By no other  means can we be sure of preventing someother  Power from establishing  itself in Iraq and threatening our vital communica-tions  by air and  sea.  In  default  of  a formal alliance,  we could not, withoutcontravening the  accepted principles of neutrality, retain our forces at Basrah, or make use of Iraqi territory  in the event of a war  in which this country,  but notIraq, was engaged.  Our interests in these regions are such that, even if we had nodefensive alliance with Iraq, we could not afford to stand aside if the territorial integrity  of  Iraq was seriously threatened.   That being the case,  it is clearly desirable that there should be a formal alliance.  Its very existence should act as an effective deterrent against irresponsible action by other  Powers.  The knowledge that Iraq  could count upon British assistance in any conflict should give pause to any state contemplating aggression.    16.  Moreover, without  some  such  assurance of the continuing  stability of theIraq  State as would  be  provided by  a  formal alliance with this country, it is extremely doubtful whether the Council of the League of Nations could be brought to relieve  this country  of her mandatory responsibilities.   In  1925,  as a condition ofawarding the  Mosul province to Iraq, the Council of the League stipulated that theMandate  should continue for a maximum period of 25 years.  It is scarcely likely that, after the elapse of only seven years, the  League Council would be prepared soradically to revise their former opinion as to agree to release Iraq from the Mandatewithout at the same time requiring adequate safeguards for her future stability.    17.   There is one other question of only slightly less  importance which  has arisen in the course of the negotiations with Iraq. My  colleagues will  recollect thatthe treaty proposals which the Cabinet approved contemplated that the Treaty would
be of indefinite duration,  but could be revised at the end of 25 years by agreementbetween  the  two parties.   Thus it would have been  possible  for His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment,  by withholding their approval, to block any attempt on the part of theIraq Government to secure the termination or revision of the Treaty at a time or ina manner considered contrary to British interests.  As in  the case of  Egypt, thisprovision has met with strong opposition in  Iraq.  The Iraq Government have putforward  a  counter-proposal, the effect  of which would be  that  the Treaty woulddefinitely come to an end after 25 years, unless it was extended with the agreementof both parties,   T fear that there  is little prospect of tying the Iraq Governmentdown to a Treat)7 which might continue in perpetuity, and that it will be necessaryto go some distance to meet them in this matter.  I suggest, therefore, that the HighCommissioner should be authorised, if necessary, to accept an arrangement, such asthat contemplated in the recent negotiations  with the Egyptian Government, whichwould provide that, at the expiration of a period of 25 years, either of the HighContracting Parties could demand that negotiations be opened  with a view  to itsrevision,  and  in the case of disagreement the difference should  be submitted to  theCouncil of the League.    18.   To sum  up, I recommend  that I be authorised by  the Cabinet to instruct the  High Commissioner to negotiate with the Iraq Government on the  following basis :     (1) His  Majestvs  Government  to  be granted  by  the  Iraq  Government a          permanent lease of an air-base, to be selected by His Majestvs Govern-          ment, at. or in the vicinity of Basrah;    (2) The British Air Force to remain at Hinaidi  for 5 years after the entry into          force of the new Treaty, and  at the expiration of that period to withdraw          to Basrah if the Iraq Government so desire, the withdrawal to be carried          out with all reasonable despatch;    (3) The Iraq  Government to assume the contingent liability for  meeting the cost          of constructing the necessary, additional accommodation at Basrah, unless          the High Commissioner is satisfied that insistence on this condition would          involve a definite breakdown of  negotiations and the  rejection  of  the          Treaty, in  which event this  liability to  be  accepted  by His Majesty/s          Government;    (4) The Treaty to  provide that, at any time after the expiration of a period of          25 years, the High Contracting Parties will, at the request of either of          them, enter  into negotiations with a view  to  such revision of its  terms by          agreement as may be appropriate in the existing circumstances, and that,          in case of disagreement, the difference will  be submitted to the Council          of the  League.
