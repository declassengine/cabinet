fa 6.S DOCUMiSO  IS THE PROPERTY  01&apos; HIS BBXTMBIC MAJESTY&apos; S  GOVBRRMHHT) .jil G RET.P. 1.86 (30)COPY NO.       \  JCABINET.NEfc HEBRIDES   Mem or andura by the Chano ell or^of t h e -Ex che quo r .          In his Memorandum of the 9th January 1S30  (CP.  11  (30) the Secretary of State for the Colonies surveys the history  of.our interest in the  Jew Hebrides group of Islands;   showsthat the present position is far from satisfactory;  and .,concludes that the only possible solution is  to prove to theFrench , the natives, and the British settlers that we intend,  toplay a more energetic part in the Condominium in future, byspending a great deal more money on administration thanheretofore.          His actual proposal is to spend  31,000 on theprovision of a new yacht for the Resident Commissioner  (whichwill cost  6,000 a year thereafter to keep up);   and  10,000initial and  5,000 per annum recurrent on a scheme of nativeeducation.   Our normal expenditure in the Group is about 11,000 per annum35&quot;;  so that under the Secretary of State&apos;proposal the recurrent cost of these islands to the British tax payer will ho just doubled, in addition to a capitalexpenditure of over  40,000.          It is admitted that British interests in this group are ludicrously small.   In 1927 there were only 53 separateBritish undertakings in the Islands, of which 29 were owned or controlled by settlers from Australia, 12 from Great Britain,x in addition to the expenses of the Joint Anglo-French  Administration, which are borne by local revenues.
                                                             a O P&apos;                                                             6 63   and 3 from New Zealand,  the balance being owned or controlled   by foreigners who have oot6d for British  status;    and the   total British population,  including women and childron,  was   only Ell.   Later figures  are not available,  but  the numbers   have probably fallen since 1927.   Thoro  is no direct trado   with Great Britain at all;   and the trade with Australia in   1924/25 amounted to only  32,200 (exports) and  94,400 (imports).   The Admiralty say that the Islands are of no strategic   importance.             I propose therefore that at the Imperial Conference  . we inform the Australian and New Zealand  Governments that we   are no longer prepared to  spend money from British funds on   the administration of these islands, in which our interests are   negligible;    that if they consider it neoessary that the   Condominium should be rotained in the interests of Australia   and New Zealand,  they are  welcome to take our place and bear   the whole cost themselves,  but that if they are not prepared   to do that,  we intend to negotiate forthwith with the French   for the surrender of our interest on the  best terms possible,   and that falling any territorial or othor compensation,  we   shall withdraw with no other condition thai the securing of  &apos; guarantees for the reasonable treatment of British settlers,   traders and missionaries.             The only argument against withdrawal is that it   would constitute  a loss  of prestige.   I  do not think that,   on the facts of the present case, that is an argument that   will carry any weight with reasonable people.                             (Intd.)  P.S.Treasury Chambers,  Whitehall, S.K.,    May 30th, 1930.
