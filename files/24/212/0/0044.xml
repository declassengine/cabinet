                                                           w &apos;i 0              Conclusions  of a Meeting to         consider the  Report of  thp  Committee on            Agricultural, Research Organisation.      The Meeting tool:  place in Lord PamoOf&apos;s  room at the Reuse of  Lords at 5.30 p.m.  on  Monday&apos;,  26th May,  1950,      The Meeting was called, at the invitation of Lord Parmocr, in accordance  with Conclusion 11  of Cabinet  Coii- clusions 28 (30)  of 21st  May, 1930.  to consider further the Report  of the  Committee of the  Economic-^Advisory Council on Agricultural  Research Organisation  (Paper  CP. -154 (30)&apos;) , and a Memorandum  by  tho Minister of Agriculture  and Fisheries (Paper  CP.-168  (30)).      Present:   Lord Parmcor, Lord  President of tlie Council., (in the Chair),  Lord Passfieid,  Secretary  of State for the Dominions and  Colonies, Mr.  W. Adams on, Secretary  t*f  State for Scotland,  Mr. Fool Buxton, Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, Mr. A.  Grcsswrnd., Minister of health,Mr. F.W. pethick-Lawrence,  Financial  Secretary  to  theTreasury,, and Mr.  -V.R. Smith, Pq^rlj omentary  secretary to the Board of Trade (representing Mr. William Graham).      Lord  Parmoor, in opening  the  discussion,  pointed out that the Report on Agricultural  Hesearch Organisation did nou emanate from his  Department,  but he  considered tLie constitution  of the proposed Council for agricultural research would, be  of great  value to the development of agriculture in this country.      The Meeting was unanimous  as  to  the need  for promoting agricultural research, and  considered that a further st*p in the organisation of  research work  was  now required.    There was general  assent  be the early establish- ment cf an  Agricultural Research Council.
          The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries andthe Secretary cf State for Scotland, however, expressed doubts as to the proposed constitution of thq. research council, and asked for further information as to whereresponsibility for research would lie, if the recemmenda-tions were adopted.,   It was pointed -nit that the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland would continue to be responsible for ail thework within their Departments;  but the Lord President-of the Council would be responsible for the work andexponditu.ro of the -proposed Council, which would be confined to rosearch only, as in the case of existingResearch Councils.                             &apos;          The two Ministers also feared that there mightbe interference on the part af the now Research Councilin the wcrk controlled by their Departments.  Lord Parm^orreferred to the cxperionco of the Medical Research Counciland the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.There had been nc friction with other Departments duringthe period of about 15 years that these arrangements hadbeen in being.   There would, in his opinion, bo no fearof any clash between the Departments and a Council composedin the manner suggested.   In illustration cf this vie?&apos; be referred to the fact that Lord Balfour, and subsequentlyLend D&apos;Abe men, had been Chairman of the Medical research council, and that Sir rtrnest Rutherford had recently beenappointed Chairman cf the Advisory Council for scientific and Industrial   search.          It was made clear that, under the proposals,detailed Treasury control of expenditure would be maintained.&quot;          The Meeting was in favour of the Report being adopted, and I dosire to make a recommendation tr this
effect.   The Minister of Agriculture and. fisheries and. the Secretary of State for Scotland desired, however,that their objections state above should be placed on record.          At the suggestion of lord Passfieid, it wasagreed to recommend the following amendments tea theBe port of the Committee on Agricultural research organisation :-     (a) para. 23 (d) (iv), page 7, omit everything after             &quot;requirements&quot;;  para. 23 (d) (vi), page 7,             insert after &quot;Stete&quot; the words &quot;the Empire             Marketing Board and the Advisory Committee             of the Colonial Development Pund&quot;;     (b) that the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs             and the Colonies should not be a member of             the Committee of the Privy Council referred             to in para. 23 fb) on page 6 of the Bepsrt.                          fSigned)  PABMOOB.
