MEMORANDUM BY THE LORD&apos; PRIVY SEAL.    1.  IN view of recent discussions, I feel  it necessary to review briefly the criticism which has been directed at our Unemployment Policy.   Foreseeing  this criticism I set  out my view Of that policy last October in my  memorandum to theCabinet (OP. 287 (29)): and that view was endorsed.  The opening  paragraph ofthat memorandum was as follows :                                           !-         &apos;&apos; It is obvious that, throughout the coming Session pur policy on unemploy-    ment will be attacked and that the greater Our success in other spheres the more    vigorous will be this attack.  I feel it necessary, therefore, to outline the problem    as I see it, and the way of approach to it  that  I  propose to develop steadily    throughout the Session, both in  speeches  and in action, in order not only    that I may be  assured that  this policy on which much of the credit  of the    Government may depend is fully endorsed by my colleagues,  but also that the    &apos; unemployment policy  &apos; may be judged hot in isolation but as part of the general    policy, both at home and abroad, for which we are all responsible.&quot;    In subsequent Cabinet  papers I have restated this policy (CP. 345 (29);  OP. 21(30);  OP. 120 (30)).    2.  The criticism at present vocal is not for what we have done, but because wehave  not done  enough  of  it.   Our  policy of economic development and industrial reconstruction has not been seriously attacked, except by those  who think we oughtto have shown an increase  in the amount spent  on schemes of  work.   At the sametime there  is undoubtedly fairly  widespread dissatisfaction with the result  of our policy in the face of a rising Live Register, based upon a vague feeling that there is something more which might be done, and it may help therefore to focus discussionif I  set out the principal alternative or additional policies which have beenadvocated,  together  with a  brief comment on each.(A)- Protection in various forms,  thinly veiled under such labels as &quot; Safeguarding &quot;        and &quot;  Empire Free Trade.&quot;                                          .    3.  In view of our declared policy, it is  hardly necessary to discuss this remedyhere.(B) Removal of the young and old from industry by  raising the school-leaving age        and granting pensions to older workers on the condition that they retire        from industry.    4.  We have already decided on the raising of  the  school-leaving  age.  Thequestion of pensioning the older workers has been most exhaustively considered, andthe arguments are fully set out in  CPs. 341 (29) and 366  (29).  The obvious objectionto the scheme proposed was that it merely redistributed employment, but that it didnothing to add  to the volume of employment, while the enormous cost must gravelyaffect  the power of industry to give employment.      [21137]
(C)-In some cases a development loan is&apos;projected&apos;not with&apos;the real object of helping        specific works of re-equipment, but with the design of inflating-currency        and credit, by which it is sometimes held that trade would be stimulated&apos;.    5.  This is no place to argue the difficult economic questions involved, but I have always found among those best qualified to judge  of the matter a general consensusof opinion against such a change of financial policy. In any case the effect (or perhaps the object) is likely to be a reduction in real wages.  Furthermore,  it is a questionwhich stands referred to the MacMillan Committee.(D) It has been suggested that the Government should assume control over the        process of rationalisation, and accelerate it by providing capital on low        terms through  another Trade Facilities Act.    6.  Rationalisation is not held  up through lack of finance.  I know of no soundscheme which is failing to make progress for this reason.   It is in many cases held up, because existing owners of shares, &amp;c, will not face  the drastic writing down ofthe nominal  value of their  property.  If the Government offered money to helprationalisation, this attitude would be at once intensified, and progress would becomeslower.  I do  not  think any responsible persons  in  industry  really desire there introduction of a scheme of Trade Facilities.    The Parliamentary position would not enable us to secure any powers of coercion,and even if we did have powers of compulsory amalgamation, the practical diffkniltiesof exercising such powers speedily and effectively are enormous.   As a government we  can make clear the facts, and act as a link between industry and finance, and, Ibelieve,  that on this side of our unemployment policy there is a growing confidence in our outlook and our actions.  We shall shortly  have the reports of the Committeeon Cotton and Iron and Steel.  Driving home the lessons of these reports will needcontinuous touch with those industries, and we shall have an opportunity of publiclyexplaining our attitude  to the detailed problems involved in applying rationalisationthoroughly.(E) It has been suggested  that the  Export Credits (Guarantee) Scheme could be        made more effective in the service of our foreign trade.    7.  We have already a scheme in operation and it is proving useful.  When weare pressed to  extend  it dramatically, this request generally  conceals a proposal that long  credits should be  granted  to  Russia  on  terms which are in  principleindistinguishable from a State-guaranteed loan for that  Government.  I am making enquiries into the need of more long-term credit facilities for industry for financingexports, but I have not yet been able,  except in the case of Russia, to find any realdemand for such facilities among the parties principally concerned.(F) Vast  schemes of national development, to be financed by a loan, the amount of        which is usually placed in  the neighbourhood of  200 million.  The precise        objects on  which this money is to be spent are  not always stated, but when        they are given they are not more but less comprehensive than those on which        we are now giving assistance. A common  feature of such schemes is the        disproportionate share assigned to roads.     8.  It is under this head that the main criticism of our  policy  seems  to bedeveloping.  I  recently circulated  a  paper to the Cabinet (CP. 120 (30)) setting-out the progress made in approving  works.  Since then further progress has beenmade, and the  figure of approvals  is now only just short of  100 million.   If thefigures  of  the Unemployment Register had not  risen to tJheir present height, forcauses that have nothing to do with our unemployment policy, would this figure ofapprovals have appeared as a negligible contribution or  indicated a lack of imagina-tion in policy ?   And is there anyone who seriously thinks that if we had been  able to double it, the increase in the Live Register would have been avoided ?     9.  The difference  between us  and our critics is not one of kind, but of  degreeand method.  It is said that our programme is not vast  enough;  that  it is not being concentrated into a short enough period of time; that we should have financed it by alarge development loan; and that emergency measures should have been adopted to overcome  the difficulties of bringing  schemes into operation.
                                          3v :.ii;.10jii iIfed-Sjtrue,that;we are.not raising a,State loan,  but it is forgotten that by far the greater part of the;expenditure sanptioned will be financed by borrowing, andwe alre,i ;d&apos;n ieffect,; providing cheap money  by paying part of the interest on loans raised for capital works.  Another point which, is often forgotten is the very heavyextent of borrowing  by Local Authorities and Public Utility Companies to meet their ordinary non-assisted expenditure.   The difference between our practice andthe proposals of our critics is not due to any reluctance to plan on a large scale. It isone thing to  construct a paper  programme and to quote it as evidence that you have apolicy; quite another to work out the details of concrete schemes  which will give aneconomic return,  obtain  the necessary powers, and  get  the work put in hand.*  Theidea that when we took Office there were, and still are, countless projects of economic development, all  ready  and awaiting only the -g*jae*ai influence of  a substantial    $*^-ti^lExchequer grant  to set them in instant motion, is a myth.  We could, no doubt, savea lot of time  in  discussing terms, &amp;o, if  we agreed  to  pay whatever amount theAuthorities  or Public Companies  demanded.  I do not think we should  get muchmore work this way,  and in any case I do not commend  the policy as a solution ofour difficulties.     11.   What is the real meaning  of the expression  &quot; programme of developmentworks &quot; ?  When analysed, it  amounts to a variety of possible works which can beclassified broadly into      (a) Primary  public and industrial utilities : Sewage; water supply; electricity;           gas; telephones.     (b) Transport facilities:  Roads; railways; tramways:  canals  and docks.     (c) Housing and slum clearance.     (d) Land development: Drainage; reclamation; afforestation.     12.   As regards  the first group,  while  one or two schemes may be held up, thereis  substantial development in gas  and electricity apart from State assistance,  andno one has yet expressed a reasoned dissatisfaction  with the rate  of progress, either with or without  State  assistance,  except  in  the  case of  telephones. As  regardstelephones, examination shows that expansion of the present  10 million programmeof capital development  annually would be  hopelessly uneconomic.     13.   As regards  the second group, roads will be dealt with separately.  We areoffering  generous terms for railway and dock development and  large programmes are in hand.  The scope for the economic  development of  tramways and canals  is obviously small.t     14.   As regards the  third group, the Minister of  Health  has comprehensiveschemes in  operation or  in contemplation. I  am discussing  further possibilitieswith him.    * It is generally true to say that the more valuable the scheme as a piece of development, thegreater the difficulties which will be encountered in bringing  it into operation.  Charing Cross Bridgeis an outstanding example.  The proposed extension of the Underground Railway from Finsbury Park(to cost over  9 million)  is another. After many months required for the preparation of plans, theservice of  notices, Ac,  the enabling Bill  was first opposed by  our own Party  in Parliament onextraneous grounds;  then it was hotly contested  in the Commons Committee by the L.N.E.B.;that  Corrfpany is now actively opposing the scheme in the Lords, and is not proceeding with ascheme of its  own  costing nearly   6  million until a Parliamentary decision on the UndergroundScheme has been given.   Yet another instance is  a large sewage scheme in &quot;the Midlands costingnearly  J million.   No Parliamentary powers were required; yet, after a grant had been approved in  principle, three months  were required for the preparation of &quot; quantities  &quot;  and for  approval  oftenders before  the work could start.  I am assured  by experts that these times could only have beenshortened at the risk of  serious financial waste.  We insist&apos;,  of course, on the maximum degree  ofcompression in point of time in the carrying out of works, but all expert opinion is agreed that it ishopelessly uneconomic unduly to curtail construction periods.  It is only necessary to examine a fewlarge schemes  to appreciate this. The  10 million N.E. Coast Electricity Scheme to be completed in five yeurs  is an outstanding example.  As regards the adoption of emergency measures, we  havetaken power to expedite  Parliamentary procedure in dealing with certain Private Bills, but this hasnot lessened Parliamentary opposition to such Bills from any quarter.. Can we take any powers  to override such  opposition  or  to  coerce  the  ratepayers ol Sheffield when they refuse to sanction a   million water scheme?  And I would remind my colleagues that when we considered a measure for giving  Local Authorities certain additional powers to acquire land, the  Cabinet felt bound  to defer  its introduction in  view of its contentious nature and of. the pressure on  Parliamentary time.The acquisition of land is, however, only one and  not the most important cause of the  lag betweenauthorisation and execution of works.    t  In both  these groups there  are lesser categories of  works on  which  useful development ispossible, eg.,  rural  water supplies  and small ports.  Both these are under examination, but at thebest their employment value is trifling.
    15.  As  regards  the; * last, group, we&apos; are., undertaking a  large  programme ofafforestation, and we have before&apos; Parliament  a  measure to enable comprehensiveschemes of land drainage to be undertaken: We cannot, however, look for any greatdevelopment in this field until&apos;greater prosperity in agriculture makes it worth whilet&apos;o restore land to cultivation.    16.  On a, review of these various works (on  which,  apart from large expendi-ture on  housing, afforestation  and telephones,  we  have already  authorised  an expenditure of nearly  100 million) it emerges that the advocates  of an expandeddevelopment  programme really  mean  an expanded road programme,  undertakendirectly by the State at the expense of the State.  I hope to circulate a separate note on roads.  Here I will confine myself to a few general comments.    1)7.  We already have in many respects the best roads  in the  world, and wehave spent very many millions on them since the Armistice.  We are already driven to offer5 from 50 per cent, to over 90 per cent,  in order  to get Local Authorities toput&apos; up! schemes, and it is&apos;clear that Local Authorities would not regard road require-ments  as justifying them  in accepting  the  liability for the sums involved in a programme  spectacular  enough to  satisfy the  advocates of the  expanded road programme.    18.  Our present troubles are mainly due to a temporary depression in world prices of primary products  leading to loss of purchasing power by our customers, theeffect of which is intensified by the delay  in adjusting our costs of production to thelower  world price  level.  Related to this situation is the need  for industrial reorganisation and re-equipment.  Therefore,  whether the aim is  immediatealleviation or ultimate cure, there is one standard by which  every  policy must be judged.   Unemployment is the  symptom  of the inability of  our industries to  giveemployment and, whatever temporary expedients may be found, it is ultimately to ordinary industry that our  people must look for employment.   Before the full effects of our specific  programme can be seen,  industrial confidence  must be restored.Whether the future of industry lies with private or public enterprise, it can nevergive a  satisfactory volume of employment until it is once more profitable,  and widesections  of  industry  cannot  be profitable until they have  been reorganised andre-equipped.  For this reorganisation and  re-equipment very large  supplies  ofcapital will be necessary, and we cannot be too careful to guard against dissipatingon palliatives the capital  resources without  which  industry cannot  be  saved, orfrightening capital  away from industrial investment in this country.    19.  There is in some  quarters a tendency to speak of unemployment policy asif it were a departmental  matter that could be  treated in isolation from general economic conditions or the broad tendencies of Government policy.  The whole of theGovernments policy  is its unemployment policy, since the  economic reactions of nearly every Government measure are bound to be reflected for good or evil in theunemployment figures.  We are in the midst of a severe economic depression; at  sucha time the mood; of industry is unusually nervous.   The more  the Government is willing to be judged by its unemployment policy the more careful we must all be toconsider the reactions upon industry of every measure which comes before us.   Ourconstant endeavour  must be to avoid anything that will hinder, and  to do everything that will encourage, the return of confidence to industry.    20.   This is, I believe, the reality of the present position, and I believe also thatthe country and the Government have much to gain if we accept this reality franklyand base our policy upon it.
