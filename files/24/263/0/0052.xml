Printed for the Cabinet.  August 1936.SECRET.Copy  No.  45CP. 222 (36).CABINET.REFORM  OF  THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.     ONE factor which we must keep in mind in considering the  question of reform of the League of Nations is the effect of any changes on relations between the  Dominions and  this country.  This paper does not set  out to reach any conclusions  on  the general question,  but simply to  make  some observations on this Imperial aspect of it.     2.  Taking the  long view, the question of League reform is possibly the most important that  we have to face touching the future of the British Common- wealth of Nations.  Great Britain&apos;s international prestige and authority depend to a considerable extent on her unique position as the head of a  great Empire and the  central unit  in a Commonwealth  of freely associated nations.   The development of the Dominions in the future should tend to add steadily to Great Britain&apos;s  influence  so  long as the  close association  between  them  and her is maintained.   On  the  other hand  her  prestige  would suffer  severely if circumstances arose  in which  some  of the  Dominions were separated from the Commonwealth.   Apart  from the  possibility  that  the  Irish  Free  State&apos;s republican ambition  may create a situation in which she cannot remain a full Member of the  Commonwealth, the principal danger of  a breach between Great Britain and the Dominions lies in the field of international affairs.   It is true that the  real self-interest  of  the undeveloped Dominions  must lie  for  a  very long time  to come in association with the British Commonwealth in general and Great Britain in particular, either in peace or in war.  But one of the principal manifestations  of post-war nationalism in the Dominions has been insistence on their freedom to  determine their own foreign policy, and in Canada, South Africa and the  Irish Free State, in particular,  responsible Ministers have made speeches again  and  again to the effect that in  a crisis in which Great Britain became involved in war their Parliaments would be free to  choose whether their countries would also go  to war, or remain neutral.  Speculation as to the likelihood of any of  the Dominions choosing to remain neutral (and thereby presumably severing their connection  with the Commonwealth) in such  a situation would be idle. But the danger should be kept in mind, and should prompt us to determineand expound the principles of our foreign policy and our attitude towards theLeague of Nations  as  far  as possible in such a manner  as  will consistentlycommand  the support of  the Dominions.    3.  All  the Dominions are Members of the  League.   Such foreign policy as each of them has  is inspired principally by devotion  to the League and its Covenant  as  the best means of maintaining  peace.  Other motives  in foreign
 policy  they look upon with varying degrees  of suspicion.   Many people under- estimate the strength of Imperial sentiment in the Dominions, and this sentiment (which  of course varies  in intensity from Dominion  to Dominion, and in the case of Australia and New Zealand at any rate  would probably prove decisive) would  show its  full value in  a crisis  in which Great Britain  became involved in war. Nevertheless it must be noted  that influential (and no doubt imperfectly instructed)  sections  of   public  opinion  in  the  Dominions   have  frequently condemned the  &quot; Imperialist  &quot; motive in British policy;  and public  opinion throughout the Dominions rallied most strongly in support of our foreign policy when during the Italian-Abyssinian dispute that  policy was  most clearly one of unqualified support for the League.  Despite the Dominion share of the general disillusionment at the League&apos;s failure to  prevent Italy&apos;s conquest of Abyssinia, the creation of a League of Nations which embodies an effective system of collective security for the preservation  of  peace  is likely to remain  the  ideal of all the Dominions in international affairs.  It may be  said  that  the  pursuit  of this objective is the one foreign policy which wOuld unite  them all.     4.   I  should point out that, from the point of  view of  the  relations of this country to the Dominions, Great  Britain has derived  from the League in its present form a number of advantages.   For instance :      (a)  Membership of  the League has quickened the Dominions&apos;  interest in           international affairs, has led to a  better appreciation on  their  part           of  the  difficulties  of  the United  Kingdom   Government,   and,           consequently, while satisfying their desire for a  recognition of their           international  status, has made  for better  co-operation  with  this           country.     (b)  The active support of  the Dominions  at Geneva has  on various occasions           been of much value to British diplomacy.   Their assistance at all           stages in the imposition of sanctions against Italy was an impressive           example.     (c) Assuming that Great  Britain would  not  become engaged in war unless           it were a League war or one which in some degree involved members           of  the League in  defence of the  Covenant,  it  follows that  Great           Britain could hope to secure the active co-operation of the Dominions           and the possibility  of neutrality on the part of some  of them  is very           greatly diminished.     (d)  From this point of view, technically, the retention of the opening words           of Article 16 (i.e., the words that any member of the League resorting           to war in disregard of its Covenants &quot; shall, ipso facto, be  deemed to           have  committed an act of  war against all other members  of the           League &quot;) is important.  This helps to get over the possible difficulty           of  the King being  put  in a  position where a declaration  of  war is           needed,  but  where  his  several  Ministers might not  be prepared to           advise him in the same sense.     5.   It is important that all these advantages should be retained.  Therefore,it is desirable that any reform of the League should be such as  to preserve thesupport of the Dominions,  so that we can continue to pursue with them throughthe League a common  foreign policy,  and they  continue to be bound  by theobligations of the Covenant.     6.   What indication  have we  of their wishes as to League reform  in thepresent circumstances 1  A memorandum is annexed containing recent statements by representative Dominion statesmen which throw  some light on this question.In fact, there are considerable initial divergences of view between them.   On theone side, Canada&apos;s strong inclination will be to delete Article  16 of the Covenant.Ever since the early days  of  the  League Canadian Governments of  differentshades of political opinion have been agreed on this, and Canadian opinion feelsconfirmed in this view by the recent experience  of sanctions.   No  individualCanadian has advocated  the idea of a consultative League more consistentlythan Mr. Mackenzie King, who is himself coming to the Assembly meeting next month.   I think we must anticipate that his intention is to  make a strong pleafor  this  change.  It  would  appear  from  the  extracts  from  speeches byMr. De Valera contained in the appendix that the Irish Free State Governmentare now strongly inclined to share this Canadian view.
oO    7.   On the other side, the attitude of South African Ministers, both duringthe Manchurian crisis and throughout the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, indicates that they would favour  strengthening  rather  than abolishing or  weakeningArticle 16.    Mr. Bruce&apos;s speech,  reported  in  the  appendix,  seems to express a certaincautious confidence in the Article as it is at present, whilst the inclination of thepresent New Zealand Government would certainly not be to weaken it.    8.   Therefore, if the  Governments of the British Commonwealth are to bein agreement when the question of League reform is discussed at Geneva, some compromise  between these  opposing  views. must  be  found.   I  gained theimpression  from my last talk with the High  Commissioners  that all their governments would be  prepared to move  some way  from their initial positions in order to secure such agreement, and to get  the basis of  wider agreement atGeneva.  I am sure that all the Dominion representatives will be much influenced by the conclusions which we ourselves reach, though the two&apos; Dominions who onthis question  take the most  extreme view  on  either side-Canada  and SouthAfrica-are by nature the most difficult  to influence  in the  sphere  of foreignpolicy.    Canada and the Irish Tree State certainly will not agree to any strengthening of Article XVI, whilst South Africa certainly will not agree to its abolition.But they could be brought, I believe, to  agree to its retention in the Covenantin its present form,  though Canada probably would  put up a stout resistance tothis and only  agree if  an interpretation,  satisfactory to her,  of  the  obligationsupon Members under the Article,  so long  as  the  League&apos;s authority was notuniversal could be devised.  Australia and New Zealand would also agree to this.This then  is  an additional  argument for  the Article being left  as it is atpresent; and from the Imperial point of view the considerations set forth inparagraph 4 (c) and (d) would also lead me to the same conclusion.    9.   But, as has been  suggested in the papers circulated by the Lord privy seal and the First Lord  of the Admiralty,  a variety of considerations makes itdifficult for us to leave the matter  there,  and probably it will  be found desirablethat League members should  have  a right to make a reservation regarding  their obligations under Article XVI so long  as the League is not  universal, as issuggested in alternative III of the Annex to  F.P. (36) 5.  That proposal has threeimportant features on which I would make some comment from the point of viewof the attitudes of the Dominions.    (1)  &quot; Members  of  the League would be  within their  rights in making  a reservation in regard to their obligations under Article XVI so long as the Leagueis not universal,  and.so long as political circumstances do not allow the strict application of Article VIII.&quot;  We should  probably have considerable difficultyin getting South Africa to agree to this  proposal.   But I do not think that she would press her opposition to it to an extreme point.   All the other dominions would probably agree to the  proposal and Canada and  the Irish Free State atany rate would positively like it.    (2)^ &quot; Members of the League having thus freed themselves from their generalobligations under Article XVI to take  economic  and  financial action,  or (inappropriate circumstances) military action, it would be open to them to reassumethe full and complete obligations of Article XVI, economic, financial and military,in  respect  of political or geographical  regions clearly  defined by  themselves,within the sphere of their own direct political or geographical interests.&quot;  GreatBritain must, of course, be prepared to play her part in a new Locarno for western europe.  There is no  hope whatever of  inducing the Dominions generally toundertake particular obligations in connection with any European  pact, and  I doubt whether Mr.  Bruce&apos;s  recent suggestion that Australia  might now beprepared to be a party to such a pact would commend itself to the  majority ofAustralians.   But I certainly do not think  that we should refrain from  under-taking obligations which we believe to be of such vital importance, simply becauseour fellow-members of the Commonwealth will not assume similar obligations..There is no denying the fact that this might cause serious difficulties between someDominions  and this country, if a war situation were ever to result from the newLocarno; but  we must risk that and trust that the gradual  education  of theDominions in international affairs will have the effect of steadily reducing the risk.      [13707-6]                                                 E 2
     But I would see considerable difficulty regarding any further public definition of  &quot; the  issues in which we are  prepared to take specific  action,&quot;  such as is proposed in paragraphs 2 and 4 of the memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty (CP. 213 (36) ).  I agree with him that it is a fact that at present the people of this country would fight and perhaps fight only to  defend the interests which he mentions there, but (apart from other considerations)  from the point of view of opinion in the Dominions a statement in the sort of  terms which he suggests would, I think, have extremely unfortunate results.   It  would revive in the Dominions the criticism that  our foreign policy was inspired primarily by selfishness, and the damaging suspicion that our loyalty  to the League depended mainly on how effectively the League could be used to  protect  our Imperial interests.  If that view became prevalent in the Dominions, it would do much to destroy the Dominions&apos;  confidence in and close  co-operation with us in  inter- national affairs, which are being steadily built up.     I recognise  that  the First Lord of the Admiralty proposes  that such a declaration  should be coupled with a general undertaking, to which he attaches considerable importance, that we should use our influence for peace, in a manner to be settled at the time, wherever peace is threatened by aggression.  From the point of view of maintaining the confidence of the Dominions, I suggest that the main emphasis should be laid on this in any declaration of our policy.  As I have pointed out  in  paragraph 3, the Dominions generally attach supreme importance to the League of Nations as the international organisation most  likely, if it can develop, to set  limits to war and establish peace more securely.  I hope that our policy can be stated as, primarily, one of support for the League system, and that any modification that we may feel bound  to propose in the League&apos;s working will be explained in detail as necessary  on account of the League&apos;s present incomplete- ness,  in order  to  save it from further disaster,  and to build up  gradually  its authority in the hope that it will ultimately become universal.     I am not, of course, suggesting that  anything should be said  which gave the impression that the region  of Western Europe was the only one where issues might arise  in which we were prepared to take specific action.  But the difficulty is that if we attempt to define the whole set of such regions our policy cannot avoid an  appearance of pure selfishness,  whilst the more  definite  we are as to these regions,  the more assurance  we give to potential aggressors outside  them.     (3) &quot;In a case where States which  had made  such  declarations as  are contemplated in (2) above were engaged in war  against the Covenant-breaking State.  ...  It would presumably be open to any of them  (i.e., the  Members of the League who had  made no such declarations), while abstaining from military action, to apply economic and financial pressure under Article XVI if they saw fit to do so.  But if they did not, what is their position  to  be&quot;?  One solution would be  for them to fall into the position of pre-war neutrality, so that they would be entitled to continue commercial and  other relations  with the Covenant- breaking State except in so far as they could be prevented under the old rules of war and neutrality.  But a situation in which Members of the League were busily engaged  in assisting  the  Covenant-breaking State  by supplying him  with everything of which he was in need, except in so far as  this could be prevented under the rights of belligerents, would be quite inconsistent with the &apos; spirit of the Covenant,&apos;  and it may indeed  be doubted whether the League could survive such  a situation.&quot;   In  order to reduce  as much  as possible the risk of some Dominions choosing to remain neutral if  Great Britain  were involved in a war resulting from  a  regional pact to which they  were not direct parties, we should aim at getting  League members committed to  at least some obligations in such a situation.  Even &quot;if we could not now get more than some general limited commit-ment of non-assistance to the aggressor,  that would be of value.    10.  The Dominions would probably all support an amendment of Article XI of the Covenant designed to secure that the adoption by the  Council under that Article of measures to prevent aggression should not be prevented by the vote  of the would-be aggressor.  They are likely also to  emphasise the  importance  of Article XIX being made effective.    11.  As I  have said, this question of League reform is perhaps the most important that the Members of the British Commonwealth are now facing, from the point  of view  of their own future.  It is  a matter in which they are all,  as Members of the League, vitally concerned.   It follows that the  fullest possible
consultation with the Dominions, before our own policy is finally crystallised and declared, is desirable.  It seems unlikely that the Members of the League  will themselves wish, or be able, to reach final conclusions on so controversial, difficult and  important  a  question  at  the forthcoming  Assembly.   From  the purelyImperial point of view, I should have preferred that we  should avoid reachingfinal decisions until there has been an opportunity for a full oral discussion with dominion statesmen round the Imperial Conference table next year.  But I daresay so long a postponement is impossible, and I  only urge that time for adequateconsultation with the Dominions should be allowed at every stage.

APPENDIX.EXTRACTS  FROM RECENT SPEECHES BY DOMINION MINISTERS AND DELEGATES  TO                     THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS ASSEMBLY.1. Extracts from a Speech  by Mr. Mackenzie  King in the Canadian House  of         Commons on June 18.     &quot;There is no  blinking  the fact  that economic sanctions may  lead  towar.....   Whether  they  will  progress  into military . measures  is notnecessarily within the control of the Powers that impose them!     &quot;Collective bluffing cannot bring collective security.&quot;     &quot;Canadian  Governments,  without any appreciable  public  dissent, had opposed the view of Geneva as &apos;an international War Office.&apos;&quot;     &quot; Successive Canadian Governments  have opposed the view that the League&apos;scentral  purpose should  be  to  guarantee  the territorial status quo,  and to rely upon force for the maintenance of peace.     &quot;Two conditions  are  essential to the working  of  any  plan  of universalcompulsion.  In the first place there must be an overwhelming preponderance  of power, economic and military, in the League as  against any possible aggressor  orcombination of aggressors.....That condition does not now exist.....Inthe second place, there must be  the certainty  that the members ....  will  beready to exercise that force when the occasion arises, regardless of where it arisesor whether they have any direct interest in the quarrel.  That condition againdoes not exist.&quot;2. Extracts from Speech made by Mr. Bruce at the Assembly of the League  of         Nations  on July 2.     &quot;There is no defect in the system embodied in the  Covenant if it  is fullyimplemented.  Article 16 provides for military, economic and financial sanctions.&quot;     &quot;Nations  are not  prepared to commit their peoples to war  for a  causewhich does not vitally concern their immediate national interests.&quot;     &apos;&apos; The  imposition  of economic and financial sanctions,  limited to  suchsanctions as will not provoke retaliatory hostile action, is a futile and ineffectiveapplication of Article  16.   Only  the imposition of the maximum practicalfinancial and economic  sanctions backed by a readiness to  accept full responsi-bility in meeting retaliatory military action with armed forces would enable thefinancial and economic sanctions  contemplated  by Article  16  to  be  appliedeffectively.   In my opinion, financial and economic sanctions so  applied wouldprobably prove effective even  in  a non-universal League.&quot;3. Extract  from a Speech by Sir James Parr at the Assembly of the League  of         Nations on July 2, with reference to the raising of Sanctions  against         Italy.     &apos;&apos; The  Government of New Zealand still favours sanctions. It favours their maintenance and intensification.&quot;     &quot; If there can be no generally accepted determination by our colleagues hereto continue sanctions, ....   I am to acquiesce on behalf of New Zealand in their removal. But the acquiescence of my Government is on the clear understandingthat the whole question  of the Geneva peace structure will be considered at the september  meeting of the Assembly, and New  Zealand would wish, if  it were at all possible, that not only the present members of  the League,  but that all nations  of the world whether members of  the League or not- should be invitedto take  part in the September meeting.&quot;4. Extract  from a Letter from General Smuts of April 19, concerning Sanctions         against Italy in the Recent Dispute.     &quot; My view is that economic, sanctions even without military  and naval action must prove effective if persisted in to the bitter end.&quot;
5. Extract from a Speech  by General Hertzog in the Union House of Assembly         on May 6, in the same connection.     &quot; Sanctions must be continued if necessary for a period of years.&quot;6. Extracts from a Speech by Mr&apos;, te Water at the  Assembly of the League  of         Nations on July 1.     &quot; I beg to announce the decision of my Government that it is still preparedto maintain the collective  action legitimately agreed upon by the resolutions  ofthis Assembly of the League of Nations, the 10th October, 1935.   We offer thiscourse which in our deep conviction  will alone  maintain the  League of nations as an instrument of security for its members.&quot;7. Extracts from Reports of Speeches by Mr. de Valera in the Irish Free  State         Bail on June  18 and 19.     &quot; The League in  the  past set itself an objective which clearly was notattainable in the present circumstances, and his view, and the view that he would urge upon  the Government as Minister for External Affairs, if the matter hadto be immediately settled, was that the League in future would have to set  itselfan humbler task.     The question of compelling other States to maintain their obligations wouldhave to be abandoned.  It was quite clear that economic sanctions  alone were not sufficient, and that if they  were to have effective sanctions they must go beyondthe  realms  of mere  economic  sanctions,  and  that military sanctions  were necessary.&quot;                   W           -TV&quot;           VE*           *7V&quot;           W     &quot; Were they themselves prepared to say that the League of Nations should bereformed in the direction of imposing military  sanctions if necessary?  He didnot think that their people,  or the people of any other country, would be preparedfor that.    The only practical line that seemed to him that they could go on was thatthe League would have to be reformed on lines of using it in other directions trying to use it as  a forum *for considering questions that might lead  to  war;using it as  a conciliatory machine and perhaps as an arbitration machine.&quot;                   JL,           M.           M.                      -At.                   -l?           &quot;TV           *7T-           W          -TV&quot;    &quot; If the League wants  to be reformed in the sense of making sanctions  morecertain, with  the  possibility  of economic  sanctions developing  into militarysanctions, I certainly would not advise our people in the present condition  to bea party to  the League, because I am certain that when the time came to  fulfilour obligations  they would  not, in fact, be fulfilled.&quot;                   -7?           -7V-           -7.-           -7\-          -?f
