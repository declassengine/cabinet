THIS&apos; -POCUMI-NT ..IS TIIT1 PRQPHRTY OF EI3BRIT AM 10 HAJMSTY&apos;S ChOVBRNHMNT).CP. 807  (36).co:py noCABINET.CURTAIN STATUTORY SABARIES.Joint Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor and Home                 Secretary.      1.  It is desired to  introduce  a Bill  to  increasethe statutory salaries of. Judges of County Courts  to 2,000 per annum and of the Chief Magistrate  and   Magistratesof Metropolitan Police Courts to  2, 300 and   2,000 per annumrespectively.      2.  The salary of a Judge of a  County Court  was fixed at 51,500 in 1865 (23 and 29 Viet.c.99  section 13).The salary of the Chief Police Magistrate of  the MetropolitanPolice Court was fixed at  1,800 and  the salary of each  ofthe other Magistrates at  1,500 in 1375 (38 Viet,c.3.section 1).      3.  Since 1919, an additional payment,  corresponding to Civil Service bonus, has been made from Votes in allthese cases.   The present remuneration is accordingly 1,550 per annum in each case, exceot that of the  ChiefPolice Magistrate whose present remuneration  is  1,953per annum.   The additional payments are ratified by theAnnual Appropriation Act.      4.  An improvement in the position of the  Judges  ofthe County Courts and of the Metropolitan Police CourtMagistrates  has been in contemplation for several years.Their functions have altered substantially since theoriginal salaries were fixed and increasing difficulty hasbeen experienced in recent years in  making appointments of
 the right ty/oe.  It is now desired to increase the remuneration as above as soon as the necessary legislation can be obtained.  The non-statutory payment from Votes will of course cease,      5.  The cost of the proposals will be approximately  35,COO per annum, including increase in non-effective charges.  They are concurred in by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,      5.  It is proposed by the Treasury to take the opportunity afforded by the Bill to deal also  with the salaries of certain miscellaneous offices where, as in the case of the County Court Judges and the Metropolitan Police Court Magistratess  payments corresponding to Civil Service bonus are made in excess of the statutory maximum salary.   The Public Accounts Committee have on several occasions commented adversely on non-statutory additions to statutory salaries  ana have pressed for legislation dealing with the cases involved.   The Offices covered by this Paragraph and the action proposed to be taken in regard to each are set out in an appendix to this memorandum. The Bill will,  in general,  avoid any statutory maximum  asbeing more convenient  and more in conformity  with present day practice in the case of salaries of the type and amount in question.  It is not proposed to modify the existing remuneration in any of these cases except in  so far as minor adjustments may be necessary to avoid odd amounts.      7,   Authority is desired for the drafting and introduction of the Bill with a view to its passage as early as possible next Session.   The Attorney General has expressed, his willingness  to undertake the introduction and conduct of the Bill in the Mouse of Commons.                                  (Int&apos;d)    K.
