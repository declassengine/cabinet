USE OF POST-WAR CABINET PAPERS IN AUTOBIOGRAPHIES.                  jje-ugrandum by the Secretary.    1.     I am directed by the Prime Minister to  submit  for  the    consideration of the Cabinet a request recently received  by me    from Mr. J.H. Thomas that I should send him at his home    (Millbury House, Perring-on-Sea, Sussex) certain Cabinet  Papers    for use in connection with the writing of his  autobiography upon    which he is now engaged.  As this is the first occasion on which    an ex Cabinet Minister has intimated his desire to make use of    post-war Cabinet documents in an autobiography, the case  will    constitute a precedent and, having regard to the important con-    siaerations involved, the Cabinet may think fit to give me    instructions applicable alike to the case of Mr. Thomas and to    other cases.    2.     The Cabinet Papers comprised in Mr. Thomas&apos;s request are    those relating to the Irish Boundary Question  in 1924;  the    Campbell Case, 1924;   &apos;The Mosley Papers when I was Lord Privy    Seal&apos;;  the 1951 Crisis;  and the Ottawa Conference of 1952.    In the aggregate a very large number of Papers are involved- in-    cluding many Cabinet Minutes and other very secret documents    dealing with these contentious questions.    3.     Copies of all these Papers were received by Mr. Thomas    when he was in office, and under the procedure for the surrender    of Cabinet Papers approved by the Cabinet in 1954 (Cabinet 11 (34)    Conclusion 5) Mr. Thomas has returned all his copies.,  and these    have been destroyed, in accordance with the usual practice.ffiNT  IS  THE  PROPERTY  OF&apos;  HIE.

4.     This Cabinet decision provided inter alia &quot;that exCabinet Ministers shall continue to have the right of access to all Cabinet Minutes and Papers issued to them during thetime that they were Members of the Cabinet&quot;.  I have inter-preted this to mean that an ex Cabinet Minister who wishes forsome good reason to refresh his memory on some point should come to the Cabinet Office and should be there shown the recordcopy of the Paper or Papers which he desires to see.4. In thisway the Cabinet Secretariat is able to exercise control and supervision over the Papers, for the safe custody of which itis responsible,,  No such supervision or control could beexercised by the Secretariat if the Papers are to be sent to thehomes of ex Cabinet Ministers.   Moreover, this inevitably mustinvolve some risk of the Papers getting into wrong hands.5.     I hope that the Cabinet will confirm the interpretationwhich I have placed upon the words &quot;right of access&quot; in theCabinet Conclusion referred to above, namely that I am precludedby the express instructions of the Cabinet from parting., eventemporarily, with documents entrusted to the Cabinet Office forsafe custody:  and that this entitles an ex Cabinet Minister to inspect the Papers in question at the Cabinet Offices, but notto ask that the Papers should be sent to him at his home or elsewhere.6.     The second question raised by Mr. Thomas&apos; s requestrelates to his proposal to make use of these Cabinet Papers forthe purpose of his autobiography.   The important question ofprinciple involved was discussed at the Meeting of the Cabineton 7th October, 1934 (Cabinet 35 (34) Conclusion 4).  I attach the relevant extracts from this Cabinet Conclusion, from whichit will be seen that in the course of.the discussion the view was expressed that great care should be exercised in authorising the publication in the first instance by ex Ministers of cabinet documents, having regard to the possible reactions of such                         -2-  Advantage  of these facilities is taken by  ex Cabinet Ministers  from time  to time,,
publication, and that the Cabinet decided inter alia that&quot;access by non-official persons to Cabinet and other similarsecret documents, for the safe custody of which the cabinet offices are responsible, should not be given where the objectof the applicant is the production of an ordinary historical,biographical or other similar work&quot;.7.     It is, of course, true that this particular conclusion, ,which arose out of an application by the widow of an exCabinet Minister (the late Lord Milner), refers to&quot;non-official&quot;persons, and that this expression would seem to be inapplicableto an ex Cabinet Minister.  On the other hand, it would appearthat in spirit this Cabinet Conclusion is definitely directed against use being made in ordinary biographical works ofCabinet and other secret documents, whether the authors ofsuch works are Ministers or ex Ministers, or other persons.8.     It should be noted that in the present case Mr. Thomasdoes not wish to use these secret documents in order todefend himself against attacks which have been made upon him.If this had been so his application might, I venture to suggest, have    been treated on the general lines of Conclusions(2) and (3) of the appended Cabinet extract.   His object would, however, appear to be rather to use the documents togive his version of the various contentious issues with whichthey are concerned.   By so doing he will, in my opinion,start a new and most embarrassing series of post-war memoircases.   Other ex Ministers concerned in the events discussed in these Papers will claim the right to reply to Mr. Thomas,and for that purpose v/ill insist on having access to the samedocuments which he has used.  The War Memoir cases have shownhow mischievous and embarrassing is the practice of usingCabinet documents, whether the necessary consents for their use have been obtained or not.  If this practice is now to beextended to the post-war documents the consequences may wellbe very grave indeed, and in any case must be highly
detrimental to the public interest.   Apart from other considerations I would point out that the reason andjustification for the Cabinet document system is tofacilitate the efficient conduct of public affairs, andthat to make use of the system for the writing of memoirs,etc., is to divert it from its proper purpose to a purpose for which it was never designed, and to bring the systemitself into disrepute.9.     If the Cabinet should decide to apply theprinciples laid down in Cabinet 35 (34) Conclusion 4, tothe case of ex Ministers, I would suggest that I might beauthorised to reply to Mr. Thomas referring to the dis-tinction which has always been drawn between War and post-war records, and saying that, while there is ofcourse no objection to his seeing the Cabinet documents in question at this Office for the purpose of refreshinghis memory, it would not be open to him to refer in hisautobiography to proceedings in Cabinet, still less to quote from Cabinet Minutes or other post-war cabinet documents, and that it would be very desirable if he couldavoid giving the impression that the information containedin his book had been in any wa^r derived from secret-official documents.  I should also propose to ask Mr.Thomas to let me see, in due course, the proofs of what he proposes to publish in regard to the matters mentionedin his letter with a view to my applying for anyconsents that may be necessary.(Signed)   M.P.A.

A P P E N D I X.S EA-O-^       C A B I N E T   55 (54),Extract from CONCLUSIONS of a Meeting  of  theCabinet held at 10, Downing Street, S.W. 1. ,  onWEDNESDAY, 17TH OCTOBER, 1954, at 11.0 a. m.cabinet procedure.Access toCabinetPapers by in on-OfficialArsons.previous reference:Cabinet 11v34),  Con-elusion 5. )4.     With reference  to  the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin, the Prime  Minister  informed the  Cabinet thatin the Third Volume  of Mr.  Lloyd George&apos;s  War Memoirs,which had just been  published,  Mr.  Lloyd George had quotedextensively from two Memoranda  written by  Lord. Milner forthe War Cabinet in 1917 just before the outbreak of theRussian Revolution,  and that he had also criticised lord milner for not having  foreseen  and  warned-  the Governmentthat the Revolution  was imminent.    The proofs of theVolume in question had been examined by the  Secretary tothe Cabinet and the  Departments concerned, and thesanction of the Lord President  of the Council for thepublication of the extracts had been obtained.     Lad.y Milner had no?/  written to ask whether she mightbe allowed to see the  documents in  question  in order thatif she thought fit she might reply  to Mr.  Lloyd George&apos;observations in a further Volume of Lord. Milner&apos;s Life,now in course of preparation.   As Lord Milner&apos;s cabinet papers had all be returned  to the Cabinet  Office,  LadyMilner could only get  access to these particular documentsby approaching the Cabinet  Office,  and the consent ofboth the Prime Minister and Mr.  Lloyd. George would have tobe obtained before Lady Milner  could be shown the documents.     The Foreign Office had been consulted and had statedthat there was no objection to  Lady Milner seeing the two documents as any use she  might  make of them  would notimpair our relations with the Soviet Government nor castany damaging light on  our actions in the past.                        -1-
                         I                         IIt was pointed out that  if consent was  given in the  present case it weuld constitute a precedent in future similar cases,and these cases were likely to &quot;become much more numerous inview of the Cabinet decision referred to in the margin, tothe effect that all Cabinet Papers were to be returned onvacation of office.     In the. course of discussion the view was expressed, that very great care should be exercised in authorising thepublication in the first instance by ex-Ministers of cabinet documents, having regard to the possible reactions of suchpublication resulting, as in the present case, in the claim of non-official persons to inspect the documents a   It wassuggested that a distinction should be drawn between caseswhere a historian or biographer wished to see Secret papers in order that he might produce a better book, and cases,like the present, where a person with a good title tevindicate the memory of a deceased Statesman desired to seethe Papers in order that he might defend the memory of the deceased against criticism made by some ether person who hadpublished extracts from the documents with  authority.  Inthe former class of cases access should, as a rule, be refused, as the historian or biographer should not be placedin any better position than an ordinary member of the public,and should therefore only get access to documents if and whenthey became available in the Record Office.  In the latter classof cases, however, it wguld be very difficult to refuse access to an aggrieved person of a document;, the publication of which by another person had been duly authorised.     After some discussion the Cabinet agreed        That while each case must be decided on        its merits as it arises,  the general line        should be as follows:-        (1)  Access by non-official persons to             Cabinet and other similar Secret documents             for the safe custody of which the Cabinet             Offices are responsible, should not be                      -2-
Z%1(3)given where the object of the applicant-is the production of an ordinary historical,,biographical or other similar work:In cases5  however vhere extracts fromCabinet or other similar Secret documentshave already been published with authority0 the  conditions named  in  (3) below3 be given to any parson who has a  good  title to vindicate  the memory  of  a deceased person and  who claims that that memory has been injured by the publication in question: The  conditions to be  satisfied under (2)  above  are - (a)  That  the documents must  contain     nothing the publication  of which     would be prejudicial to  the     p ub lie i n t e r e s t % (b)  That  in each case the proofs of     anything proposed to be  published     by the vindicator should be sub-     mitted to the Cabinet Office for     approval before publication: (c)  That  the specific sanction of     the Prime Minister  of the day     as well as of the Prime  Minister     in office when the  Secret documents     were  actually produced and circulated,,     must  be obtained before  access     is given:  by a  no -Official person.That  Lady Milne a?&apos; s application should beacceded to5 provided the conditions named in (3)  (a) (b)  and (c) above  are satisfied.E:  The Prime Minister invited members of    the Cabinet to scrutinise the wording    of the above Conclusion and to inform    the ^cting Secretary to the Cabinet of    any alterations they might wish to    suggested st. )access tosubject-  to
