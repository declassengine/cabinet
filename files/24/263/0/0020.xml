Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1936.SECEET.CP. 190  (36).CABINET.PALESTINE.           Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    I AM now in a position to give the Cabinet a survey of the state of affairs in Palestine in the light of appreciations which  I have just received  from theHigh Commissioner, which  will, I hope, facilitate the consideration of the largerissues which are involved.                   GENERAL  COMMENTS  AND APPRECIATION.    2.  In general, Jewish opinion in Palestine appears to be satisfied with thestatement which I made in the House of Commons on the 19th June and with theattitude  of  His Majesty&apos;s Government.   The Arab Press, however,  interpretJewish opinion as expressed in the Jewish newspapers  of Palestine  as meaningthat the  Jews are confident that there will be no change of policy, and that assoon as the  Arabs have been  forcibly suppressed by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentthe sale of lands to Jews and Jewish  immigration will continue as before.  Themajority of  the Arabs, the High Commissioner states, are now so embittered andtheir  distrust is so deep-rooted that they are liable to  misinterpret  almost any statement made by His Majesty&apos;s Government and to regard it either  as  a challenge or as evidence of British subservience to the Jews.   In particular, theevident determination of His Majesty&apos;s Government to  restore order before anygrievances are investigated  by a  Royal Commission  is misrepresented  as  a determination to  break the Arabs  and to facilitate thereby the pursuance of  amore active Zionist policy.  The point which has been most generally seized upon,however, is the statement  which I  made in the House of Commons, to the effectthat no Government could undertake in advance to carry out proposals which ithad not seen.   The interpretation  which has been placed by the Arabs on thisself-evident truth is that, if the recommendations of the Royal Commission favour the Arabs, they will not be acted upon.    3.  Another  point,which is made by Arabs of all  classes is  that  what is happening in Palestine is not a revolt against the British Government as such,but a spontaneous and desperate revolt against the policy which, on the admissionof Commissions previously appointed by that Government, is  working faultily,but which, under pressure of Zionist influence, they had  failed  to amend.    4.  The contention of the Arabs is that they have for  many years triedpeaceful, constitutional methods, but without avail, and that the failure of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to find a remedy for their grievances has compelled themto adopt forcible methods of bringing their  grievances to  the attention of theworld. I cannot agree that any of these contentions of the Arabs are valid, butthat they represent generally the local Arab view there can be little doubt.

     5.  During the last few weeks an average of some twenty to thirty separateattacks occurred. every twenty-four  hours by Arab gangs, snipers or bombersagainst our troops mainly when on patrol duty, or against our communications,and occasionally against Jewish Settlements.   That they constitute a  definiterebellion against Government there can be no denying.                ......     6.  Although during the last few days there have been somewhat fewer acts of violence and outrage, the High Commissioner states that there is at present no clear sign of the rebels losing  spirit  or determination.  The High Commissioneris hopeful that, as the troops get to know the ground and the tactics of the rebels,measures against them will prove more and more successful.  Time, however,  isthe most important factor in his opinion, since the longer the disorders continuethe greater the chance of their spreading, and of growing bitterness against theGovernment, and of increasing hatred..against Great Britain,     7.  Moreover, there are three factors of the highest importance which  maymaterialize later on :         (1) The raising of the religious cry throughout the country.        (2) A rising in Trans-Jordan.        (3) A strike  of Arab  Government officials and Arab police.The length of time which is likely to be taken to re-establish  order depends, in Sir Arthur  Wauchope&apos;s opinion, more upon the three factors mentioned abovethan  upon  any other consideration.   He  is  hopeful,  but  not  confident, of preventing these three eventualities, but if they do occur,  he can  fix no date,however approximate,  for the end of the disturbances.   If, on the other hand,they are avoided, he is hopeful that the garrison will prove more successful inthe next few  weeks  in breaking up rebel bands and in  reducing  incidents of sabotage, and will produce a  progressive diminution of disorder, and  if thesehopes are fulfilled he anticipates a great improvement in the  near  future.  Hewill, however, be in a better position to judge of the prospect of  such improvementin say, three weeks&apos; time.                         REINFORCEMENTS REQUIRED.     8.  The High Commissioner asked on  the  26th June for an  additionalsquadron  of mechanised cavalry and another field company of Royal  Engineers.He was informed that the War Office could not spare any more troops  from egypt; that they felt that the time had come  to ask him to  state his full require-ments of reinforcements;  that ways and means of finding them would then haveto be considered, and that  the question of command would be raised.  In his  replyto this enquiry, Sir Arthur Wanchope states that the forces now in Palestinesuffice to  guard  communications,  Jewish colonies and vulnerable points.   Toenable, however, more speedjr progress to be made in restoring order under presentconditions and to render  possible more decisive and more  immediate action, herecommends the despatch  as  soon as possible of  two fully motorised battalionswith infantry mortars in order to raise the strength of each of the two brigadesto four battalions.  Recent experience  also shows, in his opinion, that one  moresquadron of armoured cars and one field company of Royal Engineers are likewiserequired.   These conclusions have been reached by the High Commissioner  afterconsultation with the Air Officer Commanding, with Colonel Evetts, who is acting as Brigadier on Staff, and with the two Brigadiers, whom he finds in unanimous agreement with the above  recommendations.     9.  If, however, the three factors referred to in paragraph 7 materialize, theHigh Commissioner considers and the  Air Officer Commanding agrees that onecomplete Division with its staff and  ancillary troops less artillery would berequired.  This would include the addition of  one brigade headquarters and threebattalions plus the remainder  of No. 33  B Squadron of the Royal Air Force.  TheAir  Officer Commanding considers that this complete Division would suffice forthe requirements  of Palestine only, and that an additional brigade would berequired for Trans-Jordan.  Before, however, deciding as  to the need for that additional brigade, the High Commissioner would prefer to furnish me with afresh analysis after the situation has further  developed.
FURTHER REPRESSIVE MEASURES.    10.  The High Commissioner considers that there are few further repressivemeasures apart from the intensification of those now being applied which couldbe undertaken with a view to restoring order rapidly.  The following measures have, however, been suggested :      (1) The bombing of refractory villages after due warning.    (2) The extension of bombing operations  to include areas in which resistance          is offered to security forces, and to apply to all persons in those areas,          whether actually engaged in the incidents or not.    (3) The more extensive demolition of houses in villages and towns suspected          of connection with sabotage or acts of violence.    (4) The formation of Jewish quasi-military units.    11.  These measures would, in Sir Arthur Wauchope&apos;s opinion, cause muchsuffering to  innocent people  and would  so intensify feelings  of  bitterness  andresistance to Government as rather to lengthen than to shorten the period needed to restore order.                            ROYAL COMMISSION.    12.  In the foregoing paragraphs I have dealt mainly with measures for restoring order and the forces which, in the opinion of Sir Arthur Wauchope andhis military advisers,  are  required  for  this purpose.  I will  now  turn to thequestion of the appointment of the proposed Royal Commission.   I have  been giving  careful  consideration both  to the selection of  the personnel of  theCommission and to its  terms  of reference.  As regards the personnel, I fear some little time must )ret elapse before it will be possible to make any definite proposals.My preliminary views  are, however,  as follows:  I am inclined  to think that theCommission might  consist  of  five  members,  including  the  Chairman.   as chairman  I should like to suggest  either Lord Peel or Sir Horace Rumbold,G.C.B.  Personally, I prefer the latter.  As regards  the four members, I have inmind  either Lord  Somers or Lord Dufferin; Professor Coupland,  Professor  of colonial History at the University of Oxford; a  Cambridge Economist (the nameof Mr. Benians, Master of St. John&apos;s, has been suggested to me), and a King&apos;sCounsel whose experience would be invaluable in examining witnesses.    13.  As regards the terms of reference,  after consultation with Sir arthur wauchope, I am disposed to  suggest that they should be as follows :          &quot;To  ascertain the underlying causes of the disturbances which broke    out in Palestine in the middle of April; to enquire into the manner in which    the Mandate for Palestine is being implemented in relation  to the obligations    of the Mandatory  Power towards  the Arabs and the Jews  respectively;  and    to  ascertain whether, upon  a  proper  construction  of the terms of  the    Mandate,  either the Arabs  or the Jews have any legitimate grievances on    account of the way in which the Mandate has been or is being implemented;    and if the Commission is satisfied that any such grievances  are well-founded,    to make recommendations for their removal and for the  prevention of their    recurrence.&quot;    14.  The High Commissioner is strongly in favour of early publication ofthe terms of reference  and of the personnel of the Royal Commission in spite ofthe fact that both will doubtless be  criticised by the Arabs.   Such publication should have a steadying influence upon moderate opinion in Palestine.  I amdisposed to agree with the High Commissioners  opinion as to the desirabilityof early publication.    15.  If, as is to be hoped, order is sufficiently restored by then, I should liketo see the Royal Commission start its  work in  September with a view to renderingits report  by Christmas-time.  I realise that  this would be a  record achievementfor a Royal Commission,  but  it is clearly a matter of great importance that,  onceorder is restored, a decision as to future policy should be taken  with the briefest       [13478]                                                     B 2
-possible delay, and, moreover, it is not improbable that some of the members of the Commission would find  it difficult to afford longer time away from  their normal occupation.                                IMMIGRATION.     16.  This brings me to the very important question which may perhaps be regarded  as the crux to the  whole problem of  Palestine, namely,  Jewish immigration.     17.  As the Cabinet will be aware,  suggestions have been made in  various quarters that, with a view to bringing about as quickly as possible a cessation of the continuing state of disorder in Palestine, steps should at once be taken for a  temporary suspension  of Jewish  immigration into  Palestine until the proposed Royal Commission had submitted its report and a decision on the report had been taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government.  In support of this suggestion, it has been urged that if no such steps are taken it will be impossible for the Arab leaders, however willing they might be, to regain  their influence over the Arab population in Palestine and to use their  influence to secure the cessation of acts of violence,  and that,  as  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government have  already definitely announced that the Royal  Commission will not be appointed until order has been restored, an indefinite time may elapse, with deteriorating conditions in Palestine, before the  Royal  Commission can commence  its work upon the  urgent  and important problems which await solution.     18.  In order to put this suggestion in its right perspective, I think it would be convenient to my colleagues for me to give a brief recapitulation  of the  more recent political events in Palestine.     19.  It will be remembered that in January last my predecessor, Mr. Thomas, circulated to the Cabinet  (CP.  3 (36), the 10th January, 1936) a memorandum submitted jointly by five Arab political parties in Palestine to the High Commis- sioner setting  out  their grievances to His Majesty&apos;s  Government and  their demands for measures to be  taken  to  safeguard  the  interests  of the Arab community.  These demands were :      (a) The establishment  of a democratic Government.     (b) The immediate stoppage of all Jewish  immigration.     (c) The prohibition by law of the transfer  of Arab lands to Jews.     20.  The first and third demands it is not necessary  to deal with in the present connection.   As  regards  the  second, the  High  Commissioner   was authorised, as a result of a Cabinet decision, to  inform the Arab leaders, in reply to their memorandum, that there could be no question of the complete cessation of Jewish immigration, but the policy of economic absorptive capacity was the guiding principle as regards  the admission of immigrants and that no departure from that principle was contemplated.     21.  Following on  the Palestine  debate in the  House of Commons on the 24th March (i.e., as to the  establishment of  a Legislative Council),  Mr. Thomas informed the House of Commons on the 8th April  that since that debate he had had reason  to believe that the representatives  of the Arabs in Palestine would welcome an opportunity of stating their case to His  Majesty&apos;s Government, and that he had accordingly instructed the High Commissioner to invite officially the Arab leaders to send a deputation to this country and that the invitation had been  accepted.   Sir Arthur  Wauchope was  authorised in  transmitting  this invitation to make  it clear to the Arab  leaders that it would be open  to  their deputation to raise other questions with the  Secretary of State as well as that of the Legislative Council, though they were not  given any grounds for expecting that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be willing to consider any modification of their  declared policy with regard to land sales or immigration.     22,  Some delay ensued owing to differences of opinion between various Arab parties as to the composition of the deputation, and the outbreak of the strike and disturbances which began in the latter . part  of April produced  a new situation, and on the recommendation of the High Commissioner His Majesty&apos;s
 Government decided to announce that the King would be advised to appoint a Royal  Commission  when  order  had been  restored  in  Palestine.   Before  the announcement was made, however, the High Commissioner  was authorized  (on the 13th  May) to  communicate the  terms  of the  Governments decision confidentially to the Arab leaders in Palestine.   The Arab leaders took the line that they  were powerless, in view of the  strength  of public opinion all over Palestine,  to call off the strike, nor could they succeed in  stopping acts  of lawlessness unless the High Commissioner  could promise that until  the Royal Commission had made its report there would be a complete  cessation of Jewish immigration.  In reply to this  demand Sir Arthur Wauchope informed  the leaders that he could not recommend holding up the labour immigration schedule for the current half-year beginning the 1st April,  nor yet the limitation  of immigration until after the Royal Commission had made  its  report.    23. In view, however, of the gravity of the fact  that unless some limitation of  immigration were made the High Commissioner saw no prospect at that time of  the strike ending or of any lessening of lawless acts, he asked to be informed whether his reply to the Arab leaders embodied the Secretary of State &apos;s views or whether Mr. Thomas considered any modification in his reply advisable.    24.  The situation was  considered in  the light  of the  telegraphic corres- pondence with the High Commissioner at a conference of Ministers presided over by  the Prime Minister on the 14th May, and as  a result  of  that conference  the High Commissioner was informed by telegraph on the same day that the attitude which  he had taken up with regard to the demand for the cessation of immigra- tion was entirely approved.  A few days later the High Commissioner announced his approval of a labour schedule for the current half-year of 4,500 certificates. On the 18th May Mr. Thomas announced in the House of Commons the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government to advise the King to appoint a Royal Commission, when order had been re-established, to enquire into the causes of the disturbances and to investigate alleged grievances of Arabs and Jews.    25.  In a telegram of the 2nd June the High Commissioner, summing up the position, said that there were three possible courses open,  of  which the first was that he should be  authorised to inform  the leaders that  there  would  be a suspension if immigration until the Royal Commission had reported, and that the Royal Commission would be sent out as soon as lawless acts ceased.  Commenting upon this course, he  said that he had never recommended that  this should be adopted, and that after consulting his Executive Council he was confirmed in his consistent attitude; apart from the fact that he was not certain that concessions would then enable Arab leaders to restore law and order, it would be regarded by the Arabs  and the Jews  as a  concession to violence, and, moreover,  the  same demand for suspension or cessation of Jewish immigration would again be put forward if the recommendations of the Royal Commission were regarded by the Arabs as unsatisfactory.    26.  From the foregoing summary I think it will  be clear that an immediate suspension of immigration, in the hope that it would  result in the present state of disorder in Palestine quickly dying down, would involve  the reversal of the decision taken on the advice of the High Commissioner after careful deliberation by  Ministers.    27.  Before discussing further the  question of the  possible  temporary suspension of Jewish immigration, I should like to inform the Cabinet briefly of an important conversation which I had with  Dr. Weizmann and Mr. Ben Gurionon  the  30th  June.-  Dr.  Weizmann had   had  previous  conversations  withMr. Archer Cust, a former official of the Palestine Government, whose suggestions for a solution of the Palestine problem by a form of &quot; cantonisation &quot; has arousedsome interest recently.   In  the  course  of  his  conversation with Mr.  Cust,Dr. Weizmann had propounded quite tentatively a proposal of his own in which mr. Cust understood that  Dr.  Weizmann&apos;s Jewish associates in America andFrance  and Zionist labour interests were prepared to acquiesce.  According  toMr. Cust&apos;s provisional version of the conversation, Dr. Weizmann said that  in Central Europe there were 2,000,000 Jews who could be said to be homeless.  Ofthis number he wished to be responsible for a third, say, 700,000, and to findhomes for them in Palestine by immigration spread over a period of twenty years..      [13478]              &quot;                                      b 3
His policy  with regard  to  Jewish development was  that  two-thirds  of the immigrants should be urban and industrial and one-third rural.  In the coastalplain from  Gaza to Ras-el-Naqura there were, according to  the rough hydro-graphic survey of the  Jewish experts, 3,000,000 dunums of irrigable land, andhe  calculated that, with  the  Huleh Basin,  the  Emek  Plains and  the  BeisanDistrict, if the Jews could acquire up to one-third of the  total irrigable area inthe. coastal  plain his purpose could be carried out  and that  &quot;there would  bethe  Jewish  National  Home.&quot;   He  agreed  that  the   hill   country  ofPalestine would, under his scheme, be  permanently  reserved  for the Arabs, it being understood that  with the  purchase money which the Arabs would receive from the  Jews for land elsewhere, assisted by Government credit schemes, theArab areas  in  the  hill country could be rendered capable  of supporting  a considerably larger  population than  at  present.   As regards  self-governing institutions,  and the  future  relationship   of Trans-Jordan  to  Palestine,Dr.  Weizmann was  content to leave  these aside as  secondary problems in thepresent state of affairs; the only issue for the moment was to find some basis for agreement by which the present tension could be relieved.     28.  With Dr.  Weizmann&apos;s  consent  Mr. Cust  imparted  this  tentativescheme, as he then understood it, to the four  Palestine Arabs who have recentlycome to this country with a view to informing British public opinion of the Arabcase.   He gathered that  Dr.  Weizmann&apos;s  tentative suggestions  produced  a somewhat favourable impression upon the four Arabs, but they were very guardedin their expressions of opinion, and in any case had no authority to speak for anyArab parties in Palestine, having been sent to this country solely for propaganda purposes.     29.  In the course of his conversation with me, Dr. Weizmann recapitulatedin outline the suggestions which he had made to Mr. Cust, with some qualifications and reservations as regards the account which Mr. Cust had given of his previousconversations with Dr. Weizmann.     30.  The most  important  qualifications  of  the tentative  proposals,  as recorded by Mr. Cust, which Dr.  Weizmann made were : -      (i) that he  contemplated an annual  immigration of 50,000 Jews over  a          period of fifteen or twenty years;     (ii) that he wished the Jews to be able to acquire one-third of the remaining          irrigable area (i.e., the area not already in  Jewish hands) in the plains          (including the  coastal plain), which third would amount to another          million dunums;    (iii) that the determining  factor  in immigration must  be the  economic          absorptive capacity of the country, and that no commercial limitation          of Jewish immigration would be considered;     (iv) that he did not remember using the phrase &quot; there would be the Jewish          National Home,&quot; and he wished this omitted from the record;     (v) that he would be prepared to put forward this scheme of the consultation          with  certain American and Labour friends (i.e.,  presumably  their          acquiescence must not be assumed).    31.   I informed Dr. Weizmann that he would have to make his case for this to the Royal Commission, and I warned him not  to put the figure for immigrationso high as to alarm the Arabs.    32.   As  regards the Royal  Commission,  I took  the opportunity of tellingDr. Weizmann that I was  determined to do all that  I could to prevent Counselfrom being heard by the Royal  Commission,  as I was convinced  that  it was agreat mistake  when  Counsel  were briefed  for the enquiry  into  the  1929disturbances.  Dr. Weizmann  and Mr. Ben Gurion both expressed  their entireconcurrence  in this view.   I took the opportunity afforded by his visit to giveDr. Weizmann an idea of what I had in mind as regards the terms of reference of the Royal  Commission.   Dr. Weizmann said  that he and his friends had beenthinking on this subject, and that he would like  to send me  the draft terms whichthey-themselves have prepared.  These have not yet been received.    33.   The conversation then turned to the  question of a temporary suspension of immigration.   I told Dr. Weizmann that I  had received reports not only  from members of  Parliament like Mr. Maxton, but from some of my colleagues in the
 Government  to  the  effect  that  there ought to be a temporary suspension of immigration  from the time that the  Royal Commission set out from England. until its report had  been considered by the Government.   I  endeavoured to ascertain whether  there was any prospect of the Jews being willing to make a gesture with regard to immigration, not, of course, while disorder still continued, but when the Royal Commission was ready to start.   I made it clear that what I had in mind was not merely the suspension of the labour schedule, as had been done during the mission of Sir  John Hope Simpson  to Palestine.   This  would cover only part of  the total immigration, and if immigration were to be stopped for the time being it would, in my opinion, have to be a stoppage of  all immi- gration of all races, except, I thought, the dependants of those  who had already entered Palestine as permitted immigrants.   Mr. Ben Gurion expressed himself as strongly opposed  in  principle to any suspension of immigration; politically the Government could suspend immigration, but economically the results would, he thought, be very serious.  Dr. Weizmann was disposed to be more  helpful and said that the Jews might conceivably not ask for a labour schedule in October on the assumption that the Royal Commission would be at work by then.  I did not ask for an immediate answer on this point.  However, I have since received a letter from Dr. Weizmann of which a copy forms an  appendix to this memo- randum.   It  will be seen that Dr.  Weizmann throws out no hope of the Jews meeting the Government half-way over the  question of the temporary suspension of immigration during the work of the Royal Commission, but urges very strongly that no such  suspension  should take place.  Moreover, he appears to have gone back upon the tentative suggestions outlined above as  regards a more permanent settlement of the Palestine problem.  He seeks to attribute to me the suggestion that in future immigration should  no longer be regulated solely by reference tothe economic  absorptive  capacity of Palestine and that political considerations were in future to be taken into account,  and he goes on to refer  to the letter sent to him on the  13th February, 1931, by Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, as Prime Minister, in which it was stated (see at the end of paragraph 15) that &quot; the considerations relevant to the limits of absorptive capacity are purely economic considerations.&quot; This appears to be a complete misunderstanding of what took place in the courseof our conversation.  Up to now immigration  into  Palestine  has,  in fact, inaccordance with Mr. MacDonald&apos;s letter, been determined solely by reference to the estimate formed from time to time by the High Commissioner of the economicabsorptive capacity of the country,  and  in the course  of our conversation on the 30th June the suggestion that there should be a yearly maximum of immigration so as to enable seven or eight hundred thousand Jews to be absorbed into Palestine over a definite period of years, came not from me but from Dr.  Weizmann, andwas, indeed, as I understood it,  one of the key points in his proposals.    34.  I am afraid,  however, that  it is not  possible  to  escape  from  theconclusion that in  their present  frame of mind  the Zionist Jews are not at  alllikely to accept without a severe struggle any proposal for a temporary suspension of immigration during the deliberations  of the Royal Commission.    35.  While I  feel strongly that it is important that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should avoid any appearance  of bargaining with those responsible for theserious and continued acts of disorder and  outrage in Palestine, I neverthelessconsider  that, once order has been restored and  it  is  possible for the  Royal Commission to  be  appointed, it would  be  not unreasonable for all permanentimmigration of whatever race other than dependants joining relatives alreadysettled in Palestine to be suspended from the date that the Commission left thiscountry for Palestine until its  report  had been considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government.    36.  Before putting forward  this  opinion  I have consulted  the  HighCommissioner.   Sir  Arthur Wauchope  does  not  recommend  that  the jewish agency should itself be induced to come  forward with  a suggestion for  the suspension  of immigration.  Any such move, if made  by the Jews, would be  an object of the deepest suspicion to the Arabs and would be represented by them as another example of  the  subservience  of His Majesty&apos;s Government to Jewishinfluence, and it would  not improve relations between the Government and theArab community.   On  the other hand,  Sir Arthur  Wauchope would warmlywelcome the  suggestion  that all permanent immigration into  Palestine, both
                                CONCLUSION.    38.  I should be glad to have the approval of the Cabinet for the following action :     (a) Earliest  possible  despatch  of  two  fully  motorised  battalions  with           infantry mortars; one more squadron of armoured cars and one more           field company of Royal Engineers (paragraph 8).    (&amp;) Acceptance of the  High Commissioners  views as to  non-adoption of           further repressive measures (paragraphs 10 and 11).    (c)  Earliest practicable announcement of the terms of reference for the Royal           Commission and the personnel (paragraphs 12 to 14).    (d) Reaffirmation of  the decision that the Royal Commission will not proceed           to Palestine until law and order have been restored.    (e)  Decision by His Majesty&apos;s Government (despite Jewish opposition, which           is certain)  that all permanent immigration of all races into Palestine           should  be  temporarily suspended  from  the date when  the  Royal           Commission leaves for Palestine until its report has been considered           by the Government.   This decision to be taken with the object of not           prejudicing the position while the  Royal Commission is deliberating           and the Government is considering its  report, exceptions to be made           in the case of  dependants of persons already in  Palestine (paragraphs           33 to 36).    (/)  The decision ,as to temporary suspension of permanent  immigration to           be announced, provided that the High Commissioner  agrees, when           the terms of reference and personnel  of  the Royal Commission are           announced in Parliament.                                                (Initialled)       W. O.  G.    Colonial Office, Downing Street,             July 4, 1936.Jewish and non-Jewish, should be stopped as soon as the Royal Commission isduly constituted.  Sir Arthur  tells me that he has always felt that as soon asdisorder has been suppressed and threats of violence  removed,  but not  till then,His Majesty&apos;s Government should, of their own volition, suspend all immigrationso as not to prejudice -the  position while  the Royal Commission is deliberating.He is reinforced in this opinion by the fact that the effect of the continued strike and disturbances must be very greatly to reduce the economic absorptive capacityof the country.  He anticipates no serious administrative difficulties with regardto such suspension, although he considers that it might increase the pressure ofillegal immigration.  The  only exception to the suspension  which he would suggest is that of  dependants of those already resident in Palestine in cases ofproved hardship.    37.  That such a decision will be strongly opposed by the Jews and by thosein Parliament who support them I make  no doubt.  And it  is  necessary for meto remind my colleagues that any concession to Arab opinion at this time after their campaign of  violence will have  repercussions throughout world Jewry.  Inmy opinion, the consequences of such Jewish reactions may have serious politicalreactions in Parliament and elsewhere.
APPENDIX.   Letter from Dr. Chaim Weizmann to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.                                  The Jeivish A gency for Palestine,                                       77 Great Russell Street, My dear Mr. Ormsby-Gore,                     London, W.C. 1, July 1, 1936.     I WANT to thank you for the information you gave us yesterday, it has greatly clarified  the position.  Among the points raised by you there were two of exceptional gravity, upon which it is my duty to write to you without delay.     1.   The terms of reference of the Royal Commission, as  adumbrated by the late Colonial Secretary in the House of Commons, aiid confirmed by you yesterday, are to contain an assurance that the Commission is not to call in question the terms of the Mandate.   But when speaking of Jewish immigration into Palestine you seemed to indicate that that immigration is no  longer to be  regulated solely by  reference  to  the economic  absorptive capacity of the  country,  and that &quot;political&quot;  considerations were in future to be taken  into account;  in fact,  if we understood you rightly, it is your intention that  a yearly maximum should be fixed in  advance, and that Jewish immigration should not be allowed  to exceed this limit, irrespective  of the  economic development of the country and of  its absorptive capacity.     I feel it  to  be my duty, both to the  Jewish people and to the Mandatory Government, to state at once, and as clearly as  possible, that in  my view such a policy strikes at  the very root of the Mandate and the National Home.   It is in contradiction  to  the interpretations given in the White Paper  of 1922, and to the explicit statement in the Prime Ministers letter of the 13th  February, 1931, that &quot; the considerations  relevant to the limits of absorptive capacity are purely economic considerations &quot; ; it reverses the practice of the Mandatory Administra- tion during the last seventeen years.   It threatens to destroy  the foundations on which we undertook, and have carried on, our work in  Palestine, and  on which the co-operation  between the Jewish  Agency and the British  Government has been based.    I cannot believe that  this  is  to be  the settled policy  of His  Majesty&apos;s Government.   Such a  policy  would  artificially  hold  up the  development  of Palestine,  or hand over to non-Jewish immigrants from neighbouring  countries the fruits  of our labour withheld from ourselves.  And  this Avould be done at a time when the plight of the Jews in Germany and  Eastern Europe has become desperate  bej^ond description.   Our persecuted  people are left with  one last hope the hope that, to the extent to which thej^ may  succeed, by their own efforts, in creating new possibilities of  work and existence in Palestine, they will be able to return there as of right. It is on the basis of trust in Great Britain&apos;s word that Jews have gone to Palestine and staked their all in the country. With them think and feel millions of Jews throughout the world.    2.  You  further told us that you contemplated the practical suspension  of immigration  (with the exception of dependents) during the work of the Royal Commission.   This means for us much more than the loss of a certain number of immigrants during a period of several months.  I must make it quite clear that we could only regard this as a  retreat in the face of organised terrorism. This suspension will have come about as a result  of the murder of numbers of our people in Palestine, of attacks upon their property and of  the destruction-of the fruits of their toil.  In the face of the most cruel provocation, the Jewish people of Palestine have shown a discipline and a self-restraint made possible only by an iron will to do nothing which might aggravate the situation  or increase the difficulties  of the  Mandatory Power.   To penalise us  by the suspension of Jewish immigration will be to deal us a blow which  can be  justified neither to our own people nor  to the  world at large.    I believe that it is impossible to guarantee the safety of life and property in Palestine if the Government, with so large a military display,  fails to carry into effect the policy it has repeatedly announced of suppressing  disorder and refusing to compromise with it.  In 1922  and 1929 the Arab rioters were encouraged by the suspension of immigration.  I feel most strongly that if this practice is repeated,
and  the  terrorists are shown that they can  stand up in  the face of repeateddeclarations of the British  Government, backed by a large military force, therecan be no hope  that disorders of this  character will  not recur  in  Palestine on every occasion on which  an extremist section  of the Arab population  sets out to gain a political  advantage by violence.                               /.  ;    With all the earnestness at my command, I would beg you  to give renewedconsideration to these two  questions.   May I express the hope that, after  theterrible ordeal through which our people are now passing, we shall not in additionhave to suffer these cruel and undeserved reverses ?                                                Yours very sincerely,                                         (Signed)       CH WEIZMANN.
