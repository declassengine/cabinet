Printed for the  Cabinet.  August 1936.iSECRET.                                                         Copy No.CP. 219 (36).CABINET.REFORM  OF  THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS.         Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    BEFORE considering  alternative proposals for the reform of the Leaguethere  is a preliminary point of procedure to be decided.   At the last meetingof the Assembly Governments were invited to inform  the Secretary-General ofthe League in writing by the 1st September of their proposals for the reform of theLeague.   Since  the issue  of that invitation,  however, there has  been some modification of the  international situation in that a Five-Power Conference  hasnow been  summoned and the Governments concerned have agreed to  attend it.In these circumstances it would in my view be inadvisable for His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment to make any statement of its policy in respect of League  reformbefore the meeting  of the  Assembly  on the 21st September.  This would give time for the preparations of the Five-Power Conference to make some progress.It is  therefore suggested that a letter should be sent  to the Secretary-Generalinforming him that His Majesty&apos;s Government will  be  ready to make theirviews known upon the reform of the  League at the forthcoming meeting of theAssembly.    The examination of the articles of the Covenant and of the working of themachinery of the League  upon which Governments will shortly be engaged atGeneva has its origins in the failure to apply article 16 effectively in the recentItalo-Ethiopian dispute.   In such conditions there are two broad alternativeswhich  are open to Governments.  They may  determine to remove Article 16from the Covenant altogether, or they may seek so to modify its application asto limit that application hereafter to circumstances and conditions in which thereare reasonable prospects of its succeeding.  There is much to be said in favour ofthe first course.   The League suffers to-day from its lack of universality.  the deletion of Article 16 might reasonably be expected to  facilitate the  return ofGermany and Japan to the League, and possibly even the  enrolment of the UnitedStates  of America amongst  its members.  But  whatever the merits or demerits43
of a proposal to delete Article 16, it would be almost inevitable that any attempt on the part of  His Majesty&apos;s Government to secure support for  such a proposal would split the League from top to bottom.   It has  only to be recalled that theattitude of the Little Entente in the light of the lessons of recent months is to seek to strengthen, rather than weaken, the rigidity of Article  16, that in this they have  the  support of  Soviet Russia  and that of France,  moderated  in the instance of the last-named country by a desire to keep in step with us, for it to berealised how grave the consequences of any demand for the deletion of Article 16would be.     In these circumstances I do not advocate that our statement  to the assembly should include any proposal  to delete Article 16 from the Covenant,  and havingthus circumscribed the limits of our scheme  it is suggested that our declarationmight include the following  points :      (1) His Majesty&apos;s Government do not favour drastic changes in the Covenantnor the actual suppression of any Article, but they are concerned to make theLeague more effective by adapting its machinery  in  the light of the experience gained in the past few months.     (2) The framers of the Covenant were wise in that they produced an  elasticdocument which did not exclude any form of action in an emergency.   machinery should be devised which would facilitate  the taking of preventive action earlier than is now to be expected in any  dispute which arises.  The first step towardsattaining this object would be the adoption of an interpretative resolution  rulingout the necessity  of counting the votes of  parties to a dispute for the purpose of achieving unanimity in respect  of decisions under Article 11 of the Covenant.Such a resolution might  also make  it plain that it would be the responsibility ofthe Council to take preventive action early in any dispute.  The advantage  ofsuch a procedure would be that in the discussions which would take place in theCouncil under Article 11 it would appear quite clear  whether, and if  so how far;the Powers represented on the Council were ready to intervene.  If they were generally ready;  a plan of action could be immediately drawn up.  If not,  thevarious States  would  know where they were at the very outset and could shapetheir policy accordingly.  A further  advantage of  this procedure would be  thatit would reinforce action for  peace in those parts of the world covered by regionalpacts.   In other  parts of  the world  where no regional pacts existed, it  wouldprovide an alternative  means of  treating the issue,  and avoid  the  danger  of raising false expectations.    (3) There is  every advantage in the negotiation of regional pacts devised tostrengthen general security.   His Majesty&apos;s Government are in  favour of suchpacts provided that they are consistent with the Covenant.  It is for considera-tion whether they should be submitted  to  the  Council  or  the Assembly forapproval before they  attain  their full validity.  Such approval  should perhaps be dependent on  compliance  with certain conditions  to be defined.  Under suchregional pacts those who were parties to them would, of course, be free to assumedefinite obligations beyond those  at present embodied in the Covenant.   HisMajesty&apos;s Government would certainly be prepared to adhere to such a Pact  inrespect of Western Europe.     (4) There are advantages in leaving Article 16 as it is (though subject to theAssembly Resolutions of 1921) in order to provide legal cover for action  whichmight be taken subsequently  under that Article as the result of discussion underArticle 11, but  it would  be important to get it laid down that the normalapproach to Article 16 would be by way of Article  11, and that in all cases whereit is  possible action  before  the  Council should be  initiated under  the  latterArticle.  An advantage of this procedure would be that, if Article 11 was freelyused as proposed, the obligations of Article 16 would be explored and the measureof willingness  to fulfil  them made  clear at an  earlier  stage.    With such a procedure it should be possible to avoid the dangers arising from the obligationto impose sanctions under Article  16 in a dispute  where countries were not, infact, prepared  to fulfil that obligation.    (5) The Covenant should be separated from the Treaties of  Peace and takethe form of a self-contained  Convention.     (6) If the proposals set out  above were approved the declaration  should emphasise  that they do not  constitute merely an attempt  to find a compromise between extreme  views in regard to the reform of the  Covenant, but represent, in
    One of the chief reproaches levelled at the League is that it is the guardianof things as they are.  It is true that Article 19 contemplates the possibility of change; but, so far, no real attempt has been made to apply it.  There is probablyno change in the text of the Article that would make it more effective.  It would,for example, certainly not be practicable to give the Assembly power to  imposechanges against the will of the parties concerned.  On the other hand, somethingmight be done to encourage States to make use of  the Article, for, at any rate,the discussion  of  proposed changes  and,  if  it were possible to obtain it, anunmistakable expression of opinion on the part of a majority of members of theLeague  might have a  great effect.   But  the means whereby States might be encouraged to experiment with this method are probably rather outside the scopeof the forthcoming proceedings at Geneva which are likely to be  concerned withthe provision of machinery.  It seems very unlikely, in any case, that more can bedone at Geneva in September than the appointment of a committee to examine thevarious proposals  that may be made.  As regards Article 19, particularly, theproceedings at Geneva  cannot  be  divorced  from  those  of the  Five-power conference  and the question  of vitalising the Article will probably arise inconnexion with the latter.    The above comment refers only to the question of the reform of the League.It is inevitable, however, that other matters affecting the international  situation will  be raised in  the beginning  of  the  discussion at the Assembly.   Amongstthese  economic problems are certain to  have  their share,  more especially sinceM. van Zeeland deliberately referred to them and to their relation to our political difficulties during  his closing speech at the last  Assembly.  Moreover, it is clearthat no review of the international situation which ignores the economic  problems with which  we have to deal, can be complete.  It is, therefore, very  desirablethat the  spokesman of His Majesty&apos;s Government should at least indicate thathe is aware of their existence.  This might be  done by reiterating the offer madeby Sir Samuel Hoare at last year&apos;s  Assembly in respect of  raw materials, andby proposing that  this enquiry  should be set on  foot by the League forthwith.                                                                    A. E.    Foreign Office, August 20, 1936.fact, a coherent and reasonable plan.  Such a plan should result, if the nations are really anxious to join in working it, in the emergence of a stronger League,and  one  more fitted to cope with the present difficult  international situation.     (7) It is for consideration whether steps should not be  taken to ensure thatGermany  and  Japan, at any rate,  should  be invited to participate in any committee studying the reform  of the League.
