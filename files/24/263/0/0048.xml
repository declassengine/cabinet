SECRET.                                                         Copy  No.CP. 218 (36).[Also Paper No. C.O.S. 511.)CABINET.PREPARATIONS EOR THE PROPOSED FIVE-POWER CONFERENCE.              Report by  the  Chiefs  of Staff  Sub-Committee.    1.   At the request of  the Secretary of State  for Foreign Affairs, we have examined the attached Memorandum by the Foreign Office on the subject of thegeneral  lines which  should be  followed by His Majesty&apos;s  Government at theproposed meeting of the  Five Locarno Powers.    We were particularly  asked to treat this as a matter of urgency, in orderthat His Majesty&apos;s  Government might  reach the  necessary decisions  withoutdelay, and thus be the first in the  field  with their  proposals.  Consequently, wehave been  unable to devote as much  time as we should have liked to the formulation of our answers to  the intricate and important questions that havebeen referred to us.    2.   At the outset we desire to emphasise that we  have not been asked toconsider whether the conclusion of a new general agreement in Western Europe,to replace the Locarno Treaty,  is,  or is not, desirable from a military point ofview. Accordingly, we assume  that it  has been  decided on  political grounds toattempt to negotiate such  an  agreement.  We have,  therefore, confined  our attention to the questions which have been specifically referred to the Committeeof Imperial Defence in  the Foreign Office Memorandum,  and  to those other questions therein which appear  to have military implications.                            GENERAL PRINCIPLES.    3.   Before dealing with these questions in detail,  we  desire to  formulatecertain general principles which should, from the military point of view, governour policy in negotiating any new agreement.    4.   In the first  place, a statement  which we made   in a  report  to  theCommittee of Imperial Defence* in February 1935  bears repetition :-        &quot;Again,  without  in  any  way wishing to  minimise the  ultimate    potentialities of Germany, we would urge that the broad principles on which    our Empire strategy has always been  based  should not be forgotten  nor    should the lessons of history be overlooked.        &apos;&apos; The greater our commitments in Europe the less will be our ability    to secure our Empire and its  communications.....&quot;    It is true that the German threat is now more formidable, and perhaps moreimminent than it  was when the above report was written, but the  desirability of limiting our commitments in Europe is as insistent as ever.                     * C.I.D. Paper No. 1181-13, paragraph 17.      [13718 I                                                      ,i          &apos;   &apos;  ; Printed for the Cabinet.  September 1936-        .      % ff 3
     5.  Secondly, we consider that we should not undertake a liability to engage in any war in which our vital interests are not affected.  We fully realise thatthis principle has to be reconciled with the necessity to contribute towards ageneral appeasement of Europe, which in turn would contribute to the securityof the British Empire.     6.  Thirdly, whatever our engagements may be, we should make it clear thatthe final decision as to whether we enter a war or  stand out of it will rest with ourselves, and ourselves alone.     7.  Fourthly, we consider that the form which our intervention will takeshould similarly be a matter for our own decision when the occasion arises.     8.  Finally, we consider it of the first importance from the point of view ofthe full development of  our Imperial  war effort,  that any engagements whichwe  may undertake should  command the full support of  the Dominions.  This,we  submit, would not be assured,  unless the principles set out in the preceding paragraphs are adhered  to.                     THE FOREIGN  OFFICE MEMORANDUM.     9.   In the following paragraphs we deal seriatim with the questions set forth in  the Foreign  Office Memorandum. Question 2.  What  machinery should the new  agreement  contain for bringing         the guarantees into operation?  Should the League be employed for this         purpose in  the same  way as the  old Locarno  Treaty f     10.   This question has not been  specifically referred to us, but we feel that it has military implications.     11.   It is  immaterial, from the military point  of view, what form, of machinery is devised for  bringing the guarantees into operation, provided that the following conditions are fulfilled:      (i)  We must ensure, as already stated in paragraph 6 above, that the final           decision as to whether we  enter a war rests with ourselves, and ourselves           alone.  We should not agree to an arrangement whereby we might, for           example,  be automatically committed by  a majority vote of  some           international body.     (ii)  We should  have  the  powrer to take instant action in  case of flagrant           aggression, consequently,  it should be made perfectly clear in the new           agreement, as is not the case in Article 4 (3) of the  Locarno Treaty,           that the term &quot; flagrant aggression &quot; includes air attack.  In default           of this safeguard, there is a danger that the aggressor might gain a           decisive advantage during the  delay which would almost inevitably           ensue before the investigating authority announced its verdict.Question 4. Do we wish in the New A greement to be guaranteed ourselves instead         of being merely a guarantor ? If so, against whom and by whom are         we to be guaranteed ?     12.  Since Great Britain  is an  island, no direct invasion by land  forces ispossible; the danger  of  sea-borne invasion is remote.  Nor  is it likely that any power in Europe would embark upon  a naval war against us alone, unless we were already engaged in  hostilities in the Far East.   On  the  other hand,  we  are particularly susceptible to air attack, and for this reason it would appear at first sight that it would be an advantage to have a guarantee of immediate assistancein the event of our being the victim of such a form of aggression.    13.  Against this it can be argued, first,  that the contingency of our being attacked by France is so remote that there would be no practical advantage  in being guaranteed by Germany against France, and, secondly, that in  the eventof our being attacked by Germany, it is most unlikely that France would fail tocome to our assistance in the  interest of  her  own  security, irrespective of any previous guarantee.  If these suppositions are correct, the practical value to us
3301 of receiving a guarantee would  certainly be small;  but  it is doubtful whether they can be taken for granted, particularly from a long range point of view.     14.  The question whether our present policy of close  friendship with France will endure for all time is primarily a political one, and although there is at present no particular reason for thinking that it may be otherwise, recent events in Europe cannot but raise a shadow of apprehension as to what the future may hold, and suggest the possibility, if no more, that we may  at some later date have to face the contingency of French hostility.     15.  But apart from this, it is not certain,  even  in the existing state of our relationship, that we  can rely on French assistance against Germany irrespective of the  causes of the quarrel.  It is quite possible, for example, that, in the event of a German  air attack against  ourselves owing to  our  refusal at some  future date to surrender a Colony, France might well  feel  that her own security was not  endangered,  and  might even  claim that  our  refusal was  in  itself  a &quot; provocation.&quot;   In such circumstances the absence of  any guarantee of her support would result in a single-handed struggle with Germany in which our extreme  vulnerability to  air attack would  expose us to  the  gravest danger; whereas, if such a guarantee existed, it might constitute a sufficient deterrent to Germany to prevent her attacking us.   . 16.  It is true that if we consent  to  act as a guarantor without  receiving any guarantee in return, there is a psychological advantage to be obtained from our disinterested action to  preserve peace;  this  may be of  value  so  far as it contributes to a general appeasement and may also put us in  a stronger position for securing  our interests  in other  directions  (vide  paragraphs  3  to  8).Nevertheless, from a defence aspect, it is  felt that the considerations mentionedabove lead  on balance to the conclusion that  we have something definite  to gain from receiving a guarantee under  any new Agreement,  and that in  view ofour vulnerability to  air  attack,  we should  make  every endeavour  to  obtainsuch a guarantee.   This is, in  fact,  the view to  which we  inclined  in  our report* on the French air  proposals for a Treaty of mutual guarantee  in thefollowing terms :          &quot;  We note that, for the first time, a suggestion  has  been made to give    a  guarantee  to us in certain eventualities,  and we appreciate fully  the    importance of this concession.&quot;    17.  Although  a  political factor, and therefore outside our sphere, we feel that the above conclusion will undoubtedly accord with  public opinion  in thiscountry.    .18.  It remains  to consider  against  whom  and by whom  we should  be guaranteed.  From&apos; the foregoing brief review,  it is apparent that we requireguarantees from France against  Germany, and  from Germany against France. We should not, however, wish to receive any guarantee from Italy or Belgium for the reasons given  in our  answers to Questions 6 and 7. Question 5. Should the Irish Free State  participate in the new agreement?    19.  In a recent report which  we prepared at the request of the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs, but which has  not  yet  been presented to  the Committee  of Imperial Defence,  we explained the strategic  importance of  theIrish Free State in the following terms :           &apos;&apos; The strategic importance of the  Irish  Free  State to  this country arises    from its geographical position,  across our main  trade routes and less than    100 miles from the west  coast of Great Britain.        The features of the greatest military importance are          (a) The naval  ports and anchorages possessed by the Irish Free  State..        (&amp;) The existing and potential air  bases possessed  by the  Irish Free               State. :         (c) The land frontier which, separates the Irish Free State from British               Territory in Northern Ireland.            * C.I.D. Paper No. 1161-B       [13718]f Psr*v TS&quot;o, C.O.S. 507.                      B 2
  - -  .    If (a) or (b) are in the bands of a hostile Power,, or (c) is liable to attack     by a hostile Power, our strategic position obviously suffers seriously.   If     this were&apos;,the; only, aspect of our interests it would be sufficient for us to   &apos;  ensure the neutrality of the Irish Free State in war,  and a mutual guarantee     between the Irish Free State and Great Britain to that effect would satisfy     our needs.  Our interests do not end here, however, since the use of facilities     in the Irish Free State; for our forces would, be of great importance to us  : , jnwar.!&apos;   , &apos;  ,   .    . W&apos;.,, ......              &apos;   W ^.      &apos;, . ,   ,     20.  In the same Report we gave the  following explanation of the facilitiesthat we should reqiiire in the event of war :          &apos;&apos; We should require unrestricted use of  all ports and  anchorages in     wartime.   Examples of our principal  requirements are as follows :          Requirements in German War              Lough Swilly       ...     Convoy  Assembly Port:  base  for           ;     .                         Auxiliary Vessels.             Queenstown        ... &quot;1             Kingstown  ...     ...  V  Bases for Auxiliary Vessels.             Berehaven   ... ,    ...  j                                      Convoy Assembly Port.     .                                      Bases for the Main Fleet.                                      Base for Auxiliary Vessels.         It is  not practicable to define exactly where we shall require aerodromes    or landing grounds in Ireland during war,  but we can assume that aircraft    will be needed in connection with trade protection, coast defence, and minor    naval  operations.  It is therefore essential that in war we  should have  the    right of unrestricted flying over  Ireland, and the use of such aerodromes as   . we may require.&quot;    21.  The  above naval base facilities are already secured to us  by the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921; and  we should presumably still enjoy them in the eventof-any war in which we might become engaged, irrespective of whether the IrishFree State  elected to stand out.    22.  Nor  would the position be  materially altered  if, as has recently beendiscussed,  it  were  decided  to  hand  over, in  time  of  peace,  the completeresponsibility for the. defence of the reserved ports in the Irish Free State, providedthat the conditions recommended in our Report* on this subject are fulfilled,i.e.r we.should still.retain all rights  that we require in time of war.    23.  Accordingly, we consider that, so long as the Irish Free State remainswithin the  British Commonwealth of Nations, no advantage is to be gained from our point of view by her participation in the new agreement.    24.  Nor  would there appear to be any advantage to the Irish Free  Stateitself from any such participation, for the following  reasons :       (i) A guarantee by us  would be redundant, as we are already under  the         .  obligation to defend the Irish Free State as a component part of  the           British Commonwealth.     (ii) A guarantee to the Irish Free State by the other guarantor Powers would         , also be superfluous, since those Powers that enter the war as our allies           would thereby also become allies of the Irish  Free State.  It has, in           any case, to be remembered that the parties to a security arrangement       ....,.  will  no),  &quot;come to  the  assistance&quot;  of their  fellow members  by,        /.  despatching forces to their  aid.  They  merely  contract to enter  tho           war, and thereafter employ their forces in whatever way they consider  ;-   &apos;  .  &apos; most advantageous. -      &apos;   1  1                 &quot;  -  -   -    &apos;  l:SiUmxm;\ ixiiil &apos;uK.m&quot;m-i) - * C.I.D.JPnper  Xo. 416-C. \\ ^ao^L- i&apos;.(S&apos;ru^  -m^v?&apos; /-P-m:Requirements in French War-    Lough Swilly    Queenstown  ...     ... 1    Berehaven .  ...     ... J    Kingstown
     25.  From the foregoing it will be seen that the Trish Free State stands to gain nothing by participation in the new agreement, unless, of bourse, there is at the  back of her mind, the idea that she  should be guaranteed against possible aggression by ourselves.;  This is  an embarrassment which we. would clearly be unable to accept.               -     -             .&apos;-             ,   .&apos;     26.  The above arguments are based on the assumption that the Irish Free State remains within the British Commonwealth.  If she should cease to be a member, we would presumably negotiate a separate treaty with her on the&apos; general lines recommended in the Report from which we have quoted in paragraph 19.     In that event the conclusions recorded in paragraphs 23-25 above,, to the effect that Irish Free  State participation in the new Agreement would be unnecessary and perhaps embarrassing, would continue to hold good. Question 6. Is  Italy to be guaranteed?  If so, against whom, and by whom?     27.  Neither Italy nor ourselves received any guarantee under Locarno; but the Foreign Office have pointed out, in their  comments on question (6), that, if we now become a guaranteed Power, it would be  difficult to refuse the same advantage to Italy if she asked for it.     28.  The Foreign Office  state  that it  may be taken for granted that neither we nor  Belgium would be prepared to  guarantee Italy, so that, in effect, Italy would be guaranteed only by France against Germany and vice versa.   But they also say that it is  doubtful whether France  would undertake  such  an obligation without our co-operation.                                    :  ^     29.  The tentative  conclusion reached  by the Foreign Office is that  &quot; We should want in the new treaty to be both  a  guaranteed and a.guarantor Power. But we should not wish either to guarantee  or be guaranteed by Italy.&quot;     30.  The  first part  of   this conclusion  has already been  discussed underquestion 4 above.      .                                     -            .;  .     31.  As regards the second part  it would be undesirable, from the military point of view, for us to give any guarantee  to Italy -for the following reasons :     (i) On general grounds, it would  constitute an additional, and  possibly a          dangerous, military commitment for us; and               -     (ii) It is difficult to imagine circumstances in which an  attack directed, in the,&apos;          first instance, by one of the other  signatories against Italy, would also          be a direct threat  to ourselves.     32.  As we  do not wish to give  a  guarantee to Italy, we cannot expect to obtain a guarantee from  her.   It is true that such a guarantee  should  be of value to us if we were attacked by either France or Germany : but the disadvan- tages of asking for a guarantee from Italy, and, consequently,  having to give her one in return, appear to outweigh the advantages of Italian assistance in the event of aggression against us.                                  &apos;     33.  We therefore agree with the Foreign. Office suggestion that we should neither guarantee nor be guaranteed by  Italy.     34.  The question of  whether  Italy is to be guaranteed by any of the other signatories still  remains to be considered.   This must depend on the wishes of the Powers concerned, and the only comments that we  desire.to make are :       (i) It is to our advantage to keep a war  out of  North-West  Europe and          therefore that France should not  become involved in an Italo-German          war,  or Germany in an  Italo-French war.         &apos;   .  (ii). France  is; unlikely  to guarantee1  Italy,  unless  we&apos; accept  a similar          obligation.  A   .&quot;        &apos;;&apos;&apos;&apos;-.   &quot;&apos;&apos;      &apos;   ;&apos; &apos;      &apos;&apos;  &apos; Our most desirable solution,  therefore, from a military point  of view, would be that Italy should remain as she &quot;was under Locarno, merely a guarantor Power.     35.  We are not specifically asked to consider the question  of .Italy as a guarantor of countries other than ourselves; but we wish to point out that it wouldbe extremely embarrassing if we were to&apos; decide that Germany had committed
an act of unprovoked aggression against France, necessitating our armed interven-tion on the side  of  France,  and Italy, swayed by  her sympathies for another&apos;&apos; totalitarian &apos;&apos;  State, were to take a  contrary view  and intervene on the sideof Germany.  The military consequences of such a development would certainly be very serious.  Whether Italy,  if she  were not a party to  a Western  Pact,might remain neutral, but, if she were a party, might feel compelled to intervene,possibly on the opposite side to  ourselves, is a political question.Question  7. Should Belgium  be  relieved of  giving any  guarantee  and  her        commitments limited to an understanding to  defend her own territory?     36.  The effect of relieving  Belgium  of giving any guarantee would be that,in the event of war in Western Europe, she could remain neutral for so  long as her neutrality were respected by the belligerents.     37.  This holds out weighty advantages.  In  the first place it is conceivable that Germany might make a deliberate point  of scrupulously respecting Belgianneutrality at any rate  at the outset of  hostilities in order not only to lessen the chances of intervention by Great Britain, but also to  ensure that her important industrial districts in the Ruhr  are not subjected to close range air attack fromBelgian aerodromes.     38.  Secondly, it is clearly desirable to limit the area of any war so far as itis possible to do so.     39.  Thirdly, from the point  of view of  the air defence of this country, an effective Belgian neutrality would mean  that German aircraft would have to coverconsiderably greater distances to  reach their objectives.  It is true, of course,that, in  these  circumstances, we  ourselves  would be unable  to  use  Belgianaerodromes,  but  the  advantage  which we should  obtain from the decreasedintensity  of German  air  attacks outweighs this  disadvantage;  moreover,aerodromes in Northern France for the use of  our bombing aircraft would be just as effective as those in Belgium.     40.  From the above it is clear that we  ourselves have most to gain by an effective Belgian neutrality.     41.  At the same time, we and more particularly the French can feel littleconfidence that Germany will be any more disposed to  respect Belgian neutralityin a future war than she was in 1914, for the following reasons :      (i) It appears impossible for her to deploy her vast forces within the narrow           confines of  the  Franco-German  frontier,   and her best  chance of           turning the  French  defences appears to  lie in an attack  through           Belgium.     (ii) If she should desire to  develop the heaviest scale of air attack on this           country, she could not  do so unless she established aerodromes  in the           Low Countries or at least flew over them.     42.  If  Germany were to Anolate  Belgium at the outset  of hostilities,  she would gain a tremendous military advantage; and, even if she were to respectBelgian neutrality at the outset, she would still be in a  position to violate it laterat the moment most suitable to herself.   We would have to be constantly preparedfor this contingency without ever  being able to determine the precise  moment atwhich it would arise.  But clearly the  longer the violation is delayed, the betterprepared we should be to meet it.     43.  Turning now to the alternative; the  effect of insisting  on Belgium being a  guarantor Power would be that she would automatically enter any war in western Europe at its outset.  We would thus know in advance exactly where westood,  and not only we, but also the French and the Belgians themselves,  wouldbe able to frame plans accordingly.     44.  Moreover, the certainty that  she was bound to be involved in any suchwar might check any tendency  that there might  be on the part of Belgium toneglect her defences.
731     45.  The advantages of Belgium being a guarantor,  which are set out inparagraphs 43 and 44  above, are outweighed by the disadvantages detailed inparagraphs 37 to 42.  Our general conclusions are therefore as follows :      (i) An effective Belgian neutrality would be greatly to our advantage  and           should not  deliberately  be rendered  impossible,  even  though  the           chances of its being maintained throughout a Western European war           are remote.     (ii) We should therefore welcome a request by Belgium that she should not &apos;           be a guarantor  Power, but should&apos; merely  give an undertaking to           defend her own territory.Question 8. Are  Non-Aggression Provisions to be so framed (as Locarno  was)       . as to reserve the right of any Party  to  come to  the assistance  of  a        non-Party which has been attacked by another Party?     46.  This question  has certain military implications upon which we desireto remark.     47.  It appears that any European war involving Germaiw is more likely tobreak out upon  her eastern than upon her western frontiers.  It may  even be-argued that some  rectification of Germany&apos;s eastern frontier is essential before there is any hope of lasting peace and a durable settlement in  Europe.     48.  We may regard it as certain that France will not cancel the  Franco-Soviet Pact, unless and until there is a complete change of government in France.In addition, it appears impossible to turn the Franco-Soviet Pact into an  eastern european Pact  to include Germany.  This  being  so, it is important that weshould take steps  to ensure that any guarantee we give will not automaticallydraw us into a war which has as its origin the rectification of Germany&apos;s easternfrontiers.     49.  At the present time we are not placed under an obligation to use force against France in the event of her implementing her obligations to come to theassistance  of  her Eastern allies;  but  there seems  to be nothing to  makeit clear that, if  war breaks out  between France and Germany under theseconditions, we are not in any circumstances obliged to come to the assistance ofFrance, even if the latter should be invaded by Germany.  In any future treatywe consider that  we should reserve  complete  freedom to  decide for ourselveswhether we should intervene in any conflict arising out of German aspirations orFrench commitments in Eastern Europe.-Question 9. Do  we wish to make special provision in  the new agreement for        air attack?     50.  The Foreign Office comment on  this question includes the  following passage :         &quot;It  is natural that provision for  dealing with  air  attack should be     embodied in this new agreement.&quot;     51.  We are not altogether clear as to the precise implication of this sentence.We have on several occasions emphasised that war is not fought  in one element,and that it is not possible to limit war  to one particular arm of the defence forces.     52.  If, therefore,  the intention  underlying  the Foreign Office comment isthat there should be  some special provision for  dealing with attack by air as opposed to attack by sea or land, we would deprecate it.     53.  If, on the other hand and we believe this to be the case the intentionof the comment is merely to ensure that the definition of flagrant aggression inArticle 4, paragraph 3,  of the Locarno Treaty, should be extended so as to cover the case of attack by air; then, as will be seen from paragraph 11 (ii) above, weare in entire agreement.Question 10. Do  we wish to make special  provision in the new agreement  for        Air Limitation?     54.   It would, of course, be extremely desirable,  in view of the present airarmament  race throughout the  world, to achieve  some degree of  air limitation;
  and we should leave no stone unturned in the forthcoming negotiations to press,  this point of view.      55.   The principal difficulty, however, is that the new agreement is conceived  on a regional basis, whereas any effective provision for air limitation cannot be  so restricted. For example, as pointed out on pages 23 and 24 of the Appendix  to this paper, Herr Hitler made it clear  in  December 1935, that  the strength of  the Russian Air Force, combined with the conclusion of the Franco-Soviet Pact,  rendered impossible any question of air limitation on the basis of parity between  the great Western Powers.      56.   In any case a limitation of air armaments is more difficult to achieve  than is the case with land and sea armaments, owing to the fact that civil aviation  resources, and the output of the aircraft industry can  be  so readily and rapidly  converted to military use.  There are also other serious difficulties which need not  be detailed in this Report.      57.   Consequently, we consider that it  would be an almost hopeless task to&apos;  attempt  to incorporate any special provision for  air limitation in the new agree-  ment itself.      58.   Nevertheless, we feel strongly that, in  spite of the inherent difficulties  of the problem, an opportunity might well occur  in the course of the negotiations  for ascertaining the views of the contracting parties on this important question,  and possibly for initiating a separate discussion on the subject amongst all the  great air Powers.  Question  11. In view of  the  fact that  our  present  liberty  to hold  Staff          conversations  with France  and Belgium,  without  any  corresponding          conversations with  Germany, derives from Germany&apos;&quot;s  repudiation  of          Locarno, and will not necessarily continue if  Locarno is replaced  by a          new agreement tvith Germany,  do we  wish in  the new agreement  to          provide  for Staff conversations  with  France and Belgium ?      59.   The new agreement will presumably be  on  a multilateral basis.  If this  is so, it would be invidious to provide for  Staff conversations with France and  Belgium,  unless provision were also made for Staff conversations with Germany.      60.   Such provision would be impracticable  as we have already pointed out*  in the following terms :           &quot; .  . . . Staff conversations  will almost inevitably entail the disclosure      of detailed  war plans for the  purpose of  co-ordination and  neither France      nor Germany is in the least likely to disclose her plans to us when she knows      that  we  are  carrying on or have  carried  on similar conversations  with      other parties and there is no certainty as  to the side  on which we might  be      fighting.&apos;&apos;      61.   Apart  from the  practical  difficulties,  Staff   conversations  would  inevitably tend to involve us in military commitments which would fetter our  freedom  of action  as to the form that  our intervention  might  take when the  occasion  arose.     62.   Our conclusion therefore is that no provision  should be  made for Staff  conversations with any Power.  Question  12. Should Holland be asked to accede to the new agreement f  If so,          should she  assume all the  obligations  of the agreement,  or only  certain          obligations f      63.   In  their Memorandum, the  Foreign Office have  summarised the views  which we have recently expressed regarding  the possible inclusion of Holland  in  an Aerial Convention, leading to the general conclusion that the advantages and  disadvantages would be about even.      64.   We are now asked whether we consider  that Holland should be asked  to  accede to the proposed new Western Pact  of Mutual Assistance,  and, if  so.* C.I.D. Paper No. 1224-B.
Whether she should be relieved  of  giving any guarantee,  and her commitmentslimited to-ah undertaking to defend her own territory.       &apos;&apos;    &quot;&apos;     &apos;    65.  In a report dated June 1935* we recorded the following view       ,,Vl    t.   &quot;We stand  to gain  most by the  effective neutrality of Holland.\ &apos;.At  ::  present there is a chance,  though&apos;not a good one, that Germany;might    to leave Holland neutral.  If, on the other hand. Holland is to be a party to    the Air Pact, all chance of neutrality is removed.&quot;     /, &quot; -      !&apos;.&apos;&apos;&quot;&apos;&apos;,We consider that  this conclusion  applies  with equal  force to the question ofher inclusion in the new agreement.    66. , Moreover, as we have stated  in  paragraph 38  above  regarding thequestion of  Belgian intervention, we feel that if  hostilities in Western europe should occur, it is important that the field of conflict should be kept to as narrowconfines as possible.                                              .&apos;    67.  We have already referredt to the deficiencies in the Dutch  defences,and although there are indications that these are, to some extent,  being  remedied,it is certain that the Dutch will  never be in a position to resist German invasionwithout greater assistance on  land from ourselves and  the French than we shallbe able to afford.  This brings us to the conclusion which we stated in a previous report, t  &apos;&apos; Adherence  of a weak  ally,  situated in  an  area of geographicalimportance, is a commitment  which would add to our liabilities rather  than toour resources.....&quot;    68.  It therefore  appears that it would be to our advantage if Holland werenot involved in a Western War and that she should not,  therefore, be included as a guarantor Power.    69.  As regards the  question of whether she should receive guarantees, therewould be no particular advantage from our point of view, since a German invasion of Holland would constitute a direct threat to our interest  in the  integrity of theLow Countries and would probably involve us in war whether we  had guaranteedHolland or not.    70.  Consequently, we do  not consider that Holland should be asked to accede to the new agreement; if, however, France or Germany wish to bring her in as a guaranteed  Power,  wre need  not oppose this; but,  whether she accedes to theagreement or not, we consider  that it would be valuable to obtain  an undertaking from all the signatories of the agreement to respect her neutrality.Question 17. In the invitation it is stated that, &quot; If progress can be made under        this  head  (i.e.,  the  conclusion  of  a zvestern agreement for  mutual        assistance, and  the resolution of  the situation created  by the German        initiative of the 7th March), other  matters will  naturally come under        discussion  .... in such a manner as to facilitate . . .. the settlement        of  those problems  the  solution of  which is essential to the  peace of        Europe.&quot;  If such an extension occurs in  the field of discussion, what do        we propose to ask for in the further negotiations  contemplated?    71.  Although we have not been asked to express an opinion on this problem,it is one that  has military implications, and we therefore offer the  following comments.    72.  The  Foreign Office comment on this  question states &apos;&apos; we should decline to disinterest ourselves from the east and centre of Europe and continue to insist on the need for a general settlement. . . .  .&quot;    73.  It is  extremely  improbable that we should be prepared to fight in  awar arising out of an Eastern Europe dispute, at any rate until it,had spread to Western Europe and pur vital interests were threatened.  :.                 * Paper No. CCS. 381; also G.I.D.

    74.  In urging the desirability of a general settlement, we should, as we have indicated in paragraph 5, decline to assume any commitments that would involve;our intervention when our vital interests were not immediately threatened.    75.  It follows that we should not support any agreement which might causean extension of a war in Western Europe.  It is fully realised  that, if germany is given a  free hand in  Central  and Eastern Europe, there is a  danger of  theresult  recoiling ultimately on our  heads.  On  the  other  hand,  it would be disastrous  if an appeasement in Western Europe were rendered, impossible by over-consideration of Russian interests.                            (Signed)       C.

APPENDIX.PREPARATIONS FOR THE PROPOSED FIVE-POWER  CONFERENCE.                      Memorandum by the Foreign Office.     THE London communique of the  23rd July, referring  to  the proposed meeting of  the  five  Locarno  Powers,  described  the  agenda  of  the proposed Conference in the following terms :             The first business to be undertaken should .... be to negotiate a new     agreement to take the place of the Rhine Pact of Locarno, and to  resolve,     through the  collaboration  of  all concerned, the situation created  by the     German initiative of the 7th March.&quot;     After stating that  it was intended to approach the German and  Italian Governments with a  view to obtaining  their participation in the meeting thus proposed, the communique continued as follows :-         &quot; If progress can  be  made  at this meeting,  other  matters affecting     European peace  will necessarily  come under  discussion.   In  such circum-     stances, it would be natural to look forward to the widening of the  area of     the  discussion in such a manner  as  to facilitate, with the collaboration of     the other interested Powers, the settlement of those problems the solution of     which is essential to the  peace of Europe.&quot;     The primary objects of the forthcoming Conference are,  therefore,  (1) to negotiate a new  Western Pact, and (2) to resolve the situation created by the German initiative of  the 7th March; it is intended, however, that the discussion of these two problems should lead to the discussion of wider problems affecting European peace.     The present paper is a  first attempt to  state  the facts  of the situation as affecting the programme of  the forthcoming Conference, and to examine the wider questions which arise  therefrom.     Now that the German and Italian Governments have accepted in principle the invitations for a Five-Power Conference, it is a  matter of considerable urgency to put in hand  the preparatory work required to clear  the ground before the proposed Conference can take place.  As the Secretary of State said in his speech in the House of Commons on the 27th July :           &quot; If our invitations  are accepted, then there should be  an  agreement in     general terms  on  our objectives.  But  the methods of realising them will     still require much study and consultation.  Much work  through the diplo-     matic  channel  will be called for before the meeting of the five Powers can     take place.  Many obstacles yet remain to be surmounted.&quot;     As a  matter of  fact, before we  can  embark  upon any  such  study and consultation  through   the  diplomatic  channel  it  will  be  necessary  for  HisMajesty&apos;s Government to decide on the general lines which they themselves would wish to follow.   This  will involve the examination of a variety of questions, andthe formulation of certain general principles.  It would seem desirable that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should  reach the necessary decisions without delay.  Other-wise, the French and Belgian Governments may be the first to lay down general principles for the coming negotiations, and thus deprive us of the initiative whichit is highly desirable that we should retain.     The  probable attitude of France and Germany emerges from the review ofthe situation Avhich now follows.  Belgium may be expected to follow on the       [13707-4]                                u                    B
whole the line taken by His MajestyV Government.   As regards Italy,  it idifficult at present to foretell what attitude she will adopt.  It will  largely be governed by the extent to which when the time comes she finds herself co-operating with Germany in international affairs, and thereby bound to support  german policy so long as the latter does not directly conflict with Italian vital interests    ine possible reactions of the Spanish question on relations between Germanyand France and Italy are impossible to estimate at  the present juncture,  but mavhave an important influence on the Five-Power negotiations         ELEMENTS IN THE NEGOTIATION OF THE NEW WESTERN PACT.                           (i) Treaty of Locarno.     Under the Treaty of Locarno, Germany and Belgium,  and Germany  andFrance, mutually undertook &apos;&apos; in no case to attack or invade each other or resort to war against each other&quot;;  and the  five Powers Collectively and severallyguaranteed the frontiers of Germany  and Belgium  and Germany and France;.and, in the event of a violation of either of these frontiers, each of the five Powersundertook to come to the immediate assistance of that one of their number whosefrontier  had been violated.  Thus, the  Treaty of  Locarno  comprised  a non-aggression undertaking by Germany  as  against  Belgium  and France, and byBelgium and France as against Germany, and a general  undertaking to assistthe victim of aggression in the event of a violation by Germany of the Belgianor French frontiers or by France or Belgium, of the German frontier.   It did not provide for  any guarantee in the event of an attack on the United Kingdom oron Italy.                        (ii) The Proposed Air Pact.     The Air  Pact first  proposed in the  Anglo-French  communique  of  the3rd  February,  1935, and  of  which British, French and   German  drafts were subsequently elaborated,  was  based   on  a  different  principle.  Its  purpose was  a guarantee by each of the five contracting Powers &apos;&apos; immediately to give theassistance of their air forces to whichever of them might be the victim of unpro-provoked  aerial aggression  by one of the contracting parties.&quot;   The  intention was  to  guard  against sudden  attack  by  air  by providing for immediate assistance  by  other  parties  in  the  event  of  such   aerial  attack:  this assistance  to   be rendered  not  only  to  France,  Belgium   and  Germany,but  also to   the  two   guarantor  Powers  of  the  Treaty of  Locarno the  United  Kingdom  and  Italy.   In  the  negotiations  which  followed the Anglo-French proposal for an Air Pact, it was agreed  that arrangements would  be made  to provide that these  mutual assistance obligations would  notapply as between the United Kingdom and Italy.  Thus the important distinctionbetween the Air Pact and the Locarno Treaty was, so far as we were concerned,the guarantee of assistance which the Air Pact would have secured for us fromGermany in the event of a Belgian or French attack on the United Kingdom, andfrom Belgium and France in the event of a German attack.                     (iii) German Proposals of March  7.     On the 7th March, 1936, the German Government proposed, &quot; for the purpose-of ensuring the sanctity and  inviolability of the boundaries in the West,&quot;  a.25-year non-aggression pact between Germany, France and  Belgium; the UnitedKingdom  and Italy were  to guarantee this Treaty, and the possibility of  theinclusion of  the Netherlands was left open.  The German Government were alsoready to conclude an  Air Pact, presumably on the lines proposed in February1935, thus giving the United Kingdom, as well as the other contracting parties,guarantees against unprovoked aerial attack. Further, the German Governmentwere ready &quot; to enter at once into negotiations with France  and Belgium withregard to the  creation of a zone demilitarized on both sides,  and to agree inadvance to any suggestion regarding the depth and nature thereof on the basisof full parity.&quot;
               (iv)Anglo-rFranco-rBelgian Proposals of March 19.    According to the Proposals Of the 19th March, it was agreed to examine theGerman proposals of the 7th March, to consider  the  future of the  Rhinelandand to press during the negotiations for the limitation of  fortifications in the rhineland, and to draw up mutual assistance pacts open to all the signatories of locarno.  &quot;So far  as  concerns the Four Powers  represented  in London, the reinforcement of  their security provided for will include, in particular, obliga-tions of mutual assistance between Belgium, France,  the United Kingdom andItaly, or any of them, with suitable provisions to ensure prompt action by the signatories in case of need as well as technical arrangements for the preparationof such measures as would  ensure the effective  execution  of the  obligationsundertaken.&quot;                     (v)  German Proposals of March  31.    Finally, in their memorandum  of the 31st March, the German government proposed that Germany, Belgium, France, the United Kingdom and Italy should agree &quot; to enter into discussions, under the leadership of the British Government,for the conclusion of a twenty-five years&apos; non-aggression pact or  security pactbetween France and Belgium, on the one hand, and Germany on the other &apos;&apos;; thatthe United Kingdom and Italy should sign this pact as guarantors; that Germany-should  assume  such  special obligations  to render military assistance as should arise but of these  agreements; that there should be  an Air  Pact; that theNetherlands should be included in the proposed Western arrangement,  if desired;and that an international Court of Arbitration should be set up to  ensure the observance of  the  above agreements.   The relevant  sections  of the  GermanProposals of the 31st March are shown in Annex I. ELEMENTS  IN  THE  NEGOTIATION OF A SETTLEMENT TO RESOLVE  THE  SITUATION              CREATED  BY THE GERMAN INITIATIVE OF  MARCH 7.    All  that  Germany  has  offered so  far  is the reciprocal  and  provisionalarrangement for  the four months which expired on the 1st August  (points 2-8of the  German Proposals of the  31st March), and the declaration in point (9) ofthe German Proposals  of the 31st  March, that the German  Government  &quot; are willing, on the basis of complete reciprocity,  to agree with their two  Westernneighbours to any military limitation on the German Western frontier.&quot;    On the other hand,  according to our letter of the 1st April to the French and belgian Governments, we stated that, if the effort of conciliation attempted in theproposals of the 19th March should fail, His Majesty&apos;s Government     &quot;  (a) Will at once  consider, in consultation with  your Government and the           French Government,  the steps to be taken  to meet the new situation           thus created;    &quot;  (b) Will immediately  come  to  the assistance   of  your  Government,  in           accordance with the  Treaty  of Locarno, in  respect of any measures           which shall be jointly decided upon;    &quot;  (c)  Will, in return for reciprocal assurances from your  Government,  take,           in consultation with your Government, all practical measures available           to His Majesty&apos;s Government for the purpose of ensuring the security           of your country against unprovoked  aggression;    &quot;  (d) Will, for  this purpose, establish or continue the contact between the           General  Staffs of our two countries contemplated in paragraph III (2)           of the said arrangement.&quot;  .Since then we have maintained, and the French and Belgian Governments have accepted,  the  view  that, although  the  German Government  have rejected theproposals of the  19th March  for resolving the situation created by Germany&apos;s.reoccupation of the Rhineland, nevertheless, the effort of conciliation should not beconsidered to have failed in view of the  attempt now being made to call  together the Five-Power Conference.    As regards the meaning of the  words &quot;through the  collaboration of aitconcerned,&quot; which appear  in  the communique  of the  23rd  July, in  connectionwith the proposal to negotiate a new agreement to resolve the situation created bythe German  initiative of the  7th March, it has been  explained to the German       [13707-4]                                                 B  2
 Charge d&apos;Affaires in. London that this merely means that it is our desire that the new agreement should be negotiated by the five Powers together and not by the three,  and that there was no intention of inviting more  than the five Powers to carry through this particular piece of work.                         QUESTIONS FOR DECISION.     In order  that the Foreign Office may make the necessary preparations for the forthcoming conference, it will be necessary for us to be clear with regard to the general line  of  policy which we wish to  adopt  in respect of  the  various questions which are  bound to arise.  The more important of these questions are enumerated below.   From the preliminary explanatory comments  attached  to each of these questions it will be seen that at least eight, viz.,  questions 4,  5, 6,. 7, 9,  10,  11  and  12, require examination by  the  Committee of  Imperial Defence, and  steps  are  being taken to refer these points to the  Committee. As soon as a general line of policy has been settled, the Foreign Office will be in a  position  to take  the  initiative  with the  other  Governments  concerned,.probably by communicating  to  them,  for their consideration,  a memorandum regarding  the various questions  at issue.   It is hoped  that  in this  wayLondon may become a kind of clearing house for the purpose of these preliminary discussions, and that the other Governments concerned may agree to communicatetheir views to us in the first instance for co-ordination and circulation.    It seems as yet premature to endeavour to make any arrangements regarding the time and place of the proposed conference. These matters of detail will have to be left until the preparatory discussions through the. diplomatic channel havereached an advanced stage.    The following are the fundamental questions which now  seem  to call forconsideration : (1) Should the new  agreement simply reproduce the old  Locarno Treaty, with       the omission of all reference to the Demilitarised Zone?Comments.     To judge by the  language of the German proposals of the 31st March, it looksas though Germany  wishes to reproduce the framework of the  Locarno Treaty(i.e., non-aggression pact between Germany and France and Belgium, guaranteed by Great Britain and Italy), but it is equally probable that she will be opposed inthe new agreement  to the machinery provided for  in  the old  Locarno Treaty(i.e., the role of the League Council in deciding aggression).  She may even objectto the renewal of the arbitration treaties with France and Belgium,  at any ratein their present form, since they provide for the use of  the Permanent Court ofInternational Justice.  We, on the other hand, would be  in favour of altering the framework of the old  agreement (as shown in the  comments  on the  ensuingquestions), and would prefer to preserve its machinery both as regards the Councilof the League and  the arbitration conventions (though it would not  seem essential for us to insist on the use of the Permanent Court of International Justice if someother suitable tribunal were suggested as an alternative).(2) What machinery  should  the new  agreement  contain  for  bringing the       guarantees  into  operation?   Should the League be  employed for this       purpose in the same way as in the old Locarno Treaty ?Comments.     In the new agreement there must clearly be some authority to  decide if andwhen  an act of unprovoked aggression  has been  committed.   To judge  fromGermany&apos;s proposals of the 31st March, this authority is  to be the new  inter-national court of  arbitration mentioned  below, under Question  (3),  and would.thus replace  the League Council which fulfils  this role under  the old locarno treaty. It is a moot question whether it would be possible for us to agree to theLeague Council being deposed in this fashion. In any case, the proposal to create a new court will again raise the question put in paragraph 11 of our Questionnaire(Annex TT).
 (3) Should the new agreement contain provisions for arbitration and conciliation       as does the old Locarno Treaty? Comments.     The old Locarno Treaty contained arbitration conventions between Germany and (1) Belgium, (2) France, (3) Poland,  (4) Czechoslovakia.  It is probable that Germany would refuse to discuss at the Five-Power Conference  the renewal of (3) and (4), since this would at once bring Czechoslovakia and Poland into the Conference.  On the other hand, France will probably insist on such a renewal. The best line might be to endeavour to secure our aims through the acceptance of Herr Hitler&apos;s  offer to  conclude  agreements  by direct negotiation  with  all Germany&apos;s neighbours, instead of as part of the Western Pact.   As regards  (1) and (2), Germany will probably agree to renewal on condition, to quote the German proposals of the 31st March, that provision is made  for the &quot; constitution of an international court of arbitration which  shall have competence in respect of the observance of the various agreements concluded.&quot; (4) Do we wish in the new agreement to be guaranteed ourselves instead of being      merely a  guarantor ?  If so, against  whom and by whom are  we to  be      guaranteed? Comments.    We presumably wish in the new agreement to be guaranteed  by France and possibly Belgium (and this would,  for the  sake of  equality,  involve equally  a guarantee by Germany).  But the fact of our being a guaranteed  Power as well as a guarantor would involve considerable modification in the scheme of the oldLocarno Treaty.   Among other things, if we were  to enjoy the  advantages  of guarantees, we should probably be required to conclude non-aggression pacts and arbitration treaties with France, Belgium and Germany.    The C.I.D. are being asked to  consider the implications of our acceptanceof a guarantee from France, Belgium and Germany.(5) Should the Irish Free State participate in the new agreement ?Comments.    The position  of the Irish Free  State  would  appear to  require  special consideration.  The  Dominions are not parties to Locarno,  but  in view of the growing importance  of military aviation the Irish Free State, on account of itsgeographical  position,  may  be concerned  in  the  new  Western  Pact.  Thecounsellor of the French Embassy in London has, in fact, informed the ForeignOffice that the Permanent Head of the Irish Free State Department for external affairs has recently  raised with the French Minister in Dublin  the question ofthe Free State&apos;s collaboration in any new mutual guarantee treaty .for western europe.    This question  is  being referred to the C.I.D.:(6)  Is Italy to be  guaranteed ?  If so, against whom and by whom ?Comments.    Under the old Locarno Treaty we and Italy were the two guarantor Powers.If now we become a guaranteed Power it would be difficult to refuse  the sameadvantage to Italy if she asked for it.  But it may be taken for granted that inno circumstances would we or Belgium be prepared to guarantee Italy, so thatin effect  Italy would only  be guaranteed by France against Germany, and  by     There is also the case of a flagrant violation to be considered.  We would havepresumably  to resist any attempt by Germany to argue that, in such a case, noassistance could be given to the victim of aggression until the new &apos;&apos; international court of arbitration &apos;&apos; had given its verdict.
Germany against France.  Whether France would undertake this obligation with-out pur co-operation is a doubtful point.  The whole of this question is beingreferred to the C.I.D. (7) Should  Belgium be relieved of giving any  guarantee and her commitments       limited to an undertaking to defend her own territory \ Comments.     Recent unofficial hints show that in certain quarters in Belgium there is a desire that Belgium should be relieved of the duty  of  guarantor in any new agreement.   This feeling is prevalent in Flemish circles, and it is probably due. to the fact that as long as Belgium guarantees France, the French General Staff are inclined to make plans whereby in Flemish eyes the Belgian Army is relegated to the position of fighting with the French Army in defence of French territory rather than in defence of Belgian territory.  Incidentally, the old Franco-Belgian Military Agreement was terminated some months ago because it had become for these reasons unpopular in Belgium, and at present there exists only an exchange: of notes providing for a restricted form of staff  conversations.     It would have to be clearly understood  that Belgium, if she only  undertook to defend her own territory, would not be at liberty tacitly to allow foreign aircraft to cross her  territory to attack a third Power.     From our point of view this question is one on which the advice of  the C.I.D. is being sought in the first instance. (8)  Are the non-aggression provisions to be so  framed (as Locarno was) as to.       reserve the right of any party to come to the assistance of a non-party which       has been attacked by another party ? Comments.     It would seem essential  that the new agreement  should be  so worded.   We- must therefore be careful to resist  any attempt  by Germany to interpret our guarantee as imposing upon  us an obligation to use force against France in the. event of her implementing her obligations to come to the assistance of her Eastern allies against Germany.  Our guarantee did not  have this effect in the  old agree- ment, and it would not seem desirable that it should have it in the new agreement..     Germany might argue  that  in  the  new  agreement the  non-aggression provisions   should  be  modified  on  the  ground  that the   situation  had been  entirely  altered  by  the  conclusion  of  the  Franco-Soviet Pact.   In fact,  Germany might  take the following  line :  Although ready to  acquiesce- in  the continuance  of  the Franco-Czech  and  Franco-Polish  Agreements, since  these  were  already  in  existence  when  the  Locarno  Treaty  was concluded, she must insist, before concluding a new Western Mutual Assistance. Pact, that France shall modify her recent Pact with Russia, since in its present form it has completely altered the balance of power to Germany&apos;s detriment. Germany might,  for instance, demand that the provision should be eliminated whereby  France has to come to Russia&apos;s assistance  in the  case of a flagrant violation without waiting for any decision by the League Council or  any other body. Her argument in such a case might be that, so long as there was a possibility of such an attack  by France  on Germany, Germany might have,  in self-defence, to take  the initiative,  and that  Germany could  not  agree that  in   such circumstances the British guarantee under the new Western Pact should operate in France&apos;s  favour.    As regards our position, it would clearly be useless to expect the French, and more  especially the present Government of  France,  to modify and still less to give up their pact with Russia.  It would seem equally useless to try to persuade the Germans to adhere to the Franco-Soviet Pact,  for,  although  that  pact is open to their adherence, neither the German nor the  Polish Governments could reasonably be  expected to welcome the idea that  Russian troops should march. across their territories to Germany&apos;s aid to repulse  French aggression.   If,therefore, we  have to rule out (1)  the possibility of  securing the cancellationor modification  of  the  pact,  and  (2) the possibility  of  turning it   intoa mutual assistance pact  for Eastern  Europe  (with German  participation),
 the  question  remains  whether  the  present Franco-Soviet  Pact  can in  any way  be  clarified  to  meet  any  reasonable  objections  which  the  German Government may put forward, more particularly with regard to the case where France and Russia claim the power to act without a League decision.  The real safeguard in such cases is, of course, to be found in the fact that if France were to attack Germany in what the other parties to the Western Pact considered to be unjustifiable circumstances, the latter would have to intervene against France. This fact might possibly be reinforced in some way during the negotiations. (9) Do we wish to make special provision in the new agreement for air attack? Comments.     So long as the Locarno Treaty existed it was quite reasonable to supplement it by a special air pact providing for mutual guarantees against air attack.  But now that a new agreement is to be made, it is natural that provisions for dealingwith air  attack should be embodied in this new agreement.   The old Locarno Treaty provided for immediate assistance (without waiting for a finding by the Council) in  a case of unprovoked aggression where by reason of the crossing of the  frontier, or  the  outbreak of hostilities, immediate  action  was necessary. It would seem that all that is necessary is that in the new agreement this definition should be extended so as to cover  the case  of attack by air, especially by bombing. The C.I.D. are being asked to consider this point. (10) Do  we wish to make special provision in  the new  agreement  for  air       limitation ? Comments.     The proposed air pact was always linked up with the proposal for an agree- ment for  air limitation.   It will  have  to  be considered, in the first place by the C.I.D., whether we ought to continue in the forthcoming negotiations to press for the latter.   If we do it will at once raise,the problem of the Russian air force and bring us back to the question put to the Germans in paragraph 9 of  our questionnaire (Annex II). (11) In view of the fact that our  present liberty to hold Staff conversations with       France   and Belgium,  without  any  corresponding  conversations  with       Germany, derives from Germany&apos;s  repudiation of Locarno, and will  not       necessarily  continue  if Locarno  is replaced  by a  fresh agreement with       Germany, do We wish in the new agreement to provide for Staff conversa-       tions with France and Belgium ? Comments.     The views of the C.I.D. are being obtained.as to the value they attach to the continuance of the Staff conversations initiated last March, and as to whether they would like them to be repeated and their scope extended.   (In this connexion the question has been raised as to whether they might not be limited to Belgium alone see Annex III).  The German Government will probably try  and stipulatefor no  Staff conversations of any kind under the new agreement.  In  any case theywill certainly insist that if there are to be any such conversations they shall take place between all  the signatories.  The  C.I.D. are being asked to advise how far  such  a  stipulation  would  in practice render Staff conversations between ourselves and the French and Belgians valueless. (12) Should Holland be asked to accede to the new agreement ?  If so, should she       assume all the obligations of the agreement or only certain obligations ? Comments.     There has been a good deal of discussion on this subject by the C.I.D. withspecial reference to the proposed Air Pact.  The  latest views of the Chiefs ofStaff  are  that  the advantages  and   disadvantages  of  the  inclusion  of holland   in  an  Air  Pact  would be   about  even,  and  that,   if  Hollandshould desire to be included in a  future treaty, her wish should not be opposed.Nevertheless, the Chiefs of Staff have pointed out that, as Holland in her present
undefended condition is merely a temptation, we should be unwise to encourageher  to become a member of an air convention unless she undertakes to take allpossible measures for her own defence.  (There is now evidence that she is takingcertain measures to this end.)     The time has  now come when we will have definitely to make up our mindswhether or  not we want Holland to accede  to  the  proposed  new  WesternPact of  Mutual  Assistance, and,  if we  do,  how  best  she  ought  to be approached.  As regards the part she might play, it is probable that for much thesame reasons as Belgium she would prefer not to give any guarantee beyond thatof undertaking to  defend her own territory.   The C.I.D. are being asked whetherit would  be  worth while our giving her a  guarantee  if this  is  all we got in exhange.  (As in the case  of  Belgium it  would have to be understood  thatHolland was not at liberty to acquiesce in the flight of foreign  aircraft over her territory to attack a third Power.)(13) In guaranteeing the integrity&apos;of Belgium  are we prepared in all circum-       stances to guarantee her against all attempts by Germany to recover Eupen       and Malmedy?   If not, should we, before guaranteeing  Belgium, require       from Germany  a specific assurance that for the duration  of the  treaty       she will not raise the  question of Eupen and Malmedy?Comments.     The German  Government have recently, as  shown in Annex  IV,  made it-clear to the Belgian Government that &apos;&apos; there could be no question of the GermanGovernment considering Eupen and Malmedy as permanently settled.&quot;   In thesecircumstances,  and in  view of the likelihood that the  Germans will  maintaintroops and construct fortifications in the Rhineland opposite the  Belgian frontier,.the danger of  a German attempt to  recover those provinces will  obviously be greater in future  than it was when the Locarno Treaty was negotiated.   Themain danger, so far as this country is  concerned, is that Germany might attempta surprise occupation of Eupen and Malmedy with the assistance of  the Germaninhabitants of  that area, at  the  same time making it  clear  that  there was no intention to threaten Belgian  independence or integrity as existing before 1914.Such a  coup would bring the British guarantee into play in respect of territory which does not from some points of view fall into quite the same category as therest  of Belgium.     It would seem essential that Germany should undertake  as part of the  new treaty some non-aggression obligation  in regard to the existing frontier, and thiswould imply  an undertaking that she would not use force to settle her claim toEupen and Malmedy.   It would, however,  appear undesirable  to  ask  Germanyto refrain from raising her claim by peaceful methods, for such a request mightmeet  with a  German refusal,  and this refusal might prejudice the chances ofobtaining a new European settlement on what is, to some extent,  a minor point.     It would, be easier to expect Germany not to use force to settle her claim if itwere  possible to strengthen the machinery  for  the  peaceful revision  of  inter-national disputes, i.e., if Article 19 of  the Covenant could be made to function.(14)  Should  the provisions for  &quot; resolving through the  collaboration of all.      concerned the situation created by  the  German initiative  of  the  7th      March &quot; form part of the new agreement for mutual assistance?Comments.    Germany is almost certain to refuse to allow any such provisions to figure inthe Five-Power Agreement.  In view of the unlikelihood of any  agreement being reached on this subject, it will  probably be better to keep the  two subjectsseparate; but, in that case, the question will arise as to the relationship betweennegotiations for resolving the  situation created by the German  initiative of the-7th March, and the  negotiations for  the conclusion of  the new agreement for mutual  assistance.   The French  and Belgian Governments  will probably argue that they are  inter-dependent,  and may even ask that the negotiations regardingthe German initiative shall precede any negotiations for  a new Five-Power Pact.While having perhaps to agree  to the  two  negotiations being  carried  on con-currently,  we will  presumably insist that a breakdown in one negotiation shallnot affect or delay  progress in the other.
(15) If there is a  breakdown in the negotiations for &quot;resolving through the       collaboration  of all concerned  the situation  created  by  the German       initiative of  the 7th  March,&quot;  shall  we  recognise  that the effort  of       conciliation, referred to in our Letter of the 1st April, has failed, and that,       therefore, the provisions of the above Letter shall be brought into force ?Comments.    We  would presumably strongly  resist such a  view, unless and until  theconcurrent negotiations for the new agreement of mutual assistance had equallyfailed.(16) How  far ought we to support  France and  Belgium  in  trying to  obtain       concessions from Germany by way of resolving &apos;&apos; through the collaboration       of all concerned the situation created by the  German  initiative  of the       7th March ?&quot;                      -Comments.    Our view during the March conversations was that as regards the reoccupa-tion of  the  Rhineland by German  troops France  and  Belgium had receivedadequate compensation by our agreeing to Staff conversations, and by our giving them the Letter of the 1st April.  Even so, France may still  wish to stipulate that German troops shall continue to be limited in number and withdrawn fromthe actual frontier, on the lines of Germany&apos;s provisional offer.   Germany wouldcertainly not agree  to this unless  France  was prepared to give correspondingundertakings as regards  her  own troops  on her own territory.  Although itappears  unlikely that important results could be achieved through such negotia-tions regarding the number of troops near the frontier, the French government might be pressed to explore the possibilities of a settlement on these lines.    As regards the refortification  of the Rhineland, France and Belgium havenot yet received any compensation.   At the  Geneva meeting on the  10th april the idea  was that such compensation should be obtained through Germany givingsatisfactory undertakings with regard to France&apos;s allies in  the East.  This wasthe origin, in our questionnaire (Annex II), of paragraphs 6, 7, and 8 regardinggenuine  treaties, and paragraph 10&apos; regarding  the nature of the non-aggressionpacts which Germany was prepared  to conclude in  the East.  The French will certainly raise again the question of fortifications.  Germany, from what she has said,  will  refuse to  give any  one-sided undertaking in this matter and Franceobviously cannot discuss the destruction of her existing fortifications along thefrontier.   Also it  is doubtful whether, in  the place of any  limitation as tofortifications, Germany would be ready to  give France any undertakings which France would consider satisfactory regarding her Eastern allies.  Thus the task of resolving the German  initiative of the 7th March is  likely to prove  one ofthe crucial points in any negotiations, and we shall probably have  to make itclear to the French and Belgian Governments that we will not allow a  breakdownto occur on this point, and that they will have to content themselves with whateversatisfaction they can get out  of our  renewed guarantee of  French and Belgian territory and out of any further bilateral agreements which Germany may makein the East.(17) In the invitation it is  stated that, &apos;&apos; if  progress can be made under this head       (i.e.,  the conclusion  of a Western Agreement  for Mutual  Assistance and       the  resolution  of the situation created by the  German  initiative  of  the       7th March), other matters will naturally come under discussion ....  in       such a manner as to facilitate  .... the settlement of those problems the       solution of  which  is essential to the peace of  Europe.&quot;  If  such an       extension occurs in the field of  discussion, what do we propose to work for       in the further negotiations contemplated ?Comments.    This question is likely to  be put  to us  at an early  stage by both France andGermany, and for diametrically opposed reasons.  Germany will doubtless urge that a general settlement of Europe will  be fully attained if the Conferenceconcludes a Western Pact for  Mutual Assistance.  Germany may be expected to resist any attempt by France and ourselves to interfere in any  further bilateral       [13707-4]                      .                              c
arrangements which she may be prepared to make with her Eastern neighbours,and, above all, Germany may be expected to refuse flatly to conclude any arrange-ment- at all with Russia.  France, on the other hand, may be expected to urge that,unless  Germany gives guarantees satisfactory to France as regards not only herEastern neighbours, but also and particularly as regards Russia, there can be no general settlement, and that thus the &quot;effort of conciliation&quot; will have failed,thereby bringing the terms of the Letter of the 1st April into force.     This conflict of policy is likely  to  prove another crucial  point  in thenegotiations and may well come to a head at a very early stage, that is to say,before &apos;&apos; progress has  been made &apos;&apos; with regard to the Western Pact  and thesettlement of the situation created by the  German initiative  of the 7th  March.Generally speaking, it may be  said that a Western Pact,  unaccompanied by anygeneral settlement, would be merely a poultice applied to one of the few parts ofEurope which at present are not inflamed.  As such, a  Western  agreement in isolation might  be actually dangerous, since it would create in the West a  falsesense of security, while giving to Russia and  to the lesser Powers of the  Eastand Centre the  feeling that they had been abandoned to their  fate.   In thesecircumstances it ought  presumably to be our policy from the outset to make itclear that we decline to disinterest ourselves in the East, and that we intend to insist on the need for a general settlement, while at the same time urging Francenot  to wreck  a  Western  agreement,   and indeed  a general  settlement,  by maintaining impossible demands in the  East.(18) Although  our invitation does  not mention Germany&apos;s return to the League,       ought it to be raised during the diplomatic consultations in preparation       for the Conference %Comments.    The course  of negotiations will probably be such that Germany&apos;s relationswith the League will inevitably have to  be taken into account.  It is important to note that the negotiations with Germany regarding the proposed Western Pactare closely interlocked with the discussions regarding the reform of the League,and more  especially  with the possibility  of making some  use  hereafter  ofarticle  19, so as to enable treaties to be revised by peaceful  means. Germany may reasonably argue that before she can implement her offer to return to the Leagueshe must know what League she is expected to return to.   In these circumstances it might be worth while to explore the ground in order to discover  whether  it isfeasible that Germany should be invited to take part in any committee whichmay be set up in Geneva  to consider the reform of the League,  so as to  depriveher of  the excuse that she was being expected  to return to a ready-made  league in the reform of  which she had no voice or say.                               CONCLUSIONS.    In the  light of the  above  review of the  situation, the following tentativeconclusions  are  submitted.  They are not intended  to represent in any  way adefinite policy, but merely to give general indications of the direction along whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government should proceed during the exchange of views which itis intended  to carry on through the diplomatic channel in preparation  for theConference itself.New Western Pact.    A.  While not excluding  altogether the possibility of accepting Germany&apos;proposed new &quot;  international court of arbitration,&quot; we should prefer to  use theLeague Council, as in the Locarno Treaty,  to decide if and when an aggressionhas taken place.   (Questions 1 and 2 above.)    B.  As regards the Locarno Treaties  of  Arbitration, we should  press fortheir renewal in  the same  form as in the Locarno Treaty;  subject if necessary  toprovision being made for Germany&apos;s new &quot; international  court of arbitration.&quot;If Germany objects to the treaties with Poland and Czechoslovakia forming partof the  Western Pact, we should try to secure our purpose by making use of theGerman  offer to  conclude  bilateral agreements by  direct  negotiation  with.Germany&apos;s neighbours.  (Questions  1 and 3  above.)
     C.   We should want in the new treaty  to  be  both a guaranteed  and  aguarantor Power.  But we should not wish either  to guarantee or be guaranteed by Italy.  (Questions 4 and 6 above.)     D.   Subject to the views of the C.I.D., we should be  prepared to consider  a request by Belgium that she should not be a guarantor Power, but should  merelygive an undertaking to defend her own  territory.   (Question 7 above.)     E.   We should resist any attempt by Germany to interpret our guarantee ascompelling us to use  force against France if she implemented her obligation tocome to the assistance of her Eastern Allies.  Similarly, we should give Germanyno encouragement if she asks that France should cancel or modify her treaty withRussia.   On  the other hand, the implications of  this treaty might  be furtherclarified so as to reassure Germany. (Question 8 above.)     F.   Subject to the views of the C.I.D., special provision should be made inthe new treaty for attack  by air.   (Question 9 above.)     G.   Subject to the views of the C.I.D., we should explore  the possibility ofan agreement  for air limitation, bearing in mind, however, that the strength ofthe Russian air force is a factor which complicates the problem of securing an air limitation agreement between the Western  European  Powers.  (Question 10above.)     H.   Subject to the views of the C.I.D., it is contemplated that Staff conversa-tions should be  provided  for as part of the agreement, even though  such con-versations would have to take place with Germany also.   (Question 11 above.)     I.   Subject to  the views of the C.I.D., we should be ready to consider the accession of Holland to the new  Western Pact.   If agreed to, the  method of approaching her should in due course be discussed with the other Governmentsconcerned.   (Question 12  above.)Negotiations to resolve the Situation  created by the  German Initiative of         March  7.     J.    These   negotiations might,   if  the  French  insist,   be carried  onconcurrently with  those for the  new  Western Pact,  but a breakdown  in onenegotiation ought not to affect or delay progress in the other.  (Question 14  above.)     K    Unless and until the negotiations for a new Western Pact have failedwe  should resist the  view that a  breakdown in the negotiations regarding thesituation created by the German initiative  of  the 7th March must represent  a failure  of the  &quot; effort of conciliation &quot;  mentioned  in our letter of the 1st  April,and  thus bring the provisions of the above letter into force.  (Question 15  above.)     L.   If Germany refuses to make any concessions by way of resolving thesituation created by  the German  initiative of the 7th March,  we should urgeFrance  and Belgium  to content themselves with whatever satisfaction they can get out  of our renewed guarantee of French and Belgian territory and  out  of anyfurther bilateral agreements which Germany may make in the East.  (Question 16above.)General Settlement.     M.   We should decline to disinterest ourselves from the East and Centre ofEurope and continue  to insist on the need for a general settlement, while urgingFrance not to wreck a Western settlement by maintaining  impossible demands inthe East and Centre.   (Question 17 above.)Germany&apos;s Return to the League.     N.   Since the question of Germany&apos;s relations with the League must reacton the   course of the negotiations, we  ought to consider whether it would be feasible for Germany to be invited to take part in any committee which may beset up in Geneva to consider the reform  of the League.

Despatch from Mr. Eden to Sir E. Phipps (Berlin), No. 541 of May 6, 1936.Sir,    YOUR Excellency  will be aware that His  Majesty&apos;s  Government in theUnited Kingdom have for some time past had under the  most careful considera-tion  the memoranda communicated to me by  the late Herr von Hoesch on the7th March, 1936, and  by  Herr von Ribbentrop on the 24th March and the1st April,  1936, respecting the reoccupation  of the  demilitarised  zone and thepeace proposals of the German Government.    2.  Such consideration was naturally indispensable in view of the importance which, as your Excellency  is  aware, His Majesty&apos;s Government attach to theestablishment in Europe of a real and lasting peace  based on the recognition ofthe equality of rights and independence of every State, together with respect by every State for  the engagements entered into  by it.  It is the desire of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to make every effort within their  power to  co-operate inthe promotion of the objective  described by the German  Government  in thememorandum of  the  31st March,  as  &quot; the great work  of  securing European peace &apos;&apos;;  and it is accordingly with this aim in view and in order to open the wayto fruitful negotiation  that T address to you this  despatch  and  request  yourExcellency to seek an interview with the German Chancellor.  You should prefaceyour remarks by a statement to this effect.    3.  Certain of the German Government&apos;s proposals deal, as your Excellencyis aware,  with  temporary arrangements  in the demilitarised  zone  pending thecompletion of the first stage of the general negotiations for the peace of europe which were proposed by the German Government.  On these temporary arrange-ments it is not my purpose to comment in the present  despatch,  though  yourExcellency knows that His Majesty&apos;s  Government regret that  the GermanGovernment have not been able to make a more substantial contribution towardsthe re-establishment of the confidence which is such an essential preliminary to the wide negotiations which they both have in view.
                                                                       Ill    4.  In the course of my interview with Herr von Ribbentrop on the 2nd April,I informed his Excellency that His Majesty&apos;s Government regard the proposalsfor the future in the German memorandum of  the 31st March (that communicatedto me on the 1st April)  as most important and as deserving of  careful study.This  study is now at  an advanced stage; but His Majesty&apos;s Government find difficulty in carrying it further without discussing more closely with the GermanGovernment (as foreshadowed in the Geneva communique of the 10th April)  acertain  number of points in the three memoranda, particularly in those of the24th  and 31st March.    His Majesty&apos;s Government feel sure that the GermanGovernment will share their view that the greatest possible precision is desirablebefore general negotiations can open, in order that in the  future no  misunder-standings may cloud the confident co-operation of the Powers of Europe, which itis the most earnest hope of His Majesty&apos;s Government, as they are sure also of theGerman Government, that the proposed negotiations may advance.    5.  There are a number of passages in the German memoranda of the 24thand 31st March  which leave  His Majesty&apos;s Government in some  doubt  as tothe conception held by the German Government of the basis upon which  the future settlement should be founded.    6  The  first point on which it is desirable to be clear is whether Germanyregards  herself  as  now  in  a  position  to conclude  &quot; genuine  treaties.&quot;There are passages in  the second sub-paragraph of paragraph 1 of the german governments memorandum of the 24th March, 1936, which seem to suggest thatit is the view of the German Government that by their action in the Rhinelandthey  have established this position.  On the other hand, there are passages inparagraph 2  of the memorandum of the 24th March which might be capable of adifferent interpretation,  which,  however, His Majesty&apos;s Government would not themselves wish to draw.  It is, of  course, clear that negotiations for a treaty would be useless if one of the parties hereafter felt free to deny its obligation onthe ground that  that  party was not at  the  time  in a  condition to conclude  a binding treaty, and His  Majesty&apos;s Government will welcome a clear declarationfrom the German Government to remove any uncertainty on this point.    7.  If the  argument set  out in paragraph 6  of the  German Govern-ment&apos;s  memorandum of the 31st March is intended to be of  general application,it might give rise to doubt as to the view which the German  Government take ofthe continued maintenance in  force of the remaining operative  clauses of theTreaty  of Versailles, and, indeed, of any agreement which might be said to havehad its origin in the  provisions of  the  Treaty of Versailles.   His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment  do not wish to enter into controversy as to the historical interpreta-tion of  events set forth in that paragraph, and consequently they do not proposeto state their views here.  But they must, of course, make it clear that they areunable  to  accept  the  views  put forward by the German  Government  in the paragraph in question.     8.  There is in paragraph 4 of the memorandum of the 31st March a furthercause for  uncertainty.  It is  stated in  that paragraph that  &quot; the GermanGovernment  have received from the German People (&apos; Volk &apos;) a solemn generalmandate to represent the Reich and the German Nation (&apos; Nation &apos;) to carry out apolicy  which  implies  the  preservation  under  all  circumstances  of  their freedom, their independence and at the  same time their  equality of status.&quot;A distinction is  apparently drawn between the Reich and the German Nation.The  question is really whether Germany now considers that a point has  beenreached at which she can signify that she recognises and intends to respect theexisting territorial and political status of Europe,  except in  so far as this mightbe subsequently modified by free negotiation and agreement.     9.  I turn now to other matters.  Sub-paragraph  13 of paragraph 22 of thememorandum of the 31st  March refers to &quot; the conclusion of an Air Pact to supplement and reinforce  these (Western European) security agreements.&quot;   Inthe spring of 1935 the German Government were understood to hold that the negotiation of an Air Pact should not be complicated by an attempt to accompanyit by an agreement for  the  limitation of air forces.   Since  then  a  somewhatcontradictory position seems to have arisen.  In the Reichstag on the  21st May,1935, Herr Hitler mentioned the possibility  of an agreement for air  limitation on the basis of parity between the great Western Powers, provided, so  we under-stood, that the development of the Soviet Air Force was not such that revisionwould be necessary. The Chancellors speech of the 21st May, 1935,  was made
after the signature of the Franco-Soviet  Treaty;  yet  in December 1935  he informed your Excellency that that Treaty  had made air limitation impossible.A decision  not  to  attempt  to accompany  a Western  Air Pact by a regionalagreement for limitation of air strengths would be very  much regretted  by His.Majesty&apos;s Government;  and  the  statement in paragraph 2  of the Germanmemorandum that the German Government are impressed by the  results achieved in the  limited  sphere  of  the recent  agreement  respecting naval  armamentsencourages them to hope that the German Government will be able to fall in withtheir views on this point.     10.  His Majesty&apos;s Government are gratified to see that, in sub-paragraphs 10and  14 of paragraph 22 of the memorandum  of the 31st March,  the GermanGovernment propose the conclusion of non-aggression  pacts between Germany,on the  one  hand, and  France, Belgium and  possibly Holland on the  other.They note that the  German Government are willing that these  pacts should be accompanied by  treaties of guarantee.  The  exact form which these instrumentswill  assume  must be a matter for detailed negotiation.     His Majesty&apos;s  Government also note the proposal in sub-paragraph 17 ofparagraph  22 for non-aggression  pacts between Germany and the  States  on germany&apos;s south-eastern and north-eastern frontiers.  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould venture to recall the general outline of such pacts given to  Sir John Simonby Baron von Neurath in Berlin on the 26th March, 1935.  They would be glad toknow whether the German Government suggest that these pacts should followgenerally that outline, and  whether they agree that these pacts also may  be guaranteed by mutual assistance arrangements.     The announcement which the German Government have been able to make ofGermany&apos;s  readiness to re-enter the League of Nations permits His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to assume that no  difficulty will arise  as regards the conformity ofthe proposed non-aggression pacts with the obligations of members of the Leagueof Nations,  and that the operation  of these pacts will  take place  within the framework of the Covenant.     There are two further points to which attention should be drawn. The firstconcerns the meaning of the  words &quot; the States on  Germany&apos;s south-eastern and north-eastern frontiers.&quot;  His Majesty&apos;s Government  cannot but feel that thegeneral settlement would be  very greatly facilitated if  the  German Governmentcould see their way to interpret these words so as to cover at least also the soviet union, Latvia and Estonia, as well as the States actually contiguous to Germany.In this connexion His Majesty&apos;s Government would venture to recall that in their memorandum of  the 26th March,  1935, the German Government stated their readiness to conclude pacts of  non-aggression with  &quot; the Powers interested  in east European questions.&quot;     The second  is  that of non-interference in  the  affairs of other States,  as distinct from non-aggression against them.  His Majesty&apos;s Government  recallwith satisfaction the Chancellors statement in the Reichstag on the 21st May,1935, that the German Government were &quot;ready at any  time  to agree  to aninternational arrangement which will effectively prevent and render impossibleall attempts to interfere from outside in the affairs of other States.&quot;     11.  In  sub-paragraph  19 of  paragraph 22  &quot; Germany proposes  theconstitution  of an international court of arbitration which shall have competence inrespect  of the observance of the various agreements concluded.&quot;.  Presumably,.these agreements are those mentioned in sub-paragraphs 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and17 of paragraph 22. It would  be desirable to know generally the functions and constitution  of the proposed  court and the relation which the former would bearto the functions  of the Council of the League of Nations and of the PermanentCourt of International Justice.     In  view of  the announcement  of  Germany&apos;s  willingness  to return  to theLeague of Nations, the German Government will, no doubt, be willing to indicate their future attitude towards  the Permanent  Court of  International  Justice(particularly in  relation  to the Optional  Clause)  and  towards  the  variousprovisions for arbitration, conciliation or judicial settlement contained in treatiesto which Germany is a party.     12.  When  your Excellency sees the Chancellor,  I  request that you will discuss with him the points  raised in this despatch and leave with him a copy!Your Excellency should explain that these are not exhaustive.   There are othermatters which will  have to be raised at a later date; and before the return of
Germany to the League of Nations comes under discussion, the German Govern-rnent will no doubt think it desirable to give some definition of the phrase &quot; the separation of the Covenant of the League of Nations from its basis in the Treatyof Versailles setting,&quot; which occurs in sub-paragraph 18 of paragraph 22.  Atthe moment  His Majesty&apos;s  Government prefer only to deal with  points  theelucidation of which is essential prior to the opening of the general negotiations with, as stated above, they are sincerely desirous of promoting.                                                  I am,  &amp;c.                                                      ANTHONY EDEN.ANNEX III  TO APPENDIX.       Letter from Mr. Eden to the Prime Minister, dated June 6, 1936.My dear Prime Minister,     YOU may remember that when I saw van Zeeland  recently in Geneva hesuggested  that it  would  be to the  interests  of our two countries if staff conversations could take place between Belgium  and ourselves apart from  therecent Anglo-French-Belgian Conversations in London. He suggested that such conversations  could be held by the  Service Attaches quite quietly, and that  thekind of subjects for discussion would be air co-operation, landing grounds, types of aircraft, strategic considerations concerning the portions of the front to beheld, and the defences of the Belgian coast.     To appreciate  this proposal, it is necessary to recall  briefly what passed atthe recent  Three-Power Staff Conversations.  The military conversations dealtprimarily with the arrangements for getting  a British expeditionary  force intoFrance, but in no way with the part of the line to be held.  The naval conversa-tions  were really  only  concerned with  movements  of ships,  and the  airconversations  with the suitability  of  various aerodromes for  the operation of squadrons.     There  was, further, in  the course of these conversations  an importantstatement made by the senior French Military Officer &quot; that France was perfectly well able to look after her own frontier and would prefer that any aid that mightbe given by Great Britain should be sent to Belgium &apos;&apos;; further, we learned thatthe Belgian coast was undefended.     I  think that van Zeeland&apos;s recent remarks to  me are the logical sequence qfwhat passed at the Three-Power Conversations, and particularly of  the remarksof the French Military Representative.  My understanding is that what passed at the Three-Power Conversations could in large part also equally well have passed had we had conversations with Germany, and van Zeeland himself pointedthis out to me.  But van Zeeland now evidently wants to go further than this, and discuss with us alone, as quietly as may be, the  question of plans.  This, of course,would rule out corresponding conversations with Germany.     I  told van Zeeland at the time that, while his suggestion  would be very carefully considered over here,  I felt doubtful  if the present was an appropriate moment for its adoption.  We were trying hard to start negotiations which would lead to some agreement with Germany, and I feared that any intimation that  wewere engaging in additional conversations with Belgium  would be seized upon by the German Government as a pretext for  returning an unfavourable reply.Indeed, we have recently received a hint somewhat  to this effect from the german military Attache here in connexion with the question of the fortifications of the rhineland.  I  still feel that it would be a blunder on our part to enter uponfurther conversations whilst our negotiations with Germany are hanging in thebalance; we must  not give  her the excuse which we believe she may be looking for to  break off the negotiations.    On the other hand,  I am impressed by the  remark of the French military representative in London, which I have quoted  above, and I  do think  that ifwe have to go further in conversations and we may very well have to do  so if,as I fear is only too probable,  the German negotiations break down there is alot  to  be said  for  conversations between us  and  Belgium alone.  The  Frenchevidently are quite prepared for that, and if we had to have further conversations
there are strong arguments for an agreement with Belgium only from the pointof view of our public opinion.   Thus, the British public is prepared to defendBelgium and understands that it might be  asked to defend her.  It could notbe said of Belgium as of France that she would use our commitment to prosecutea-forward policy in some other part of Europe.  We could not in a military agreement with Belgium undertake engagements  which would affect &quot;the  distri-bution of  our  forces in other theatres, because it could be argued that we  haveto defend Belgium anyhow on account of our vital interest.  On the other hand,by any military agreement with France it might  be said that  we might becomepolitically committed as we became to some  extent before the war by assigningto the French one theatre for defence and by ourselves engaging to defend anothertheatre.  Lastly, the Germans would find it much more  difficult to object  to aBritish military agreement with Belgium, and its existence would not necessitate a corresponding agreement with Germany.    If you agree with the foregoing views,  I think that it would be useful toarrange for an early  preliminary examination of this question so that,  in theevent of the German  negotiations finally breaking  down, or  even  coming  to acomplete standstill, we should be in a  position to take a decision on van Zeeland&apos;suggestion.  If you agree with these ideas, I  would be very grateful if you would speak to Inskip on the subject and perhaps give him a copy of this  letter.                                                 Yours ever,                                                     ANTHONY EDEN.ANNEX IV TO APPENDIX.    Despatch from Sir E. Phipps (Berlin) to Sir Samuel Hoare, No. 1266 of                             December 4, 1935.Sir,,             ,    WITH reference to  my despatch No. 1080 of the 25th October last,  I havethe honour to acquaint you that the Belgian Ambassador in Paris came to Berlinfor the day on the 2nd December and paid me a short visit.    2.  Count Kerchove  said (what he had not told me before) that he had,  athis parting interview with the  Chancellor,  described  in my  despatch under reference, suggested the advisability of some public statement being made to theeffect that Germany had no territorial claims upon Belgium and that the questionof Eupen and Malmedy might be considered to be definitely settled.  The BelgianGovernment would for their part declare that they warmly welcomed this recogni-tion of the status quo and were determined to live on the  best of terms withGermany.  Herr Hitler had declared  that he could not undertake to make anysuch statement, for although a plebiscite had been taken over Eupen-Malmedy, he did not regard it as a satisfactory solution of the matter.  However, this was anaffair which concerned only some 40,000  German-speaking persons, and he was quite ready not to pay any undue attention to it for the present (in other  words,to leave it in cold storage).    3.  Count Kerchove  told me that the German Ministry for Foreign affairs were so anxious  that there should be no misunderstanding in this  matter thatthey instructed the German Charge d&apos; Affaires at Brussels to make it clear to theBelgian Government  that there could be no question of the German  Governmentconsidering Eupen and Malmedy as being permanently settled.    4.  Count Kerchove brought with him to call upon us Vicomte Davignon, thepresent Belgian Minister  at Warsaw, who is to  succeed him here, and VicomtesseDavignon.    5.  I am sending a copy of this despatch  to His  Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at brussels.                                                    I have, &amp;t.                                                       , ERIC PHIPPS.
