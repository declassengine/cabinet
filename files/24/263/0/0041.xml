MEMORANDUM.    THE Cabinet, at their meeting on the 23rd June, 1936, agreed          &apos;&apos; That the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence should  invite the    Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee to consider  and report on  the  proposals in    CP. 165 (36) for an Eastern Mediterranean understanding with Turkey and    Greece &quot; (Cabinet 43 (36), Conclusion 3 (c)).    2.  We instructed the Joint Planning Sub-Committee to make, in the firstinstance, a  detailed study  of the  strategical  commitments  and requirementsinvolved in  such  a  proposal, and to submit to us an appreciation showing itsadvantages  and  disadvantages.   We invited  them  also to include  in  the appreciation general considerations  affecting the  possible establishment of  anadditional naval,  military and air base in Cyprus,  since that was  relevant to thematter under consideration, although a detailed examination of this particular question is to form the subject of a separate Report.    3.  In accordance with these instructions the Joint Planning Sub-Committeehave submitted an appreciation, a copy of which is attached to this Report.  Thisappreciation sets out the pros and cons  of the proposal in a form which we thinkwill be of value as  a record.  It was, howeArer, prepared on the  assumption an understanding with Italy was not achieved, and we believe that the international situation has  developed, since the  Sub-Committee were given their terms ofreference, in such a way that that assumption need no longer be held as necessarilyvalid.    4.  Our own conclusions  on the broad question of  the desirability of  an understanding with Turkey and Greece are as follows :      (a)  From  the strategical  point of view  the first  desideratum is a secure          Mediterranean.   This involves,  as  the primary  consideration,  the          restoration  of our  former friendly relations with Italy.   No action          should be taken which is liable to prejudice this primary consideration.    (b)  Subject to. the  above primary consideration, any  step that can be taken          to  renew a  peaceful situation in the Mediterranean  will  be  an          advantage from a strategical point of view.    (c)  In particular, it is important to avoid an unfriendly Turkey or to throw          her  into  the arms of a hostile  Power.  The maintenance of friendly          relations with that country is  second in importance only to that of          friendly  relations  with  Italy.  It is  also important to avoid  an          unfriendly Greece in time of war.      [13595]                                                      s
    (d) Our present circumstances are: not M^WiS^^ifki!ili^lS^0^^ of fresh           military commitments,  since some years must elapse before we should.           be  in a position to give effect to them.  Assurances, we suggest, are           only too readily taken as pledges of support.    5.  In the unfortunate event  of the situation vis-a-vis Italy not improving,Turkey&apos;s  co-operation and support will be  of great  value,  and  certain other measures  referred to in  the Report for improving the strategical-position will receive additional importance.   Notable among these are the suggested railwaybetween Baghdad and Haifa (paragraph 28)  and the establishment of a hewnaval, military and air base at Cyprus (paragraph 30).  In the latter connectionwe consider that a more accurate description of the problem of the air defence of cyprus against a hostile  Turkey would be to say that its geographical position inrelation to the mainland would lay it open to a scale of attack similar to thatwhich might have to be  faced at Malta.  In the former case, however, counter-attacks could be delivered from  bases in Palestine as well as those on the islanditself; moreover,  the size of the island would permit a greater dispersion in theinterests of security.    6.  To summarise, therefore, we recommend that everything possible shouldbe done to maintain the most friendly relations with Turkey, but we considerthat nothing should be. done-that is liable to  alienate Italy, and that no newmilitary commitment should be entered into. This would not preclude some inter-national diplomatic arrangement between all the Mediterranean Powers with  aview to a maintenance in that region of the territorial status quo which would beall to our advantage.

[J.P. 164 and C.O.S. 500.]ANNEX.                Report by the Joint Planning Sub-Ccmmittee.  ...  V         ;&apos;          .  I.-INTRODUCTION.                       ,Terms of Reference.    IN accordance with Conclusion 3 of the 179th Meeting of the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee,: we have examined the strategical commitments and requirementsinvolved in an Eastern Mediterranean understanding with Turkey and Greece and prepared  an appreciation showing  the  advantages  and disadvantages of  theproposal..  In our appreciation we have also included general  considerations affecting the possible establishment of a naval, army and air base in Cyprus.   a detailed review of the potentialities of Cyprus will form the subject of a separate report.    2.  The proposal for  an understanding with Turkey and Greece is discussed in Paper  No.  C.O.S. 476, which deals with  the  new problems  which face HisMajesty&apos;s Government in  consequence of the  Italian conquest of Abyssinia, anddiscusses what  should be done to restore  our  prestige in the  Mediterranean and provide additional security for our communications through the Mediterranean.    3.  First consideration must therefore be given to the extent to which  theproposed understanding with  Turkey and/or Greece  would overcome the weak-nesses of  our position in  the  Mediterranean in the event of continued Italianhostility.  At the  same time it is important to weigh up the commitments andadvantages,which we should be accepting, apart from Italian hostility.Causes of change in the Mediterranean problem.    4.  The new problems which face His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Mediter-ranean have only arisen indirectly from Italy&apos;s conquest  of Abyssinia. Althoughthe consolidation of Italian power in Abyssinia is introducing a new distributionof strength  in Nqrth-East Africa, which tends to reduce the security of Egypt,our North African territories  and our communications through  the Red Sea,the main causes of our new problems are Italy&apos;s increased readiness for modernwar and her present hostile attitude towards Great Britain.  Many of the factors.which have npw become prominent as causes of our weakened position in  theMediterranean  have existed for years, but remained of  secondary  importance solong as Italy showed no signs of aggression or hostility towards us.Political considerations.   . 5.  Though we propose now to examine an Italian  challenge to our positionwe cannot exclude from our consideration of an understanding with Turkey and greece the possibility that  other Powers, such as Germany or Russia, might extend their  influence  into these  countries, or that trouble might arise  in the Mediter-ranean when we are at war with a non-Mediterranean Power.  We must also take into account the uncertainties of our political relations with Egypt and the ineffective-tiveness of League action.        II. REVIEW  OF OUR  STRATEGICAL SITUATION VIS-A-VIS  ITALY.A s sumptions.    6.  In order, however, to keep the strategic issues clear we propose first to review our situation  vis-a-vis a hostile  Italy in its  simplest form by makingarbitrary assumptions as to uncertain political factors.  The influence of other political situations can  more conveniently be considered  subsequently.    7.  We assume that after the withdrawal of the bulk  of the British  rein-forcements now in the Mediterranean, Great Britain is faced with a situation inwhich Italy is hostile, no effective League action is being  taken  and  all otherlowers, except Jigypt and Iraq, are neutral.       [13595]                                                   B 2
  &quot;,&apos;  We also assume that a treaty has been concluded between Groat Britain and egypt in which the following are the&apos;terms which affect the military situation :-    (a) There will be an alliance;between Great Britain and Egypt    (b) British forces are to be stationed in the Canal Zone until the Egyptian           army is efficient enough  to protect the Canal.  Our withdrawal to the           Canal Zone may be completed in 6 to 8 years from now.  After 10 years  umuuiu ),! negotiations may be started with a view-to revision of the&apos;Treaty and           after  20 years  the necessity for the continued presence of  British          ; forces may, if there is disagreement, be  submitted to the arbitration of           the Council of the League;    (c) The British garrison in the Canal Zone is limited to 10,000 soldiers and           a maximum of 400 Royal Air Force pilots; -   (d) In an apprehended emergency  such British  forces  as  may be necessary           to ensure protection of essential communications may be sent to Egypt           and British Naval Forces will have full facilities in Egyptian ports;    (e) In war and apprehended emergency Egypt will give us all facilities and           assistance including  the use  of ports,  aerodromes  and  means of           communication.    As our purpose in  this  section of the paper  is simply to define,  the mostimportant  features in the  strategical situation in the Mediterranean we shall,where possible, confine ourselves mainly to conclusions  based on previous papers.Vulnerability of our communications through the Western Mediterranean.    8.  It i will be useless to  consider the strategy of our forces in the  eastern mediterranean unless we can  be satisfied  that  they can be served by adequatelysecure communications.  During war with Italy,  British trade which  normallypasses through the Mediterranean  could, if necessary, be diverted to the Caperoute; but unless the  necessary Army  and  Air Force reinforcements  and thesupplies and munitions  required for all  three Services could be moved by seabetween Gibraltar  and Malta,  the difficulty of defending  our interests in theEastern Mediterranean would be very much increased.    In the crisis of August 1935 circumstances allowed us to reinforce our forcesin Egypt without interference by Italy, but in future &quot; the danger from italy might become acute with very little  notice and at any moment particularly afterthe lapse of time necessary for the  consolidation of Italy&apos;s present gains.&quot;*    9;  Since any British convoy in the Western Mediterranean could be attacked by the  main Italian fleet,  it would need the escort  of equally powerful naval forces, and its passage would be a major fleet operation.   The passage of a largeconvoy  and so large an escort  within  100 miles  of Italian aerodromes would immediately  put  to  the test  the effectiveness  of  aircraft attack and A.A.defence.  The Naval Staff are  of  the  opinion that  in  the  next few years an accurate estimate may be made of the results of such a test;  further, in  the first few days of  a war, before any convoy  was  ready, results of A.A. fire againstaircraft in war would probably be determined, and this would greatly affectsubsequent operations.   Nevertheless, in  the light of present knowledge, it is unlikely that we should be prepared to subject an important convoy of Army  andAir reinforcements to the passage of the Malta Channel as a test case in an initialoperation of war.  In the view of the Air Staff the passage of a convoy,  howeverheavily escorted, within 100 miles of Metropolitan air force bases of a first-classPower,  is not a practicable operation of war.  Both Naval and Air Staffs agreethat, pending war experience, we cannot rely during the  first few weeks of  war on shipping Army  and Air reinforcements through the Western mediterranean to. Egypt,except^ such limited forces and equipment which could.be conveyed inHis Ma3&apos;esty&apos;s:.ships.      &apos;&apos;&quot;;. i[&apos;       &quot;q&apos;;1&apos;.&apos;         q&apos;qM;/&apos;;^        &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;Vulnerability of Italian communications  with herpossessions; in North-East         Africa.     &apos;            &apos;&quot;&apos;....... 1  ;fq &quot;&apos; RVd^-v  .&apos;v;&apos;. :]&apos;:S&apos;--,r^1-,&apos;  ;.  &apos;10.rt :Italy&apos;s. communications with-Abyssinia can he decisively cut by us.

The. present Italian heavy and medium:.bombers have a sufficiently long range to fly from Libya to Abyssinia,&quot; but&quot; their&quot; useful load over&quot;so long a distance is small, and they could not maintain their forces by air. ;, .Vulnerability, of our communications through the Red Sea.      :. ;1  i urn .1 Any British shipping in the Red Sea&apos; would fatrfirst be exposed to intenseItalian air attack.   The scale of attack would, however, diminish with time owingto the cutting off of Italian supplies  to Abyssinia.   Our own shore^based aircraft from Aden would  give a measure of protection  which would be  increased  as adequate Naval A. A.  escorts became available, but shipping losses might at first be high.    12.  If in the course of time Italian developments in Abyssinia enabled themto maintain their  air forces there in spite of communications with Italy beingcut, our difficulties  in the Red Sea will  be increased because Italy would then bebetter able to maintain the scale of her  attack.The  concentration  of Italian resources in the  Mediterranean opposed to our        dependence on communications.    13.   While Italy has all her  national resources  in  the Mediterranean, ourlocal forces, in common with all our overseas garrisons,  have to be  restricted tothe minimum considered adequate  until the arrival of reinforcements.  The timeand the difficulties of reinforcement  must therefore largely determine the size ofthe Army and Air Forces we should maintain locally.   In.the past, in the absenceof any immediate danger in  the Mediterranean, we have relied  upon our ability.rapidly to concentrate a superior fleet there and have aimed  at keeping our Armyand Air Force strength to the minimum essential  for internal  security and thedefence of our bases in emergency.  With Italy hostile,  a threat of Italianaggression may become acute at short  notice, and we may, in consequence,  beplaced at  a severe  disadvantage in the initial stages of a war.Italian ability to attack Egypt from Libya.    14.   It is unlikely that we could completely  interrupt Italian communica-tions with Libya as the distances are short and could be largely completed duringdarkness by a fast ship.*    The transport and maintenance of land forces to  Libya  would, however, be ahazardous operation for the Italians in the face of our superior sea power.  to run a campaign in Libya inevitably means the passage  of  a stream of ships  toand  from the Home  Country.  Without our being  able to maintain  complete control, a few successes on our part  might suffice to bring their troop reinforce-ments almost to a standstill.  The strength of Italian  attack by land upon Egyptfrom Libya would also be limited  by the  difficulties of maintenance forward  oftheir bases in Libya.    The shipping required for air force maintenance purposes is not great  in amount, and we might have difficulty in interrupting the shipping  to an extentsufficient seriously to handicap the strength of Italian air attack.    The desert which separates Libya from Egypt makes an Italian advance  inforce by land a difficult operation, even with modern mechanised formations. Forthis  reason the threat to Egypt from  Libya would not become serious  for  aconsiderable period.  In addition,  however, to preventing an overland  advance,we shall have a  difficult internal security problem in Egypt as soon as italian aircraft attack Cairo and Alexandria with high explosive  and gas.  From theexperience of  the past year we know that in order to be prepared  to meet/boththe external and the internal threat in war the Army garrison in Egypt niust  be&quot;raised to a strength,of about 20,000, including certain tank units. Similarly thestrength of the Royal Air Force in Egypt needs to be about 4,500 in order tdueprepared for war against Italy.                                 .. :  .\ .        - ,Our peace-time garrison in Egypt allowed under the Treaty would thereforeneed reinforcements of about 10,000  to bring them up to  this strength again, w &apos;                        * CCS. 42L;(J.PP;^ Mso J.P. 128.
Inadequacy of our existing Naval bases.    15   A main requirement  of the Navy in a  Mediterranean war  is  safedocking and repair facilities for damaged ships,;  At present we have two basesGibraltar and Malta.  Docking facilities at the former are being increased  andits distance from Italian air bases, coupled with adequate A.A. defences shouldmake it suitable for use in war;  Gibraltar is, however, too far from the Eastern.Mediterranean for ships operating in that area.    16.  Malta is not adequately defended at  present, and it is only 80 milesfrom  Italian air bases.  A full scale of A.A. defence is essential,  coupled with amaximum of passive  protective measures : owing to the restricted area, only alimited number of aerodromes can be constructed, but air facilities up to the full capacity of the  island should  be provided as soon as possible.   We  cannot,however, pending war experience of A.A. defence, rely upon the full facilities of malta being available for the fleet in war.    17.  The proximity of Italian air  forces to Malta, and  the chance of heavysurprise attacks, added to the fact that ships operating in the Eastern end of theMediterranean are 900 miles from their base, point  to the need for a base in theEastern Mediterranean in  addition.  While it is true to say that Italian airforces can reach any position in the Mediterranean,  at the same time the greater the distance of those  forces from a base, the less will be the scale of attack.  to rely on one base  only, and that in a position most exposed  to heavy air attack.might seriously  hamper  our operations  in the  Eastern Mediterranean. . Analternative  base to Malta should,  therefore, be provided, so that docking. and repair facilities may  be more certainly available in the Eastern Mediterranean.In effect, if we are to face a Mediterranean war, our western and central bases of Gibraltar and Malta must be augmented by an Eastern base.Extension of Italian  power in  the Eastern Mediterranean.    18.  By developing  Naval  and  Air  bases  in  the  Dodecanese, Italy  isextending her Naval and Air poAver in  the Eastern Mediterranean.    Air bases in the  Dodecanese are within  500 miles of Alexandria, Haifa and cyprus, so  that even with their present aircraft the Italians could reach our naval base, wherever  we might locate it in the Eastern Mediterranean.Present comparative powers of attack  by air.    19.  As we are considering a single-handed war in which we are restricted to aerodromes in our own or Egyptian territory, Italy has at present a great advantage  in respect  of the objectives available for  air attack, both because heraircraft have longer  range  than  our  own and because  of  the distance of hervulnerable  points from Egypt.   Our present aircraft have not sufficient range toreach Italy from any British base other than Malta and cannot reach the mainItalian ports in Libya.   Cairo, Alexandria and  the  Suez  Canal are, on the otherhand, all within range of Italian aerodromes in Libya,Influence of increased range in British A aircraft.    20.  Increased range  in aircraft  will in time radically alter our situation.The present rearming of our Air Force will provide us with a more effective means-of attack against the Italian base organisation and lines of communication  in libya, and thereby reduce  the threat of any land invasion into Egypt.    . When the aerodrome at Gibraltar has; been completed, aircraft will be  ableto fly from England via Gibraltar to reinforce Egypt:Italy&apos;s economic vidner ability.   .21,  Although, m previous  papers*  we have  expressed confidence in our ability, with  the full co-operation of  the  &apos;&apos; Sanctionist &quot;  countries, to bring;:         .  * C.O.B. 421 (J.P.) (also J.P. 128) and C.O.S. 462 (J.P.) (also J.P. 145).
decisive economic pressure on Italy,  the position would  be altered in a single-handed war.                                               .&apos;    Our ability to close the eastern and western entrances to the mediterranean to Italian &quot;shipping  and to contraband consigned to Italy gives us  a means ofexerting a degree of pressure on  Italy.  We could carry but operations  in theWestern Mediterranean and in the iEgean which would interrupt Italian  trade&apos;.;but, single-handed,  we could not cut off Italy&apos;&apos;s overland &quot;or Adriatic  trade norcontinuously interfere with her seaborne trade with France and Spain or throughthe -iEgean.  We cannot, therefore, ourselves exert decisive economic pressure.    On the other hand,  it may  be  doubted whether  Italy&apos;s present financialposition would permit her to sustain a serious war effort for long.-Conclusions.    22.  In a single-handed war against Italy at the present time we should find it difficult to bring a,uj decisive  pressure  to bear  on Italy  for a considerable period unless circumstances enabled us to bring her main fleet to action.    The reinforcement of Egypt through  the Mediterranean might not be a practicable operation in the first few weeks of war, and unless we had been ableto move Army and Air Force reinforcements to Egypt before the  outbreak of war we might be faced with a difficult  situation  in that country, especially in view ofthe internal disorder which might occur.  We could, however, deny Italy the useof the Suez Canal and render the maintenance of her sea communications withLibya hazardous.    23.  At the best, our forces would be on the defensive, and we must count onholding our position until the strain of war began to affect Italy seriously.  this might mean a long war, during which the  lack  of a repair base in the eastern mediterranean would be a severe handicap on our Navy.III. -REVIEW  OF  FACTORS WHICH  MAY AFFECT  OUR  STRATEGICAL  POSITION.The attitude of Egypt.    24.  In Section II we assumed Egypt to  be  bound  to us  by a treaty of alliance, but no treaty has yet been concluded and negotiations may still fail.    If the Treaty is successfully negotiated we may hope that the Egyptian army will be modernised and rendered more efficient under the direction of the british military Mission.  It should then be in a position to secure internal order and toassist the  British forces to a greater extent than is at present possible against external aggression.    The failure of negotiations would be  likely to cause prolonged internal unrest,which would be favourable ground for Italian propaganda  and would in war add to the difficulties of defending Egypt against Italian attack.    There is a possibility that, under  the terms of the Treaty, revision  aftertwenty years by the Council of the League might entail reduction in the strengthof the forces we can maintain in Egypt in peace.  Although this is an improbablecontingency, if it should take place it would necessitate finding a suitable locationfor Army and  Air force reserves  in the Middle East outside Egypt,  for  whichpurpose Cyprus, among other places, is worth consideration.The attitude of France.    25.  The attitude of  France would have a most important strategical  effect in the event of war between Italy and Great Britain.  So long as the attitude ofFrance remained doubtful, Italy would feel the greatest anxiety about her North-Western frontier and the defence of her northern cities against air attack, withthe result  that her freedom of action in other theatres would be restricted.    The direct co-operation of France would, of course, alter the whole characterof the war.  The Franco-Italian frontier would  become the main theatre of land operations,  except during the  winter months,  and of air operations, and themajority of the Italian air forces would most likely be retained in Northern Italy.Effective French air co-operation could also be carried out from Corsica.
Situation if Great Britain is at war in another theatre.     : .;     26.   If, when we Wore already at war either in Western Europe -or in theFar East, Italy were to attack our interests in the /-Mediterranean, we should be forced to confine ourselves to a very limited defensive in the Mediterranean itself.In a Avar iri Western Europe  we should probably be allied with France, and theissue with Italy&apos; would largely be decided: across the Franco-Italian frontier, but during&apos; a War in which our main fleet was in the Far  East we should have toadopt a defensive strategy in the Mediterranean.!  *yi nois^joq  ?M a: w.v/v.vo;-:    In a recent paper* we showed that the three  Powers from whose  policieswar  is most to  be  apprehended  in the near future are Germany,  Italy and japan,  while  temporarily  in the background is the   U.S.S.R.    We  also stated that since we  cannot  contemplate  with  confidence the  outcome  of war against  any two of these possible  enemies, our country  will  remain liable tobe placed in ah untenable position until our military resources have been increasedor political action has liquidated the dangers of the present situation.   If thedanger  of  Italian  aggression in  the Mediterranean  is liable  to continue indefinitely, our  whole defence programme will  have to be recast.    MV.-POSSIBLE&apos;-MEASURES TO  IMPROVE OUR STRATEGICAL SITUATION.Strengthening our forces in the Mediterranean.     27.   From  the  foregoing  Sections it will  be  clear  that  our  strategicalproblems in the Mediterranean would  be  simpler if we  maintained in  peaceconsiderably stronger Army and Air Force garrisons in that area.  To increase our garrisons to a strength which, without any other measures, would eliminate the danger arising from Italian aggression would, however, entail a reorientationof our whole defence policy which is beyond the scope of  this paper.A alternative communications.,   .  28-  : Overland communications between Basra and Haifa, if of adequatecapacity,  would  provide  an  important   alternative   line of  communication to pur Mediterranean garrisons.  It is understood that a metalled road is shortly to be built between Baghdad and Haifa, but a railway would also be necessary togive  this  route adequate carrying capacity  as  a  line of  supply  to theMediterranean,.  Compared  with the  line  of   supply  through  the western mediterranean or via the Cape and Red Sea it would be fairly secure so long asTurkey,is not hostile, since Iraq would be our ally under the terms of our  Treaty.If we&apos;relied upon this line of supply, reserves of the munitions and stores required during the first few weeks of war would have to be held in India, and some method would have to be found by which reinforcements  for Egypt could be spared from india.                                                                      :     Another; route the development of which would have  an important bearing on our position  in the Mediterranean  is that from Kilindini through Uganda tothe Sudan.   A dry weather  motor road is  already occasionally  used between/Nairobi and Mongalla, whence there is a regular steamship service to Khartum;and the Kenya.railway system frOm Kilindini already extends to points  in Ugandar within 400 miles of Mongalla.Alternative bases. .     29.   In a previous section we have shown that in a  war with Italy we couldnot rely on full facilities for  the Fleet being available at Malta.  We concluded that it was essential to augment Gibraltar and Malta by  a base in the eastern mediterranean.  There appear to be three possibilities : Haifa, Alexandria andFamagusta.     Haifa is in Mandated territory,  and although  we are not thereby debarredfrpni,.. establishing  a permanent  base there  (were&quot; have, in fact, used  it as  a&apos; tiMii])p.rary  base&apos;. during  the  recent  crisis),  there - are  Wei; id us  objections to&quot;establishing a&apos;base in territory over which&apos; we have no  guarantee of  permanentcon t rol.&apos;.,. 11 ait a;, lias  al rea dy  been; developed as  a commercial harbour; but the. proyisidh.. .pf&apos;&apos; adequate&apos; accommodation &apos; for : a   Fleet  would&apos; entail- completereconstruction  at. a heavy cost.            -h-v5;&apos;: &apos;--&apos;&apos;-&apos;-W.;.v saornd-TT ;f;..:.:&apos;MY;.   :            * Strategical Review (July 1936) (C.QMe49i%9&amp;i) jUlte JfPc156) /&quot;-1. t
     Alexandria has been used by the Fleet during the recent crisis, and many facilities were  improvised.  A .great  disadvantage ds . the, lack  of . blocking facilities.   Undoubtedly /such  facilities  could  be provided, and  Alexandria already  affords a  suitable fleet  anchorage,  which dredging,,will  improve ,in the future.  The shallow approach is a further drawback.   If we had a free hand in developing and controlling Alexandria-, we could provide a fleet repair base, there at less cost than at Famagusta.  The outstanding disadvantage of Alexandria, however, is its possession by Egypt.   Under the terms of the. treaty, now, being negotiated by us with that country,  a time limit will be set  to  the  presence of British troops in Alexandria, for whose  defence we shall ultimately have to rely upon Egyptian troops.  Further, it is by no means certain whether we should be as free as we could wish when developing Alexandria on the desired lines. . A clash between Egyptian commercial interests and our naval requirements might occur.  The outstanding objection, however, remains in the fact that to maintain our position in the Eastern Mediterranean, we should be relying on a naval repair base in the possession of another country. A advantages and disadvantages of Cyprus.     30.  Except  in the matter of cost the above  objections do  not apply to Famagusta  in  Cyprus, which is  British territory,  and whose geographical position  renders  it just as suitable for use as  a Naval Base  as Haifa  or Alexandria, provided  Turkey is not hostile.   Furthermore, its  island  position rules out the possibility of any threat from a land advance such as the Italians might develop against Alexandria.     The Admiralty has already surveyed its possibilities as a base and outline plans for the construction of a breakwater, which would provide  the necessary anchorage, and of  docking facilities have been prepared.     Apart from the question of the  Naval Base,  we have to  face the fact that none of  the territories adjacent to the Eastern  Mediterranean, in which  our garrisons are at present stationed, will  remain entirely under our control, and in order to  increase the strength of our  defensive position  to suit ourselves, we may have to find new locations for any additional land and air  forces.     For  this purpose,  also, Cyprus offers us advantages in the  way of accom- modation and  climate  which do  not  appear to  exist  elsewhere.  Although dispersion of aerodromes in the island would be limited, there is a considerable area in  which aerodromes  could be  constructed,  and the  country generally is suitable for military training.  Aircraft based in the island could counter-attack any  Italian forces in the Dodecanese,  while at the same time being within easy flying range of Egypt if required to concentrate in that area.     On the  other hand there are two important disadvantages in  the proposal to develop Cyprus :      (a) The development of a naval base at Famagusta entails the protection of           the  whole  of Cyprus, which  is a permanent  additional military           commitment;     (b)  Cyprus is  only 70 miles from the coast of  Asia  Minor. If Turkey came          under the domination of a hostile first class air power the position of           Cyprus would be geographically almost  as  weak as  that  of Malta..          The development of  an important base  in  Cyprus would therefore           permanently  affect our  political relations  with Turkey  and hence          with her neighbours.     We  have here  confined ourselves to the military disadvantages,  and have not considered the financial implications. Understanding with Turkey and Greece.     31.  The strategical requirements involved  in  an Eastern  Mediterranean understanding with Turkey and Greece and the advantages to us of that under- standing are largely governed by what our policy vis-a-vis Italy is to be.     There can be no doubt that, if by diplomatic means we can once more restore the cordial  relations which previously existed  between  ourselves and&apos;Italy,  we ought not to take any  other action which might adversely affect  our  chances of restoring the situation  in this way.

  . :  A complete rapprochement must, however, prove difficult so long as we refuseto recognise Italian sovereignty in Abyssinia, and Mussolini,, for his part, clingsto his intention &apos;0f expanding the  Italian Empire still further.  Moreover, weare still pledged to the League and  the system of collective security which might involve us in war with Italy just as  easily as with any other country.     32.  If we could rely on  the military co-operation of Turkey and Greeceunder the League Covenant, no additional strategic advantages would be gained by a special understanding,.but events of the past year have amply demonstratedthe folly of relying upon  collective action by League  Members in the face of italian aggression.     This being so, we cannot count upon assistance from either Turkey or Greeceunless we can come to some definite understanding with them.   In the following paragraphs the advantages and disadvantages of an understanding with eithercountry are reviewed.Greece.     33.  As regards Greece, the advantage we might hope to gain from an under-standing,  if one. could be concluded, is  the use by our forces of ports and aerodromes in Greek territory  in time of war.  The geographical position of thesebases would simplify the problem of controlling the Central Mediterranean andthe iEgean Sea and would enable us to launch air attacks against Italy.     Even this  advantage  is qualified by the probability that internal  economicconditions  and  lack  of internal communications in Greece  would  make  themaintenance of our air  forces  in  the country difficult.     Moreover, the Greeks are poor fighters and the military problem of protectingtheir country against Italy in war  would be a very difficult one.  Greece lies soclose to Italian aerodromes that a heavy scale of air attack could be directed by italy against any military  bases established in that country.     We should also  be  committed to the maintenance of Greek sea communica-tions, which would be a commitment, in some respects, greater than maintaining our  own, as for us there are routes alternative to the Mediterranean.     Any understanding with  Greece would entail the danger that  we might become involved in hostilities  in  connection with quarrels which do not directly affect&apos; our  military interests,  since  Greece is  very closely  concerned with  theproblems of Yugoslavia.     Further,, any understanding  with Greece which did not include Yugoslaviawould be resented by the latter and  be likely to weaken the Balkan Entente anddrive Yugoslavia out of it into the arms of Germany.     On the above grounds it  is  clear that we should lose much more than weshould gain by an understanding with Greece, and in  any  case it appears thatshe is already so frightened  of  Italy as  to be very unlikely  to conclude any independent understanding with  us.Turkey.                  -                                  .     34.  On the other  hand,  Turkey  is a different proposition and an under-standing with her holds the following military, advantages for us :     : :(i) Through being able  to  rely upon the  friendship of Turkey we  could           develop Cyprus into a Naval, Air  and Army base, with confidence           that.it would not be subjected to air attacks from Turkish territory.     (ii) The use of ports and aerodromes in Cyprus and Turkey would place us           in a  favourable  position  to  neutralise the Italian  base in  the           Dodecanese.     (iii) In war Turkey has the power to control all shipping passing through the           Dardanelles.                                         ....     (iv)  Turkish troops are good fighters, arid her forces can be relied  upon to           put up a good defence of their own country.     (v)  The influence which Turkey exerts with all Moslems would help to ease  -ihY!    -our problems of internal  securityjiniEgypt,;Ealestine, Iraq arid India.     (vi) Turkey  is independent  of. sea  communications anuthe Mediterranean,-  -sshiu?    and consequently we  should  not be saddled&apos; with  additional naval           liabilities for; the protection, of her s trade in war. v -. , -:. i il :r-v &apos;;e:d: u
Russia.     37.  Although one result of the Franco-Russian Pact has been, to reduce thepossibility of an Anglo-Russian clash,  either in  Afghanistan  or elsewhere,nevertheless  we must  remember that the creed of Communism is diametrically-opposed to our own policy of democracy, and fundamentally, therefore, Russiamust always be  considered as a potential enemy to the British Empire.  It  isnot unlikely, in  view of  her present relations with Turkey, and the importance which she naturally attaches to the entrance to the Black Sea, that she would be only too willing to act as a guarantor of Turkish integrity if we allow her theopportunity.     38.  In  any  war with  Russia  one of  the  few  measures. by  which wecould bring effective pressure to bear on her would be the attack on her oil interestsin the Caucasus  and Baku area, together with the dislocation of her communica-tions in the Black  Sea and the Caspian,  and we should only be able to achieve this if we could control the entrance to the Black Sea and make use of Naval andAir bases in Turkey.Germany.                                                               &apos;     39.  There  are signs that  Germany is  once  more  undertaking  peacefulpenetration  towards the Eastern Mediterranean, and although so far she hasmade no very definite approach to Turkey, there are indications that she wouldlike to adopt the same policy as she  followed before the last war  and tie upTurkish interests with her own.     40.  From a military aspect we should remember the lessons of the last war,: -when the hostility of Turkey cost us  some 300,000  casualties,  and  possiblyprolonged the war by two years.   Any action that we can take to avoid repeatingour  acknowledged mistake in  failing to  get Turkey on our side in the pre-war years is well worth consideration.Disadvantage of an understanding with Turkey.     41.  In the event of war an alliance with any second-rate Power is inevitablya drain on  the resources of a major Power, both financially and in respect ofmunitions supply, and Turkey, being  unable to manufacture arms for herself,will be particularly dependent upon allies.     To this extent an  understanding with  Turkey  would be  an  additionalcommitment for us; but Turkey almost invariably participates in any european war and in  the past she  has proved far more of a drain on bur resources as anenemy than  she would have proved as an ally,  ..&apos;           .8 iUou i:muConclusions and recommendations: \....      ,   ..;  y   d-;.v -        dk&quot;&apos;&quot; (y.)  .;.  42J  From the. above examination we conclude that am understanding with greece would have very great  disadvantages for us:  bri    - - ?.i     :;;T (rn   :&apos; On fhe:other handywe.should -gain;considerable  advantages from.an under-standing with Turkey without-aneurrihgo comparable military - disadvantages.    35.  Apart from these direct military advantages of an understanding with turkey,  there  are other  less direct military considerations  of importance,Although Turkey has strong nationalistic tendencies and under Mustapha Kemalhas  shown ibeyond, all. doubt  that she - prefers to  manage her -own  affairs,nevertheless she has. undoubtedly been impressed by the recent successes, Mussolini -;has achieved in the face of the League opposition, and she must realise that.sheis not in a position to secure herself against Italian aggression by means of her own resources.  The conclusion is that she will be driven  to conclude some form ;of defensive agreement with some major Power in the near  future.    36.  If this  is admitted, a further consideration arises as to whether  we ought to shoulder the commitment  which an understanding with Turkey mustimply, rather than allow another major Power to guarantee the integrity of thatcountry  and thus  become paramount  in  territory  adjacent  to the  eastern mediterranean.
  :  We appreciate that any form of understanding&apos; may be regarded by italy as being directed against her, and it is important that, if we do approach Turkeywith a view to concluding an understanding, we should do so in a manner calcu-lated to avoid still further exacerbating our relations with Italy.    43.  In any understanding which we negotiate with Turkey we should reserveabsolutely the right to decide where and how we should employ our Own-forces against the common enemy.   In no circumstances should we  commit  ourselves to come to the assistance of Turkey by sending our forces to co-operate with theirsin local defence measures.    44.  We recommended in a recent paper* that our liabilities should be limited by a clear recognition of the three vital interests for the protection of whichwe should go to war.  The Committee of Imperial Defence has already confirmed that the integrity of the Dutch East Indies is vital to the security of the BritishEmpire in connection with our interest in Singapore.    The maintenance of our position in the Mediterranean constitutes another of our  three vital interests.  We recommend that the basis of an understanding with Turkey should be the recognition of her integrity as  an essential factor asregards our security in this area. \                                      (Signed)       T.
