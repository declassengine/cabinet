HQNFIDENTIAL .                                            A.C.  355.                         BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.                           STATE OF TRADE - JUNE.  1936.               Summary of reports submitted by members of the Board                of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some                cases by statistical information from other sources).     OVERSEAS TRADE.  Imports in June at  67.6 m. were  9.8 m.more than in June, 1935.   Over three-quarters of the rise wasin food and raw materials.   Of the increase of  2.1 m. inmanufactured goods  554,000 related to machinery and  181,000to iron and steel manufactures.   Exports of United Kingdomproduce,  32.1 m., were  850,000 less (this decrease relatedmainly to Italy), and re-exports,  5 HI. , were  214,000 lessthan in June, 1935.     ^E^J0Y^?SN.T*  The &quot;total number of unemployed persons onthe registers at the 22nd June, 1,702,676, was 2,366 fewer than at 25th May.  The main variations were:-   London--........ - 2,659     North Eastern... + 32,740   South Eastern.. - 6,602     North Western... -  8,277   South Western.. - 6,138     Scotland........ - 18,408   Midlands...... 4- 7,059     Wales........... -     81The estimated number of insured persons  aged 16-64 in employmentwas 10,832,000, 1,000 more than at 25th  May and 441,000 morethan at 24th June, 1935.     Employment in most of the principal indxistries was greaterthan in May, though there was a decline  in most of the clothingtrades (including boot and shoe manufacture) and&apos; in the wooltextile, linen and motor vehicle industries.  A sharp increasein the numbers temporarily stopped in coal mining was partly due to a temporary suspension of work at certain mines inconnection with the annual demonstration of the YorkshireMiners1  Association.                            -1-
     RAILWAY TRAFFIC).  In the four weeks ended 28th June railway-traffic receipts decreased by . 149,000 (1,23$) compared with thecorresponding period of 1935.  There was a decrease of 5.59$in passenger traffic, but increases of .4.19$ in merchandise,minerals and livestock and 1..5$ in coal, coke and patent fuel.(The 1935 period included the whole of Whitsuntide, but the1936 period only Whit-Monday).     SHIPPING- AMD SHIPBUILDING.  The Chamber of Shipping index number of freights (1913 = 100) was 87.86 as against 88.46 inMay and 75.90 a year ago.   At the 1st July 478,000 net tons ofshipping were laid up in Great Britain and Ireland as comparedwith 474,000 at the 1st April and 588,000 a year ago.     The amount of tonnage under construction in Great Britainand Ireland at the 30th June was 849,000 gross tons (thehighest cguarterly total recorded since December 1930) as against842,000 gross tons at the 31st March and 560,000 a year ago.     BANKING.   Money was quite usable, although bankers&apos;  depositsat the Bank of England increased by  10 m. as compared withthe last bank return in May.   The average Treasury bill ratefluctuated between 18/1d. and 12/7d.   The transfer of Frenchfunds to London made a strong demand for sterling, the ratesmoving from 75^- to 76f.   The three months forward ratefluctuated between 2-g- and 7-jj discount, the lower rate beingquoted during the last week of June.  The dollar moved between4.981 and 5.04^ (the highest rate since August, 1934).  Theprice of gold fluctuated between 138/3d. and I39/4d.   Largepurchases of gold by the Bank of England are explained by thecontinued rise in the note circulation.     JXAL.  The average weekly output of coal during the 13 weeks ended 20th June was 4.27 m. tons as compared with 4.19 m.  tonsin the corresponding period a year ago - an increase of 2$.   Theaverage number of wage-earners employed was 1% less than a year before.  Exports in June amounted to 2.57 m..tons compared with
                                                          HI %J Q 3.06 m. tons in June, 1935.     Exports to Italy were 326,000 tons less, and other  countries taking less included Prance and the Netherlands;   the  chief increase was to Denmark.     IRON AND STEEL.   Active  conditions continued.  Pig-iron was in very strong demand and in  some cases business has been transacted for delivery up to the end of March, 1937.  The price increases have had no adverse effect on business.  Pig- iron output (644,000 tons) was 21.7$ greater than in June 1935. Semi-finished steelworks were fully occupied.  Output of ingots and castings (965,000 tons) was 25,4$ greater than in June, 1935,   The finished steel market was active;   delivery periods are tending to lengthen as consumers are anxious to buy far forward.  Overseas markets showed signs of improvement.     -Scc^tdancl.  Output remained at an extremely high level. It is probable that most producers will operate practically to capacity for the rest of the year.  Export business was rather slack.     North East Coast.   There was a steady expansion in demand for all classes of products and steps have been taken to increase output.  It was easier to obtain Pig-iron supplies for export.  The sheet steel department lacked export businessbut there were signs of improvement.     Sheffield.   Steelworks continued extremely busy.   New orders were plentiful and scheme.es for extending plant are being developed.   Production of high speed steel approached,  and demand for engineer&apos;s tools passed,  record levels.     South Wales.   Conditions were satisfactory.   Demand for finished steel is sufficient  to keep manufacturers busy for some months ahead.  The tinplate position improved considerably.     ENGINEERING.   Conditions In general  showed further improvement.   In some cases demand has temporarily outrun supply facilities - this partly explains  the  recent  rise in imports.   It  seems probable that activity will  shortly  be greater than  at  any time since 1920-1.
                                                       tfjt fft. ?-*                                                      &apos; *t&apos; &apos;;5 /      Exports of machinery were valued at   3 m.  as  compared with  3.3 m,  in June,  1935.      MOTOR I INDUSTRY.    The number of motor vehicles  newly registered in May was  40,959 - 8,675 more than  a year ago. The  increase in private cars was 6,681,   The production of private cars and taxis was 36,231 as against 27,575  in May,1935.. The  production of commercial vehicles increased from 7,705 to 9,820.    Exports of new private cars and  chassis in  June amounted to  4,842, and  of new commercial vehicles and chassis to 1,398,  showing when compared with June,  1935, increases of 19$  and 26$  respectively.   Imports of complete  new private cars and taxis amounted to 654,  21% less  than a year ago.      LIGHT METAL INDUSTRIES.   Most light  metal  trades continued busy, though  the cutlery trade was in general unsatisfactory. Most non-ferrous metal  mills were working to capacity.  The falling off  in the lock and  allied trades early in the year was  more than made good in the cpaarter just  ended;   prices of some lines were advanced owing to increases  in  wages  and raw material prices.  The  situation in the foundry  industry improved greatly.     ELECTRICAL.......INDUSTRY.  Progress  in general  was well maintained.   In most classes  of installation material  and light apparatus production showed  a  considerable increase  as compared with  a year ago.  The  index  of heavy engineering orders declined  as compared with  June,  1935.   Consumption  of electricity amounted  to 1,334 m. units, 16.3$ more than  in June,  1935.     COTTON.  There was a  slight  seasonal decline in activity in June.   Average weekly  deliveries  of raw  cotton to spinners were 26.53 m. lbs. against 29.73 m. lbs.   in May and 23.52  m.  lbs. in June, 1935.   Deliveries of American and  Indian cotton  fell as compared with May,  but  deliveries of Egyptian cotton increased slightly.  Raw cotton prices continued to rise,mainly on account of increasing world consumption.   Spinners&apos;margins remained small.  Yarn exports at  12,3 ra. lbs. were
 slightly  less  than  in May hut rather more than in June, 1935. Exports of  piece  goods  at 129.6 m.  square yards were 16.2 rah square yards less than  in May and 8.7 m. square yards less than in June,  1935.   The decrease as compared with May was spread over most  markets;  hut exports to New  [Zealand, British West Africa, French West and Equatorial Africa and Greece increased  substantially.      WOOL.  There was an appreciable decline (mainly in the worsted section)  from the May level of activity.  Raw wool prices weakened.  As compared with May exports of tops and yarns declined but  exports of tissues increased slightly. Except in the heavy woollen district, new orders and enquiries Y/ere  scarce.      General activity during the first half of 1936 was considerably greater than a year ago.      SILK AND ARTIFICIAL SILK.  Demand for rayon yarns improved but business in warps was of a hand to mouth character.  Demand for  staple  fibre  declined.   The volume of trade in rayon piece-goods was normal but competition was very fierce, the public demanding  cheapness rather than quality.    Exports of yarns decreased and of all-rayon fabrics and rayon mixture piece-goods increased as compared with June, 1935.      -The summer  season in silk has on the whole been bad; the hardening in  raw silk prices should stimulate the buying of piece-goods.     HIDES AND LEATHER.   Hide markets were rather erratic in June.   In the leather trade conditions were  on the whole quieter than for  some months past.     CHEMICALS.  Home sales  of alkalies,  though  less  than  inMay, were satisfactory;   exports were low.   Deliveries  of chlorine products and of industrial nitrogen products were maintained.    Sales  of dyestuffs again showed a  satisfactory
increase.   Home sales of fertilizers will be greater thisseason than last, hut total exports to date are considerably less, despite a substantial increase in Empire sales.  Tradein coal tar products was satisfactory in most directions.     PAPER.  Demand in most sections of the trade was greaterthan a year before, the chief exception being miscellaneousprinting papers.  As regards raw materials, the advance inprices of wood pulp (especially Bleached Sulphite Pulp) continued     BUILDING.  The situation further improved slightly.Housebuilding activity probably did not expand but there was increased activity on public buildings.     RETAIL TRADE.   The money value of retail sales in May was.2$ greater than in May, 1935,  Sales of food and perishablesrose by 5.5$ and of other merchandise by 8.7$.   There are indications that sales of non-food merchandise in June barelyexceeded those for June, 1935;  but in 1935 June included thelast week of pre-Whitsun trade.     CO-OPERATIVE TRADE (SCOTLAND). The general drapery etctrade increased substantially and trade in the furniture etc.section continued fairly steady.     AUSTRALIAN TRADE. 2,765,441 bales of wool were receivedinto store from the 1st July,  1935, to. the 31st May,  ascompared with 2,822,989 a year previously, the quantitiessold or shipped being 2,618,699 and 2,638,957 bales respectively..Wheat and flour shipments from the 1st December,  1935,  to the26th June were equivalent to 67.8 m.  bushels of wheat against65.7 m.  bushels a year agoi    Butter shipments from the 1stJuly, 1935, to the  27th June amounted to 87,000 tons  ascompared with 110,000 tons a year ago.   Imports of merchandiseduring May amounted to  8.59 m. (Australian currency) ascompared with  7,94 m. a year before.                         -6-
      SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE.   Imports  in April were  16.2$ greater than in April,  1935.   Exports  (excluding gold) were 17$ more despite a heavy decline  in  wool and maize shipments.  Cold output was greater than  in  April, 1955,  and gold  exports amounted to  8.3 m. as compared with  7.6 m,  a year ago.  The improvement in  industrial activity  was maintained.      SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.      Argentina.  Shipments  of wheat, linseed, harley and oats were  much less  in  the first half of 1936 than in  the first half of 1935;  maize exports  were slightly greater.  The grain markets were inactive in June, hut  prices advanced.  Wool prices improved in the latter half  of the month.  The free exchange market was erratic and weakened towards  the end of June.   Total exports for the first five months of 1936 were 13.8$ In value and 29.1$ in volume  less than a year &quot;before; imports were 1.9$  less in value hut 10,4-$ more in volume.      Brazil.  Shipments  of  coffee from 1st July, 1935, to 22nd  June were substantially greater than in the corresponding period for the 1934/35 crop.   A large surplus of new crop coffee is expected;  prices fell slightly.   The sugar market remained steady, but the cotton market weakened considerably.      Chile.   Imports of United Kingdom and United States goods are being seriously affected by the operation of &quot;Compensation&quot; treaties,  particularly with Germany.   Imports from  Germany in the first four months of 1956 increased in value bjr over 150% as compared with a year ago,     Peru.  Economic conditions remained satisfactory  and theagricultural outlook improved.     Colombia.  The coffee market was quiet;   but  heavjr shipmentswere  made  in fulfilment  of contracts made early  in the year.     Uruguay.   Total exports of wool from October  1st, 1935,to the 31st  May were 17$  more  than a year before.
