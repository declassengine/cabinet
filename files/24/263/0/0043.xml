Printed for the Cabinet.  August 1936.SECRET.Copy No.CP. 213 (36).CABINET.THE REFORM OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.     THE  following Notes are the outcome of the Prime Minister&apos;s request for comments  and  suggestions  from Members  of  the Cabinet  on  this  difficult subject:      1.  I start upon the assumption that a substantial change is needed in the practice, if not in the theory, of the League.  The lessons of the last twelve months cannot be neglected, the danger of a still more serious embroilment in the future cannot be ignored.     The country will rightly expect a restatement of British policy that will free us  from commitments upon questions in which public opinion is not willing to support  specific action.  The ultimate  test   in a  democratic  country is  the willingness of public opinion  to support  a given line of policy.   The British public, and indeed the publics of all the League States, were not prepared to fight - for Ethiopia.  I do not believe that the British public will be prepared to fight in  a quarrel that will almost certainly start, not as the 1914 crisis started, by a flagrant act of aggression upon territory that  we regard as vital, but by a series of  complicated  and perhaps obscure political incidents  culminating in action under&apos; the  Franco-Russian Pact.   If this  is the case, it is both dishonest and dangerous  to allow obligations to remain on paper that we shall have neither the will nor the power to fulfil in practice. It is essential, therefore, to use the present opportunity to reduce our specific commitments to the point at which the  Govern- ment and the country will be both willing and able to stand by their word.    2.  How is it possible to effect this reduction  without on the one hand stimulating aggression in Eastern Europe, and on the other hand making a deep cleft in British and world opinion over the League ?    If we  declare that we are  not interested in questions affecting Central and Eastern Europe, we  give an incentive  to Germany  to embark  on  a policy  of aggression in Austria, Czechoslovakia, Lithuania or Russia.    If we come crudely out  for the &quot;deletion of Article XVI of the Covenant, we shall in actual practice smash the League,  for France and the Little Entente will leave it, and we shall outrage a  large body of League opinion in this country and the Dominions.  This being so, I  should, if possible,  leave the Covenant  as it is, and not face a frontal  issue.  I say  &quot;if possible.&quot;  for  I  attach so great importance to the re-entry of Germany and Japan and the friendly co-operation of the United States of America, that I would not remain rigid on the question of Article XVI if  its retention stood in the  way of a comprehensive League.   A comprehensive League without coercive  powers would be immeasurably more effective than an incomplete  League with coercive powers.   But short of  making the League substantially more comprehensive than it is to-day, I would leave the Covenant as it is.    I would defend it as  an excellent constitution for a comprehensive  League,and I  would maintain it  in the hope that sometime the League will in realitybe comprehensive.   In the meanwhile, I would follow the 1921 precedent and[13652]
proceed by explanatory resolution.   The Foreign Office paper (CP. 210 (36)) hasalready suggested  the kind of resolution.   I agree with the  suggestion that the member States should reaffirm their support of the Covenant, but should statethat, so long as the League is not comprehensive, they must define their attitudetowards obligations that wei/e undertaken on the assumption of their universality.    Such  a statement would in our case involve, firstly,  a definition of the issuesin which  we  are  prepared  to take  specific  action;  secondly,  and I  attachconsiderable importance to this second feature of such a  statement, an under-taking to  use our influence for peace, but in a  manner to be settled  at the time,wherever peace is threatened by aggression.  Such a general undertaking wouldnot only be valuable in itself, but it would free us from the  charge of throwingto the wolves countries in which we had no vital interest.    3.  Supposing that we proceed upon  these lines,  the question at once arisesas to what are or are not the vital interests for which we are ready to take specificaction.  By  specific action I mean sanctions of any kind,  military or economic.For recent events  make it unwise to draw a distinction between military andeconomic sanctions. It does not seem to me possible to have a three-decker systemof military sanctions for vital interests, economic sanctions  for less vital interestsand a general obligation  to follow the path of peace for  interests  that do not directly concern us.  The  distinction seems to be between commitments in whichwe are determined  to act, and situations in which we will judge at the time  asto whether or  not we can give more than moral support.    4.  Accepting this distinction, I should have no hesitation in stating thatthe integrity  of the  Channel Ports and of the Locarno  Agreement was pre-eminently one of these vital issues.  Should it  be our sole  vital issue?  I thinknot.   I am convinced that we  ought to fight and that we should fight for thefreedom of our Eastern communications.  Our vital interests in the East cannot therefore  be ignored in the statement  that  I contemplate.   Should the freedomof OUT Mediterranean communications be specifically mentioned?  I incline  tothe view that  it should be mentioned.  It might, however,  be possible to includeboth  the  Mediterranean  and the  East in the  general phrase  of  &apos;&apos; imperial communications.&apos;&apos;    5.  It may be urged that such a statement covering the security of  this island and the Empire would appear insular and self-interested.  I do not thinkthat this charge could be  maintained in face of the fact that the other member states would  presumably be  making  similar  declarations  of their own vital interests.    I  assume  that these statements  would be unilateral or  in  some casesmultilateral, but that they would have the weight of League  resolutions.  It would obviously  be impossible to expect the unanimity of the  1921 resolutions behindeach specific declaration.    6.  As to the  tactics at Geneva, I  would leave as  much liberty of manoeuvreas possible to our delegation.  It might, however, be worth their while to considerthe advantage of making a comprehensive statement on some such lines as I havesuggested, assuming,  that is, that  they agree with them.  It would  seem to meunwise that they should appear to be merely making  a  compromise between twoextreme views. I should not admit that this is a compromise policy any more than    should admit that Anglicanism  is a compromise  between Roman  Catholicismand Protestantism.  It is  a policy sound in itself and suited  to the conditions  ofthe world in which we find ourselves.    7.  Lastly, I  would  suggest that it would be well to bring the GermanGovernment into the  discussions at the earliest possible moment.   If one of our main objects is the return of Germany  to the League,  it is urgently important toavoid the appearance of Anglo-French foundations, still more of a Franco-Russianwall round the future structure of the  League.                                                                    S. H.    August 10, 1936.
