COPY NO.CABINET.GENEVA RED CROSS CONVENTION.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.      1. The  Geneva Red  Cross  Convention,  1906, to which the United Kingdom is a party, prohibited the unauthorised use of the Red Cross Emblem  and of the words  &quot;Red Cross&quot; or &quot;Geneva  Cross&quot;;  the Geneva Convention Act, 1911, was passed to give  effect to that  obligation.  In 1929 an  International Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of  the Wounded and Sick in  Armies in the Field was adopted at Geneva prohibiting  in addition the unauthorised  use Of:-   (a) imitations of the Red  Cross Emblem        or   of the words &quot;Red Cross&quot; or        &quot;Geneva Cross&quot;, and   (b) the arms of the Swiss  Confederation        (i.e. the Red Cross Emblem with the        colours reversed) and imitations        thereof.     The Convention provided that the Governments concerned shall &quot;adopt or propose to their legislatures the measures necessary to enforce these prohibitions&quot;.     2. The Convention of 1929 was ratified by HisMajesty&apos;s Government  on the 23rd June,  1931,  and came into force,  so far as the United Kingdom is concerned,on the 23rd December,  1931.   Under the  Convention theabove prohibitions must take effect  within five years from the coming into  force of the  Convention,  i.e,  not later than 23rd December,  1936.    In these circumstances am now bringing this  obligation  to the notice of  mycolleagues. P. 305(362.
9 9 %frf wr e*      3. Legislation  is necessary to give effect to the prohibitions and it  was hoped that an opportunity would be  found to make the necessary provision in other legislation, but this has not proved possible.  After consultation with other Departments concerned the attached draft  of a Bill dealing only with the 1929 Convention has been prepared.   The Bill follows in general the form of the Geneva Convention Act of 1911.  In pursuance of a reservation made at  the time of signature a provision has been inserted to protect marks consisting of the Swiss Arms or imitations thereof which were in use prior to the 23rd December, 1931.     4... No objection need be expected to the provision for dealing with imitations of the Red Cross.  I understand however, that the War Office would not regard legislation as necessary to implement this obligation.   Similar provisions relating  to the Swiss Arms and imitations thereof may well give rise to criticism.  These were inserted in the Convention at the instance of the Swiss Delegate.   He stated that since traders could no longer use the Red Cross,  they had turned to the Swiss Arms which were commonly used for all kinds of objectionable purposes&apos;; the honour originally done to Switzerland by the use of her Arms as the basis of the Red Cross emblem had turned to her detriment.   The United Kingdom Delegate (at the instance of the Board of Trade)  resisted the proposal  to introduce protection of the  Swiss Arms on the ground that it was foreign to  the purpose of the  Convention.   But  he was alone in his objections  and  was ultimately instructed (in August  1929) to  come into line with  the  representatives of the other countries on the understanding  that  existingmarks were  protected.                       -2-
   5.   The necessary legislation will provide material for criticism apart from the point that we shall he asking a special favour for Switzerland who found herself unable to co-operate fully with other members of the League in regard to Sanctions, Except as &quot;regards the registration of trade marks, there is no similar legislation in force in this country for the protection of our own national Emblems such as the Union Jack.   The strict analogy to the present . proposal is a restriction on the use of British Emblems abroad,  but our; exporters would, I thinkj, be  averse to any such suggestion,,  and even more strongly against any proposal  that  they should not be allowed to use foreign emblems.   The provision may, however,  give point to the agitation in favour of prohibiting the import of goods bearing our national Emblems in connection with the Coronation.    It  will be recalled that much was heard of  this at the time of the  Silver Jubilee,  6,  The  Convention forbids the use of the Swiss Arms  and  imitations thereof &quot;whether as trade raarks or as parts  of such marks,  or  for a purpose contrary to commercial honesty or in circumstances  capable of wounding  Swiss national  sentiment&apos;1&apos;.   This  provision implies the exercise  of  discretion  on  the  part of the Government  and the  only  practicable  course  would appear  to be  to  prohibit  the use  of  the  emblems  in question without the  authority  of the  responsible Department, viz. 9 &quot;the Board of Trade.   This  plan is embodied in the  draft Bill but may well be  criticised as giving too arbitrary powers to a GovernmentDepartments
    7.  It  is  therefore probable  that  legislation may he contentious  and. it has no intrinsic  merits  to  set  against the  arguments on the other  side.   There is  in fact no reason for proceeding with  the  legislation  except  the obligation to bring certain provisions into  force by 23rd December next.   The Foreign Office see no way by which this country can properly escape from its commitment.   8. -A subsidiary point arises on Australia and India.Australia is bound by the Geneva Conventions Act,  1911, and has expressed a desire to contract out  of this Act andto pass new legislation dealing with both the 1906 and 1929Convention.   As she has not adopted the Statute of westminster this cannot be done until legislation is passed in this country..   In the case of India, the Government  ofIndia1s legal advisers take the view that India cannot legislate at all on this question unless empowered to do soby a specific provision in the United Kingdom Act  ofParliament.   Clause 2 of the Bill is designed to  cover  the case of Australia (and of New Zealand if she wishes to takethe same course) and also of India.   It may be added thatprohibitions cannot be enforced in the Colonies until theUnited Kingdom Act is passed.              A   L  * G*Yugoslavia and Switzerland, have already passed thenecessary legislation, and Japan, amongst others, haslegislation under consideration.  10. To sum up, my colleagues will see that the prospectof legislation on this subject is disagreeable.   None theless the obligation to legislate in the interests ofSwitzerland, exists.   I do not feel able to make any recommendation to the Cabinet on this question, and I shouldbe glad to know which of the following alternatives should,9.
