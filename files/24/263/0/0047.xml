SECRETCP. 217 (36).Copy No.  43CABINET.                     NOTE BY  THE ACTING SECRETARY.    AT the meeting of the Committee on Foreign Policy held on  Thursday,the 30th April,  Sir  Maurice Hankey was asked to  produce a summary of the criticisms directed against the idea of a League of Nations system of collective security which were  made before the Peace Conference.    The papers, though not very  numerous, were voluminous, and it was only possible to give the Committee an indication by quoting extracts annexed hereto.                                   (Signed)       R. B. HOW&amp;RTH,                                           Acting Secretary to the  Cabinet.    2  Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,          August 25, 1936.SUMMARY OF SOME OF THE CRITICISMS OF PROPOSALS FOR A LEAGUE OF NATIONS   SYSTEM OF COLLECTIVE SECURITY PRIOR TO THE PEACE CONFERENCE, 1919.1916.    The first record available in the Cabinet Office of a criticism of the proposedsystem of collective security  is one by Sir Maurice Hankey, dated the  25th May,1916.   It takes the form of  an office minute addressed to Mr. Balfour to whomColonel House,  on the 23rd May, 1916, had outlined his  proposals for a  Leagueof Nations.  A copy was sent to Mr. Asquith, the Prime Minister, on the following day, and it was read by  a number of Ministers.    2.  After  describing the scheme (which was very  similar to the  presentLeague system) the comment begins  as follows :          &quot; Generally,  it appears to me that any such scheme  is dangerous to us,    because it will create a sense of security which is wholly fictitious.&quot;    3.  After describing how Belgium had been lulled by the Treaty guarantee of 1839 into neglecting  its armaments, the minute continues :          &quot; It will, of  course, be urged that we should not fall into the error into    which Belgium fell; that we should always maintain our armaments on a    scale sufficient to deal with  our possible enemies.  For a time, no  doubt, this    would be the case,  but after the  generation which has experienced this war    has  passed away, this is more doubtful.  In fact, the danger of the proposi-    tion lies in the essential differences between the characteristics of the British    and German nations.         The English nation is essentially law-abiding.   It believes in inter-    national treaties as it believes in its own law and police, and nothing  appears    to shake its trustful confidence in such institutions.         An immense number of examples could, if necessary, be given of this, but     a few will suffice.  A few years before the war there were some of us who felt     very disturbed about the code of rules for the conduct of war commenced at     the  first Peace Conference, or,  perhaps, earlier still,  at the Declaration of       [13707-1]                                                    B                                                                      9 Q Q                 Printed for the Cabinet.  August 1936.
     Paris, and ending in the Declaration of London.   It was again and again     pointed out that our present enemies could not possibly be relied on to keep     these rules, and that, in all probability, the force of circumstances would be     such that  we would  be  compelled to  break them  ourselves.   All such     suggestions, however, were indignantly repudiated by the &quot;Government on the     advice  of  the  Foreign Office.    The sanctity of  international treaties was     regarded as almost equivalent to the sanctity of our own laws, although, it is     true, there were some cynics, particularly in the Admiralty,  who said  that     they had no objection to these agreements, because they knew they would fall     to pieces directly the guns began to go off.   It is  surely beyond dispute that     these Conventions have, on the whole, been a great drag on this country, as we     have had  to wait for the enemy to break  them before we could do so, but     fortunately few of them now remain to clog our efforts.&quot;     4.   Further examples are then  given of the British trust in internationallaw, after which the minute continues :           &quot; If the British nation has been so trustful in international undertakings     in matters relating to the war, and even during the war, in which the enemy     has proved to be unscrupulous and unreliable to an astonishing degree,  how     much, the  more so are they  likely to become trustful after a long interval     of peace ?   It seems  reasonable to  suppose that after the end  of the present     war financial and economic considerations will force peace on the world for     at least a generation.  During that time, no doubt, the proposed arrangement     will work perfectly well.  All differences between the nations which cannot     be adjusted by diplomatic means will be referred to the international body.     At the end of twenty-five years,  and  probably far before that, it will be     claimed as an entire success, and the peace (which is really due to economic     considerations) will be attributed to the new machinery.  What  a lever this     will be in the hands of the  enthusiasts for social reform and the anti-war     and disarmament people!  Is it not almost certain that they will persuade     the nation to go to sleep so far as its military preparations go, and to divert     its energies in other directions  of greater  immediate benefit  to the human     race ?&apos;&apos;     5.  The&apos; minute then dwells on the different mentality of some other nations and particularly Germany, following which it  continues  as below :-         &apos;&apos; What possible reliance could be placed on  international co-operation     to coerce Germany in such  a case ?   The nations of the world are almost     certain to be divided on the question  of its merits, and if this is not the     case half  of  them  will be  too frightened,  too  unconcerned, or too  self-     centred even to give  their opinion, much less to exert any form of pressure,     military or economic, on Germany.  The United States as likely as not will     be on the eve of a Presidential  Election and unwilling to take a hand.   In     any case, such a democratic country cannot be relied on to take any part in     European  affairs. .... And even if they  could  be relied on they would     be half-hearted about the business,  as nations only fight well, and only bring     economic pressure to bear effectively, when  their vital national interests are     concerned.  They do not fight well for abstract principles or justice, if they     fight at  all.         To sum up, then, it is submitted that-no advantage is likely to accrue     to this country, or to the world at large, from the adoption  of  the  scheme     proposed.  It will only result  in  failure,  and the longer that  failure is     postponed  the more certain it is that this country  will have  been lulled to     sleep.  It will put a very  strong lever into the hands of  the well-meaning     idealists who are  to  be found in almost every Government, who deprecate     expenditure on armaments, and, in course of time, it will almost certainly    result-in this country being  caught at a disadvantage.&quot;            p                 &apos;                         *            /1917.     6.  The  next reference to the subject occurs in the Report of a  Committeeof the Imperial Conference of 1917 on Economic and Non-Territorial Desiderata(p. 15), under the Chairmanship of Lord Milner, which included Mr. Henderson,
 Mr. Walter Long, Mr. H. A. L. Fisher, Sir Eyre Crowe and representatives of the  Dominions and India, including Sir Robert Burden and General Smuts.     The pertinent extract is as follows r-^&apos;         &quot;The Committee were deeply impressed with the danger of the complete     destruction of civilised society which threatens the world if the recurrence     of  a  war like the present cannot be prevented, and with the necessity of     devising means which would tend, at  any  rate,  to diminish the  risk of     such a calamity.  They felt, however, that any too comprehensive or ambitious     project to  ensure world peace  might  prove  not only impracticable,  but     harmful.   The proposal which  seems to promise the best  results proceeds     along  the  path of consultation  aiid conference for composing  differences     which cannot otherwise he adjusted.&quot;  .     7.  When  the Report was discussed at the  Imperial War  Cabinet on the.26th April, 1917, the Prime Minister, Mr. Lloyd George, rather reproached the Committee for having thrown cold water on the idea of the League of Nations.     8.  Lord Robert  Cecil then mentioned  that he had written  a memorandumon Limitation of Armaments &quot;hut confessed that he had been driven out of hisposition by the criticisms contained  in an examination of that memorandum bySir Eyre Crowe.&quot;  It was, therefore, decided that  Lord Robert  Cecils  and SirEyre Crowe&apos;s memoranda should be  circulated.     9.  Lord Robert  Cecils  memorandum,  a short one (undated but evidentlyprepared in the autumn of 1916), which was headed &quot; Proposals for Diminishingthe Occasion of Future Wars,&quot; provided for a conference of the Powers to dealwith any difference or controversy arising out of the eventual Peace Treaty, anda guarantee of the Treaty, if necessary,  by force of  arms (p. 18).     10.   With Lord Robert  Cecihs  memorandum  was  circulated  a  long com-mentary by Sir Eyre  Crowe,  dated the  12th October, 1916.   This memorandum is to be circulated (if copies are available)  or passed round to the Committee.Nevertheless, to complete  this summary  a few extracts  are appended :         &quot;A pan-cosmopolitan  conference   of this  type will  possess  in an    exaggerated form all the vices of the old concert of Europe, the principal    of these being that it is formidable  as an instrument of passive obstruction,    but correspondingly  feeble as an engine of  development and well-directed    effort towards progress.                   -5V           W           &apos;/V                      ^MF        The first case is that of a violation  or attempted  violation  of  the    guaranteed territorial status quo. Until the attempt has actually been made    to induce  the  Powers to assume   definite  responsibility  for  preventing    violation of the status quo and  to  pledge themselves jointly and singly to    common coercive  action against any State breaking this solemn  covenant,    it must remain a  matter  for speculation whether such a defensive union of    all the Powers is  in fact possible.                   VF&quot;           -7V&quot;           -ft-          W           -TV-        For the purpose  of the present discussion it will be assumed that  the    solemn  league and covenant between all the nations can be and  will be    established.   But it is necessary to observe that this is a treaty,  like  other    treaties.  What is there to ensure  that it will not, like other treaties, be    broken?  Lord R. Cecil himself points to the danger  that a strong and    aggressive  group  of  Powers might  ignore all treaties.   This danger  is to    be overcome by the strength of the coercive machinery to be put into operation    against the offender.  This strength, however,  is not an absolute quantity;    it is strictly relative,  and itself  a function of the grouping of the Powers.    The various causes bringing about such groupings need not here be examined,-    but it is well not to forget that the real  force which can alone bind together    all the Powers in opposition to a disturber of the status quo is a moral one.    It resides ultimately  in the conviction that the  status quo to be maintained    is desirable and just.   Once the idea gains ground  that,  owing to whatever    circumstances, the territorial  arrangement is no longer just or  desirable,    there will inevitably be a loosening of the ties uniting the Powers in common      [13707-1]                                            : -   B 2
 resistance to a change however  brought  about,  and defections from  the conservative group  to the group  favouring a  change will be  facilitated. Every State which the aggressive group can win over to its side counts double in  the  balance, like transferred party votes  in a parliamentary  division, and,  what  is  perhaps even  more  important, every weakening of  the conservative group  proportionately increases the  difficulties  and dangers attending its forcible intervention.  It tends, more particularly, to  expose those States which are unfavourably situated geographically, to added risks of invasion and destruction.     What, in such a situation  is  the  value  of the  solemn covenant, and what are  the chances  that the pledge  of  common coercive action will  be redeemed?   It is  difficult to avoid the conclusion that the chances will  be ruled by  the respective weights in  the balance of power, just  as they have been hitherto.  When a combination of Powers  commands a preponderance of  force using the word  &apos; force&apos;  in  its widest sense and  the necessary means of aggression, there can be no certainty that an effort on its part to alter  the territorial settlement for  its own  benefit  will be actively resisted by  the rest of the world.  The degree of probability whether  there will  be such resistance  or not will be found to  depend on how far the threatened disturbance would directly or indirectly affect  the position of the individual State, and on the balance of forces marshalled, or available to be marshalled, on  either side.    It may be that Powers which  might hesitate to embark on dangerous and costly military operations  would  show  greater  readiness  to join  in measures of  commercial blockades and financial  boycott.  But  this, at best, is only relatively true.   Supposing  a combination of a strong Germany and a strong Russia, is it to be expected that Austria, Servia, Roumania, Sweden, Denmark,  Holland and Switzerland would unhesitatingly declare a general boycott against all  German and Russian  trade and  finance ?   It may  be predicted with some assurance that they would do so only if entirely confident that their own territories would not  be overrun by their powerful neighbours. And supposing those territories were so overrun, would the  prospect  of speedily reducing such a compact mass of territory to  a state of economical helplessness by means of blockade and boycott be so definitely assured as  to overcome  all apprehensions and hesitations ?    jfe          - : 4fe &apos;         &apos;.&apos;&apos; : Jfe  -        - -. Jfc -         - &apos; jfr -&apos;.         &apos;&apos; Jfc    -7V-           &quot;7V          -7T            W           -7I-           -ft-    As a means of preventing a war  over a question  on which Powers will not compromise, a conference could function successfully only if  it abandoned the fundamental principle of its constitution, which  is the requirement  of unanimity of decisions,  which, in  turn,  is based on the  sovereignty,  inde- pendence and equality of the States represented.  If a diplomatic assembly abandoned the principles of unanimity and proceeded to arrive at decisions by votes of majorities, it would cease to  be distinguishable from a court  of arbitration, save as  regards the personal qualifications of its members and the latitude  of its procedure.  Given a really grave difference of views  or aims, in respect to which  one  or more Powers  are determined not to give way to the majority, the risk of  an armed conflict is not avoided by substi- tuting a diplomatic  conference for an arbitration court.    This is the  compelling principle of the &apos; sanction &apos;; in other words, the certainty that force will be applied to  restrain evildoers.  It  is explicitly recognised in the scheme; but the proposal to make the scheme palatable by suggesting blockade  and boycott as the weapons to  be more  particularly employed,  tends to obscure the fact  that  coercion ultimately means military action, bodily fighting.   It is as useless as it would be dangerous to conceal this.  Even if it be granted that commercial  and financial pressure alone may suffice in the end to bring  any modern State to its knees, it must not be forgotten that at best this requires time.  What  is there to prevent the timebeing utilized to invade, conquer or paralyze the boycotting countries, or a sufficient  number of them?  The pressure is  exercised by  the bodies  andibrains of live persons.   Kill, capture or incapacitate these persons, and their blockading and boycotting  comes  to  an end.
         If, therefore, the State, or group of States, to be coerced possesses strong     military forces and is  prepared to use them, the opposing combination of     Powers  on their side must be in  a position to overcome  or  contain  those     forces in good  time.  It is all a question of real military preponderance.     Such preponderance does not  reside in mere numbers theoretically available.     Organisation:  readiness; sufficiency of materials and supplies; rapid means     of communication; unity of command; compactness of territory and favour-     able frontier lines;  all these  are elements which enter  into the calculation     of superiority  and may,  in  combination, prove  more than  a  match for     numerically much larger forces composed of contingents of diverse nationali-     ties,  speaking  different  languages and obeying  different  sovereigns, not     trained to act together  or to follow a strange leader, separated, maybe,  from     one  another by  wide stretches of sea and  land, and possibly divided by the     interposition of enemy territory.   Yet unless the forces at the disposal of     the league of Powers are at the outset, and in fact during peace, established     on such a footing, as regards both numbers and all other elements of  military     strength, as will ensure  immediate and certain,  not  to  say overwhelming,     superiority on the  decisive spot over  any  possible recusants in arms,  there     can  be little confidence that the weaker and more exposed  members of the     general league will unhesitatingly stand to their undertaking and risk  their     own safety in upholding the common cause.         The  balance  of power  reappears  as the fundamental  problem.  To     prevent the possibility of any one State or group of States pursuing,  through     war and bloodshed, a policy of aggression and domination, nothing will  serve     but adequate force.&quot;        -U-           Jfe          4fc           fc           4fe        TP           TP                      TP          - TP. -           SJJiThere follow some interesting and in some respeqts very prophetic observations on the probable results  of an attempt at disarmament.     11.  The result  of the resumption of the Imperial War Cabinefs discussions on the 1st May, 1917, is recorded in the Minutes in the following terms :          &quot; Lord Robert  Cecil read to  the  Imperial War Cabinet a suggested     clause in the Terms of Peace  by which it was agreed that, in case of any     difference or controversy,  a Conference should be  forthwith  summoned, and     no action taken until that Conference had considered  the matter, or for     three months after the meeting of the Conference.   Each of the high contract-     ing Powers should bind itself to enforce this agreement by cutting off all     financial and commercial intercourse from an offending  Power.         General Smuts suggested that  the precise nature of the sanction to be     imposed  would  have to be worked  out later.   It  would be sufficient if the     Imperial War  Cabinet  expressed itself in general terms  in favour of the     principle of a sanction.         The Imperial War Cabinet concurred in this view.&quot;     12.  The Imperial War Cabinet also expressed the view that  limitation ofarmaments should be discussed with the United States of America in connectionwith  any conversations on  the question of a  League of Peace.    (I.W.C. 13,Minutes&apos;3 and 4.)     13.  The next development was the appointment late in 1917 by Mr. Balfour,on the recommendation of Lord Robert Cecil, of a Foreign Office Committee underthe  Chairmanship of Lord  Phillimore to enquire into the various schemes for establishing, by means of the League of Nations or other device, some alternative to war as a  means  of settling international disputes.   The members  of theCommittee were :             Professor Pollard.             Sir Julian Corbett.             Doctor J. Holland Rose.             Sir Eyre Crowe.            Sir William Tyrrell.            Mr. (afterwards  Sir Cecil) Hurst.    14.  The  Committee attached  to its  report, dated the 20th March, 1918,a draft Convention for setting up a League of Nations.  The contracting  parties
were to agree not to go to war with one another without submitting the dispute to arbitration or,a conference of the  members.  Militaiw,  naval, financial andeconomic sanctions were provided for the case  of  a breach of the  Covenant.&quot; Member States which cannot make an effective contribution of military or naval force shall at the least take the other measures indicated in this Article.&quot;  ThePhillimore Committee took no evidence from the Services.  Sir Maurice Hankeyis  the  only witness mentioned and he was examined only on  a scheme he had prepared  for developing  a League of Nations  out of the  already existing international machinery created  by the Allies for the  purposes of the war :  ascheme which did not provide  for sanctions.    The  official  summary  of  his evidence occupies  only  a page and a half of typescript,  but his recollection isthat he developed fully the views in his memorandum of  May  1916,  alreadyquoted.  In any event, it must be supposed that Sir Eyre Crowe, as a member ofthe Committee must have developed this side of the case.  The Phillimore report is  a very brief one  and does not go into detail and the following passage contains the only hint that  the difficulties  of collective security had been considered :           &quot; It may  be suggested that in this case &quot; (i.e., where a State refused to    abide by the award of the Conference) &quot;the whole power  of the League    should be used to enforce submission, but we have felt a doubt whether States    would contract to do this, and still greater doubt whether,  when the time    came, they would fulfil their contract.  Most  of  the writers on this subject    have hesitated to recommend such  a provision.&quot;It should be noted that the Phillimore  report was  not published.    15.  There  were few commentaries made by Government Departments  onthe Phillimore report.  By far the most  interesting is one by the Admiraltydated the 23rd December, 1918 (P. 78), for the reason that it  contains the onlyexpression of Service opinion on the subject to be found in the records  of  theCabinet  Office.  Their remarks  on the  proposed League of Nationsfollows : &apos;         &quot; There can be no naval  objection to a  scheme  of conferences and    correlated judicial, economic and administrative bodies designed to  lessen    the risk of  international disagreement and consequently  of war.  Such a    scheme is a matter of policy for the judgment of the civil Governments.         When, however, it is  proposed that the Powers should enter into certain    binding covenants designed to prevent war, the Admiralty feel that  it is a    serious   matter  to  enter into  such  covenants,  which  will in  certain    contingencies result in an obligation to take joint naval and military action    with certain Powers against another  Power or Powers, without  regard to;    the wisdom of the step as a purely naval  and military proposition.  The    recalcitrant Power or Powers may be assumed,  ex  hypothesi,  to have made    preparations for war;  the Powers attempting to enforce the jurisdiction of    the League will, also ex hypothesi, have made no combined preparations other    than  such as  will  be known to the recalcitrant Power or Powers.   This    creates, particularly in naval  warfare,  a  position of considerable danger.    The difficulties and disabilities of an international  fleet, hastily collected    on the outbreak of war, might well be  such  as  to lead to its defeat by a    single well-directed navy of half  its size, and  command of the sea is  too    essential a weapon to allow  it even to run the  danger  of  being lost  to  the    League in such a manner.        Apart,  moreover,  from this  strictly professional consideration,  the    Admiralty cannot  ignore the possibility that the  success of  a League  of    Nations  in  diminishing armaments (which  is  presumed to be one  of  its    objects  equally with the  prevention of war) may be delayed rather than    advanced by the immediate adoption of these binding covenants.  In their    view the existence  of a state of mutual confidence among the Powers is  a    condition precedent to effective organisation for peace, and covenants entered    into before that confidence has had time to develop may impair its growth.    The Admiralty  have a definite responsibility for the defence of the  sea    communications of the  Empire and of its territories  from oversea attack.    It appears,to them  that (until in course of time the international intercourse    of the League creates  a new atmosphere)  that  responsibility is in no way  ,  diminished.  If, in addition, His Majesty&apos;s Government are under covenant to
M2     go to war in certain circumstances from motives other than those of self-     protection,  and cannot  put  complete  confidence  in  the  effective  naval     co-operation of  other  members of the League,  the responsibility of the     Admiralty is actually increased, and  the estimate of the  required  strength     of the Navy may also have to be increased.   As the strongest naval Power     Great Britain may be  in a  somewhat exceptional position in this  respect;     but,  in  so far  as  similar considerations operate universally, a  scheme of     binding covenants may defeat  its own object.&quot;     16.   Both the  Phillimore report and  the Admiralty remarks  quoted above came before a meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet on the 24th December, 1918. By that time, however, the  Imperial War  Cabinet had received General Smuts&apos; well-known memorandum  which was  afterwards published  (P.  44)  and the discussion dealt mainly with his proposals and  was on broad lines.  The very full minutes of the meeting show that no discussion took place on the principles of  collective security in detail.  Lord Robert Cecil dealt  much more  strongly on  the advantages of a League of Nations  from the point of view of conciliation rather than sanctions, for example :          &quot; The object was not so much coercion, as to procure delay and force the     parties to come to an opinion and submit their dispute to the highest authority     the world could supply.         Should war  ensue, he believed it would be possible in this way to confine     it to very narrow limits,  and to prevent a world-wide conflagration such as     we had just suffered.  This  plan was  in accordance with  the report of the     Phillimore Committee and with the latest statements of President Wilson.&quot;     17.   Nearly all those who took part in the discussion adopted the same kind of  line.   Lord Reading, for example, just back from America with President Wilson, was very strong in his warnings against asking too much of the League:          &quot; If you tried at this stage to guard against the causes of future  war,     the League of Nations was doomed to failure.&quot; Mr. Lloyd George, in his summing up          &quot; Quite  agreed, however, that in  the League of Nations it would be a     mistake to attempt too much.&quot;     18.   It may be said, therefore, that in their last sessions  before  the Peace Conference, the general view  of  the Imperial War Cabinet was in favour  of a League in which the emphasis was on conciliation rather than sanctions. 1919.     19.   It would  be beyond  the scope  of this  summary to pursue the subject through   the tortuous  labyrinth  of  the  Paris  Peace  Conference.   Broadly speaking, it may be said that the British and American delegations, which worked very closely together, were in favour of a League of Nations in which conciliation predominated and force was in the  background.   The French conception of  the League of Nations, on  the other hand, put sanctions in the forefront, and  the French scheme provided for international forces, international general staff, and a League of Nations which, in  effect,  was a super State.    20   The discussions of the  League of Nations Commission at Paris over which President Wilson himself presided,  proceeded  with great speed  and secrecy.  It was extremely difficult  to keep track of what was  happening.   Theminutes were circulated on an average eleven days after the meeting; the shortestperiod was four days and on one occasion they were as late as a month.  It wasin the course of these meetings that our representatives (Lord Robert Cecil  andGenera] Smuts) agreed to the present provisions of the Covenant.    21.  There is no mention in the  records of the British Empire delegation ofany discussion in which were raised the kind of criticisms that had been made bySir Eyre  Crowe and  others  in the earlier  consideration  given  to the idea of a league of Nations.  Neither does the Military Section ever seem to have circulated a memorandum on the  subject, although those who were present at  the PeaceConference will recollect that Field-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson was unsparing inhis  personal criticisms of the commitments we were undertaking.
    22.  To sum up, it has not been possible to trace that any reply was everformulated to the criticisms of the principles of collective security, in which theweaknesses which have since become so evident were quite clearly forecast.  Thosecriticisms,  however, undoubtedly exercised considerable effects on the minds ofthose responsible, with the result that the British Empire representatives enteredon the Peace Conference with the idea of a League devoted (in its early days atany rate) mainly to conciliation and probably not involving very definite commit-ments.  At the League, however, we encountered views which went very far inthe opposite direction, and the result was in the nature of a compromise whichwas generally held at the time to be a  rebuff to  the French and a success to theAnglo-American view.
