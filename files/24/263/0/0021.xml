Printed for the Cabinet.  July  1936.Gbpy N6iCABINET,EXPORT  CREDITS  FOR RUSSIAN ORDERS.          Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    IT will be remembered that on the 17th  January, 1934, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer circulated to the Cabinet a joint memorandum from the treasury and the Board of Trade (CP.  11 (34)) pointing  out the very unsatisfactorysituation arising from, the failure of His&apos; Majesty&apos;s Government to Utilise the balances in  British  banks  belonging  to  the  former Russian Government,commonly known as the &quot; Baring balances,&quot; and the  advantages of utilising thesebalances for necessitous British creditors of Russia, but concluding that no action could  be taken in the matter except in agreement with the Soviet Government.    2.  On the  18th  May, 1935, Sir John Simon,  then Secretary of  State forForeign Affairs, wrote to the Chancellor  of the Exchequer pointing out that thesituation had been changed by  the  signature of the Anglo-Sbviet commercial agreement, and suggesting that Messrs. Baring should be asked to agree totransfer the balances to His Majesty&apos;s Government in return for an indemnityin respect of any claims by the  Soviet Government, who would be  informed ofthe intention to use the money for the deserving creditors  and advised in theirown interest to  let the matter pass without  comment, as  there was  reason tothink they might do.    3.  The  Treasury,  however, were  unwilling to press Messrs. Baring to surrender the balances  without  a definite renunciation of the Soviet Govern-ment&apos;s claim on  them; and it was then proposed to include the Baring balances in the money to  be made available for the creditors under the scheme for a loan to the Soviet Government, as explained, in the last paragraph of my memorandumof the 8th February (CP. 32 (36)).  The  reasons there given for thinking that an offer of credits, apart from a loan, would not suffice  to induce the Soviet Govern-ment  to renounce their claim to the balances are no longer  so cogent, since it is unlikely that credits  will be  available frcrii France owing  to the high rates ofinterest now prevailing there, or that the  Soviet Government will wish to increasethe amount of credit already given to them in Germany.  It  would therefore seem desirable,  since it has been  decided by His Majesty&apos;s Government to offer creditson  a  considerable scale, to make  a serious effort, in accordance with the spiritof the Cabinet Conclusions of the 12th February, to obtain the renunciation ofthese  claims in return  for the offer of really substantial credits.    4.  I cannot guarantee that this attempt will be successful; but the reasons why we should at  least  try to secure something for the creditors seem to me asstrong as they seemed to my predecessors, Sir John Simon and Sir Samuel Hoare.These. reasons are summarised in the second part of the last paragraph of my memorandum CP. 32 (36).       8696  [13446]SECRET.C:P; 191 (36).
    5.  Nor would any sacrifice be imposed upon this country by obtaining  the balances by such means on the contrary,  I am convinced, as  I was when that document was circulated, that a really substantial advance to the Soviet Govern-ment  would be of great  advantage to British trade.   Indeed,  it seems the solemeans of securing any real increase in Soviet imports of British manufactureswithout  denouncing the present Anglo-Soviet Commercial Agreement.  All  theevidence goes to show that the Soviet Government are hot how in  such need ofgoods from abroad, nor in such difficulty over paying for them in cash, that theywould welcome credits merely for the sake of obtaining the goods on credit terms.What they would welcome, on the other hand, is something which would show  theworld that His Majesty&apos;s Government regards them as &quot;a good risk&quot; from  the credit point of view.  A really large long-term credit  on  favourable terms would thus be of value to them for reasons of political  and financial prestige; it wouldvindicate, so they hope,  their  ability  to borrow money  at  a moderate rate ofinterest, and it would bring nearer the day when the London money market willbe freely  open to them as borrowers.   For these reasons, apparently, they  are definitely desirous of raising a large credit in London; and,  though one cannot,of course, be certain on the point,  we might be  able,  by negotiating for such a credit, both to secure the Baring balances and to  obtain a much-needed outlet  forour exporting industries, which have hitherto derived disappointingly little benefit from the Commercial Agreement.    6.  It will be realised that an arrangement  of this  nature will involve  thefinal and public abandonment of the hope of securing  anything  like a full settle-ment of  the claims of the British  creditors of Russia; but since it is now clearthat that hope can never be realised without measures, such as  a loan, which  weare not read^ to take, His Majesty&apos;s Government would only be laying up troublefor themselves in the future by permitting its continuance, and it would be betterboth for them and the creditors if  they made the admission  now and were ableto couple it with the announcement that they had, at least, secured the Baringbalances, rather than allowed the matter to drag on, with damaging consequences,through a refusal to face the facts.    7.  I therefore urge that the  Cabinet  should authorise the three ministers most  concerned with  this  question the  Chancellor of  the   Exchequer,  thePresident of the Board  of  Trade  and myself to consider  the best means of ascertaining  from the Soviet  Government whether they would renounce  their claim to the Baring balances in  return for commercial  credits and, if  so,  forcredits of what length and what amount.                                                                   A. E.    Foreign Office, July 1, 1936.
