IRISH SITUATION COMMITTEE.       THE PROPOSED PISOUSSIONS  ON -ALL OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS                   BETWEEN THE TWO GOVERNMENTS.                         REPORT.  1.     At  their Meeting on June  23rd (Cabinet  43 (36)  Conclusion  8)  the Cabinet had before them our  Report  (Paper No.  CP. 171(36))  on  the new Irish  Free  State  Constitutional proposals  mentioned  in  Paper CP. 167 (36),  end  agreed  inter alia  that the reply  in  the form set out  in the Appendix to that  Report, which  indicated  our willingness to open discussions  on all  the out-  standing questions now at issue  between the  two Governments,  should be  sent to Mr.  De Vflerars communication of 8th June, and  that  the Committee should, complete  their examination  of Paper  No. CP., 124 (36) and  submit their  recommendations thereon  to  the Cabinet  as early as  practicable,  and in  any case  before the  Summer Recess.  2.     While no formal  reply has yet  been  received from the  Irish Free  State  Government  to the  communication made  accordingly  to  that Government on  June 24th., there is good reason to believe  that Mr. De Valera will  raise no objection to  the proposal  that  informal discussions between Officials  of  the  two Governments  for a. settlement  should  take place.  3.     Since the Meeting of  the  Cabinet referred to above,  a  fresh development has  occurred in the form of  a public  statement by Mr. De Valera  in the  Dail on  24th  June, in  which he  announced  his intention of  abolishing  the  office  of  Governor-General  and providing for an  elected President  as ceremonial head  of the State.   He added, in  reply  to a  question, that &quot;the person                           -1-
who will occupy the new office will he elected by the people and will represent the people and no-one else&quot;.   On 7thJuly the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs had a prolongedconversation with Mr. De Valera, in the course of which it became clear that  the latter?s present intention is that in his new constitutional proposals the Grown should have no place in theinternal affairs of the Irish Free State.   For convenience ofreference a Note of this conversation is attached as Appendix Ito this Report.4.     In the second paragraph of our previous Report (CP.171(36))it was stated that the Government of the Irish Free State proposedto introduce in the Autumn a Bill to set up /their new constitution.It has since been ascertained on very good authority that theproposed Bill is not yet in draft, that it is improbable that itwill be ready for introduction in the Dail before late in theAutumn at the earliest, and that it may well be that it will notbe ready for introduction before next Spring.5.     In these circumstances it would seem that more time willprobably be available than rppeared lihely a month ago.Nevertheless, we agree with the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs that from every point of view it is desirable to expedite the proposed discussions between Officials of the twoGovernments, and we hope that it will be possible for these discussions to begin early in September next.  With this end inview we have very carefully examined the proposals in CP.124(36)for settling the outstanding questions between the Irish FreeState and this country with the object of framing instructionsto the United Kingdom Officials which would enable them, in theforthcoming discussions, to put forward proposals as forming abasis for settlement, on the understanding that the Irish FreeState remains a Dominion inside the Commonwealth.
 60      As  regards the  constitutional  issue,  the  position has altered as indicated above since  the  Cabinet had before them the  original Memorandum (CP.  124 (56)) by  the Secretary of State  for Dominion  Affairs, and  we have considered  the proposals  in that Memorandum in the light of these subsequent developments. 7.      We  have had the benefit of a full  examination of the position by the Home Secretary,  the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, the  Minister for  Co-ordination of Defence and the Attorney-General,  the  results of  which are set out  in the memorandum attached  as Appendix II  to this Report. 8.      We  are in full  agreement  with  this document,  the conclusions  of which are set out in paragraphs 10 and  II,  and we  recommend that this Paper should be  treated by the  United Kingdom representatives  as their authoritative instructions for the conduct  of discussions on the constitutional issues, We  think th; t  our representatives should  be  instructed to emphasise, not only the  aspect of allegiance,  but also  that of the will to  co-operate which,  as shown by paragraph  12  of Appen- dix II,is  also fundamental to  the idea, of the  British  Common- wealth.    As  the  Secretary of  State&apos;s talk with Mr.  De  Valera shows,  the latter aspect  is that  to which Mr,  De  Valera  attaches importance,  and  to  lay emphasis  on  this aspect as well  might therefore  serve  to  improve the general atmosphere and  the prospect of  success in the negotiations. 0.     On  the  question of  the  suggested statement, to the effect that the Irish Free State  is mistress of  her own  destiny, discussed  in paragraphs 15-18  of  CP. 124  (36), we have ccn- ferred with the Secretary  of State for India who  saw great difficulty from the point  of view of political reactions in India in agreeing to any declaration of general application of the kind contemplated being made by the United KingdomGovernment.                           -3-
j*t gj1 10.     We recommend thr t the instructions to our represent- atives  on this matter should he that without further express authority they should not put forward as a proposal the making of any  such declaration by the United Kingdom, but that the possibility that some declaration of the kind might be of decisive help in the negotiations should be kept in mind. On the  other hand they should not be precluded from indicating in conversation that in their personal view the Irish Free State was free to choose to remain in the Commonwealth and be treated as a full member, or to go out of the Commonwealth and be treated as a friendly foreign State.   We think that such an informal suggestion that the United Kingdom Government would not he greatly exercised in the latter eventuality might have a good effect on the Irish, prevent them imagining that they can &quot;bluff&quot; us into concessions, and bring them up against realities. 11o     As regards Defence, we recommend that our representatives should put forward the proposals submitted by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee in Paper 416-0$, of which a copy is attached as Annex II to CP. 124 (36), and which were subsequently approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence at their 278th Meeting on 12th May, 1936. 12.     As regards the financial dispute, which must be regarded as covering both the payments in respect of which the Irish Free State is in default and the special duties imposed by us in consequence of that default,  our representatives should not&apos; be authorised to put forward any definite proposals,  but they should indicate our willingness to consider whatever suggestions for a comprehensive settlement  of this aspect of the problem the   ,; Irish Free State might wish to  offer.    We ought to make it clear that  we doubt whether  in fact the Irish Free State will be able to put  forward any suggestions  likely to be acceptable to  us, and this point  will  certainly give rise to difficulty in thediscussions.    On the  other hand we naturally do not wish  to
 give away anything unnecessarily  and  the Special Duties are  our strongest bargaining  counter.   We  propose  therefore that our position in this matter  should be entirely  reserved until we are in a position to  see what prospect  there  is of obtaining a satisfactory  settlement  on  the other  items, especially the constitutional  issue.    Great care  must, of course, be taken to avoid convejring the impression thr t we  are  anxious by making some financial  sacrifice to purchase  the allegiance of the Irish Free State. 13.     As regards economic relations generally, our represent- atives should be authorised to indicate that, subject to a satisfactory arrangement being reached  in regard to the financial issue, we should be prepared- to negotiate a general trade agreement which, provided that the Irish Free State were prepared to offer adequate reciprocal advantages, would put them in a sim- ilar position to the Dominions with which agreements were made at Ottawa in 1932. 14.     As regards citizenship, we recommend  that our represent- atives should be authorised to indicate thrt citizens of the Irish Free State would continue to be entitled to the privileges accorded by us  to British subjects in this  country or elsewhere, in particular to admission to service under the Crown,  admission to the United Kingdom for purposes of employment,  whether permanent or temporary, and the right of protection in foreign countries. 15o     Our representatives should also be authorised to indicate, as regards  the development of the Trans-Atlantic air  services, that the Irish Free State would be entitled to participate as a full partner in the development of these services  on  the lines discussed at Ottawa in December,  1935. 16.     It  must be clearly understood by our representatives  thatwhile  they  are at  liberty,  subject as stated above, to  discuss                           -5-
       individual  proposals,  they  must make  it  clear  at  the  outset       that  the  object  of  the discussions  is  to  find  a basis for  a       general and comprehensive settlement,  and that any  proposals       that  they may make  are subject to the  ultimate conclusion  of       such  a settlement and  fall  completely  to  the ground in the       event of  the  discussions proving abortive.   Subject  to this,       our representatives should  present  the proposals  to the Irish       Free  State  representatives  as a whole, and should be  prepared       to discuss  them  in  any order which  seems  likely to  lead to       satisfactory  results.       17.     In  the event of it  appearing that Mr.  De  Valera would       insist on constitutional changes which,  in  our view,  were  in-       consistent  with  continued membership of  the British Commonwealth       of Nations  by the Irish Free State, our representatives may       well  have to  be  prepared to put forward a different set of                  the       proposals on/various subjects, which would be  based on a       relationship  between the two countries conforming to  that       between friendly foreign States.   A certain amount of inter-       departmental  work on this problem is still being  done,  and if       necessary we  shall  report on it to  the Cabinet at a later  stage.       18.     We  accordingly recommend to the Cabinet :              (l) That the Secretary of State for Dominion                  Affairs should be authorised  to inform  Mr.                  De Valera  that  our representatives will be                  ready to start discussions early in                  September.              (2) That our representatives should be author-                  ised to discuss a posaible basis of a                  general and comprehensive  settlement  on                  the  lines  set out in paragraphs 6  to  16                  of this Report.                               Signed on behalf of the  Committee                                       STANLEY  BALDWIN                                          Chairman.&apos; Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1.   84th July,  1936.                            -6-
/G A B I 17 Z TSlilUliONJO KITT:J i.,C. (32) 108.no.           Relations ^\7itii jtiie Jlrisii Xree State.      Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs       containing a note of his conversation with               Ilr. de Valera.          I had a long talk with Mr. de Valera on the evening of July 7th when he was passing through London on his way from geneva to Dublin.  I told hi:.i that I hoped VIE should he ablesoon to commence the informal discussions which we had proposed,but that I was not in a position yet to give him any indication of the results of our examination of the outstanding problems which we were to try to settle.    But I said that I had noticedthe many references which he had made in his recent speeches tothe need of special friendship between the peoples of theIrish Free State and of Great Britain, and to his own desire forthat.     I of course agreed with his sentiment.  He had nowbeen thinking and speaking about the problem of the relationsbetween the Irish Free State and this country for many years;I wondered whether he could give me some clear idea of whatconclusions he had reached, and exactly what form he thought the relations between these two friendly countries should take,and what he had in mind in proposing a new Irish Free StateGons ti tut ion.
          Hr*Dulanty,  who was present most of the time, IiaeLtold iae beforehand that he feared Mr, de Valera would notrespond to this approach and that the conversation wouldprobably be over in half-an-kour.   But L&apos;.r.  de Valera spokefrankly and in a very friendly spirit throughout, and the conversation continued for four hours.  It is perhaps an indication of his present practical mood that in the course of ithe never mentioned Oliver Cromwell or any character or event whichtroubled. Ireland prior to 1921.          An account which attempted to reproduce all theexchanges which tool: place in so long a talk would he tedious.tho following is a summary of tho views which Mr. de Valeraexpressed, which represents accurately I believe his presentposition, with some account of my own contributions to the talkwhere that is necessary for a clearer definition of hisattitu.de.     1.    he said that in his new Constitution the Crown would cease to perform any function, or to have any functionsperformed on its behalf, in the internal affairs of the Irishhree State.  But in matters of common concern between the nations of the British Commonwealth - such as foreign relations,defence, etc.  - the Irish free State would co-operate fully,and for these purposes the Xing would he recognised as the headof the Commonwealth.     2.   Ideally he would; like Ireland to be a completelyindependent Republic.   But many circumstances made this idealunattainable.   Amongst those circumstances was the division ofopinion amongst the Irish people themselves, between those whofavoured a complete breach with the Covrionwealth and the                                                 declaration
declaration of a Republic,  and those who wished to remain in theCioi-ivionwealth and under the monarchy.     his personal preferencewas for an independent hepublic, hub above all else  he wishedfor a United Ireland,  and therefore in 1921 he had given&apos; careful thought to the possibility of finding some compromise which would ultimately bring the majority and the minority in Ireland together.He had consider! what was the furthest that he and those whoagreed with him could go to meet the feelings of the northernmajority and those who agreed with them.  This was the explanation of his proposal for the abolition of the Grown in internal affairs and its maintenance in external affairs.   It wasa compromise.   He could not possibly go further in the directionof compromise;  if he did,  he himself would be overthrown by his followers.  The dislike of the Grown amongst his people wasintense; the suggestion that it should be retained to performfunctions concerning all the external affairs of the Free state would be greatly criticised, but he was ready to advocate that,and thought he could advocate it successfully.  Fven if he were willing to advocate more than that, and If he were to carry theday immediately, the success would he temporary.  What he wishedfor was some settlement which would Have some prospect of beingpermanent.     3.   He thought that such a constitution as he had in mindwould enable the Irish Free State to remain a member of theBritish Commonwealth.   I said that I could, only express a tentative personal view, but that I thought this v/ould not be thecase.   The nations of the Commonwealth were all free nations,but if they wished to remain fee nations inside the Commonwealth,enjoying the advantages of membership, the;- must accept certain                                                  fundamental
fundamental principles governing their special relationship.Otherwise their special association would mean nothing, wouldhe no different to their relationship with other free nations who were not members of the Commonwealth, and there would heno case for their giving special advantages to each other whichthey did not extend to those other nations.  One of thosefundamental principles,  it seemed to me,  was allegiance to theCrown.          Mr.  de Yalera said he agreed that there must he somefundamental principle of association.   But he did not agree thatallegiance to the Crown was necessary.  It was impossible to expect the Irish people to recognise allegiance to the King ofGreat Britain.   I replied that it was not a question of owingallegiance to the King of Great Britain,  but to the King ofthe Commonwealth.     Mr. de Valera said that he did not thinksuch allegiance was necessary.  lie thought there was only onefundamental principle that must unite the members of theCommonwealth.,  and that was the will to co-operate in all mattersof common concern, such as defence and trade.  Ee and his peoplehad that will;   it was untrue that there was any strong anti-British feeling amongst the majority of Irishmen;  lie and theywere anxious for very close co-operation;  what was preventingit was the present sense of domination by Great Britain, whichwas expressed in the position of the British Crown in theinternal affairs of the Tree State.          Ze said that one of the difficulties of recent years had been that we on our side had continually insisted on thePree State maintaining forms which were not necessary for itscontinued membership of the Coivoonwealth.  Por long we had                                                     insisted
insisted on the Oath of Allegiance in the hail;  yet when hehad abolished the oath we ourselves had been forced to admit thatits abolition did not mean that the Irish Free State went out ofthe Commonwealth.   In the same way we had insisted on the officeof Governor-General being retained.  how he proposed to abolish                                              zould have no more                                              I replied that our            :he oath had been that it was written into the treaty and tnerefore ought not be abolished without the agreement of theparties  to the Treaty.  I agreed that the taking of the oath hadnot been of such importance that it was essential if the FreeState were to remain a Dominion.  It was possible that tho -office of G-governor-General was also not an essential requirement;its abolition might not,  by itself, involve the separation of theFree State from the Commonwealth.     The Governor-General was merely a representative of something;   that something, whichwas the Crown, did seem to me to be of fundamental importance.If the Crown was to be represented in some other proper way inIrish Free State affairs - and there were other \7ays in whichit might he so represented - then the office of Governor-general was not essential.                                                       -          Ivlr.  de Valera said that in his opinion insistence onallegiance to the Crown was a mere piece of legalism.   we ought not to attach too much importance to the lawyers.  Whatmattered was the spirit of the association&apos; between members ofthe Commonwealth, and all that the spirit required was free and willing co-operation.    I said that I fully agreed with him                                                        that
that trie will to co-operate on all matters of common concern wasone of tlio fundamental requirements of membership of theCorxionwealth.  But in my view the position of trie Crown,&apos; andallegiance to the Crown were also fundamental matters.  muchmore than 5ia mere piece of legalisrr&apos; was involved,  Forinstance, since the Dominions had attained their present status as sovereign nations, with equal rights to foreign nations atGeneva and elsewhere, foreign nations with whom we had importanttrading relations had protested against the continuance of thesystem of Imperial Preference for Dominion goods in the UnitedKingdom market.  They argued that the Dominions should nolonger he treated like Colonies, and that like other sovereignnations they should only he entitled to most-favoured-nation treatment in our market.   Hitherto,  I said,  we had been able, to resist this suggestion, because we had been able to answer that although the Dominions were sovereign nations, they and we wereespecially associated together in the Commonwealth, tho symbol ofour association being the Crown, to which all our people owedallegiance.  It was this point of allegiance to the Crown which enabled us to hold the position, and to justify the whole systemof political and economic advantages which we in the Coiamonwealthextended to each other.  If we now suddenly said that a Republic,where no allegiance to the Crown was owed, could be a full member of the association and draw all the benefits from it, ourposition as against foreign powers would become untenable.  Thewhole system of mutual advantages would be undermined, it would indeed collapse.
^ &quot; &amp;hi          Mr. de Valera said tliai Me did not see why  talishould follow.  Me could justify the benefit;to each other on other grounds.  I ashed, him&apos; what those  groundswould he?  Me replied that we were surely ;;free to  choose ourown friends&apos;-&apos;.  Me would say to foreigners that we chose  to exchange special &quot;benefits with the Irish because our  geographical position required that we should he friends.  I said  that I  re all;/could not take that suggestion seriously; surely he did  not  put it forward seriously.   If we justified giving trade  preferencesand special political advantages to Irishmen, or anyone  else,simply on the grounds that we were free to choose our ownfriends,  the implication was that those to whom we  did not extend these things were not our friends.  That would produce,and very properly produce,  ill-will between us, and a host of countries with whom we wished, our relations tc remain friendly(indeed,  friendship between them and us was important from thepoint of view of world peace),  and no  doubt would result in  theirputting on at least economic reprisals against us.    Ms  for  thesuggestion that geography should be counted a determining factor,that would involve us in extending the advantages which  we had inmind to our European neighbours whose  geographical  relationship to us was also a matter of great importance.  &apos; -here did  liesuggest that we should draw the geographical dividing line?Mould it not mean that citizens of the French Meaublic couldenjoy Imperial Preference,  and immigrate freely into  Great Britainwhenever they were out of work in France?   Did he  suppose thatthose nations who were just beyond the geographical   dividingline would regard the new practice with indifference?  /-aid howwould the Dominions themselves regard  this extension  of  the membership of the British Commonwealth of nations?
9 &amp; 9          I am inclined to think that this point of view made sor.impression on I.Ir. de Valera. though he- repeated that we ought tohe free to choose our own friends.     4.   I believe he is really anxious to remain in theCommonwealth,  though for the reasons given above he wantsRepublican forms in the constitutional procedure by which theIrish Free State people govern themselves in their own internal affairs.   Indeed, he said that he would not take the IrishFree State out of the Commonwealth;  he thought that theproposals which he had in mind were reconcilable with thecountry remaining a member of the Commonwealth, or at leastbeing entitled to enjoy the benefits of the association.  If we thought otherwise,  we would have to turn them out.  Theresponsibility would be ours.  But he does not want theIrish Free State to be turned out.   he referred once to thepossibility of ;ifinding a formula-&apos; in the course of thediscussions which are to take place.     5.   lie is reluctant for the Irish Free State to lose itsassociation with the Commonwealth principally because of the unfortunate situation which that would create between northern and Southern Ireland.  The division in the country would becomewider than it is today.   The aim that lies nearest to his heartis that of creating a United Ireland;  indeed,  it was Carsonand the threat of schism that brought him into politics.  Inhis view the partition was the greatest crime that England hadever committed, against Ireland.   he was opposed to those in theSouth who asked him to use force to bring in the north.  liewould not use force; but he would employ reason, and was willing to wait for reason to prevail.   But he thought that
Great Britain did not wish the North to join the South, and thatwe were now using and would continue to use our influence tokeep the division alive.    he said that the financial agreements which he had made favoured Northern Ireland and were an inducement to the ITorth to remain separate,   he was convinced that if we wished, to,  we c:;uld persuade the  horth to join in a United Ireland.          I said that it would he fruitless to argue about the historical reasons for the separation.   what had been done couldnot be undone.    I had to face the facts of 1936,  and one ofthose facts was a pledge given by the United kingdom GovernmentIreland;  a United Ireland would only come into being when theITorth as well as the South desired it.  I would no more think of breaking a pledge given to the horth than I would think -of breakinga pledge given to the Irish Pree State.   I thought that any Irishpatriot should desire above all else a United Ireland.  But thatwas now a matter for the Irish people themselves in the Southand the North.    we would put no obstacle in the way of theiruniting, if they desired to do so.&apos;   It was not we who could persuade the horth.   Only the people of the Irish Pree State could persuade them,  by pursuing  a policy which would ultimatelyincline them to come in of their own free will.          hr.  de Valera repeated that he thought that if weused our influence with the people of the horth we could do muchto make them, favour a United Ireland.   The cuestion was of supreme importance,  for partition at present was doing more than anything else to damage relations between the majority ofIrishmen and Great Britain.
2ic%Ki ta  eJ     6.    he said that he thought the relations between our two countries should be those of close and specialco-operation.  Arising out of this,  ho expressed the followingviews:-     a.    Regarding defence,  the two countries should have a         complete understanding..  r7hilst wo occupied ports in         the Irish Free State this was difficult from his side.         Our security would be greater if that occupation         ceased,  for then his Government would be free to         co-operate fully.  They would look after the defencesThey would spend whatever money they could afford onthese.   Recognising our much greater experience in this matter, they would wish to follow the advice of ourexperts.our problem was a common one.ought to lay our defence plans together;b.    he thought that we had no right to &quot;the  land annuities,    and did not recognise the Agreements  concerning  them as    valid.  hut he would be willing to agree    considerable monies on defence - as muchiv we agreed in return to accept tnac as of the Land annuities dispute.utle.:..enxc.     In trade matters he would lido to-give us a    preference.   he was going ahead with the devr,-!ox&apos; secondary menumeant that thoy woulmachinery and other :mes  xnjm-ee s ua LO,s a u  ma o. have  an  increased need for^eruirements,  and  these  he  would liketo purchase as far as possible from Great Britain.                                          I breover
         Moreover, if the  Free State started to &quot;build, up its         defences, they would require armaments of various Minds.         These too he would wish to purchase in Great Britain.         Otherwise he would have to go to Germany, or elsewhere.         He thought that the expansion of trade between the two         countries would be of advantage to us in another way.

He thought that if we did not attempt to influence theother Dominions,  but allowed them to express freely their own view as to whether the Irish Free State,  with the newconstitution which he proposed,  could remain a member of theCommonwealth;,  they would all decide in the affirmative, with thepossible exception of South Africa, where General Hertz og- might  -be afraid of giving too much encouragement to his own Republicanmovement.     8.   lie said that the tendency in the Irish Free State was for the voters to move to the Left.

The Constitut ional Issues - proposal framed, at a Meeting                   of M i n 1st ers.     1.   The Irish Situation Committee at its meeting on     July 16th (1.0.0.  (32) 27th Meeting) asked us to -prepare     a definite proposal on the constitutional issue for the     Committee&apos;s consideration,     2.   The main question is whether the constitutional     changes which Mr.  de Valera is understood to have in     contemplation can he fitted into the conception of a     British Commonwealth of which the Irish Free State forms     a part, or whether the kind of changes which he has     ind.iCoi.ted to the Dominions Secretary as &quot;being in his mind.     would necessarily mean that the Irish Free State would     put itself outside the Commonwealth.   The changes     indicated appear to involve (a) the abolition of the     Governor-General and. the substitution of a President     elected by the people of the Irish Free State who would     be responsible only to them;  (b) legislation of the Irish     Free State to be passed by the Bail without the assent of     the Crown being necessary to give it effect 5  and (c)  a     constitutional conception which Mr. de Valera,  in his last     conversation with Mr.  Malcolm MacLonald, seems to consider     as not involving,  so far as the inhabitants of the Irish     Free State are concerned, allegiance to the Crown.   On                          -1-  H 1
 the  other hand, Mr. de Valera ins-lets that the relation , between the Irish Pree state ano. this country would continue to be quite different from the relation between a foreign state and this country, and not only contemplates close  and friendly association but assumes that the fundamental principles of membership of the British Commonwealth could and would be preserved. 3-   We would first emphasise that it is the substance of the  relationship between the Irish Free State and the crown which  is important rather than the formal and. legalistic expression of that relationship.   There is no harm in altering forms of expression as long as this is not done in order  to reject the essential substance.   If Kr. de Valera really desires to maintain the reality of his country&apos;s position as a Dominion under the British Crown, it ought not  to he impossible to find a way of agreement about the formal language in which this is to he expressed.   In paragraphs 10 and. 11 below&apos; we state our main conclusion and make proposals as to the point of view from which the-. constitutional issue can best be discussed with Mr.  de valera.   And in paragraph 11 we suggest some practical tests which might be applied.   But it is first necessary to consider the underlying principle more generally.4.   In our view, the best way to approach these matters is to remind ourselves of the BaIfour declaration of 1926 as incorporated in the proceedings of the ImperialConference  of that year.,    The Report of the  Inter-imperial relations Committee (page 14 of Cmd.  2768)  declared that &quot;nothing would be gained by attempting to lay down a constitution for the British Empire&quot;  and went on to  define the position ana mutual relation  of the  &quot;group  of self-governing communities  composed of  Great  Britain and  the                       -2-
Dominions&quot; in the following wordsj-          &quot;They are autonomous Communities within the           British empire, equal in status, in no way           sub ore1 mate one to another in any aspect of           their domestic or external affairs, though           unit edyDy;p^                      the Crown,           and freely associated as members of the           Brit i sii Comvfiomeaitn of Notions&quot; .b.   In preparing to deal with Mr... de Valera&apos;s proposals,we must of course distinguish between the question whetherthey are consistent with the existing conception of theBritish Commonwealth as defined above, and the questionwhether their adoption would involve a modification inthat conception,  which might be oiscussed with us and theother members and which might lead to an acceptable ortolerable new development.   The constitutional structure of the British Commonwealth should not be regarded as having reached its final stage and as being incapable of future alteration.   Indeed, the successive developmentsthrough which it  has passed throughout its history haveseemed at the time to many people inconsistent with its essential principles.   But it seems to us that the first question is whether what Nr. de Valera seems to contemplateis consistent with the existing constitutional structure.Even if it is, it may still call for fresh consultationwith the other Dominions.   But if it is not, a very muchmore serious operation is involved.6.   we think that the most essential element in the balfour declaration quoted above is, for the present purpose, the phrase &quot;united by a common allegiance to the0rown&quot;.   It is regrettable that a technical word, like&quot;allegiance&quot; has  to be used (and,  later on, we suggest&apos; aless technical phrase) for this suggests some legalisticconception which  docs not necessarily correspond with thesubstance of the  matter:.   Bat it  seems to us that,  however                     -3-
                                                     y K it- the thing is  phrased,  the  really  essential  test  is  uMjg&apos; preserved and demonstrated by  common  allegiance  to  the Crown.    Since each self-governing  unit  has its  own Legislature and its own Executive,  where can the unity come from if  it is  not  from  the sharing  of  this  common allegiance to the Crown?   Subtract this, and there is nothing else.    Nowadays the Government  of  each  Dominion is  regarded as advising the  Sovereign in respect of that Dominion&apos;s own. concerns, and. that advice is accepted and  is then locally  applied.   It is  the constitutional duty of the citizen to accept  the  decision  thus  arrived  at.    But how can this  constitutional  scheme he  preserved  unless  by preserving in every Dominion &quot;common  allegiance  to  the Crown&quot; *? 7.    Other tests and illustrations might he suggested, but  the  conclusion  seems to  us to be  that union  by  a  common allegiance bo  the Crown is the essence of the relation  of all  parts  of  the British Commonwealth, and  consequently that, unless  this allegiance is in some way acknowledged and preserved,  the  unity of  the British  Commonwealth  could not  continue. 8.   This  deals with point (c) in paragraph 2 above,   The difficulties  raised by points (a)  and (b) are also very great, but we have  the feeling that if the  fundamental point of allegiance were adequately provided for, there would be more  room for discussion about the part which the Crown takes in Dominion legislation or as the head of theDominion Executive.    As regards legislation, it is true that the present practice  without  exception is that the legislation of a Dominion  requires the assent of the King, and  even if the form of the enactment  did not use his namebut the  name  of a Governor  or Governor-General,  the official                      -4-
 actually named would be acting on behalf of and with the commission  of the Crown,   Mr. de Valera appears to contemplate  Irish legislation which would not receive the assent  of the.Crown either directly or indirectly.   This raises  difficulty, but it seems to us that it might be possible- to  conceive a British Commonwealth in which a self-governing member enacted its statute law by the vote of  its  Parliament without requiring even the formal assent of  the  Sovereign.   As the assent of the Sovereign to Dominion legislation is given or &quot;withheld on the advice of the Dominion Government, and the Dominion Government exists only because it has the support of the Dominion people, it may he  that the conception of the British Commonwealth does not essenti ally depend on the Grown&apos;s assent being given to Dominion legislation.   At any rate, we think the legislative difficulty is less serious than the difficulty about allegiance. 9.   The remaining point has to do with the Dominion Executive.   In the Constitution of every Dominion the Crown is declared to be vested with its executive function, wnich of course is discharged, through his Ministers. There seems to us to be more difficulty in imagining a change here which is consistent with the fund am en t a1 principles of the Commonwealth than in the case of the legislature.   Nevertheless,  here also the conception is in one sense formal, and it  seems to us that the importance of -preserving both the legislative and the executive link lies chiefly in the support  which these give to the preservation of the conception of allegiance.    If the essential idea of allegiance  could be  preserved without them,  this might make  modification on  tnese  two other points possible.
 10.   Our  conclusion  therefore  is that  the first and most essential test  is  that  provided by  the  conception of common allegiance  to the  Grown, however that  allegiance may be described.    We  think that our  representatives should explore  this  aspect  of  the matter at the -proper time  with Mr, de Valera&apos;s officials and should indicate that,  however it is  expressed, this seems to  us essential to the unity of the  Eritish commonwealth which we all desire to prestrveu   Our representatives should not of course concede  the possibility of fundamental changes on the other two points, but the fact  that Mr. de Valera wants to press  forward also with  changes  about them will bring out still more  clearly  the  importance  of what we regard as the fundamental conception, viz. unity  by a common allegiance to the Crown.   If Mr.  de Valera denies the possibility of this,  we  do not see  how his scheme  could be fitted into the British Commonwealth, even  though we regard the Commonwealth as essentially  a thing which is capable of future growth. If a way  can be found in which this essential condition is preserved, we should not despair of finding means by which the Grown&apos;s part in  legislation and administration could be suitably  modified. 11.  A.  test may be suggested as follows.   Is Mr.  de Valera prepared  to include  in the constitution a preamble or declaration which asserts that &quot;the Irish Mree State and its citizens acknowledge the Ming as the head of and as representing the Commonwealth of which the Eree State forms a part, alike in peace and in war&quot;.    If Mr.  de Valera says that  there is no place in his constitutional  instrument  for any reference to the Crown at all,  then it  seems to  us tnathe is really contemplating a separation of  the Pree  Statefrom  the British Commonwealth,  even  though he  may  sincerelycontemplate entering into  the closest  relations of amity
                                                       9 it 9 and alliance by contemporary treaty.   If he honestly accepts the Crown as the head of the Commonwealth, and says so, the precise form in which  he casts the Legislature and even the executive of the pree State does not seem, the crucial difficulty.   And we think that Mr. de Valera&apos;s constitutional ideas might usefully he tested by a hypothesis.   Supposing that after the new constitution has been established, the Ming went to Lublin. Would the King&apos;s position there, in Mr. de Valera&apos;s view, he that of a visiting Sovereign, to. be received with courtesy but,  apart from the politeness due to guests, having no status superior to the Presidents   Or would be enjoy the status there of the supreme head of the Common-wealth of which Ireland, equally with Canada or the UnitedKingdom., forms a part&apos;? 12.  The above is written from the strictly constitutionalpoint of view, but we would, add that of course the thingwithout which the British Commonwealth cannot continue is the spirit of  co-operation.   The letter of the Constitutionkilleth^  it is the spirit that gives the Commonwealth life.But the difficulty is to embody the spirit in the necessarily formal language of a written Constitution.
