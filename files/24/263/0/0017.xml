(Previous reference :  C.I.D. Minutes of 275th Meeting, Minute 16.)     THE COMMITTEE had under consideration the Report of a Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 1240-B).     At the CHAIRMAN&apos;S request SIR WARREN FISHER, Chairman of the Sub-Committee on War Office Production,  introduced the Report.  He explained that the main feature of  the  proposals  was  that the Master-General of  the Ordnance should be relieved of all  responsibility for production and supply of stores covered by Army Vote 9,  and be thus enabled to concentrate on his proper functions of research, experiment,  design, demand  and inspection.   It  was proposed that the production of munitions should be entrusted to a new Member of the Army Council,  to be known as the Director-General of Munitions Produc- tion, who should concentrate on actual production.  The rate of production was, of course, determined by the rate  of demands, which aspect of the problem was under consideration in the War Office.   The selection  of the right man for this post was obviously of vital importance.     In reply to a question by Mr.  Chamberlain regarding setting up a munitions supply Ministry, he explained that this would entail a delay of about six months and was not contemplated unless war was  held to be imminent.    MR. DUFF COOPER said he agreed  entirely with the recommendations of the Report.   The War Office had  already  started to investigate the question of accommodation for the new  Department, and it might be possible to put  them all in Caxton House.  It was essential that the whole of the new Department should work under one roof.    THE CHAIRMAN said that he understood that the Office of Works hadbeen very helpful in regard to the question of accommodation.    After further discussion the Chairman suggested that the  Committee should recommend that the Report  be approved, and that the matter should be referredto the Cabinet for final decision.                          CONCLUSION.THE  COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed to recommend (a) That approval should be given to the recommendations  contained  in      paragraph 16 of the Report on  War Office Production (C.I.D. Paper      No. 1240-B), which are as follows :         (i) That supplies and  stores  covered by Army  Votes 6,  7 and 8            should  continue to be obtained under the present arrangements.       (ii) That the Master-General of the Ordnance should be relieved  of            all  responsibility for production and supply of stores covered            by  Army  Vote  9, but  should  continue to  be  responsible for            research,  experiment, design, demand and inspection.

BY direction of the Prime  Minister, the  accompanying Report of a Sub-Committee on War  Office Production is circulated for the consideration of theCommittee of Imperial Defence.

WE have been set up by the Prime Minister to consider and advise as to anydevelopments in War Office organisation that may be desirable in order to ensurethe most rapid possible execution of the Governments plans for reconditioningthe Army.  Our Report is as follows :     2.   The Cabinet  decision approving the  Report of the Ministerial  Sub-Committee  on  Defence  Policy  and Requirements  (C.I.D.  Paper 1215-B)threw on to the War  Office the responsibility  for obtaining  quickly very greatquantities of material and supplies to make  up the deficiencies in the equipment of the Army on the basis approved.    3.   These  requirements  can conveniently be  grouped  according to  theEstimates  provision :-    -        Vote 6.   Supplies. and Road Transport.        Vote 7.   Clothing.        Vote 8.   General  Stores.        Vote 9.   Warlike  Stores.    Vote 6 is the responsibility of the Quarter-Master-General; Votes  7, 8 and of the Master-General of the Ordnance.    The stores and supplies under Votes 6,  7 and 8 are, generally speaking, of types  which are either  supplied  to the community  at  large, or do  not  varyessentially from commercial types and can therefore be obtained  through  tradechannels without great difficulty.      [13398]               &apos;     &apos; -
    4.  Vote 9  stores, however, are largely of a type peculiar to the defence departments or the Army.  &apos;. They are shown in Estimates under the followingsub-heads:-; ,&apos;; .&apos;          *  &apos; &apos;  &apos; &apos;\             &apos;&quot;&apos;              1         (1), Guns and Carriages,.               ,         (2);Gun Ammunition.         (3) Small Arms.             .            /             . .        &apos;(4) Small Arm  Ammunition.         (5), Horse Transport  Vehicles.         (6) Motor Transport  (wheeled).         (7) Motor Transport  (tracked).         (8) Anti-Gas Equipment.         (9) Searchlight, Signal and Bridging Equipment.        (10) Miscellaneous Warlike Stores.    For the supply of most of  these stores dependence has been placed upon theEoyal Ordnance Factories and the reduced number of firms who, still, since theWar, have continued to manufacture guns, ammunition,  and armaments stores.It is  obvious that the problem of obtaining increased supplies of  such stores,commonly known as &quot; munitions,&quot;  differs essentially from  that of obtaining other types of stores.   There is a very limited production capacity in the country whichcannot be extended merely by increasing demand. It is not, therefore, surprising that while the War Office  do not anticipate any grave difficulty in fulfilling their responsibilities as  regards supplies and stores covered by  Votes 6, 7 and 8, theyare experiencing difficulty as regards &quot; munitions.&quot;    5.  The  Master-General  of the Ordnance  is responsible  for  the  design,specification and demands  for all munitions for the  Army. His responsibilitiesalso include the administration of  research, experiment, specification and supplyof apparatus for chemical  defence for all three Defence Departments,  and for avery important range of other services common to the three Departments,  suchas explosives and filling;  the supply of war material on an agency basis to Indiaand the Dominion and Colonial Governments;  and the  administration of theRoyal Ordnance Factories.  He has a Financial Adviser and financial  staff, whoexamine all proposals from the finance point of view before demands are issued to the Contracts Directorate.    The Master-General of the Ordnance has no power to place a contract withthe trade or to negotiate with them on contract  matters.   The Director  of contracts is  responsible for all negotiations with  the trade and for  placingcontracts.  Although normally  there is no need for him to refer to finance, he isfree to do so should occasion arise.    6.  The problem of  expanding productive  capacity  in emergency is  dealtwith  partly  by  the Supply  Board  Technical  Establishment,  which  existsindependently of the Contracts Department and was  set up primarily to produceprocess specifications so that commercial machinery could be adapted to munitions production.    The staff of this organization  have formed extensive  trade contacts and arein a position to advise as to the capacity of firms to take on orders for munitions.Their technical knowledge enables them to calculate what quantities of particularmunitions can be manufactured on the basis of the machinery and labour availablenow, and what increased  machinery or expanded factory space, &amp;o,  would  berequired to meet the estimated  war-time requirements.    7.  The  most economical  method of  keeping  alive  machinery specificallyrequired for munitions and of encouraging the setting up of reserve  plant for emergency production is to place contracts in peace which will give a reasonablereturn to the firms  concerned. Moreover, the labour&apos; factor  is extremely important and firms must  have peace-time experience if the skilled, labour is to be available.These factors make essential some  element of elasticity in:the normal  procedure of placing contracts.  Consultation between the  Contracts Department and theSupply Board Technical Establishment is essential, and the ideal aimed  at is to award contracts for munitions in such a way as not only to obtain the quantitiesrequired now,: but to foster potential sources of supply to meet war requirements.At the  same  time the xeyiew of the trade capacity  in the light of the knownmilitary: needs  suggests that ;for some supplies it will be necessary to provideGovernment factories.     ,                              ;. : .;   .  *  -
    8.  Both the  Supply  Board  Technical  Establishment and the OrdnanceFactories: are administered  by the Master-General of  the  Ordnance.    the contracts Department, however, is administered independently by the FinancialSecretary of  the War  Office.  We therefore have the position that the supplyfunctions for munitions are not under unified control.  At the same time,  owingto the increased work thrown on to him in connection with the Deficiency Pro-gramme of the Army, and the corresponding increase in the agency work and thecommon services referred to in paragraph 5, the Master-General of the Ordnanceduring the last six months has been unable to devote any time to his other duties.    We  therefore conclude that the speeding up of munitions  supplies  willrequire  co-ordination  of the  Ordnance  Factories,  the Supply Board TechnicalEstablishment, and the  Contracts Branches, and that these  functions should be allotted to a separate  authority  independent of  the  Master-General  of the ordnance.    &apos;9.   Such a grouping of functions  might at  first sight suggest a nucleusMinistry of Munitions.   If  war had to be anticipated in the relatively near futureit would no doubt be reasonable to consider whether it would not be preferable toset up a full Munitions Supply Ministry here and now, especially as it is generally accepted that in war this would be essential.   It would not help in any way toset up an organization with merely advisory powers.    10.   There  is  no doubt that if a Munitions Department  were set up with compulsory powers the specific task of obtaining  armament  stores would beultimately simplified.   On the other  hand,  it would require legislation, and its powers would have to  be very clearly defined.  All of this would take time, andwe are of opinion that a period of up to six months would elapse before the new ministry could operate, and there would be a corresponding delay.    The effect on public opinion in general and on the trade in particular must also be considered.  The powers which  the trade would accept as inevitable inwar would probably arouse  opposition in peace and the result might very well bemuch less helpful  than harmful.    The effect upon the trade and finance of the country might also be considerable and there would almost certainly be an immediate  failing off of exports throughinterference with commercial production.    As  far as we are  aware the Admiralty and Air Ministry have managed to overcome the  difficulties which face them and  there is no reason  for disturbingtheir arrangements.    For these reasons we consider that some solution short of a separate MunitionsDepartment  must be found.   We  consider therefore that in  order to expediteproduction to meet our immediate needs, the first essential  is to reorganise the branches of the War Office responsible  for Munition production, so that,  if atsome later date a  decision to form a new Ministry  is taken, these branches couldbe transferred without interrupting the  process of  supply.    11.  We recommend that there should be set up in the War Office a separatesupply department for munitions,  i.e.,  for  the stores covered  by  Vote 9,  whichshould consist of a head, and under him the Director of Ordnance Factories andthe establishments controlled by him,  the Supply Board Technical Establishment,and those branches of the Contracts Department which deal with munitions.    12.  The head of  this department should be a  member of the Army Council,and, we suggest, should be known as the Director-General of Munitions Production.We do not consider it advisable for him  to be a member of the Government, sincethe appointment arises out of the extreme urgency of the problem and a Minister,owing to his parliamentary  duties, would not be free to give his whole time to this task.  As explained in paragraph 5, financial consideration is given to the Supplyof Munitions before demands are issued by the Master-General of the Ordnance.We do not recommend any disturbance of this arrangement, as the vote concerned will continue to be dealt with by the  Permanent Under-Secretary of State.. . TheDirector-General of Production will not therefore require a financial organisation as such; but he should be given a  personal staff, including: an!experienced civil servant of. the War Office staff, and a small secretariat;  The arrangements, conic]of course be modified or amplified in the light  of experience.  * The Director-General should be accommodated with the whole of his staff in one building near the War Office.   He should also be allotted a room in the War Office.  .
    13.  With regard  to  the selection of  a Director-General of  munitions production, as the main problems affect engineering we consider that he shouldbe an engineer of proved experience.  He should have drive, but should be able towork with the official staff without friction.  His  name should be of sufficientweight to give an assurance to the public that no obstacle will be allowed to standin the way of the rapid production of essential military requirements in munitions.One who has not been used to working under the conditions of the parliamentary control of Finance would be at a disadvantage.    14.  We consider that, whilst our proposals should hasten the production ofmunitions by eliminating delays after demands have been formulated, it is obviousthat they will  not in themselves provide a remedy  for delays  prior to the demandstage.   We understand  that the War Office are already considering the  questionof  hastening  demands,  and  we have  therefore refrained from making  any recommendations on this aspect of the problem.    15.  Finally, owing to  the extreme urgency of the  problem,  we  strongly recommend that our recommendations be given effect to at  the earliest possible date.16.   We recommend  (i)  That Supplies and Stores covered by Army Votes 6, 7 and  8 should      continue to be obtained under the present arrangements. (ii)  That the Master-General  of  the  Ordnance  should be  relieved of all      responsibility for production and supply of stores  covered by Army      Vote 9, but should continue to be responsible for research experiment.      design, demand and inspection.(iii)  That the provision of munitions,  i.e.,  stores  covered  by Army Vote 9,.      should be entrusted to a new Member of the Army Council, to be known      as the Director-General  of  Munitions Production,  to whose control      should be transferred       (a)  the Supply Board Technical Establishment;      (b)  the Director  of Army  Contracts,  with  those  branches of  the             Contracts Department dealing with the  supply of munitions;             and      (c)  the Director of Ordnance Factories and  his establishments. (iv)  That the Director-General and his staff should be accommodated in one      building near the War Office. (v)  That effect should  be given to these recommendations  at  the earliest      possible date.Summary of Recommendations.(Signed)N. F. WARREN-FISHER (Chairman).M. P.  A. HANKEY.H. J. WILSON.H. J.
