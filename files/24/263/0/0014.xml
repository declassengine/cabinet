Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1936.SECRET.                                                          Copy  No.CP. 184  (36).CABINET.ANGLO-EGYPTIAN TREATY CONVERSATIONS.          Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    BESIDES the articles dealing with the alliance  and connected military matters, and those dealing with the Sudan, an Anglo-Egyptian treaty will need to include (as in the case of the 1930 and 1933 drafts) provisions relating to othermatters, namely:     (1)  The cessation of the military occupation of Egypt.    (2)  Reciprocal diplomatic representation by  Ambassadors  instead  of as          hitherto by a High Commissioner in the case of the United Kingdom          and by a Minister  in the case of Egypt.    (3)  Support by His Majesty&apos;s Government of  an Egyptian application for          membership of the League of Nations.    (4)  Affirmation of the rights and obligations of the High  Contracting Parties          under the Covenant of  the League of Nations and the Pact of  Paris.    (5)  Protection of foreigners.    (6)  The capitulatory regime.    (7)  Abrogation of any existing agreements, &amp;c, inconsistent with the present          treaty.    (8)  Settlement of any disputes over the application or interpretation  of the          treaty provisions (which the High Contracting Parties fail to settle          by direct  negotiations) in  accordance  with  the provisions  of  the          Covenant (i.e.,  a general disputes clause to be carefully distinguished          from  the  revision clauses, viz.,  Article 9,  last  paragraph,  and          Article 14).    2.  Annexed to this memorandum  as  Annex I  are  the texts of  the articlesby which it  is proposed to deal with these matters.   In the  case  of some  of thearticles, i.e., those dealing with the exchange of Ambassadors, with the capitula-tions, with the protection of foreigners, their provisions are expanded or explainedand precisions are made in notes to be exchanged between the High ContractingParties.  Certain matters not specificially mentioned in the  body of the treaty,though having a  connexion with the matters dealt  with in  particular articles,are dealt with only in the notes  to be  thus exchanged.   These matters are thefuture of the European Bureau of the Public Security Department of the Ministryof the Interior and the (British) Director  of the Bureau,  the European element in the Egyptian Police and  the British  Commandants, the nationality of  any foreign officials engaged by the Egyptian Government.  These notes (which  wouldbe published) are also annexed to this memorandum.  The terms of both articles and notes are based almost entirely on the texts of the 1930 draft treaty as agreed with the Egyptian Government.  The only substantial variation included  is theone in the article dealing with the capitulations [Article O  (4)](1), in  which,under (6) of the second paragraph, it is  stated that His Britannic Majesty agrees   (1) The figure (4) and the figures in  succeeding references to specific articles refer to thenumbers given to.the articles in the 1930 draft treaty.      8686   [13415]                                                B
to the removal of all restrictions on the application of Egyptian  legislation to foreigners  (see the memorandum on the  capitulations clause&apos; circulated to theEgyptian  Conversations  Committee  on  the 13th  June,  No. A.E.C. (36) 3,Annex II).    3.  There  are two matters,  (1) the future of  the  posts  of Financial  andJudicial Advisers (British) of the Egyptian Government, and (2) the  protectionof minorities, which were mentioned in the 1930 draft but which it is not proposedto mention in the present treaty.  The reason for this  is as  follows. In the caseof (1), His  Majesty&apos;s Government in 1930 proposed a stipulation to the effect thatthe Egyptian Government intended to  maintain these  officials  for the  remainingperiod of their existing contracts.  The Egyptian proposal was to dispense withtheir  services at  the end  of the financial year in which the  treaty was signed.The most we could hope to secure would be the proposal of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment.  But this  would be of little  value,  since the  contract of the  financial adviser expires in November 1937, and that of the Judicial Adviser in November1938,  and it is believed that he wishes to retire before that date for  reasons ofhealth.  To mention the matter, therefore, can bring  us little advantage and itwould have the possible disadvantage  of tying the Egyptian Government downto an  expressed intention to dispense with the services of these officials, whereasif no  mention is made of the matter it would be possible for them (should theyby any chance  desire to do so) to prolong their  contracts or  keep the  posts in being. Should  His Majesty&apos;s Government, however, or the Egyptian government feel it necessary to insist  on reference being made to the Financial and  JudicialAdvisers, it could be done by a note (or an addition to Egyptian Note No. $) tothe following effect: &quot;I have further the honour to inform you that the egyptian government propose to retain the Judicial  and  Financial Advisers until the expiry of the existing  contracts of the present holders of these offices.&quot;  In thecase of (2),  while there  was no mention of minorities in  the British drafts of 1930,the Egyptian counterdraft proposed a  paragraph in a note to be annexed  to thetreaty in the following  terms :  &quot; It is recognised by the High Contracting Partiesthat there  is no ground  to provide for  the question of  minorities  in Egypt,considering that, as Egyptians, any question relating to them is  the exclusiveconcern of  the Egyptian Government.&quot;  His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot hope to secure Egyptian agreement to any article in the treaty or paragraph in a notegiving assurances with regard to the  treatment of minorities.  If they  do so,they would no doubt be met by an Egyptian demand to state that this matter  wasthe exclusive concern of the Egyptian Government.   This His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment  would be reluctant to agree to.  Although this is a matter in which we havehitherto accepted responsibility both towards foreign countries and towards ourown ecclesiastical and  missionary bodies, having not stood out for an assurance from  the Egyptians in 1930, His Majesty&apos;s Government will not  be  in a goodposition for doing so now, even supposing the Egyptians would yield to pressure,which I think  that on this point they certainly would not.  But in replying to enquiries from missionary bodies since the present  conversations began, I have said that I considered  the best method of dealing with this matter was to leave it till Egypt applied for membership of the League of  Nations, Avhen the Leaguemight demand  assurances from Egypt as one of the conditions of her  election.It seems best,  if possible, to avoid being faced with an  Egyptian demand for  astatement that any question relating to minorities is the  exclusive concern ofthe Egyptian Government.  To do  so  would risk  prejudicing the  action of thethe League in  this matter or at any rate His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s  attitudewhen  the matter was raised at Geneva.  If nevertheless the Egyptian  delegationinsist on such reference being made, it could perhaps  be done by way of a note in the following sense :  &quot;I have further the honour to  inform you with regard tothe question of the protection  of minorities, which figured in the Declarationof the 28th February, 1922, but is not mentioned in the  treaty, that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United  Kingdom, while taking  note that  the  EgyptianConstitution provides  for liberty of conscience and of worship, no longer  claim the right to protect such minorities.&quot;  This text Avpuld  not prejudice the questionof protection by the League.    4.  The question  of  the protection of foreigners  (Article N (3) ) has beendiscussed by my colleagues at the end of February and in March last, and I would
[13415]refer them to the papers I circulated to them at that time, namely, CP. 66 (36)of the 29th February, CP. 71 (36) of the 9th March, and CP. 78  (36) of the14th March.  In  these papers I argued in favour of accepting Article 3 of the1930  draft, on  the grounds that, having  been accepted  (though reluctantly)  bythe Egyptians,  it would most likely, be accepted by them again and that it gave us all we require.  I would once more urge  my colleagues to accept the 1930 articleas it stands.  If,  however, they feel bound to insist on some further provision, I trust that they will  be  satisfied with the  proposal in my note circulated  asCP.  78  (36), namely, that an addition should be made  to Article F (7), to theeffect that &apos;&apos; the High Contracting Parties would also consult together if circum-stances should arise involving the possibility of any intervention into the internal affairs of Egypt by any third Power.&quot;  This, I am persuaded, is the most whichwe can hope to secure (and it is very doubtful that we could secure it all) in orderto provide against the possibility of a sudden intervention by,  say, Italy in caseof any disturbance detrimentally affecting Italian interests a possibility whichexercised the minds of my colleagues.    5.  There is one other point to which  I invite the attention of my colleagues,and that is the  abolition of the European  Bureau of the Public Security Depart-ment and the elimination, within five years from  the coming into force of thetreaty, of the European  element in the Egyptian  City  Police.  This matter is dealt with in the  Note No. 4, the text of which will be found in the annex to thismemorandum.  The note  reproduces the text agreed upon in 1930, except for the elimination of one ambiguous sentence a modification which is in our favour.We must expect the Egyptian delegation to insist on a provision in this sense andto reject anything which  might secure that the European element in the police would remain for a period longer than five years.  So long as it was the policy ofHis Majesty&apos;s  Government that  the  British troops should remain permanentlyin the cities of  Cairo and Alexandria, the Army Council considered that it was of great importance that a European element and British commandants in theEgyptian Police should remain for as long a period as  possible.  Now that the cities are to be  evacuated, I understand that far  less importance is consequentlyattached to this point.  I recommend, therefore,  that the provisions of the 1930draft be agreed to in this  instance also.    The High  Commissioner informs me  that the  opinion of the senior british officials in Egyptian service is definitely that any attempt to modify the above-mentioned clauses in  the  direction  of the maintenance of  British control wouldnot only be unacceptable to the  Egyptians,  but would  fail in its  object,  evenif the Egyptian negotiators were reluctantly  forced to accept such modifications.The  British officials  in question have pointed out that in  post-treaty conditionsBritish  officials in Egyptian  service could  only  function  effectively if  their presence were really desired by the Egyptian authorities, who can easily  reduce toimpotence any such officials imposed by us.    6.  In general, I urge my colleagues to agree to articles in the sense of those given in  the annex  to this memorandum.   His  Majesty&apos;s Government  have informed the Egyptian Government that in the case of the military clauses some modification would be necessary  in order to  adapt the 1930  draft to changed conditions.  In these essential matters the Egyptians have offered us concessionsabove what they  were prepared to concede in 1930.   In the matter of the less important civil clauses I  recommend that the 1930 draft be accepted.   though have in the annex  to this paper proposed for the sake of convenience texts ofarticles, I would like to repeat once more that it would be dangerous to crystallisethem into fixed  formula? at this stage.  As in the case of the military articles, the annexed texts are intended to cover any form of words which would produce thesame effect and  which in the course of negotiations it might be necessary to adopt.                                                                    A.  E.    June 25, 1936.
    His Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, and His Majesty the King  of Egypt,    Being anxious to consolidate the friendship and the relations of good under-standing between them and to co-operate in the execution of their international obligations in preserving the peace of the world,    And considering that these objects will best be achieved by the conclusion ofa treaty of friendship and alliance, which  in their common interest will providefor effective co-operation in preserving  peace and ensuring the defence of theirrespective territories, and shall govern their mutual relations in the future,    Have agreed to conclude a  treaty for this  purpose, and have appointed as their plenipotentiaries :     His Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India;    For Great Britain and Northern  Ireland;    His Majesty the King of Egypt;who, having communicated their full  powers, found in good  and due form, haveagreed as follows :                                      A.

C.                                ARTICLE 2.    His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom will support any request for admission to the League of Nations which Egypt may present in the conditionsprescribed by article 1 of the Covenant.                                    L.                                ARTICLE  12.    Nothing in  the present treaty is  intended to or  shall in any way prejudice the rights and obligations which  devolve, or may  devolve,  upon  either of theHigh Contracting Parties under the  Covenant of the League of Nations or theTreaty for the Renunciation of War signed at Paris on the 27th August, 1928.                                    N.                                 ARTICLE 3.    His  Britannic Majesty recognises  that the  responsibility  for  the  lives and property of foreigners in Egypt devolves exclusively upon the Egyptian Govern-ment, who will ensure the fulfilment of  their obligations in this respect.                                     o:                                 ARTICLE 4.    His  Britannic Majesty recognises that the eapitulatory regime now existing in  Egypt is  no  longer in accordance with the spirit of the  times and with thepresent state of Egypt.    His  Britannic Majesty accordingly undertakes to use all his influence withthe Powers possessing capitulatory rights in Egypt to obtain their agreement(a) to the transfer to the Mixed  Tribunals of the jurisdiction  of the existing
Consular  Courts; (6) to the removal of all restrictions  on the application of egyptian legislation to foreigners.    His Majesty the King of Egypt undertakes that no Egyptian legislation made applicable to  foreigners shall  be inconsistent with  the  principles generallyadopted in modern  legislation or  discriminate inequitably against  foreigners,including foreign corporate bodies.                                     P.                                ARTICLE  15.    The present treaty abrogates any existing agreements or other instrumentswhose continued existence is inconsistent with its provisions.

EGYPTIAN NOTE  No. 1.    With reference  to article B of the treaty signed this day, I have the honourto inform you that as His  Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ireland and theBritish Dominions beyond  the Seas, Emperor of India, will be the first foreignsovereign to be represented in Egypt by an Ambassador, British Ambassadorswill,  during the period  of  the Alliance, be considered senior to the diplomatic representatives accredited to the Court of His Majesty the King of Egypt.                            BRITISH  NOTE No. 3.                              Capitulations Note.Sir,    With regard to  article O of the  treaty signed to-day,  I desire to place on record the views of  His Majesty5s Government in  the  United Kingdom  withregard to the transfer to the  Mixed Tribunals of the jurisdiction now exercised by the Consular  Courts.  This transfer  (which will,  of course,  be subject to theprovisions of the special convention referred to in article K)(2.). will necessitate the revision of the existing  laws relating to the organisation and jurisdiction ofthe Mixed Tribunals, including the preparation and promulgation of a new code of Criminal Procedure.   For  these purposes His Majesty&apos;s Government  in theUnited Kingdom would be prepared  to accept  as a basis the  principles which resulted from the discussions which took place on this subject in 1920.    It may be difficult for  some Powers to agree  to the  transfer to the  MixedTribunals of all suits relating to the statut personnel of their nationals.  Transferin  the  case of  these questions would be facultative.   Jurisdiction in  suchmatters should remain with the consular authorities unless an agreement is made between the Egyptian Government  and the foreign Government concerned  for itstransfer to the Mixed Tribunals.    There are certain matters upon which  it will be necessary  for agreement tobe reached between the Egyptian Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom, but it  is unnecessary to do more  at the moment than mentionthese  subjects.    The first is the definition  of the word &apos;&apos; foreigner &apos;&apos; for  the purposes  of theproposed  extension of the jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals.    The  second  is the increase in the  personnel of the  Mixed Tribunals andMixed Parquet,  which will be necessitated by  the proposed extension of their jurisdiction.    (2) This article will state that the immunities and privileges to be enjoyed by His Majesty&apos;forces in Egypt will be determined in  a separate convention to be concluded between HisMajesty&quot;s Government and the Egyptian Government.       [13415]                                                     B 3
     The third is the procedure in the case of pardons or remission of sentencesimposed on foreigners, and also  in connexion with  the execution  of capitalsentences imposed on foreigners.                           EGYPTIAN NOTE  No. 3.Sir,     I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note of to-day&apos;s date in which you informed me of the general lines upon which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom would be  prepared to support the efforts of theEgyptian Government to conclude  arrangements with the Powers for  the reform of the capitulatory regime.     I am happy to state that the Egyptian Government are in general agreementwith His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom as to the lines on whichthe reform of the capitulatory system should proceed.     I wish,  however,  to  make it clear  that the willingness  of  the  egyptian government  to  conclude  arrangements on these  lines  for  the reform of thecapitulatory  regime is entirely without  prejudice to their  desire to  secure the eventual abolition of that regime.     As regards the revision of the existing laws relating to the organisation and jurisdiction of the Mixed  Tribunals and the preparation  of  a  new  Code  of criminal Procedure, the  Egyptian  Government recognise  that they shall  notdiverge from the principles generally adopted  by  modern  legislation  which is applicable to foreigners.                           EGYPTIAN NOTE  No. 4.                        Protection of Foreigners, &amp;c.;Sir,  &apos;&apos;                                   &apos;  :  .           -&apos;    .&apos;  &apos;  r :     With reference to  article N of the treaty signed this day, I have  the honourto inform you that the Egyptian Government intend to abolish  forthwith theEuropean Bureau of the  Public Security Department, but will retain, for fiveyears from the coming into force  of the  treaty, a certain European  element intheir city police.  The said police will remain for the  same period under the command of British officers.     With a view to facilitating the gradual substitution of Egyptian officialsfor the said European element and  thereby securing the harmonious  workingof the police organisation, the Egyptian Government propose to dispense  annuallywith the services of one-fifth the number of European police officials.     The Egyptian Government, in view of the treaty of friendship and alliancesigned to-day, will, when  engaging the services of foreign experts, employ Britishsubjects possessing the necessary  qualifications.
                                ANNEX  II.A.E.C. (36) 3.                             THE CAPITULATIONS.    THE capitulatory regime in  Egypt involves  restrictions  of  two different kinds upon  the powers of the territorial sovereign with regard-to capitulatoryforeigners,  namely, (a)  the  judicial  Capitulations,  and  (6) the  legislativeCapitulations.                                       &apos;    2.  Under (a), (the  judicial  Capitulations),  capitulatory foreigners areexempt from the jurisdiction of the Egyptian  courts.  In fact, at the presenttime  in  Egypt,  capitulatory  foreigners are  subject  to  two sets  of  tribunals,(i) the Mixed Courts consisting of Egyptian and  foreign judges  (the majoritybeing foreign), which  have jurisdiction over all civil cases where a foreigneris involved, except cases  between  foreigners of the  same nationality,  and  an extremely limited criminal jurisdiction, and (ii)  the Consular Courts, which havejurisdiction in respect of  civil cases between two of their nationals and a nearlyexclusive criminal jurisdiction.    3.  Under (6), (the legislative Capitulations), capitulatory foreigners are (withcertain exceptions) exempt from  the  operation of -Egyptian legislation unless such legislation  has become applicable to  them either (i) by the  assent of thecapitulatory Powers, or (ii) by the approval of  the law or decree by the general or legislative assemblies of the Mixed  Courts.  Most Egyptian legislation whichbecomes applicable  to foreigners does so by  reason of the approval  of  the MixedCourts; but the Mixed Courts have no power to approve certain types  of legisla-tion, in particular that imposing new  taxation.   For this category  the assent ofthe capitulatory Powers is necessary.    4.  It is  common  knowledge  that  the  Capitulations impose upon Egypt afetter to which  that country  strongly  objects and every proposal for a treaty between the United Kingdom and Egypt has contained some provisions laying down the manner  in  which  His Majesty&apos;s  Government were  ready to  agreeto the capitulatory position being modified  and  promising the assistance of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to Egypt to securing the agreement of the  other&apos; Powersto such modifications.    5.  The proposals made  in 1930  with  regard to the Capitulations are  setout in the Annex to this  paper.   These proposals  were not modified  materiallyin the draft treaty drawn up in 1933.  To put it shortly these proposals consisted(a), as regards  the judicial  Capitulations, in  obtaining the  abolition  of the consular Courts and the transfer  of their jurisdiction to the Mixed Courts, and(b), as regards the  legislative  Capitulations, in  conferring on the Mixed Courtsthe power to approve the application to foreigners of all kinds of legislation andin laying down that in granting or withholding  their approval the Mixed Courtswere only to refuse to approve a law or decree which (i) discriminated inequitablyagainst foreigners, or  (ii) which was  inconsistent with  the principles generallyadopted in modern legislation.    6.  In  the  present treaty conversations it has proved necessary for HisMajesty&apos;s Government to make military demands of a considerably more exactingnature than on previous occasions.  Some makeweight to these demands is required and the  Capitulations seem to  be the only sphere where it would be  possibleto provide it.  The maintenance of the capitulatory system  of  Egypt is notin my opinion a major British interest and it is  perhaps open to question towhat extent it is in the long  run  a British interest at all.  From  Lord Cromeronwards it has always been the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government and of HisMajesty&apos;s Representatives in Egypt that we should aim at the eventual abolitionof the Capitulations in that country.  They are  an anachronism  which in Persia,Turkey and Iraq has already disappeared a fact  which makes their continued existence in Egypt all the more irksome. His Majesty&apos;s Government alone cannot,however, by agreement with  Egypt abolish the Capitulations.   It is therefore desirable to confine the proposals in the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty  to those which it
would be reasonable  to expect the other capitulatory  Powers  to  accept.  Asregards (a), the judicial Capitulations,  it does not appear  to me that there is really any practicable alternative to the 1930 proposals.  Moreover, though the mixed Courts are unpopular in Egypt, they are not in their judicial capacity any real fetter on  the free government of the country.    7.  The  legislative Capitulations  are  in practice  far  more  galling to egyptian Governments than the  judicial Capitulations,  and  the unpopularitywhich has fallen upon the  Mixed Courts is largely due to  their conflicts withEgyptian Governments in the exercise of their legislative functions.  I think thatthe 1930 proposals in continuing  the legislative functions of the Mixed courts and to some extent adding to them proceeded on the wrong lines.  If the MixedCourts  are  to survive in  Egypt,  they  should  be relieved  of  their  legislativefunctions.  My present proposal is that, the legislative  Capitulations should be abolished and that Egyptian legislation should apply to foreigners, but that thereshould be a treaty obligation binding Egypt towards His Majesty&apos;s Government,under which Egypt will undertake that no  Egyptian legislation will be made applicable to  foreigners which  discriminates inequitably  against  foreigners or which is inconsistent with the principles  generally adopted in modern legislation.The effect of this  proposal, if it were adopted,  would be to give His Majesty&apos;sGovernment the right to protest diplomatically against any Egyptian law  whichwas held to conflict  with  either  of  these two  principles.  Other  capitulatoryPowers would no doubt require a similar undertaking towards them as regards their  own nationals in return for surrendering the legislative Capitulations.  Sofar as His Majesty&apos;s Government were concerned, if a dispute arose between themand the Egyptian Government as to whether a given Egyptian law was or was not open  to objection on the grounds  of one of the  two principles stated above, thedispute would fall under the general disputes article of  the treaty, and thus theCouncil of the League would be given jurisdiction to decide  it.  My proposal wouldinvolve  the  following  amendment of  the  1930  proposals :   the  deletion  ofparagraph 2 of the draft note on page 39 of  Cmd. 3575 of 1930 (see Annex) andthe substitution of the following addition to article 4 of the 1930 draft treaty :---         &quot; His Majesty the King of Egypt undertakes that no Egyptian legisla-    tion shall be applied to foreigners which discriminates  inequitably against    foreigners, including foreign companies, or which is  inconsistent with the    principles generally adopted  in modern  legislation &quot;  (or any more suitable    wording which can be devised in the same sense).    Foreign Office, May 14, 1936.                   1930  DRAFT ANGLO-EGYPTIAN TREATY.Agreed Text of the Proposed Exchange of Notes in regard to the Reform of the                               Capitulations.                                British Note.Your Excellency,     WITH regard to the second paragraph  of  article  4  of  the Treaty signedto-day His Majesty&apos;s  Government in the United  Kingdom recognise that  theconditions in which the Capitulations are at present applied as regards the powerof the Egyptian Government to legislate for or to impose taxation on  foreignersare no longer consistent with modern conditions.     They are prepared to agree that in future any assent which  is necessary before Egyptian legislation, including fiscal legislation,  is applied to  foreigners  Ishall be given by the General Assembly of the Mixed Tribunals, except in the case  Iof legislation relating  to the constitution or jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunalsthemselves, which  should  not come into force  until it has  been approved by thePowers.  The competence of the General Assembly, of the Mixed Tribunals should consist in satisfying itself that the legislation in question is not inconsistent withthe principles generally adopted in modern legislation, which  is applicable to
 foreigners, and, with particular relation to legislation of a fiscal character, that it  does  not  inequitably  discriminate  against  foreigners,  including  foreign companies.     The transfer to the Mixed Tribunals of the jurisdiction now exercised by the  Consular Courts, which will,  of  course, be  subject to the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Egyptian note of to-day&apos;s date, will necessitate the revision of the existing laws relating to the organisation and jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals, including  the  preparation  and promulgation of  a  new  Code of Criminal Procedure.  For these  purposes  His Majesty&apos;s  Government  in the United Kingdom would be prepared to accept as a basis  the  principles which resulted from the discussions which took place on this subject in 1920.     It may be difficult for some Powers to agree to  the transfer to  the Mixed Tribunals of  all suits relating to the  &quot; statut  personnel&quot; of  their nationals. Transfer in the case of these questions would be facultative.  Jurisdiction in such matters should remain with the consular authorities unless an agreement is made between the Egyptian Government and the foreign Government  concerned for its transfer to the Mixed Tribunals.     There are certain matters  as to which it will be necessary for agreement to be reached between the Egyptian Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, but it is unnecessary to do more at the moment than mention these subjects.     The first  is the definition of the word &apos;&apos; foreigner &quot; for the purposes of the proposed extension of the jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals.     The second is the  increase in  the  personnel of  the Mixed  Tribunals and Mixed Parquet  which will be necessitated  by the  proposed  extension  of their jurisdiction.     The  third is the procedure in the case of pardons or remissions of sentences imposed  on foreigners, and also  in connexion  with the execution  of  capital sentences imposed on foreigners.                           Article  i of the Treaty.     His Britannic  Majesty recognises that the capitulatory regime now existing in Egypt  is no longer in accordance with the spirit of the times and with the present state of  Egypt.     His Britannic  Majesty accordingly  undertakes to use all his influence with the Powers possessing capitulatory rights in Egypt to obtain, in conditions whichwill safeguard the  legitimate interests of foreigners, the transfer to  the  MixedTribunals of the jurisdiction of the existing  Consular Courts, and the applicationof Egyptian legislation to foreigners.
