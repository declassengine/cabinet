(1)  Letter from Sir Arthur Wauchope to Mr. Ormsby-Gore, dated July 6, 1936.                                      High Commissioner for Palestine,Dear Ormsby-Gore,                                Jerusalem, July 6, 1936.    I HAVE sent by to-day&apos;s mail a despatch dealing with the judgment on thedemolitions in Jaffa.    The Chief Justice  found himself  obliged to give judgment in favour ofGovernment.    It is not for me to criticise the comments of the Chief Justice, but it is myduty to point out the unfortunate results they will have on Arab opinion in thepresent situation.    The Chief Justice makes the statement that Government has shown lack of moral courage.  I maintain that Government showed no lack of  moral courage.    This statement will be  construed by  Arabs as a direct encouragement tocontinue their  struggle  against  a weak  Government,  and anyone with  anyknowledge of the Arab mind must realise  that this will  be the inevitable  resultof such an accusation.        ,                               Yours  very sincerely,                                               ARTHUR  WAUCHOPE.        13505] &apos;
    Confidential Despatch from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the            Secretary of State for the Colonies,  dated July 6, 1936.(Confidential.)(Reference No. CF/394/36.)Sir,                                                Palestine, July 6, 1936.     I HAVE the honour to refdr to my telegram No. 467 of the 3rd July, 1936,informing you that on the 27th June the High Court, on appplication of an Arabadvocate, granted a rule nisi against the District Commissioner and the Attorney-General to show cause why order for demolition of a particular building in thearea  affected  should not be stayed, return date being the  1st July.  On the29th  June the  High Court made a similar rule in respect of thirty-nine other buildings, return date being the  3rd July.  Instructions were given by me to allconcerned to take immediate steps to identify the buildings affected by temporaryorders and to endeavour to ensure that they were not damaged in any way in thecourse of demolition of unaffected buildings which took  place on  the 29th  and30th June.     On the morning of the 3rd July the High Court, after adjourning from the1st July,  discharged the rule  while criticising the action of Government on theground that it was not  made clear  in notices  served  on the occupiers  thatdemolition was  ordered under Article V (5)  of  the Defence Order  in Council.This judgment renders it unnecessary for Government to answer the rule grantedon the 29th June in respect of the other petitions.     I transmit for your information a copy* of the judgment of the High Courtin this case.  I also enclose a memorandum! by the  Acting Attorney-General on certain legal aspects of the case and on the procedure adopted by the High Court.I  would  invite your  special  attention  to  paragraphs  6 and  10  of  that memorandum.    2.  My advisers and I have  long felt that the opening-up and improvementof the Old City of Jaffa by the construction of one  or more wide roads and the demolition of insanitary buildings was a task which would need to be undertakenso soon as funds could be made available and a, suitable opportunity offered.  this measure we held to  be in the highest degree desirable for two distinct but bothcommendable objects :           (i) Increase of public security;         (ii) Relief of unhealthy congestion and  insanitary conditions.The most lawless elements in Jaffa dwell in the  Old City, where they havehitherto been able successfully to defy the police and to resist any attempt toestablish  effective control.   The  cost of expropriation and  the many adminis-trative difficulties and delays to which expropriation would inevitably have given rise  in normal  circumstances  have hitherto deterred  me  from proceeding withthis very  desirable project of  town improvement.  In this connection it is most appropriate to  recall that the expropriation of buildings and property for  theconstruction of the hew south approach  road to the Port occupied  the best partof two  years.  Moreover  until recently there appeared  to be  other and morepressing objects  of  expenditure, since the acts  of disorder committed by  thelawless elements in the  Old City  were not sufficiently numerous or sustainedseriously to affect public security  and thus to demand immediate attention.     3.  Shortly, however, after  the disturbances began on the 19th April,  theold town of Jaffa presented an extremely serious problem to the police and militaryauthorities.  The old town, as I have explained in my telegram No. 361, is a warrenof tortuous and narrow covered streets, where blind alleys and culs-de-sac makethe operation of police or troops an extremely hazardous enterprise.  From anearly stage  in  the disorders the Administration had no control of this area.Neither police nor soldiers could effectively penetrate into it.  Patrols outside itsboundaries were constantly being bombed or sniped and  the  Central  Police                           * Enclosure I (not printed).                           -f- Enclosure II (not printed).             0 &quot; -
Barracks were under constant fire from houses in the Old City.  In short the oldtown of Jaffa became a rebel stronghold, which continued to defy the forces of lawand order with impunity.    4.  I considered  with my military and  civil advisers the possibility of employing a large force of troops to carry out a thorough search, quarter byquarter and house by house; but decided in full agreement with my advisers thatthis was&apos; inadvisable, as it would probably result in serious loss of life on bothsides and the effect would be temporary only, since once the troops had withdrawnthe inhabitants of the Old City would resume their habits of lawlessness.  In themeantime, bombing and sniping continued and neither the police nor the&quot; troops could stop it, although they  replied with  stronger  fire.  This method  provedineffective; moreover, it necessitated  the grave and inevitable danger of killingor wounding innocent  and harmless persons in the area, and indeed one  womanwas killed although by whom it is unknown.  Meanwhile, in the rest of the countryoutside of Jaffa  the situation was deteriorating.  The lines of communicationwere being cut; patrols were constantly fired upon; Jewish property and lives werebeing attacked.    5.  In these  circumstances I deemed it  a prime necessity for the restorationof order that Jaffa should be put under effective control without delay.  the disturbances had  originated in Jaffa, and  as it had  continued to be the maincentre of resistance, it seemed to me that the restoration  of  order there was essential.  Moreover, the Old City dominates the port, which  could not, therefore,be opened until that quarter was brought under control.    6.  After carefully studying the tactical situation with my military and civiladvisers, I  reached the conclusion,  in  accordance with their advice, that  anessential preliminary to the restoration of order was the opening up of  the oldtown by means of roads which would give easy access to the security forces and enable them to exercise control of the old town and of the port which lies belowit.  I therefore decided that the time had come to exercise the powers given tome under Article V (5) of the Defence Order-in-Council to undertake the necessarydemolition of buildings rendering possible  the construction of better roads,  animprovement to the City I had long  wished to undertake.    My military  advisers were apprehensive that this measure would be resisted by  armed force and that  casualties  would be  caused among  both  troops and civilians.  In view of  the likelihood  of armed resistance I  considered first thedesirability  of carrying out the operation without prior warning and none islegally necessary under Article V (5) of the Order-in-Council.  It seemed possiblethat surprise  might operate as  a factor to  lessen  active resistance and thus toreduce loss of life.    7.  On further reflection, however,  I felt that it would be wrong not  to givethe many innocent inhabitants of the Old City an opportunity to withdraw beforethe operations began, and that it was essential to avoid the panic and confusionwhich would be inevitable if the people  in the Old City were taken unawares.  Ithus decided  that the  inhabitants  must  be given  prior  warning and full opportunity themselves  to withdraw and to remove  their effects before the troopsentered and the demolitions began.    It was thus necessary to consider  the form of warning to be given.  If I had represented the action contemplated as a  purely military measure aimed  atcrushing a nest of rebels, there  is no doubt that great excitement in Jaffa, and indeed  throughout Palestine, would  have been created, the  lawless elements inthe Old City would have  been encouraged  to  resist  by  arms  the forces  ofGovernment, and  the widest apprehensions would have been aroused in the minds of innocent persons. Such action would, I feel sure, have led to unnecessary lossof life and injury to person and property.    It was wiser  and  perfectly honest  in  the communique which I issued andin the warnings given  to the inhabitants of the Old City, to endeavour to allayapprehensions by  stressing, without any sacrifice of the truth, the administrativerather than the military  aspect of the operation, the normal  rather than the abnormal.  By this means I was enabled to complete a drastic although necessarymeasure in an atmosphere almost approaching normality; with the  result thatno resistance whatever was offered, there was  no panic,  no lives were sacrificed,no  civilian  suffered other than  a superficial injury.   The security forces  of
Government are now in complete control of the Old City, and the work of townimprovement  which will be of lasting and  great benefit to the town of Jaffa,which will greatly enhance the value of surrounding properties, and which isalready, so I am informed by the District Commissioner, recognised by the more responsible citizens as a wise and valuable measure, is on the way to completion.     8.  You will note that my method of action has been described by the chief justice in his judgment as a &quot; singularly disingenuous lack of moral courage &quot;and &quot; a glaring case of evasiveness.&quot;  Mr. Justice Manning caps these stricturesby referring to &quot; a policy of deceit,&quot; &quot; circumlocution &quot; and &quot; a blunder.&quot;   Iam content that you, Sir, should judge whether this public castigation is justified.     There is no doubt that this judgment will have a seriously detrimental effecton the security position in Palestine,  and will be looked upon as an incentive to resist measures which  Government undertakes to restore law and order.  It hasbeen reported, although with what truth I do not know, that the Arabs proposeto print off 10,000 copies of this judgment for circulation throughout Palestine.The judgment has already been received with exultation in Arab circles, whereit will doubtless be represented as proving, what has hitherto been largely surmise,that the Chief Justice  is strongly opposed to the policy pursued by the executive in the suppression  of  the disturbances,  and that at a time when unity of theBritish official  community in the  face of disorders is particularly to be desired.It will, I fear, tend to encourage Arab members of the Judiciary, who are alreadyconsidering  declaring  a strike, to take that  step.  It will  undoubtedly weaken the Government by bringing it into  disrepute  at a juncture  when all men of goodwill  should be striving  to strengthen the position of the Executive. I  takea very serious view of this aspect of the matter.                                         I have,  &amp;c.                                               A. G. WAUCHOPE,                                         High Commissioner for Palestine.
