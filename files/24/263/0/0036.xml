Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1936.secret.Copy  No.CP. 206 (36).CABINET.PROPOSED  REQUEST TO GERMAN AND  ITALIAN  GOVERNMENTS    TO  SECURE  THE   LIQUIDATION  OF   BRANCHES  OF  THE    NATIONAL SOCIALIST  AND  FASCIST PARTY ORGANISATIONS    ESTABLISHED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.     Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the. Foreign Secretary.    THE branch of  the  foreign  section of  the  National  Socialist  Partyestablished  in  the  United  Kingdom  is  known as  a Landesgruppe  and  isunder  the  direction   of   a  Landesgruppenleiter,   Herr  Otto   Bene  (anapplication  for whose appointment as  German Consul-General  in Londonwe   recently  succeeded  in  forestalling  without   any  protest   from  theGerman  Government).   Under him there are two  local branches, known  asOrtsgruppe, in London  and Dalston, and smaller branches, known as Stutzpunkte,at Bradford, Birmingham, Hull and Manchester-Liverpool  and Newport-Cardiff.There is  also, apparently,  a Stutzpunkt at Dublin.   It is believed  that  at themoment there are some 288  members of the National Socialist  Party in GreatBritain, of whom some 67 form the staff of the British Isles branch  of theAuslands Organisation.  Prince Bismarck himself is one of these  :  he  is theliaison officer between the Embassy and the Landesgruppe.  The headquarters  inLondon are understood  to be in touch with some 1,500 people, some being Britishsubjects of  German extraction.    Since  the Nazi Party   in Germany  hasunprecedented  power over the individual,  it can direct the  energies of every member of the  party in any desired  direction.   An underlying  object  of theAuslands organisation  is to weld  together all Germans abroad who  are to beregarded as an indissoluble part of the Reich, and who are expected by. their oathto give active co-operation in the pursuit of the Fiihrer&apos;s aims.    2.  Considerably less information is available regarding the Italian FascistParty Organisation in this country since enquiries into their activities  have only recently been set on foot;  but as in the case of the German National SocialistParty,  a branch of the  Fascist Party is known to be in existence  here with itscomplement of party officials and machinery.  It has its headquarters in Londonand a number of provincial branches.  It is based on the  foreign section  of theItalian Fascist Party in Rome.  During the recent crisis very definite instructions were issued from H.Q. that in the event of an outbreak of hostilities certain acts of sabotage were to be  carried out by members of the Fascist  Party  attached toBritish Air Force units  in the Near and Middle East.    3.  There  is  no  objection on the part of our authorities  to German andItalian citizens in this  country being affiliated as individuals to their nationalparty organisations in Germany or Italy as the case may be. What is consideredobjectionable is the establishment  of branches of these  organisations in thiscountry.  These organisations provide a ready-made machine which can be usedfor any end desired or  decided upon by the party headquarters (a branch  of thetotalitarian  State) in  Germany or  Italy.  They might  also  be  used   in an8735  [13574]
 emergency; to the detriment of: the vital interests and safety of this country.  This party machinery.is, in fact, an excellent instrument not only for.propaganda and intelligence, but also for espionage and, in an emergency, for sabotage;-: It cannot...be, over-emphasised that every member of the party is an agent of his Government,rand is obliged to;act according to their orders.   ;:&apos;       .  ,     4.  It is true that there is in existence in this country an organisation known as the Russian Communist Party cell, which consists of members of  the Russian Communist Party employed in Soviet institutions in this country.  This organisa- tion works underground and has no open contact with the Communist Party of Great Britain.  It can, however, be differentiated from  the Fascist and Nazi organisations in that for the moment its  activities and influence are so negligible that our authorities do not consider it necessary to review  its activities in this connexion.     5.  The proposal which it  is now desired that the Cabinet should consider is that informal and friendly suggestions should be made to the German and Italian Governments through their Embassies in London that they  should take steps to secure the closing down of their party organisations in this country, the presence of which is considered unusual and undesirable here.  Action of this kind has already been taken,  without any serious protest from  Germany,  by the Swiss Government against the National Socialist Party organisation in Switzerland.  It is not proposed that  detailed reasons for this request should be communicated to the German or Italian  Embassies; but they would be given to understand that, should the request not be acted upon, we should probably be obliged to require the leading organisers  and party officials to leave the country.     6.  The decision to be taken by the Cabinet  in this matter  must  depend primarily on their view of the  effect of the  proposed  action  on the safety of the country.   M.I.5,  who are  responsible for  supervising  the  activities  of  any organisation which may be a danger  to  the internal security of  this country, strongly urge that this action should be taken.  Their view is that to deprive these organisations of their right to operate publicly and freely here would embarrass them and limit  their activities.   For instance, the pressure which they can bring to bear on other individuals, of German  and even of British nationality, to aid and abet their activities  would, in the view of M.I.5, be diminished; and, more- over, even if the work of the organisation was continued in secret and by under- ground methods, it would inevitably be hampered  in many  directions.   On the other hand, it can be argued that if  driven  underground and compelled to work in  secret it might become more difficult to keep  an effective watch on these organisations.   On this view the action  suggested  would not  necessarily secure the  discontinuance of these organisations, but might add to  the difficulties  of observation.     7.  Two other points will have to be borne in mind in coming to a decision on this matter.  The first is the fact that this action will certainly be challenged in Parliament and the Press,  and that  for  obvious reasons it would not be in the public interest to give detailed arguments in its defence.   The ultimate sanction is deportation of party officials  if the organisations  continue, and great pressure would be brought  to  bear  on the Home  Secretary to  explain his  reasons  for requiring the departure  from this country  of  German or  Italian subjects who ostensibly have  good reasons to remain in  this country but are known  to the authorities to be engaged in secret party activities.     8.  There  is, finally, the question of the effect of the  proposed action on our  relations with  Italy  and Germany.   There can be  no  question but that  the  action  proposed  is  legitimate   from  our  own  point   of  view; and, however  inconvenient it  may be   to  the  German  or  Italian Govern-ments,  it  can  scarcely be said  that   they would  be  entitled  to  resentit.   If  our  people  go to Germany or  Italy they have to  conform  to german or Italian practice : and there is no reason why German or Italian citizens  in thiscountry should seek to establish over here, in this unprecedented manner, theirown organisations.  These, as agencies of a totalitarian State, are the tools of aforeign Government owing direct allegiance to its head. On the other hand, it is,of course, true that, for this reason, the two Governments concerned will feel thatthis action strikes at a very fundamental part of their methods and programme.
3257     9.  It would certainly be legitimate to refuse to give detailed reasons for our action to either Power or to say more than that we had decided to take the action proposed  on grounds of public interest.  A reason for taking it soon, which is of some  importance, is that, the longer it is delayed, the greater becomes the prescriptive  right of these organisations  to  carry1 on their  activities here. By permitting their continuance we, in fact, condone their activities.  Were, moreover, action  to be delayed until a period of emergency arose, its initiation, which might then be imperative, might be embarrassing; and in any case the widened activities of these organisations might be difficult to suppress at short notice.  They are in an early stage of development here:  we do not.know how they will evolve.     10.   If the Cabinet take the view that some action to deal with these foreign political organisations is necessary, the only  possible course seems to be. that suggested in this  memorandum, even if we cannot be sure that it will be entirely effective.  To give freedom of  action in this  country to  the organised agencies of a foreign Power is a dangerous precedent;  and it is for serious consideration whether time has not come when we should do our best to curtail the activitiesof these foreign political organisations.                                                                  .
