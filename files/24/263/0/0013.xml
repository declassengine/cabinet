Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1936.SECRET.                                                        Copy No.CP. 183 (36).CABINET.ANGLO-EGYPTIAN  TREATY  CONVERSATIONS.   QUESTION WHETHER THE EGYPTIAN DELEGATION SHOULD COME TO LONDON.         Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    I INVITE the attention of my colleagues to the  fact that recent telegramsshow that Nahas Pasha is clearly anxious to carry through the concluding stages of the negotiation of an Anglo-Egyptian  treaty in London.   I have  told HisMajesty&apos;s High Commissioner  that he is at liberty to tell Nahas Pasha that weshould be glad to agree with him that the signature of a treaty should take placein London.    There remains the question whether the negotiations should be transferredto London (as Nahas Pasha would wish) once the military clauses and the Sudanclauses have been agreed to.  As to this, while I should prefer that agreement should be reached on the whole treaty before the Egyptian delegation visited thiscountry,  there might be advantage from  the  point  of view  of  speed if  thenegotiations on the civil clauses (regarding which a paper is being circulated tomy  colleagues) should take place  in London.  Sir Miles Lampson will report further on this point upon his return to Egypt.                                                                   A. E,    June 25, 1936.8682  [134121
