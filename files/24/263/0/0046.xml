CABINET.Proposed Use  of Tear  Gas against riotous Mobs  in the  Punjab.      MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY  OF STATE  FOR INDIA.   On the 27th June 1933 the Cabinet  approved  the proposal of  my predecessorthat the Government of the Punjab should be authorised to mate experimental  useof tear gas for police purposes within a limited field in situations such as arise whenarmed criminals are brought to bay in a house or  place  of refuge.   It was thenconsidered  inadvisable  to use in  India tear gas  against riotous mobs, thoughrepresentations  had been received from various quarters that such a practice wouldbe preferable to the rifle fire to which the authorities  have, unfortunately, to resortfrom time to  time.   On the 19th March 1935 a serious riot occurred in Karachi  in connection withthe burial  of a Mahommedan executed  for the murder  of  a  Hindu.  As a  lastresource, British troops were ordered to fire  and  a  detachment  of 25 men  fired 47rounds in all, as  a result  of which 47 persons were killed and  134 injured.  Iunderstand that at a Cabinet meeting the following day the  question was raised,but not discussed  in the absence of my predecessor, whether if tear  gas could havebeen employed  such grave  loss of  life might not have  been  avoided.  The samesuggestion was  made in  the House of Commons by Mr. Churchill, and in consequencethe Government of India were authorised to consider further the possibility of usingtear gas against riotous mobs.  In the result experiments were  made at the PunjabPolice Training School, in the course  of  which Sir Reginald Clarke,  a formerCommissioner of Police,  Calcutta,  demonstrated  American  methods, apparatus  andammunition.    These  experiments  have satisfied the Local Government and theGovernment of  India that  tear gas would be a valuable weapon supplementary tothe existing weapons possessed by the police for use in some, at any rate, of thecircumstances which arise in  dealing with riotous mobs  and other forms of civildisturbance.   In the present state  of  communal tension in  the Punjab there is a possibilityof an outbreak between the different communities at any time, and the Governmentof the Punjab desire to  be in a position  to  use  tear gas  in such circumstances ifoccasion should arise.   The Government of  India have, therefore, proposed to  methat the Punjab Government should be permitted  to use tear gas against unlawfulassemblies, provided        (a) that  suitable equipment and police trained in its use are  available, and       (6) that  the Local  Government is satisfied that  the  occasion and circum-     stances are appropriate for the  use of tear gas.   I submit this proposal  for the approval of my colleagues.    For the present it  is proposed only to use the  gas in the Punjab, but  I ask  mycolleagues  further to authorise  me, if  successful results should  be  obtained, topermit any other  Local Government which  may wish to follow the example of  the punjab to use tear gas on the same conditions.   My  colleagues  will recall  that similar proposals  made by  the Secretary of  State for the  Colonies in  CP. 226 (35)were approved by them in December last, and that I then stated that I might becoming to them  before long for wider authority for the use of tear gas  in Indiathan that already granted  to me.
