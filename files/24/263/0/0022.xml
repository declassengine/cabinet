Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1936.SECEET.                                                          Copy No.CP. 192  (36).CABINET.ANGLO-EGYPTIAN  CONVEESATIONS.                                 THE SUDAN.  Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal, Acting for the Secretary of State for                              Foreign Affairs.    I WOULD invite  the  attention of my colleagues to the third paragraph,and footnote, of the draft article regarding the Sudan printed as Annex A to cp. 176 (36) of the 19th June.    The Governor-General of the Sudan has represented that this article as atpresent drafted, with the addition of  the  proposed agreed initialled minute,restricts his power to employ persons of nationalities other than Sudanese, Britishand Egyptian to employment in &quot; minor technical posts.&quot;    The phrase &quot; minor technical posts  &quot; might, Sir S. Symes feels, give rise inpractice to difficulties of interpretation.  And  further, whilst employment  ofsuch persons would normally be confined to minor  posts which  Egyptians were unwilling to accept,  or  for which no  suitable Egyptians were available (e.g.,Greek  artisans might be employed on pump schemes), it might occasionally bedesirable to appoint a person with special technical qualifications or possessingspecial knowledge  to a post which could not under any interpretation be classedas &quot;minor technical posts.&quot;   Sir S.  Symes states that it would  therefore be preferable from the point of view of the Sudan Government either to insert  theword &quot;usually &quot; or &quot; normally &quot; between &quot; will &quot; and &quot; select &quot; in paragraph or to substitute in the agreed initialled  minute the phrase &quot; special posts &quot;  forthe phrase &quot; minor technical posts.&quot;    I am in agreement with this suggestion and should be grateful for authorityto instruct His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner to adopt whichever  of the  abovesmall  amendments  he considers would  be  the more  readily acceptable to theEgyptian Delegation.                                                                        H.    July 8, 1936.            THIRD PARAGRAPH, AND FOOTNOTE,  OF DRAFT ARTICLE.    3.  Selections, appointments and promotions of officials in the Sudan will inconsequence remain vested in the Governor-General, who, in making new appoint-ments to posts for which qualified Sudanese are  not available, will select suitablecandidates of British and Egyptian nationality.(3)    (3) It is intended that there should be an agreed initialled minute  to this provision to theeffect that this provision does not prevent  the Governor-General occasionally appointing to minortechnical posts persons who are neither  British  subjects nor Egyptians nor Sudanese.8673A   [13491]
