Printed for the Cabinet.  August 1936.Copy No.  43CABINET.REFORM OF  THE  LEAGUE.    I CIRCULATE to the Cabinet the text of a note from the French Ministerfor Foreign Affairs to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations giving thegeneral views of the French Government in regard to the question of the reform of the League.                                                                    A. E.    August 19, 1936.French Minister for Foreign Affairs  to the Secretary-General of the League of                                  Nations.(Translation.)Sir,          ^                                      Paris, August 14,  1936.    ON the  7th July, in accordance  with the recommendation  adopted on the4th of the same month by the Assembly of the League of Nations, you were goodenough to request  the French Government to send in to you,  if possible by the1st September,  any proposals that  it might think fit to submit with a view toperfecting the application of the principles of the  Covenant, in  the spirit  of,and within the limits laid down by, the recommendation in question.    I need not say that the problem before the Assembly is receiving the veryparticular attention of the Government of the Republic, and that on two occasionsin the days preceding the vote of the 4th July the French representatives had the honour to lay before the Assembly our general ideas on the matter.    On  the 1st  July M. Leon  Blum, President of the  Council  of Ministers,affirming France&apos;s attachment to the system  of collective security,  emphasised the necessity of making a  new arrangement in regard to  the  Covenant  by restricting  &quot;to the Powers which are nearest, geographically or  politically, tothe Power that is attacked &quot;the risk involved by any military assistance rendered to a State that is a victim of aggression.    On the 3rd July I myself urged the necessity of increasing the authority ofthe League without sacrificing any of &quot; the essential principles of  responsibility and collective action which are embodied in the Covenant,&quot; while at the  sametime perfecting  the application of  the Covenant and endeavouring to evolve apractical method of increasing the effectiveness of the League.  I explained that,in the French Governments opinion, there was no occasion to amend the Covenant,and that the immediate action must bear upon the conditions governing preventiveaction (Article  11) and  those governing punitive action (Article 16). I  definedthe French conception of this two-fold problem.  As regards Article 11, it is aquestion of preventing the abuse of the unanimity rule, and as regards Article 16,of bringing about a closer relationship  between measures of economic and financialpressure and the application of military measures, while giving full value to the secret.CP. 221 (36).
system of regional understandings.   By this last term is meant  &quot; any group ofPowers-whose union is based upon geographical situation-or-upon--a-community of interests.&quot; ^ The/Government of the Republic still adheres to these conceptions. 7  ^ ) \ ^    Iff these circumstances, and since many of the Governments of  StatesJ^I^emheisof the League have not yet taken up a definite attitude on a problem which affects the fundamental principles of the Covenant, the Government of  the*::Republio iiloath for the moment to enter into a more detailed account of its own views.  As,however, its proposals have in  fact already been submitted for consideration tothe Members of the League for more than a month, and accordingly it is possiblethat they may be referred to in the observations which some of  them may wishto submit, the French Government must reserve the right before the Assemblymeets to revise or add to its previous  statements in any way that  may appearto it to be necessary.                                                    I have, &amp;c.                                                        I VON  DELBOS.
