(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC              MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).COPY NO,3  SECRET.(C. P.180/56).                    C A B 1 N E T.                        INDIA.     Appreciation of the Political Situation, by theGovernment of India, dated 18th June, 1936.     Circulated for the information of the Cabinetby the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential Appreciation of the Political Situation    in India, dated the 18th June 1936, issued on the    authority of the Secretary of State for India.   1.      The most  interesting  development  during  the last month has &quot;been  the  strengthening  of  opposition to  the policy  enunciated hy the President,  J.L.  Nehru,  at  the Congress  session at  Lucknow.   In conformity with  the resolution attacking the Government&apos;s repressive  policy he  has attempted to form a non-party  civil liberties  union hut, though it might have &quot;been expected that  such a proposal  would command some support even outside Congress circles,  the  attempt has fallen  very flat.  In response to the  suggestion to&apos; join  the union Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru gave considered  reasons for his refusal and exposed  clearly the  implications of  the policy of the  Congress party as led &quot;by  a communist, which  cannot but have an effect on moderate Hindu opinion.  The  value  of his declaration may  he judged  &quot;by the fact that it has aroused angry criticism in the extremist press. Not  only did the invitations to form  the  union  receive  little support, hut the celebrations of  Subhas Bose  Day  were  a distinct failure. In United Provinces  for  example, though the  day  was celebrated in 32 districts, in  only 10 places did the attendance reach 3 figures;  in Calcutta, a meeting attracted 6,000  people hut in the  rest of the province meetings were very thinly attended. Subhas  Bose has now been removed from  Poona  jail where he was first confined, to his brother&apos;s house at Kurseong  near Darjeeling and, provided he does not abuse them, will be granted certain concessions; it  cannot, therefore,be arguedby the  extremist press that Government are vindictive in their treatment of him.   Although their attack on Government&apos;s repressive policy has not so far met with any measure of success, it is improbable that Nehru or other leaders v/ill
                                                           2. drop this item in their programme hut will continue to proceed with it in order to create feeling against Government and against the police and executive authorities.   2.     The opposition to Nehru&apos;s views on the question of acceptance of office has in no way decreased but it is mainly the policy of socialism which has excited opposition in Congress ranks.   During his recent visit to Bombay, though he was  at pains  to explain that he did not wish to force his views on the country which could decide socialist issues after it had  obtained  independence,  his continued advocacy of communist principles evoked considerable opposition which was made clear in a  manifesto  signed by 21 leading  business men  of Bombay  condemning  unequivocally his propaganda.   His policy has  also  been criticised by some Congress  leaders;  thus Mr.Satyamurti of Madras  is reported to have said,  socialism implied violence and meant and  included the abolition of private property,  class  warfare,  and dictatorship  of the proletariat;   this was not  the  accepted policy  of  Congress which believed in non-violence  and  private  property, nationalisation  of the key industries  and taxation  of  the rich for  the  benefit  of  the poor.   Rajendra Prasad,  the ex- President, has stated that  continued exhortation to  socialism was  inopportune  and unwise and urged that  &quot;unity of action is the  greatest need of  the hour&quot;.   3.    During his tour  in Punjab, Nehru also appears  to have provoked opposition.  His reference to  the Shahidganj dispute and to Hindu-Sikh discontent over the communal award as trivial affairs,  which were obscuring the real object of the country, complete independence, is hardly likely to secure for him  or  Congress any more support, while  the fact that he &quot;hedged&quot; on the meaning of revolution will tend to discourage socialist and communist elements which had tackled him on
                                                          3. this point.  It is significant, however, that wherever he has gone he has  attracted large crowds and in spite of the opposition which lie has stirred up,  there is no doubt that his influence and prestige stand high;   he visited two notoriously criminal villages in Central Punjab, one of which had taken a leading part in civil disobedience, but it is too early to say yet whether he has  succeeded in obtaining therefrom recruits to his revolutionary policy.   4.   Judgment has been delivered in a suit filed by the Muslims for possession of the site of the demolished mosque at Shahidganj in Lahore.  The decision is adverse to the Muslims,  for the judge,  though holding  that the building was a  mosque,  found that it  had been in  continuous  possession of the  Sikhs for 170 years and among  other grounds  dismissed it as barred by limitations.   The issue of the  civil suit v/as regarded  as doubtful by  the Muslims  but their doubts did not prevent them from cherishing hopes and  their disappointment has revived to  some extent their resentment against both Government  and  the  Sikhs.   Responsible  leaders  have exhibited commendable restraint  in  their comments but some of the lesser  leaders  have delivered speeches  designed to stir  up fanatical feelings  against Government and  some  sections  of the press have  given  vent  to  similar hostile criticism.   5.    The  disturbances in Palestine have  attracted attention in  the Muslim press  and  the British Government havebeen severely criticised for  adopting a pro-Jewish policy.. Up-to-date  the Muslim public has not exhibited much feeling in the matter, but  the 19th June  is to be celebrated asPalestine Day in accordance with a resolution recently passedby the Muslim League, and it is possible that this mayintensify feeling on the subject. Nehru has also publiclyexpressed his. sympathy with the Arabs and  he and other
Congress leaders may attempt to make capital out of the agitation and to win over some of the more extreme andfanatical Muslims as their allies in attack on theGovernment.
