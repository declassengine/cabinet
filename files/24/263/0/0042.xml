THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET.&apos;COPY NO.35CABIN E T.THE SOUTH &quot;WALES COAL TRADE.Note of Meeting; with Deputation from South Wales.Memorandum By the President of the Board, of Trade.     On 29th July I  received, at the request of Sir Robert Home;a Deputation from the South Wales Trade Recovery and ExpansionCommittee.   In addition to Sir Robert Home, the Deputationincluded Mr. George Hall, M.P., Mr.  James Griffiths, M.P.,Sir Evan Williams, Chairman of the Central Council of colliery owners, Sir Stephenson Kent, Sir David Llewellyn andMr. H.H. Merrett, prominent colliery owners in South Y/ales,and Mr. .A.L. Horner, the President of the South Wales Miners^Federation.                                                     &apos;.,!     I promised the  Deputation that I would bring to the noticeof my colleagues the two main points which were made by  them,namely:     (l) The question of a subsidy for the coal export trade.          The South Wales Trade Recovery and Expansion     Committee&apos;s argument on this point is summarised in  the     following extract from a memorandum which they submitted     to me -                                        v &apos;             &quot;The obvious solution to these problems is  the        creation of a Coal Cartel to embrace all coal-producing  1        countries in Europe, but before representatives  of the        British coal trade can attempt with any real hope of        success to negotiate the formation of such a Cartel,        a subsidy must be given on coal exported from this        country.   Any attempt to bring negotiations to  success  ,!i        without this weapon in the hands of the negotiators is   \        doomed to failure. -              The Committee therefore feel that they must make        the strongest representations that the coal export        trade of the country in general and of South Wales in        particular receive a subsidy per ton of coal exported.&quot;  j
                                                  K* 5j cj     (2) The -possible substitution of Welsh  coal  for          imported coke.          The deputation argued that a shortage  of  coke     to be anticipated in this country this  winter, and     that the consequent demand should be met by  the     supply of &quot;welsh smokeless fuel, and not by  the     importation of coke from abroad.     I attach a note by the Secretary for Mines  on  thesetwo points.                                 W.E.6th August, 1936.
              MEMORANDUM 3Y THE SECRETARY FOR MINES..                      (1) Coal Export Subsidy.     Ever since 1929, when the Bill for regulating output and prices  (The Coal Mines Act, 1930) was introduced into theHouse,  discussions have been going on in the coal industry -at times very heatedly - in regard to the need for a levy oninland  coal to subsidise export coal.   Only a few weeks ago the Central Council of Colliery Owners were once moreconsidering this problem in relation to the Central Scheme forco-ordinating organised selling in the Districts - end once more they failed to agree.   I had informed the coal ownersthat if they could agree to a national levy and subsidyscheme financed by the industry I would do my best to obtainthe approval of my colleagues and of- Parliament;   but I was notprepared to impose such a subsidy in the absence of agreementamongst the coal owners themselves.     The failure to agree is due to the conflict between the inland and the export districts.   Since the war some of theexport districts, having to a large extent lost their marketsabroad, have taken advantage of low wages and cheap coastwisefreights to make a considerable encroachment on inland marketshitherto supplied from the inland, districts.   The latter mighthave been prepared to accept a levy if the exporting districts,in turn, had accepted proposals for a definite limit on theirinland. trad.e.   The two sections of the industry have nevergot near enough to one another on this point to hold out any prospect of agreement.     I have approved in the selling schemes for the exportingdistricts (South Wales,  Durham,  Northumberland and Scotland)  aprovision for levy and subsidy schemes inside those districts,but whether these are put  into operation or not,  they cannot  by themselves be of any material assistance in the maintenanceor recovery of the foreign market  for  coal.
     The principal proposal put before the President of theBoard of Trade by the Deputation from the South bales TradeRecovery and Expansion Committee on 29th July, was for a taxupon inland coal to create a fund, for the subsidisation of exports.   This proposal is in effect, I suggest, the same thing as a levy on inland trade to subsidise export trade, forthe following reasons:-   (a) The policy of the Government in encouraging the organised         selling of coal is to enable a fair economic price to         be obtained.   There must be a limit to that price and,         in fact, the Government has itself set up Committees of         Investigation to whom consumers can complain if the         coalowners were to take advantage of the organised         selling schemes to go beyond that limit,   (b) A tax on inland coal would be an addition to the price         charged to the consumer and therefore the possibilities         of raising the price to the economic limit would, be         reduced by the amount of the tax.   (c) In effect, therefore, it would still be the inland-         producers who would be paying the tax.     The Deputation on 29th July was from south Wales - aspecial area, the difficulties of which are, of course, causing the Government great anxiety - end the case for South wales was put very strongly.   It would be supported by theNorth-Fast Coast and no doubt also by Scotland.   If, however,the inland districts thought that the proposal for a tax oninland coal was being seriously considered by the government there is no doubt that they would make as strong representationsagainst the proposal as those of the exporting districts insupport of it.    If a tax on inland coal is forced upon the inland collieries their objection to it would be so strong thatthey might refuse to collect it and throw back the entireresponsibility for that function and for its administrationupon the Government.
     There is the further consideration of the attitude of labour,.It is very unlikely that the miners in tho inland districts wouldhe willing to limit their prospects of increased wages in order toassist wages in the exporting districts.   It has to he rememberedthat when wages get above the minima, which it is hoped will occur in the inland trade districts shortly, 85 per cent, of the levywould come out of wages.   In effect, what South wales is nowashing the Government to do is something of v/hich the industry asa whole does not approve and v/hich I said that I was not preparedto recorjmend except at the unanimous request of the coal industry.     The case made for the tax in relation to the prospects ofsecuring an international coal cartel is probably a good  .one.In the view of my Department it seems tmlikely that Germany will,at any rate for a very long time, be prepared to come into any :international arrangement with the United Kingdom, coal industry on reasonably satisfactory terms.   The Germans have securedsuch a hold upon the European coal markets in recent years thatthe share they wouild require in any international agreement would be impossible of acceptance by this country, arid so far as one can see, the claims of Germany are likely to increase in thenear future.   In these circumstances a fund of money providedby a tax upon inland coal which would be used as and where necessary to compete with, and to drive out, the heavily subsided German coal would^ it is thought, be most useful.As against this the experience of the past, particularly inrelation to the devaluation of sterling, has shown that subsidyis met by subsidy.   The only question is at what point would the German industry.prefer to come to terms rather than tocontinue a price war.     There is also the question - perhaps a detail - of theadministration of the fund.    presumably, the Government havingby legislation imposed the tax could not divest themselves of allresponsibility for its administration and distribution.    In anycase, before a final decision could be taken it would benecessars&apos;- to discuss further with the coalowners both the                       -51.
                                                        $ Q a                                                        FS Q t?question of administration and the amount of tax that would &quot;berequired.     One further point should he mentioned.&apos;   Some difficulties might arise in the protected Scandinavian and Baltic markets &quot;byreason of the undertakings given to them that they will not hecharged a higher price than is charged to other countries for thesame coal.   Since, however, the principal weight of Germancompetition falls in markets taking to a large extent differentcoals from those sold to Scandinavia, these difficulties might possibly be overcome, except for the general effect on the world price of British coal of a reduction in price in particularmarkets.     (2) Substitution of \7Q1S3I, coal for imported coke.     One proposal urged by the Deputation from the south balesTrade Recovery and Expansion Committee on 89th July for assisting the South &quot;ales coal trade was that measures should be taken bythe Government (either by the prohibition of, or the impositionof a tariff or quota on, imported coke) to ensure that any marketcreated in London and the Home Counties by a. possible shortage of coke for domestic purposes should be barred to foreign coke, inorder that Welsh smokeless fuel might have the opportunity of supplying this demand.     While information furnished to my Department indicates thatcoke production will be sufficient to meet the demands of theiron and steel industry, it is admitted that there is alikelihood, of a shortage, chiefly for domestic purposes, inLondon and the Home Counties during the coming winter.   Theamount of the deficiency has been variously estimated, but it ispossible that it may not be of very substantial proportions -say, in the neighbourhood of 200,000 tons;     The Deputation claimed that Welsh smokeless fuel was quitesuitable for the purposes  for which coke was used and that itcould fill any deficiency in supplies of coke.    There appearsto be no reason to question this.    Only &quot;sized&quot; coal,  however,                         -4-
                                                      f* *? wwould be suitable, but it is probable that sufficient supplies could be made available, if need be, by resort to breaking oflarge coal.    At the same time the question of price ismaterial, and the Deputation admitted that this was a handicap,,There can, however, be no question of Government assistance inregard to transport costs from South Wales to the metropolitan area.     There can, it is thought, be no question of prohibition ofthe import of coke.   Apart from other considerations, thiscourse would appear to be contrary to existing treaty provisions, e.g., with Germany.     The course recommended to the Deputation by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (i.e., of submitting their case to theImport Duties Advisory Committee with a view to theimposition of a duty) appears to he the mostfeasible.   If that course is adopted, the Committee will no doubt make a full enquiry covering the suitability of Welshsmokeless coal as a subsitute for coke;   the ability of the producers to fill any deficiency in coke supplies;  theprice at which the coal would be placed on the market;  thepossibility of the sale of this coal preventing a reversionfrom coke to imported oil, and the effect of the proposed action on our coke export markets,                            H.C.
