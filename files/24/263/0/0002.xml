      (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .SECRET.CP. 172 (56) .                                CABINET.                                ---                                REPORT OF THE                COMMITTEE ON THE REGULATIONS OF THE TOIEi PLOYMSNT                              ASSISTxJ\TCE BOARD. 1.     The Committee have considered the proposals of the Unemployment Assistance Board for revised Regulations as described in detail in U.A.R.(34) 8 attached as appendix.   They have also had an opportunity of hearing a full explanation of the proposals from the Board. 2.     The proposals which the Committee recommend for approval are, with two exceptions, in accordance with the proposals contained inU.A.R. (34) 8.   The Committee have ascertained that the Board are prepared to submit amendments to their original proposal for dealing with rent and earnings, which the Committee accept as satisfactory.        The Committee wish to emphasise that the solution of  the problem of new Regulations, difficult and troublesome as it is, is a matter that must be faced and faced without further delay.   A considerable number of reductions from the allowances payable under the Standstill Act are inevitable, unless the new Regulations are as extravagant as the transitional payments practice  of the most extravagant Local Authorities;   there are no alterations to the proposals which the Committee could recommend which would avoid such reduction. Alterations would merely raise the general standard of assistance still further, at considerable extra expense, without appreciably easing the difficulties. 3.     The proposals contemplate a transitional period of one year during which the new regulations will be gradually applied in so far as they involve reductions.   This will avoid a situation of the kind which caused the difficulties on the last occasion.    The proposals further provide, in accordance with the Election Manifesto, for association with local opinion through Local Advisory Committees,  both in regard to clearing up the Standstill position and on the difficult local problem of rent.      The Committees                                    1.
will &quot;be about 120 in number, with a membership of 20 or 30 members.   Some  ofthe members are persons nominated by the Local Authorities, others, have beensuggested by the Local Employment Committees,  and others are individuallychosen by the Board from among people in the locality with local knowledge and experience and interest in the work.  Under the terms of the Act theCommittees are advisory to the Board,4.  The new proposals change the existing Regulations in the following ways:-     SCALE.     The weekly scale rates under the present Regulations and under theproposals are as follows.   Changes are underlined.Class of case.

5.   In addition, the proposal contains what may be called a guaranteed&quot;fall-back&quot; related to the present unemployment benefit rates, in the caseof oertain applicants.   These are applicants with dependants and noresources -which under the Regulations are to be treated as available tothem.   The amount of the &quot;fall back&quot; is the present unemployment benefitrate for the applicant (including any increase of benefit for his dependants living with him) less such reduction, if any, as falls to bemade on account of low rent and, exceptionally, owing to the &quot;wage stop&quot;adjustments for rural areas, and odd cases of special circumstances.    Thisguaranteed payment will appJy to all the applicants affected, whether ornot they are insured under the Unemployment Insurance Scheme.   This&quot;fall back&quot; will go far to meet the criticism which will otherwise fastenupon the scale rate of 24/- for man and wife.   Further, in those cases in which the fall back will not apply, the new rent rule will have asubstantial effect in increasing the allowances.   The Board state, forexample, that in the cases of man and wife more than half pay more than&amp;/&quot; in rent, and will thus have scale rates of more than 24/-;  one thirdpay 8/- or more, and will thus have scale rates of 26/- or above.     The proposed scale rates are an improvement on the existing rates in(a) allowance for female householder, (b) abolition of reduction for&quot;subsequent member&quot;, (c) increase of allowance for female adults at homeand (d) for females of 18 to 21, (e) increase of allowance for adolescentsbetween 16 and 18 years, (f) abolition of &apos;supercut&apos; for large families,(g) a common basic rate (subject to adjustment) for applicants living inlodgings or as boarders.     The proposals retain the figure of 10/- as the appropriate scaleallowance for &quot;adult male members of the household&quot;.   This rate is notuncommon under the Standstill in many industrial areas, but there are some areas, particularly in South Wales, where such members receive 17/-, andothers where more than 10/- is paid.   In conjunction with the other rates,however, the scale allowance for adult members of the household is reasonable, especially in view of the practice of the Board of increasingthe allowance where hardship arises.
       The Committee have given a good deal of consideration to the proposedrate of  15/- for persons living alone.   This rate  is subject to adjustment,on  the face of the Regulations, and in a large number of cases more  than15/- will in fact be paid.   In particular in the case of older men  whoare receiving 16/- or 17/- under the Standstill,there is no intention ofdisturbing these rates.   In the case of the younger single men, many ofwhom could transfer to other districts, the Committee feel that the  amountof  the allowances should be no more than are strictly necessary and considerthat in  general 15/- is sufficient.       Taken as a whole the scale lias been  appreciably improved and  producesallowances which appear to the Committee satisfactory.6o     adjustment of allowances for variations in rent.       The principle of adjusting allowances by reference to the actual rentpaid is  retained, as indeed it must be in view of the wide variation  of rents paid by households of the same composition, not only as between one area and another but also in the same area.    The rent rule has,however, been completely transformed and in the form now proposed (which isan improvement on that in paragraph 20 of U.A.R.(54)8) is now much more flexible than the rigid rent rule which gave rise to so much trouble in thefirst Regulations.    Increases for high rent may, after consultation with theadvisory Committees, be paid where the actual rent exceeds a quarter of thetotal of the scale rates for the whole household.   In cases where theactual rent is less than a quarter of the scale  rates the Local AdvisoryCommittees will,  on the face of the regulations, be empowered to make recommendations with regard to reductions on account of rent to the  effect     (l)   that the difference between the actual rent and a quarter of the           total of the scale rates should,  up to the whole or any specified           amount,  be disregarded,.or     (2)   that for the purposes of determining reductions a lower proportion           than one quarter should be substituted,  and     (3)   in addition that in appropriate classes of cases the difference           between the actual rent and the substituted proportion should,up           to the whole or any specified amount, be disregarded.       These adjustments may be recommended  for  any classes of pases  either in the whole area or in part of it.
    In view of the part to be played by the Advisory Committees  thetreatment of reductions for low rents will vary from area to area.    Insome areas, e.g* London, the Committees may think it appropriate to  retain the figure of one-quarter but to protect a small number of lower rents bydisregarding a fixed amount, while in other areas where the general  levelof rents is low, as in Scotland, Committees may prefer to substitute a lowerproportion, within certain cases, an additional protection of a fixed amount.The Board say that, with their knowledge of rents actually paid by applicants,they would regard as reasonable a substitution of a lower proportion, say  ofa fifth or a sixth, according to the area, or alternatively the disregard of an amount up to 3/- in appropriate cases, or finally, in appropriate cases, e*g. the lower scale allowances,a disregard of some small specifiedamount in addition to the substitution of the lower proportion than  a quarter of the scale rates.      It should be noted that a reduction on account of low rent from thetotal scale rates will not necessarily mean a reduction of current payments,-as the allowances are the result of calculations of the scale, the rentadjustment and also the earnings rule.   It will happen therefore that areduction on account of low rent may, through the improvement in the other factors, be accompanied by an increase in the total payment as comparedwith the existing payment.7.   The easing of the means test.     Within the framework of the existing Act it is proposed that the means test should be eased -      (i) by distinguishing between the contributions that may be expected         from the earnings of a married child or married brothers and         sisters living with an unemployed applicantj  and unmarried         children and brothers or sisters respectively!    (ii) by improvement of the earnings rule.    A married son with a wife and child living with an applicant would,under the proposals, unless his earnings were very high, be regarded ascontributing no more to the household than he would reasonably beexpected to pay if he and his dependants were boarders, and the amountallowed to him for his personal requirements would be adjusted accordingly.
     As regards the earnings rule for unmarried sons and daughters, brothersand sipters of the applicant, the existing Regulations provide that an allowance for personal requirements shall be one-third of the first pound andone-quarter of any subsequent earnings, together with the appropriate scalemaintenance rate of the wage earner.   The new proposals as improved sincethe Minister of Labour&apos;s paper U.A.R.(34)8 (paragraph 26), are that the wageearning members aged 21 and over should retain the first 14s. of their earnings plus one-half of the remainder, with a minimum of 20s., this to beinclusive of the wage earner1s maintenance;  between 18 and 21 12s. plus one-half of the remainder, with a minimum of 16s; and under 18 12s. plus one-halfof the remainder.     Under the   present rule an unmarried son aged over 21 and earning 40/-would retain 21s*8d., and is regarded as contributing to the needs of theunemployed applicant 18s. 4d.   Under the proposal he retains for himself 27s.and is regarded as contributing 13s. to the maintenance of the unemployedapplicant.     As regards the earnings of the applicant, his wife, his father andmother, the present rule is to allow the first 5s. or one-half of. the earnings, whichever is the less.     Under the proposed rule the first 3s. or one-half of the earnings,whichever is the greater, is allowed, subject to a maximum of 8s.     Under the present rule an applicant obtains a direct advantage from anyearnings up to a maximum of 10s., but the rule involves taking into accountearnings however small.   The proposed rule allows the applicant the first3so and allows him to obtain direct advantage from earnings up to 16s. a week.8.   The provisions for adjustments to the allowances in &quot;specialciroia-nstances&quot; for the &quot;wage stop&quot;, and for &quot;exceptional needs&quot; areretained.   One additional provision is necessary to provide for theapplication of the Regulations to rural areas.   It is proposed that thelocal Committees in such areas should make general recommendations as tothe manner in which allowances should be adjusted.9 *   Transitional period.     This is an important part of the proposals and the Committee recommendthat the method proposed by the Minister of Labour (paragraphs 36-52 of u.A.R.(34)8 should  be-adopted.                                  7.
                                                                       2) (nt The Regulations will  give power  to the Board for a  transitional period of a year  to pay more  than the allowance payable under the Regulations to persons who are in  receipt of such higher payments  under  the Standstill Act, or  would be in receipt of them if the Standstill Act were continued.      In exercising  this power the Board will, by the terms of the Regulations, give consideration  to any recommendations which the Advisory Committee  may  make, and the Regulation will be  so drafted that the  recommendations of the Advisory Committee must be directed to the question of the progressive adjustments to be made  in various classes  of cases in the area,  so that during the transitional period the assessment may be brought into conformity with the standard of  the regulations.     In a considerable number of areas there are cases of grossly excessive payments which may be roughly defined aa payments more than 10/- in excess of the allowances calculated under the Regulations.  While generally it is proposed that the allowances during the transitional period shall be on the same basis for all  similar cases in the area, it is not proposed to create fresh cases of such grossly excessive payments.   Existing allowances  of this kind will be reduced gradually.     The Board propose that in the first three or four months, subject to considering the views of the Advisory Committees, the reduction from current payments which may be involved by the Regulations shaj.1 be limited to the cases of grossly excessive payments, and to the cases of single men under 25 years of age, whether living in lodgings or at home,where the present allowance is in excess of the regulation allowance.     In the remainder of cases they would not propose generally to begin reducing existing determinations during the first six months or so where the difference is only 2/- or 3/-, and would at all times avoid making a large number of simultaneous reductions merely for the  sake of bringing the allowances into conformity with the regulation figure. This will not apply to reductions which will arise from a change of circumstances.
     In view of the improvements in the rent rule and of the &quot;benefitfall-back the Board anticipate that during the transitional periodnearly all the reductions from exisiting payments that in practice wouldbe made apart from single men will arise in the case  of households withresources.   The amount of resources in the households is constantlychanging, but is showing, as is natural with the improvement in trade, atendency to increase, and the Board think that with care and the help of the local Advisory Committees, it should be possible gradually duringthe period to bring standstill allowances into a reasonable conformitywith the standard of the Regulations without undue disturbance.10.   The turnover of the Register and the fluctuations in the resourcesof the households with earning members, and also the fact that local opinion, through the Advisory Committee, is to be fully associated withthe Board during the transitional period, make it impossible to give any,reliable forecast of the numbers of cases where existing payments willbe reduced as a result of the new Regulations.   The only way of making any calculation would be to assume that the new Regulations would beapplied in full on a single day.   This disregards the changes in theRegister and in the circumstances of the household.   Such a calculationwould therefore be unreal and misleading.     It is possible, however, to make an estimate of the results inthe first three or four months where reductions from existing payments will be confined to the two classes of grossly excessive payments and young men under 25.   The Board have supplied the Minister of Labour withthe attached statement covering the results in a number of areas whichthe Minister chose as illustrative of the problem in different types oflocality.
     The total number of the reductions in those classes is roughly-estimated at about 60,000.   The increases on existing payments will, on thebasis of the present facts, be about 250,000;  they will occur in all areas,and will become effective during the first four or five weeks.11.   Cost.     In submitting their proposals the Board pointed out the difficulty of framing an estimate of cost in advance of actual experience of the revisedRegulations, and. in particular without a knowledge of the advice likely tobe given by Advisory Committees with regard to the working of the new RentRule and otherwise.   Upon the information at their disposal, however, and making what they regarded as reasonable assumptions as to the advice whichwould be given by the Advisory Committees, the Board estimated that the costof their proposals, apart from the cost of the Transitional arrangements forthe liquidation of the Standstill, would be approximately the same as thatwhich is being incurred at the present time under the existing Standstillarrangements, i,e.  40? million per annum for 665,000 weekly payments.   TheBoard further estimated the additional cost of liquidating the Standstillgradually over a period of a year, very approximately at  2,000,000.    the alterations in the Rent Rule and the Earnings Rule which have been made sincethe Board&apos;s proposals were submitted are,  on such assumptions as can be made  jas regards the Rent Rule,  together estimated to  cost  from  400,000 to  500,000 1                                                                              1per annum.   These alterations would to some extent reduce the cost ofliquidating the Standstill.   The best estimate which can be made on present   1information and on the basis of existing numbers and circumstances of                                                                               Iapplicants is that the total additional oost of the proposals as compared with 1the cost of the existing arrangements would very approximately bo  2,000,000for the first year and thereafter  g- million a year.12.   Date of Operation.     The Board have informed the Committee that since the Regulations are not likely to be approved before the end of July it will not now be possible,owing to the difficulty of getting Advisory Committees together during the holiday season and in view of the wide reference to the Committees on thesubject of rent, for the Regulations to come into operation on the date in theMinisters Memorandum (U.A.R. (34)8) - namely, 1st October next - and that  the                                10.
2 3earliest date that oould safely be fixed is the loth November,   TheCommittee therefore recommend that this should be the date adopted.,13.   Second Appointed Day.       The Committee approve the recommendation that the Second appointed day should be. 1st April, 1937^14,    The Committee&apos;s recommendations to the Cabinet may be summarisedas follows :-     (l)  That the proposals of the Unemployment Assistance Board for           revised reguls/tions set out in the Apjpendix to this Report           should be approved, subject to the amendments suggested           by the Board for dealing with rent and earnings explained           in paragraphs 6 and 7 of this Report, which amendments the           Committee have accepted as sa.tisfactory.     (2)  That the method proposed by the Minister of Labour for           liquidating the &quot;Standstill&apos; (paragraphs 36-52 of Appendix)           should be appi-removed.     (3)  That the dat e on which the revised Regulations should come into           operation should be 16th November, 1935, and not 1st October,           1956, as previously contemplated, and that the Second           Appointed Day should be 1st April, 1937.15.    We regret that the Secretary of State for Scotland is not incomplete agreement with this Report, and we understand that he willbe circulating a Memorandum expressing his ovm views.

Appendix:6-iTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTYTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET.U.A.R.(34) 8.COPY NO.CABINET.COMMITTEE ON THE REGULATIONS OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT                ASSISTANCE BOARD.Note &quot;by the Minister of Labour.      My discussions with the Unemployment Assistance Board with regard  to new Regulations have now reached a stage  at which the  draft proposals  . should be brought before the Committee  and I,  therefore,  circulate the accompanying memorandum.      I am able  to agree  with the Board&apos;s  recommendations  on all points of  substantial  importance,  except one - the  method of  liquidating the Standstill as to which I may refer to paragraphs  36 to 52 of  the attached memorandum      Under the  Act it is for the Board  to  take  the -&quot;nitiative in proposing Regulations but the final responsibility for the  draft to be placed before Parliament rests with me.   The  Board have not  as yet  submitted formal regulations for my approval.   They agree with  me that before they do so, the whole  matter should  be  discussed by me with my colleagues.      The new Regulations will require approval  by resolution of both Houses. It will also  be  necessary for both Houses  to pass a Resolution bringing the Standstill Act to  an end.    I understand that the measures for liquidating the  Standstill  will  not require legislation, but as the point is not entirely  free from doubt  it will be advisable to consult theLaw Officers  in  due course.(intd.)     E.B.
STATUTORY PROCEDURE.1.    The  procedure for making Unemployment Assistance Regulations is laiddown by Section 52(2) of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1934.   TheBoard have first tc- submit draft regulations to the Minister of Labour.  TheMinister  has power to modify the draft  so submitted, but if he intends te doso,  he  must inform the Board and must consider the Report which the Boardmust then make with regard to the rroposed alterations;  this Report,together  with a statement of the Minister&apos;s reasons for his alterations,must be laid before Parliament.      The  Regulations which the Minister proposes to make require approval by resolution of both Houses of Parliament, and are not subject to amendment2.    The  Unemployment Assistance Regulations (which aro at present operative(subject  to the Standstill arrangements) were approved by the House ofCommons on 19th Deoember, 1934, and by the House of Lords on 20th December,The Minister made the Regulations on 21st Deoember and at the same timeissued  an Order fixing 7th January and 1st March, 1935, as the First and second Appointed days respectively,  M3,   On 7th January, 1935, the Hrst Appointed Day, the unemployment assistance Board began the task of taking over from the public assistance committee the 725,000 current applications for transitional payments. It was hoped that the transfer would be completed by the Second Appointed Day on1st Maroh, when the persons (200,000 or more) in the remairiing classesvdLthin the soapo of the assistance scheme would become eligible to apply tothe Board for assistance,4,   The Regulations produced reductions in a large number of cases from thelevel of  transitional payments.  In more than half the cases dealt with therates of payment were reduced;  many classes of applicants and all types cfdistricts were affected.   It had been stated in tho White Paper (Grad.4765)covering  the draft regulations and stressed in the Debate that under theRegulations tho annual rate of expenditure on tho classes taken over on the7th  January was estimated to be about  3,000,000 above the amount
 ( 41,000,000) x  then being spent in respect of persons entitled to transitional payments,  It turned out that during the first weeks of the new Scheme the scale  of expenditure under the Regulations instead of being  3,000,000 more than under the Transitional Payments Scheme was in fact  3,000,000 less, i.e. it was  6,000,000 less than had been estimated (see paragraph 6 of U.A.R.(54) 5).     In these circumstances it was decided to declare a &quot;Standstill&quot; pending investigation and the Unemployment Assistance (Temporary Provisions) Act was accordingly passed on 15th February.   The adoption of the Standstill involved the postponement during its continuance of the Second Appointed Day and a pay- ment by the Exchequer to Local Authorities in respect of the relief of those able-bodied persons who were to have been transferred to the Board on 1st March. 5.   The broad effect of the Temporary Provisions Act was to suspend the operation of the Regulations in those cases where they would have resulted in cuts   in comparison with transitional payments.  Under the Act,  applicants for unemployment assistance arc entitled to payment at the rate which would havebeen assessed in their, cases by way of transitional payments or at the appropriaterate under the Regulations, whichever is the more favourable to the applicant.6,   The criticisms which led to the Standstill had been directed principally to the number and nature of the  cuts as compared with transitional payments.Immediately after the Temporary Provisions Act was passed the Board began a. fullinquiry into the position.  They reported the preliminary results of this inquiry to my predecessor on 19th February,  1935, (in a memorandum (U.A.R. (34) 4) which dealt,  among other things,  with the reasons for the difference  between theestimated and actual rate of expenditure.    In May they completed an analysis of the effect of the Regulations particularly in relation to the Transitional Payments situation as it had previously existed and they also made suggestions for amended Regulations (U.A.R. (34) 7).   This report describes in some detail the principles on v/hich the previous Regulations had been drawn up and the classes of cases in which allowances had been reduced;  it also gives  instances of excessive payments which had necessarily to be continued K   This figure is based upon an average number of 725,000 applicants of the Transitional Payments classes in receipt of assistance.  The actual number has since fallen somewhat but for convenience of comparison subsequent estimates of cost in this memorandum are (except where otherwise stated) based on the same figure of 725,000.                                         2.
 under the Standstill.    When I came to  the Ministry of Labour  a preliminary examination of the Board&apos;s report made  it clear that  the proposals  in  certain respects would not be  acceptable to me  and detailed discussions between  the Board and my Department were thereupon  undertaken and have now resulted  in the present memorandum. 7.    Since the passing of  the Standstill  Act  there have been two  developments in other fields which  have an important bearing on our consideration of  the problem before us.   The first is  that  there  has been an increasing tendency on the part of Poor Lav/ authorities  to  adopt as  their scale rate  for man  and wife the sum of 26s.  per  week.    This corresponds  to  the unemployment benefit rate for a man and wife and compares with 24-/- in  the Board1 s existing Regulations. In the  cases protected by  the  Standstill,  therefore,  the rate of 26/-  is being paid  wherever  it is now the Poor Law figure.    A list of the areas which have adopted this rate is included  in Appendix I.   Tho second development  is that since October last the  unemployment benefit rate  for  children has been increased to 3s.   This has been reflected in the unemployment allowances payable under the Standstill to applicants living in  areas where the Poor Law rate  for  children was already  as much as  3s.  or has since been increased to that  figure.   A list of such  areas is attached  (Appendix II). 8.    The  cost of unemployment  assistance,   as modified by the Standstill Act and taking into  account the increased rates payable on account of the changes in poor Law practice referred to  in the preceding paragraph,  is working out at a level of roughly  44 m. per annum or almost exactly the amount  which theRegulations  were estimated to  cost.     It is significant also that the strong feelings aroused by the originalarrangements were almost immediately calmed by the Standstill and that  there  isat present no  effective public criticism of tho Standstill  arrangements.    On theother hand,  the present position is open to the objection that  the manyanomalies arising from the varying practices of different areas,  anomalieswhich the Board was set up to abolish,  are being continued.   It was with these considerations in mind that a statement on unemployment assistance was  drawnup in consultation with the Board and included in the  Government Manifesto
issued immediately prior to the General Election.  The statement in thatManifesto was as follows:-                            UMEMPLD^iENT ASSISTANCE,..          The arrangements under the Unemployment Assistance scheme have     received prolonged and anxious consideration hy the Government, and,     as already stated in Parliament, no alteration will he made in the     existing &quot;standstill&quot; arrangements &quot;before next spring at the earliest.     The Government regard it as important to maintain the existing powers     of the Unemployment Assistance Board and the general frame-work of the     Unemployment Assistance Act.  They will, however, give effect to any     recommendations by the Board for improved arrangements, where these     may be shown by experience to be desirable.  The &quot;standstill&quot; arrangc-     commitments  are, as they were always intended to bo temporary.  They must be     replaced by permanent arrangements, which must remedy certain abuses     and, at the same time avoid hardship to applicants.  Any action must be     gradual, and must be carried out in full association with local opinion,     so as to give effect to reasonable differences in the localities.  As     regards the Means Test, the Government believe that no responsible person     would seriously suggest that Unemployment Assistance, which is not     insurance benefit ought to be paid without regard to the resources     properly available to tho applicant.  The question is not whether there     should be a Moans Test, but what that test should be.  This is a matter     which is now under close examination, but in any scheme great importance     will bo attached to maintaining tho unity of family life, and, in     addition, provision will be made to meet any cases of proved hardship.General Considerations.9.   When the Proposals for permanent arrangements to replace tho existingtemporary arrangements are before Parliament there arc four main points onwhich attention is likely to be concentrated.  They are -          (a) tho scale;          (b) tho rent rule;          (c) the household test, including tho earnings rule;  and          (d) the method of liquidating the existing position.10.  When the existing Regulations were introduced the Scale in itself did not meet with any substantial criticism.   Parliament undoubtedly failed to appreciate the effect of the rent rule on the application of tho scale, butthis calls for consideration of the rent rule rather than of the scale itself.Some of the changes which have since been made in Poor Law practice will,however,  make it more difficult to defend certain of tho figures in tho scale than it was in 1934-.11.  The effect of the Rent Rule in reducing allowances was one of the maincauses of the protests which lod to the Standstill.  The scale figurescontained a definite proportion for rent and the Rent Rule provided a moansof automatic adjustment of tho allowances wherever the actual rent paid was
above  or below the rent allowed for in tho total scale rates of thohousehold.  As already stated the effect of this when rents v/ere low,particularly in  Scotland, was not realised when the regulations were underdiscussion and the actual &quot;cuts&quot; came as a surprise to members ofParliament.12.  As regards  the Household Test and the operation of the Earnings RuleI need not remind my colleagues that these will be the focus of politicalattack.  There are certain adjustments which must be made, but I assume thatwc shall hold fast on the main issue of tho household principle.15.  As regards  the method of liquidating the present position, the problem to bo  solved is  how best to arrive at the position in which tho new regulations will operate fully throughout tho country.   The problem is, ofcourse, akin to  that which faced tho Board in January of last year whenbringing the Regulations into operation.  In many cases there were thenbeing paid, by way of transitional payments, allowances at a rate higherthan the level authorised by the Regulations;  and similarly at the presentmoment allowances at that former level arc not only protected by statutebut, as has been shown above, have been increased in many areas followingincreases in Poor Law rates and the increase of children1s allowances in thebenefit scheme (see paragraph 7).  As on the former occasion, therefore, thonew Regulations  will lead in certain types of cases to reductions in thecurrent rate of  allowances.     Wc should not, in my opinion, repeat the attempt made on the previous occasion to bring the Regulations into force without any period of transition.Proposals for now Regulations.14.  Tho Board have not as yet submitted draft regulations such as must bedealt with by the procedure prescribed by Section 52 (2) of the Act.  the following Proposals are, however, the result of full discussion between theBoard and myself.  Except where otherwise stated,  the Board and I are inagreement with regard to them.;
15.  SCALE.     The weekly scale rates under the present Regulations and under theproposals are as follows.

Female          12s.)H Subject to adjustment by way of increase or reduction to meet the  circumstances of a particular case.     Claimants with a dependant or dependants and without available resources.A special fall-back is proposed for this class of claimants, vis.  an amount equal to the unemployment benefit that would have been applicable to them ifthey had been eligible for benefit, less only the reduction (if any) arisingfrom the application of the rent rule to their scale rate.  Where the scalecalculation produces an amount loss than the fall-back, the fall-back will bepaid.16,  The main issue on the scale relates to the figure for man and wife (24s.)as compared with the rate of 26s. paid as benefit and by many Poor LawAuthorities (see paragraph 7 above).  There is a corresponding difference of. in all cases of a man and wife and two or more children under the age of 5.     It should not be overlooked, however, that the rent rule will increase thescale rates to more than 24/- in half the cases and more than 26/- in a thirdof the cases.  So far as this is not so the &quot;fall-back&quot; described at the endof paragraph 15 substantially meets the point here raised in the case ofclaimants without resources;  such claimants will receive not less than thebenefit rates, save in a small proportion of cases in which the rent rule(see paragraph 20) will cause a reduction, usually quite small in amount.     As the fall-back is a guaranteed payment, it cannot apply to resourcescases.     These cases are treated under tho earnings rule (see paragraph 25)which in relation to the scale rates are considered to yield allowances whichare fully sufficient for the needs of the applicant.  This is the answer toany suggestion that the non-application of the fall-back to resources casesrobs the earnings rule of 2/-^ of its apparent value.                                  7.
      Two other difficulties arise.   The first relate to single  men and women in lodgings who arc in general to receive 15/-.    It is important  to note that  a special proviso is attached to this rate,  which will he administered flexibly. In certain cases,  eg.  men in common lodging  houses,  less than  15/- may be appropriate,  but a number of applicants, e.g. elderly men,  or women living in a room of their own will  probably receive more  than 15/-.      The fact must,  therefore,  be faced that  in many parts  of the country 17/-  is paid under the Standstill,  and on public assistance;   it is also  the present benefit rate.      The second which is numerically much  loss important, is tho  scale  rate  of 10/- and 9/-  for adult  men and women living as racmbcrs of the household.  Although a rate  of 10/- is  not uncommon under tho Standstill  in many industrial  areas, there are some- areas, particularly  in Sovith Y/alcs, where  such members of  a house- hold receive  17/-, and  others where  more than 10/- is paid.      Therefore this  type of case will also involve a  number of  cuts.      But on both these  issues relating to  single  persons  I  think  wc  can defend the  proposals and  face  the  objections. 17.   Other points  to be  noticed are  that:-      (a) the  super-cut  (paragraph 15(v) above)  of la.  for each member of  a          household of over  5 disappears;      (b) the  rates for  adolescent members  of  the  household  are  improved and  the          reduced rates  for  &quot;subsequent members&quot; of tho household  also disappear;      (c) the  allowance  in part  II for a single person living  alone is expressed          as a flat rate  of  15s. irrespective  of sex.   In the  case of an adult          person living as a member of the  household,  however, the female member          will receive a  lower allowance than  the male.  There may be  some          criticism on this  account.  As pointed out above, however, the Board do          not  intend to pay  15s. in every case:  the allowances will be  subject to          adjustment in tho  light of  individual circumstances; 18.   Rent.      As  indicated in paragraph  11 above the figures in the  scale are assumed to contain  a fixed proportion  for  rent  (&quot;basic rent&quot;) and the purpose of the Rent Rule  is  to  provide an automatic means of adjustment of the allowances wherever the actual rent paid by the applicant differs from the amount of rent assumed to be included in the  total scale allowance of the household.  As will be realised the operation of  this rule results  in a reduction from the scale rates wherever a low rent  is being paid.  This, however,  in my  judgment is only material to our consideration where such reductions result in a decrease in allowances bolow the Transitional Payments rate.  In other cases the joint effect of the Rent Rule and various  other provisions of the Regulations is to produce an allowance at a  rate at least as high as and in many cases higher than that paid under the Transitional Payments scheme, and no serious complaint on account of tho operation of tho Rent Rule has been made in such cases.   In framing the new Rent Rule, therefore,  it lias been the aim to avoid unnecessary increases to households wherethe allowances arc already at least  as high as the Transitional  paymentsAllowances, but, so far as practicable, to  avoid cuts on account of rent in thecases which are now protected by the Standstill
19.  The present Kent Rule pro/ides:-3 jijt    (a) a basic rent of one-quarter of the scale allowance plus ls.6d for       scale allowances below 24s. ;    (b) a basic rent of 7s.8d for scale allowances between 24s. and 30s.;    (c) a basic rent of one-quarter of the total scale allowance for scale       allowances above 30s.;    (d) a direction to reduce the allowance vdiere the net rent is less than       the basic rent, such reductions, however, to be subject to a       discretionary modification not exceeding ls.6d. ;    (o) a direction to increase the allowance if the net rent exceeds the basic       rent, up to one-third of the basic rent allowance.     Where the rent exceeds the maximum allowance under the scale, there isdiscretion to increase the allowance up to the full amount of the rent if theamount is reasonable.  This discretion is being used in a large number of cases.20.  It is now proposed:-     (i) that the basic rent be one-quarter of the total scale allavvance in         all cases.         Apart from the simplicity of this, one marked advantage is that for         man and wife on a scale of 24s. the basic rent will be 6s. as against         7s.6d under the present Rule;    (ii) subject to (iii), that where the net rent differs from the basic rent         the allowance shall be increased or decreased by such amount as is         reasonable and that in making such increases or reductions due regard         shall be paid to recommendations by Advisory Committees as to the         application of this Rent Rule to various classes of cases in their area;    (iii) if the scale rate is 32s, or less the first 3s. of any difference         between actual and basic rent shall be disregarded (with adjustments         for marginal cases where the scale rate is ever 32s,) when the actual         rent is less than the basic rent.    (Note:  &quot;Actual&quot; rent includes rates if paid by the tenant).21.  As regards (iii) of the above proposed rule, the households protectedunder the Standstill from cuts on account of low rent are, generally speaking,those comprised in a group of man and wife, and man, wife and 1, 2 or 3children.  Prior to the recent change in the children&apos;s benefit rate, themaximum allowance for this group was 32s.  It is now 35s.;  but, if 35s. were substituted for 32s. in the proposed rule, households  other than those atpresent protected by the Standstill would receive increases unnecessarily,For that reason it has been thought preferable to adhere to the figure of 32s.A tablo (Appendix  III ) is attached showing for certain representative townsthe percentage of applicants in that group whose rents are lower than the basic rent appropriate to their households.- -
 22.  An  example  of  the  effect of the rule in&apos; the case of a childless couplewithout  resources with  a scale rate of 24s.  and a fall-hack of 26s. will serve to illustrate how it would work.   In  such a case the assumed or basic rent will he; 6s.  (i.e.  one quarter of the scale rate of 24s.) and noreduotion on  account of low rent will be made, save where the rent is below 3s.If, for  example, the rent is 2s. a reduction of Is. only may follow, i.e. the allowance may be at the rate of 25s.   where the rent is in excess of 6s. areasonable increase will be given in the light of any recommendation made bythe Advisory  Committee  of the area.23.  It  seem a necessary to retain the provision for a reduction of allowances in the case of very low rents in order to leave the Board discretion to dealwith cases where the applicant is living in undesirable housing conditions.If no reduction could be made on account of  low rent, it would equally beimpossible, to increase  the allowance when the claimant moved to a better housebut still paid no more  than the basic rent.24.  It will be seen that an important part of the new rule is the functionassigned to Advisory Committees to made recommendations to the Board as to whatwould be reasonable adjustments on account of rent (either increases ordecreases) in regard to any particular class in the area.   It will be observed that the Committee&apos;s functions are  advisory only and that it is opento the Board  to reject  the advice wherever they regard it as unreasonable inall the  circumstances.25.  The Household. Test (including the Earnings Rule).     The Board have been advised that the interpretation of what constitutes a household cannot be altered by way of Regulations and that they are bound by the terms  of the Act to take into account the resources of all members ofan applicants household.   Accordingly, unless there is legislation, the only way of relaxing the present Means Test is by way of concessions in the earnings Rule, i.e. by  reducing the liability of the wage-earning members ofai household to contribute to the. maintenance of the. unemployed applicant andhis dependants.
26.   The present rule and the proposals are as follows:-Present Regulations.                    Allowances.Description of member of household.  (i) Applicant. (ii) Applicant&apos;s wife, husband., father      or mother.(iii) Applicant&apos;s son or daughter      (including a person who, whether      related or not has from childhood      been brought up by applicant as. a      son or daughter), brother or      sister.

It will be seen that the proposal maintains the grouping of members of households into a series of grades, with dirrdnishing degrees of liability tomake contributions, but alters the boundary between the third and fourth grades.In the first and second, grades are placed (as at present) the applicant and his;wife, husband, father or mother.   The third grade at present includes all sons,daughters, brothers and sisters of the applicant who belong to the household.                                   11.
                                                                       .-..42The proposal transfers from the third to the fourth grade those sons, daughters,brothers and sisters who have dependants, i.e. in general those who  are marriedand have a wife or children living with them.   The fourth grade includes inaddition (as at present) all other members of the household vfao are  more remotely-related to the applicant.  This grouping is the result of much careful considera-tion of the matter by the Board and myself, and I think it is justifiable.Appendix IV illustrates the effect of the present and of the proposed Rules incertain ranges of earnings.28.   In this matter of grouping, I have been much exercised in mind whether (asis now the case and is proposed) it is right to place a greater obligation on thefather than on the son, and whether the brother and sister should be required tomake as great a contribution as the son, but on the whole I have come to theconclusion that the proposals in the above form are right.   It will be observedthat the amount left to the wage-earner by the proposed rule -where he is an adultearning normal wages will be considerably greater than at present.  Indeed, in thisrespect it compares favourably with the practice of the great majority of Poor LawAuthorities.   Appendix V shows the practice of some of the more importantAuthorities.   It will be understood, however, that cuts cannot be avoided in these areas where the Transitional Payments practice differed widely from  the Poor Lawpractice.29.   The proposed recasting of the Earnings Rule will in effect modify the &quot;house-hold&quot; for the purposes of the Means Test.   The earnings, for instance, of a married son with dependants living with his father will not be held  to be availablefor the maintenance of his unemployed father.   In such cases the Board&apos;s officerwill make an allowance for the -personal requirements of the married  son additional to the ordinary earnings rule, and &quot;except in the case of very high earnings only such amounts will be regarded as available for the maintenance of the unemployedfather as would have been taken into account if the married son were a boarder.      I should add that in accordance with the existing practice, relatives of theapplicant by marriage will generally be treated as boarders.30.   Other Resources.      The present rules in the Regulations for the treatment of resources otherthan earnings are as follows.(a)   Capital Assets.      All capital assets belonging to the applicant and members of the samehousehold must be aggregated.   This is, however, subject to a proviso which                                      12.
differentiates between property owned by (l) the applicant, the wife, husbandfather or mother of the applicant, and (2) other members of the household,including, for example, the brother, sister, son or daughter of the applicant.These can be referred to as Classes A and B.   If the whole, or more than half,of the capital assets are owned by the persons in Class A and the total valueexceeds  300, the excess over  300 must be regarded as an available resourceand the applicant may not be held to be in need unless there are very specialcircumstances.     If, on the other hand, one-half or more of the property is owned by aperson or persons in Class B the maximum beyond which no need can be said to exist is  400.   Where the aggregated capital is below  300 or  400, as thecase may be, the income from it is assessed at the rate of Is. per week forevery complete  25 over and above the first  25.(b)  Disability Pensions, Sick Pay and Workmen&apos;s Compensation.     These forms of income receive special protection under the  Act and theRegulations and there has been no suggestion that that protection is inadequate.(c)  Miscellaneous forms of income.     In the case of resources other than those derived from earnings or from capital assets full account is taken of them when they belong to the applicant;but when they belong to a member of the household other than the applicant, theBoard&apos;s officer has discretion to decide  what is a reasonable amount to betaken as available for the maintenance of the applicant and his dependants but,as a minimum, he must allow for the personal requirements of the owner of theresources at least the amount of the scale rate of that member and his dependants and one-third of any balance remaining.   There has been littlecriticism of these rules, apart from some demand that such forms of income asArmy Reserve Pay, Service Pensions, Blind Pensions and Old Age Pensions shouldreceive absolute protection under the Regulations.     Save in the case of Service Pensions the Board&apos;s present practice,however, is more generous than that laid down in the rules.   It is substantially as follows:-
Army Reserve Pay.                                                   - -     In the ordinary case, where this amounts to  5.6s. a quarter and is paid quarterly, half is allowed for personal requirements where the recipient is the applicant or any other member of the household.   Thebalance of the payment is brought into account when it is received;  thatis to say, goes to reduce the assessment in that week and in suchsucceeding weeks as the amount may warrant.   Thus, if the Reservist is aman with a current determination of 30s. a week a new determination isgiven for one week at &quot;Nil&quot; and for the next week at 27s.   If the currentdetermination is for 10s., the new determination is &quot;Nil&quot; for three weeks and 7s. for the fourth.Old Age Pensions and Blind Pensions.     No part of these pensions is taken into account to meet the needs ofthe applicant when they belong to some other member of the household.Service Pensions.     The rule i? applied without modification.     I feel that the Board&apos;s practice with regard to the above matters is satisfactory and I do not think that it is necessary to amend theRegulations except on one point where the Board themselves propose thatthey should have discretion to allow for the personal requirements of theapplicant himself some part of the miscellaneous resources (para.(c) above)which he possesses.   To make wider alterations would provoke demands for specific provisions in the Regulations as to treatment of many other categories of miscellaneous resources.31.   Separated Dependants.     Under the Unemployment Assistance Act the Board can grant allowancesonly in respect of dependants living in the applicant&apos;s household.   Thatis to say, if the applicant has a wife from whom he is permanentlyseparated the Board cannot under the Act take into account the needs ofthe wife.   Under the Transitional Payments Scheme, however, which
reproduced the conditions of unemployment insurance, an applicant &quot;was entitled, in certain circumstances, to an increase of benefit to enable him to remit certain fixed sums to his dependants living  apart from him.One effect of the Standstill Act was to continue this title.   But withthe termination of the Standstill this statutory protection will vanish.Under the proposed liquidation procedure these allowances would becontinued,.32.   Right of Appeal.     Under the Act of 1934 an applicant for an allowance has the right toapply to the Chairman of the Appeal Tribunal for leave to appeal againstthe determination given in his case by the Board&apos;s Officer.   The Chairmancan at his discretion grant or refuse such leave.   In the &quot;Standstill&quot; Act,however, an unrestricted right of access to the Appeal Tribunal was granted in any case of appeal against a determination of the amount of any&quot;supplementary allowance&quot; under that Act.   With the termination of the standstill Act this unrestricted right of appeal will disappear and such aright could only be continued thereafter by legislation.   The Boardinform me however that they propose to suggest to Chairmen of appeal tribunals that they should take a wide view of. their power to give leave to appeal and they anticipate that the Chairmen will give effect to sucha suggestion.33.   School Meals.     Under their existing practice the Board when assessing an applicant&apos;resources take into account the value of certain school meals given by theLocal Education Authority to his children.   They ignore any meals given ona doctor&apos;s certificate that the child is suffering from a specificpathological condition and also meals consisting of milk and other specialforms of provision, such as codliver oil.   Furthermore, no account istaken of meals up to two a day for a single child in a household or onemeal each for two children.   In other cases the meals are taken intoaccount to the value of Id. per meal.   The Board now inform me that they propose  that the value of all school meals should be ignored;   it is not proposed to include in the new Regulations any specific reference to thispoint.                                 15.
to replace the present arrangements by permanent arrangements will be carriedout in full association with local opinion.   There can be no question thatthe Local Advisory Committees for -which the Act provides must be the organs ofthat opinion.   In accordance with the Act the Committees will have no morethan advisory functions and after very careful consideration I have reachedthe conclusion that they should have no executive duties.   I should add that by arrangement with me the Board deferred setting up these Committees untilour proposals with regard to their future functions had taken shape;  I havenow informed the Board that they may proceed at once to set up the Committees.36.   Liquidation.      The main classes of cases in which serious problems of liquidation will arise are   (a) single peraons living alone in areas in which Local Authorities for       transitional payments purposes, assessed such persons at more than 15s.       (usually at 17/-*, the same as the benefit rate).   (b) single persons living in households in areas in which Local Authorities,       for transitional payments purposes, assessed such persons at -more than       10s. (men)  or 9/- (women) even where the household has resources;   The       rates paid  vary according to  the  area from less than 10/*- or 9/-       up to 17/**  (men)  and 15/- (women)*   (c) cases in yfoich the Local Authorities,  in making assessments  for       transitional payments, paid less  regard  to resouroeis  than is proposed       by the Board.34.   Rural Areas.       The question of the adjustment from the ordinary scale to be made in                                                                               mthe allowances in rural areas will be specially considered by the Looal                                                                               HAdvisory Committees constituted for these areas.   Accordingly it is proposed  I                                                                               Hto insert in the Regulations a specific provision requiring the question of                                                                               1the adjustment of allowances to the economy in rural areas to be referred for  Iadvice to those Committees.                                                    I                                                                               1                                                                               I35.   Local Advisory Committees.                                                                               p      The Board are required by Section 35 of the Act of 1934 to set upLocal Advisory Committees and our election pledge was to the effeot that action!
37,   It will be necessary to terminate the Standstill by bringing theTemporary Provisions Act 1935 to an end by Order, as provided in that  Act, andat the same time to give effect to the new regulations.   In every area thenew regulations will involve some increases and some reductions as compared withthe present Standstill rates.   Over a large part of the country they will entail relatively few reductions in the amount of existing allowances  and insome areas there will be increased allowances to a substantial extent;  forinstance, in London, Birmingham, Newcastle, Lancashire County, Edinburgh, thereshould be no very serious problem of liquidation.   In certain other areas thenecessary cuts will be numerous and - principally in resources cases - relativelyheavy;  such areas include South Wales, Hull, Barnsley and Barrow.   In these latter areas, the problem of the transition from the level of payments secured by the Temporary Provisions Act (&quot;the Standstill&quot;) to the level contained inthe new Regulations is one of the most difficult we shall have to face, and wemust anticipate violent opposition.   In agreement with the Board, I rule outthe possibility of applying the new level to all cases as from the date on whichthe &quot;Standstill&quot; Act disappears, with only such delay as is entailed by themachinery for re-assessing the claims.   Such a plan would be plainly contraryto our election Manifesto.   The intention is that the new and improved regula-tions shall become generally operative, and this policy will be made clear onbehalf of the Government.   But this must be coupled with some process ofgradual modification from the level of assessment under the Standstill to thatcontained in the new Regulations.38.   A point on which I have had considerable discussion with the Board is whether this principle of gradual reduction should apply not only to cases -whichare already in receipt of assistance when the nev; regulations come into operation,but also to new cases coming on afterwards.   Such new cases may be those ofpersons who had recently been in receipt of assistance but had been offassistance for a short period on account of work or otherwise.   For the mostpart, however, they will consist of persons who have just exhausted their benefitafter being unemployed for six months or more.39.   The Board take the view that cases coming to the Board after the Regulationscome into effect (including those coming on to assistance after exhaustion ofbenefit) should receive the allowances contemplated by the Regulations, includingof course any increases above the figures in the Scale which were called for by                                         17.
the circumstances of the case, and that they should gradually, and with the help of the Advisory Committees, bring existing allowances which are inexcess of what would be properly payable under the Regulations, into conformity with the Regulations.   This method, they feel, would establish the authority of the Regulations, would give them the widest powers in dealingwith existing Standstill allowances, and would be intelligible to theAdvisory Committees.40.   This procedure would, however, mean that during the liquidation periodpersons in the same area and in like circumstances would be treateddifferently according to whether they are &quot;new&quot; or &quot;old&quot; cases.   I do notthink we could defend this in Parliament.   Moreover, we might be chargedwith a breach of an Election pledge if we did not use the gradual method forall cases.   Until the old cases of the same type had been liquidated - a process which would take longer or shorter according to the area - new and oldcases would be receiving different amounts..   In some cases the differencewould be small and in others it would be considerable.41.   In my view it is essential to adopt the principle that in any particular area all cases which reveal similar circumstances shall be treatedsubstantially alike during the liquidation period.42.   This principle is subject to one obvious exception.   I do not think it need or should apply to cases of grossly excessive allowances.   Broadly suchcases should be regarded as those where the resources which are to be takeninto account under the new Regulations, together with the amount of the allowance made hitherto, exceed the needs calculated under the new Regulations,including any needs arising from sickness or other special circumstances,  bymore than 10s.   In some areas there are a number of these, and it may take alittle time before they are brought down to a reasonable figure.   We shouldnot create new cases of grossly excessive allowances while this process is continuing.   Thus, no new case will receive an allowance exceeding by morethan 10s. the allovrance properly payable under the Regulations, even, if, inthat area, some old cases are being temporarily continued at a figure in excessof that amount.   This exception would not appear in the Regulations, but instating the general principles to Parliament, it would be necessary to make itclear that this was the intention.                                        18.
 43.   The Board have emphasised to me that if new cases are dealt with    q. \j otherwise than on the basis of the Regulations they would have much greater difficulty  in establishing the authority of the Regulations, especially in their relation to the Advisory Committees.   If, however, we conclude that the principle I have indicated is necessary, the Board regard it as essential that  their  position should be protected by specifying in the Regulations a time  limit  of 12 months  for the liquidation period.   Although I recognise the difficulties to -which such a time limit may give rise, I agree that in the circumstances a time limit in the Regulations is necessary, and I have agreed with the Board that the time limit should be 12 months from the date at which the new Regulations begin to operate.   It will, of course, be important that in carrying out the liquidation, the arrangements should be such  that the simultaneous making of a large number of cuts in any one area should be avoided as far as possible and also that, if possible, all the cuts  that need to be made in order that the Regulations may be regarded as in operation generally throughout the Country in accordance with our policy should have been made before the end of the liquidation period.   The Board see no reason to anticipate that they will be faced with a large number of reductions  that have automatically to be made at a single date on the expiry of the time limit. 44.   To give effect to  these views the Regulations would include a clause giving the  Board, for a  period of 12 months from the date at which the Regulations come into effect, power to pay more than would normally be payable under the Regulations in cases which would have received more if the standstill  Act had been  continued.   The Regulation would not make any distinction in terms between cases with Standstill allowances at the time theRegulations come into effect and cases which come on to the Board within the12 months.45.   The Board are in agreement with me that as soon as the Regulations aremade  they will seek the  advice of the Committees as to the method ofbeginning to deal promptly with cases where the Standstill allowances aregrossly excessive.    It  is the intention to begin the reduction of the allowances  in such cases as soon as convenient after the Regulations oomeinto force.
46.   In addition the Board mould begin to deal,  in association with  the   - -Committees, with the cases of single men without  dependants.    As regardssingle men living in lodgings, the Board do not propose, in the initialmonths, to effect a general reduction from 17s. to 15s,  in the case of menover 45 years of age.   For single men under 25 years, the Board propose that,after consultation with the Advisory Committee, the process of reduction shallbegin, due regard being had to the numbers affected in any particular area,at the beginning of the transitional period, and shall result in the  applica-tion of the 15s. rate, by either one or more stages, after obtaining  theadvice of the appropriate Advisory Committee.47.   Similarly, in the case of single men living at home, the Board  proposethat in respect of the younger men the process of bringing Standstill allowances to the figure of the Regulations or some near figure shall, after consultationwith the Advisory Committees, begin at the beginning of the transitional period,and proceed by such stages as may be thought right after obtaining the advice of the appropriate Committee.48.   The date proposed for the coming into operation of the new Regulationsis 1st October next.   This may seem a long delay and will involve launchingthe new arrangements at the beginning of winter,  but I am afraid it is inevitable.   The regulations cannot very well be approved by Parliament untilwell on in June.   When the regulations are approved, a difficult and importanttask will lie before the Board and the local Committees.   The Board  mustprepare memoranda and instructions for their officers which cannot be drafted in advance of Ministerial declarations.  These memoranda and instructions  mustbe properly assimilated by the Board1s officers for presentation to the LocalCommittees, and the Local Committees must be given adequate opportunity tobecome acquainted not only with the regulations but with the facts and thecircumstances of their areas.   The Regulations will not be complete  until theCommittees have made their recommendations as to  the treatment of rent, andnot until these recommendations have been finally considered and acted upon bythe Board can the Committees form any sort of judgment as to how the  regulations will work in their areas.   It is obviously essential for their considerationof the method and rate of liquidation that each Committee should know, by reference to the way in which the new regulations will work, what is  the extent and nature of the problem of liquidation in their area.    With the holiday                                     20
 month of August intervening - in the case of Scotland,  July is the month of holiday - there is no chance of these matters &quot;being completed in time to enable operations to be begun whilst Parliament is sitting;  there are obviously objections to any substantial beginning being made whilst Parliament is not sitting.   Furthermore, any attempt to rush the  Committees might foster a belief that they are being denied time for their work.   In these circumstances the 1st October seems the earliest date that can be reasonably fixed. 49.  Thus the process of liquidation would extend over  a period of 12 months, beginning the 1st October, 1936, and this period will be specified in the Regulations as the period during which the Board will have power to make assessments in excess of those normally.due under the Regulations.   Under the Regulation conferring this power on the Board it will be made clear that the advice of the Advisory Committees will be obtained as to the manner in which, within tho 12 months&apos;  limit, allowances in excess of those normally due under the Regulations shall be progressively brought into conformity with the Regulations in each area.    If,  in any area,  a Committee declines to give such advice,  or gives advice that will not effectively produce the iesu.lt contemplated by the Regulations,  the Board Will themselves determine the method and rate of assimilation in that  area.    The  Board may  desire from time to time to  consult me about thoir action  in any such  area,  but  the responsibility will rest with the Board. 50.  Subject  to those  considerations,  in  all  cases  whore reductions  to  tho proper Regulation allowances  arc  due,  the Board propose  that  such reductions, for each class  of case,  shall  take  effect by  such  stages  and  at such intervals as  the appropriate  Advisory Committee may recommend,  duo  regard being had  to  -     (a)  tho  numbers affected  in  any area, and     (b)  the  need to roach the allowance position under  the Regulations         within  the 12 months. 51.  The relevant Regulation will make it clear that an  applicant whose allowance is  to be reduced from tho Standstill allowance as a consequence of the introduction  of tho now Regulations can appeal to tho Appeal Tribunal.   In order to give him an opportunity of making his appeal if  he wishes, tho operation of the reduction will bo post-dated by tho necessary interval of two weeks. 52.  The Board have informed me that if for political reasons the CabinetCommittee decide that the policy which I recommend as regards treatment of now
                                                                    tj Cj cases  should, be  adopted,  and the other proposals  in  this memorandum are approved in the  form agreed with me,  they will  submit  draft Regulations in accordance therewith and  adopt  in  their  aoirdnistration the principles  which I  have described..    As I  have stated, I  feel no doubt  on this  subject;  in my opinion it  is essential on all  grounds to adopt the policy  I have indicated. 53*    Cost of  Proposals.       The Board  point out the difficulty of framing  an estimate of cost in advance of actual  experience of the revised Regulations and in particular without a knowledge  of the advice  likely to be  given by Advisory Committees with regard to the working the  new rent  rule and  otherwise.    Upon the information at their disposal and  making what they regard as reasonable assumptions as to  the advice which will  be given  by  the Advisory Committees, the Board estimate that if the  Regulations were brought into full  operation at  once the increased allowances under the Regulations as compared with allowances under the present Standstill  arrangements would amount  to between  2-g- millions and  3  millions per annum which would be  set off  by a roughly similar sum in respect of decreased allowances.   The  cost of  the  new Regulations would  thus be approximately  the same  as  that which is  being incurred at the  present time under the existing arrangements,  i.e*  AO% millions  per  annum for 665,000 weekly payments  which is equivalent to about   44- millions per annum for 725,000 weekly payments (see  footnote on page 2).     The  Board further estimate that the additional cost of liquidating the  standstill  gradually  over a period of  a year in accordance with the  principle set out  in paragraphs 41 and 42 would be very approximately  2 millions.   Wo  account has been taken in the above  estimates of the effect of the  introduction of the  Second Appointed Day. Second  Appointed Day. 54.   As  stated  in paragraph 4, the Act  setting up the Standstill arrangementspostponed the Second Appointed Day.   It is important that when we publish the draft  of the new Regulations we should be able to announce the date nowproposed  for the Second Appointed Day.   After consultation with the Boardand the Chancellor, I propose that it should be 1st April,  1937,  which is  thedate when the revised block grants to Looal Authorities will  come  intooperation.                                    22.
