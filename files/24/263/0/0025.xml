Copy No.1245-B.(Also Paper No. COS. 494.)COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.DEFENCE  PROBLEMS  OF  HOLLAND AND  THE  NETHERLANDS                            EAST INDIES.              Report by  the  Chiefs  of  Staff  Sub-Committee.    AT our 180th Meeting held  on the 6th July, we had under considerationcertain defence problems  affecting  Holland and the  Netherlands East Indieswhich had been raised by  the Foreign Office and referred to us by the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence (Enclosure).    2.   The questions upon which we are  asked to  advise the  Committee ofImperial Defence are as follows :     (a) Is Japanese aggression  in the Dutch East Indies resulting in all or part          of these territories falling in the hands of the Japanese strategically          of vital concern to the British Empire ?    (b) If the answer to (a) above is that the prevention of such aggression is of          such importance that  it would justify the resort to war by Great          Britain, what action could we in actual fact take to  assist the Dutch          with reasonable prospect of success, bearing in mind  other possible          commitments ?    (c) Can any informal advice be given as  to the best policy for the Dutch          Government  to  follow  in  reinforcing  their  armaments   in  the          Netherlands East Indies and in the  Netherlands itself ?    3.   As regards (a) above,  we are of the opinion that the  integrity of theDutch East Indies is vital to our security in the Far East, and the occupation ofthe Dutch Islands near Singapore by a hostile Power would be a most seriousevent.    4.   We do not, however, recommend that a guarantee of military supportunder all circumstances should  be offered to the Dutch.  Even if we intended tocome to their assistance under all circumstances, it would be inadvisable to commit ourselves openly to this policy, which would no doubt cause the  Dutch to rely on us and  take little or no action  to improve their defences.  Moreover, withour present standard  of naval  strength, a one-Power standard, we are  not in aposition  to undertake any additional commitment, though if a new standard ofnaval strength were to be adopted,  we  should, of course,  be in a better positionto defend our  Far Eastern commitments if they are attacked at a time when weare engaged in Europe.  The time has not yet come, however, for us to engage inany fresh undertakings in the form of a pledge of assistance to the netherlands east Indies.[13489]
    5.  We suggest that our  declared policy should at present be limited to astatement that the  preservation of the status quo in the Pacific,  including the integrity of the Dutch East Indies, is a major  British interest.   This should encourage the Dutch to take steps for  their own defence,  provided it is notaccompanied by any form of guarantee.    6.  The Dutch should  be  encouraged to  do all that they can,  both at Homeand abroad, to improve their defences, and we have instructed the Joint PlanningSub-Committee to  work out  detailed  suggestions  in accordance  with para-graph 2 (c), which might be put to the Dutch, and the same Sub-Committee will consider  proposals for action  in the event of war in the Far East as suggestedin paragraph 2 (&amp;).  In the  first place, however, we ask the Committee of ImperialDefence to endorse  the following conclusions  as the basis of the policy which wethink should be adopted and on which other  matters hinge :                 ,    (a) The integrity of the Dutch East Indies  is of  vital concern to us and a           statement should be made that the preservation of the status quo in           the Pacific,  including the integrity of the Dutch East Indies,  is a           major British interest.    (6) No guarantee of active support in the Far East should, however, be given           to the Netherlands Government.   Apart from our  inability definitely           to  undertake any  new  commitments  with  the  existing standard of           naval  strength,  such  a  guarantee  would no doubt cause the Dutch to           take little or no action to improve their own position in the Far East.    (c)  The integrity of Holland,  as of  Belgium, is of vital concern to Great           Britain.                                     (Signed)      ERNLE CHATFIELD.                                                  E. L. ELLINGTON.                                                  C. J. DEVERELL.    2 Whitehall  Gardens,  S. W. 1,            July 8,  1936.                                ENCLOSURE.Memorandum  on certain aspects of the Defence of the Netherlands and  of the                          Netherlands East Indies.    EARLY in April Dr. Colijn, the Netherlands Prime Minister,  during an interview with the Military Attache at The Hague, expressed anxiety about thedefence of the Netherlands East Indies,  He expressed the view that the proposeddefence measures were of as great an interest to England as to Holland, and indicated that it would  be helpful  if he  could discuss the matter unofficiallywith some of his English friends,  tie said that since it was beyond the financialpower of the Netherlands to provide complete defence for the Netherlands east indies, i.e.,  cruisers, submarines and aircraft, it seemed to him desirable to try to adopt that form of defence which would be the most appropriate from theBritish point of view.    Dr. Colijn later had an interview with the Air Attache at The Hague, whenhe again raised this question.   He at  the same time discussed  the  defence of holland itself and gave the Air Attache the impression that he  would welcome an assurance from Great  Britain that his  defence plans are in accordance withour views. He said that he did not foresee Holland engaged in any way in which great Britain was not equally committed, and that  although any formal conversa-tions were impossible, a certain liaison in peace would be of mutual benefit.    As a result of these conversations, the question arose whether Dr.  Colijnshould be encouraged informally to discuss the defence problems of Holland andthe Netherlands East Indies during one of his periodical visits to England.  Itwas subsequently agreed between the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretaryof State for War, the Secretary of State for Air, and the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, that before any decision was taken on this point, the  Committee
Foreign Office, June 26, 1936.of Imperial Defence should examine the matter, having before them the advice of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on the military implications of the problem.    Before  informal  discussions  with  the Dutch  Prime  Minister  can  beauthorised it is necessary to be  clear as to the policy  of His  Majesty&apos;s  Govern-ment in the event of Japanese aggression against the  Dutch in the netherlands east Indies.  It appears necessary, therefore, to consider not only the suggestionput forward by Dr. Colijn,  but also the wider implications of policy which thatsuggestion raises.  The points to be dealt with are therefore as follows :     1.   Can any informal advice be given as  to the  best policy  for the dutch government to follow  in reinforcing their armaments in  the Netherlands east indies and in the Netherlands itself \    2. (a)  Is  Japanese aggression in the Dutch East Indies resulting in all or part of those territories falling into the hands  of the Japanese strategically of vital concern to the British  Empire %    (b) If the  answer  to (a) is that the prevention of  such aggression is of such importance that it would justify the resort to war by Great Britain, what action could we  in actual fact take to assist the Dutch with reasonable prospect ofsuccess, bearing in mind other possible commitments %    If it is  possible as a result  of examination of  question (1) to make  any recommendations, it  is desirable that they should be communicated informally to dr. Colijn at the earliest possible date.    The possibility  of giving any informal advice on these questions should therefore be considered as a matter of urgency.   It  would, however, be essentialthat nothing should be done which would in any  way commit  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, even by implication, to the  adoption of  any  responsibility for thedefence of the Netherlands East Indies (or of the Netherlands itself).
Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   July 1936.SECRET.                                                        Copy No.  41COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.Extract from the DRAFT Minutes of the 280th Meeting, held on July 10, 1936.

Paper No. 1245-B.)      Previous reference : OLD. Minutes of the 275th Meeting, Minute 6.     THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a report by the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee regarding certain aspects of the defence problems of the Nether-lands East Indies (C.I.D. Paper No. 1245-B).     SIR ERNLE CHATFIELD, introducing the Report, said that the question had  arisen from a request by Dr.  Colijn, the  Dutch Prime  Minister, for a discussion  regarding the defence problems  of  the Netherlands East Indies,regarding which he had expressed anxiety.     At  the request of the Foreign Office, the Chiefs of Staff had been  asked togive  their views upon the following questions :          First, whether  Japanese aggression in the Dutch East Indies resulting     in all or part of these territories falling into the hands of  the Japanese, is&apos;     strategically of vital concern to the British Empire; secondly, assuming that     the prevention of such aggression  is of importance to the  British Empire,     what action could we take to assist  the Dutch, bearing in mind other possible     commitments;  and, thirdly, what  advice should be tendered to the Dutch     Government as to the best means of  reinforcing  their armaments in  the     Netherlands East Indies and in the  Netherlands itself.     In paragraph  6 of their report, the Chiefs of Staff had stated that, in their view, the integrity of the  Dutch East Indies is of vital concern to us, and they recommended that a statement should be made that the preservation of the status quo  in the Pacific,  including the integrity of the Dutch East Indies, is a majorBritish  interest.   There was no suggestion, however,  that we should  give  theDutch an  undertaking of active support under all. the circumstances, in view ofour other commitments.     The most suitable  measures  which the Dutch Government could take  to-improve their defences and the  action which we could take to assist  them in  the!event of hostilities,  having regard to our other commitments, had been  referredto the Joint Planning Sub-Committee.     SIR ROBERT VANSITTART said  that,  while  the  Foreign  Office  fully recognised the importance of the Dutch East Indies,  it was open  to  questionwhether a public declaration on the lines of that proposed by the Chiefs of Staffmight not be taken by the Dutch Government as a direct offer of assistance, andso induce them to slacken off in their own defence preparations.     LORD SWINTON noted  that the Chiefs of Staff  Report had expresslystated the undesirability of giving the  Dutch the impression that they need do nothing  to improve their defences.     [13508-4]
     SIR ERNLE  CHATEIELD suggested that Dr. Colijn should be informed that the security of the Dutch East Indies is of great interest to us, and that his Government should be encouraged to do all they could to improve the defences. A declaration regarding the status quo would, he suggested, be used as a deterrent to the Japanese and thereby afford the Dutch additional security.     LORD ZETLAND said that this was a question of great  importance to the  Government of India, who were examining the defence position of India and Burma vis-a-vis Japan, particularly in the area of the Bay of Bengal.     SIR THOMAS INSKIP thought that a declaration of the nature proposed would run dangerously close to a guarantee, which was out of the  question.     SIR SAMUEL HOARE raised the  question  in view of the trend of the discussion as to how far we should go in any conversations which  might take place with the Dutch Prime Minister.     SIR ROBERT VANSITTART suggested that the first step should be to encourage the Dutch  to  increase their defences, regarding which  he understood the Joint Planning Sub-Committee were now working out the details.   If pressed by Dr. Colijn for an expression of our views regarding the strategic  importance of the Dutch East Indies to the British Empire, he suggested that  it could  be said privately that we  were deeply interested in  the  question.   But he was opposed  to any public or official declaration in  the matter.     MR. CHAMBERLAIN  said that having regard to  the views of the Chiefs of Staff  regarding the  importance of the Dutch East Indies to  us,  we should encourage the Dutch to do all they can, in collaboration with us,  to improve their defences. We should, he  suggested, if necessary  inform Dr.  Colijn that we consider  the integrity of the Dutch East  Indies a  major British interest, but give them no guarantee  of  support.  While agreeing that the  integrity of the Islands is a  major interest, it was not our only interest, and we should not in any way commit ourselves to a guarantee of assistance.     SIR THOMAS INSKIP said that it was important that whatever was said to Dr. Colijn gave him no guarantee of our  support, and at the same time did not discourage him to improve the Dutch defences.     SIR ERNLE CHATFIELD  said that if  in fact we were able  to  provide Naval support in the  event of the  Dutch East Indies being attacked by the Japanese, he  thought a  suitable recommendation  would be  that  the  Dutch Government should  increase their submarine and air forces in Borneo.   If, on the other hand,  we could not support the  Dutch,  then our  advice might be of a different  nature.    Sir Ernie Chatfieid drew attention to the serious  situation which would arise if the Japanese establish themselves in Borneo.  There was,  he said, a  strongparty in Japan whose expansionist aims to  the southward are well known.    In reply to a question by Mr. Chamberlain, Sir Ernie Chatfieid said thatthere was very little that the Dutch could do which would prevent the capture of the Dutch East Indies if we did  not come to their assistance.    SIR THOMAS INSKIP, referring to  paragraph 6 (c) of the Chiefs of staff report regarding the vital concern  to Great Britain of the integrity of Holland,said  that this question was bound  up with the  major problem of the  defence ofthe Low Countries, which had been the subject of a previous report  by the Chiefsof Staff.   He did  not think  the  Committee were called upon, in the presentconnection, to endorse the Chiefs of Staff view.                               CONCLUSION.    THE  COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL  DEFENCE agreed     (a) That the Dutch should be encouraged to do all they can both in the Dutch          East Indies and in the  Netherlands  to improve their  defences;     (&amp;) That the integrity of the Dutch East Indies was a major  British interest,          but in existing conditions it was inadvisable to announce this;
