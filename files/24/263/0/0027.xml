C.P.197(36)COPY NO0ABX1OT .Final Report of Sir Arthur Rose as Commissioner for        the Special Areas in Sootland..         :.Bl..Oj^U-riUh BY THE SjSCRBTARY. OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND.     I circulate herewith, for the information of my  colleagues,proof copies of the Final Report of Sir Arthur Rose who has been compelled, on health grounds, to resign his appointment asCommissioner for the Special Areas in Sootland.     A summary is attached of the Report and of the commentsand recommendations which it contain a.   The examination ofthese, some of which raise questions of general policy, is&quot;being undertaken, but no immediate action on them is contemplated.     I propose that the Report should be published shortly beforethe House adjourns at the end of the present month.(Id.)    G.P.C.16th July,  1936.
                   SUMMARY OP THE REPORT.          The Final Report, which was signed on the 12th-of June,,-1936 ,  follows two Sixi-iionthly Reports covering the period fromDeoember, 1934, to  December, 1936, which.record progress on theschemes adopted by tha Commissioner in pursuance of his powers under  the Special Areas (Development and Improvement) Aot , 1934.          In the Final Report, Sir Arthur Rose, in addition tebringing the record of work up to the date of his resignation,records a number of conclusions based Upon his experiencePowers of thou Cjmmlssji oner f-          Sir Arthur Rose18 first comments deal with thelimitation of his powers ,  and he points out that , while he hasappreciated the fact that  his work was intended to be largelyexperimental and in the nature of practical research, some difficulties have been encountered owing to uncertainty as tothe plan of the Commissioner in the general scheme of public administration.          The conclusion is &quot;that the value of the Special Areasscheme would be enhanced if the appointment was more clearly and generally conceived chiefly as that of an explorer andexperimenter , prooeeding by trial and error to discover theeffect of selected schemes upon the various problems involvedin industrial depression.     If this  was generally understood,the scale of the operations would then be of less moment than their variety and character , and the wider questions of public policy would not normally arise until the results of the experiments were available for examination.&quot;                              - 1 -
Financial Cormnitmepts.     The Report provides the following information about the commitments of the Special Aroas Fund in respect of the scottish special Areas at the 16th of hay, 1936. -            Industrial Development             89*315            Public Works, All Classes       1,073,074            Land Development                  15 6,980            Social Service                    145,420            hiscellaneous                          10                         Total              1.434.799The total expenditure from all sources in respect of the aboveschemes is estimated at  2,787,931.General Comments and Recommendations     Sir Arthur Rose then makes comments on the various types of scheme he has initiated or  assisted,  and submitscertain general vre-commendations under appropriate headingsas follows:(a) Problems of Industrial Labour     Recommendsthe examination and analysis of the surplusof mine-worker and shipbuilding labour in more detail than has hitherto been attempted.,  in an endeavour &quot;to get a measureof what still further remains to be  done in finding occupation,economic or otherwise;   secondly,  to ascertain what is thefuture potential supply of effective workers in the West ofScotland.&quot;(b)  The Unemployment Problem     Confirms -     (i) The good and widespread effect produced by the greater      activity in shipbuilding on the Clyde,  and. x&apos;3fers to the                                               direction/
     direction of Government orders to the Clyde,  recommended     during the Investigation in 1934.  (Can?. 472-8-)-;     (ii) The improvement in the fhard core1 position;   and     (iii) The value of the Training and Reconditioning^Centres     of the luinistry of Labour. (c) Sewage and Water Schemes     After referring to the assistance given to selected sewageand water schemes in the Special Area.s,  Sir Arthur Rose recommends&quot;that the Government should consider whether some   ft^e assistance could be offered to local authorities in comparable circumstancesfor the provision of modern sewage disposal and water facilities,the latter probably on a regional basis, to be administered bythe appropriate Government Department on lines similar to the grants for housing^ etc&apos;1  A further recommendation is &quot;that such a grant as Buggested above should also be utilised  for thecleansing of rivers running through densely populated industrial areas of Scotland.&quot;(d) Amenity Schemes     Comments are made on the practical difficulty of effectinga wholesale clearance of derelict buildings, waste bings and otherunsightly features of the landscape in industrial  districts, and reference is made to the uselessness of any scheme undertaken without powers to deal with current spoliation.   It is statedthat consultations as to the practicability of dealing with wastebings on an experimental basis are still going on.(e) Land Development s     After referring to the work done in collaboration withthe Department of Agriculture for Scotland and other bodies in themore orthod.ox types of land schemes, such as allotments,  plots and small-holdings, Sir Authur Rose draws special attention to thepossibilities of lagge-scale reclamation of waste  land,  and also                                             intensive/                          -  3  -
 intensive farming developments, and commends his particular experiments &quot;to the attention of tho Government in the. hope that, if these prove successful, plans relating to Scotland as a whole may &quot;be formulated.&quot;  ^e alBO suggests, with a view to the development of land schemes more directly as a means to the solution of the industrial unemployment problem, &quot;that the Government should examine closely the scope of existing legislation and the financial provision necessary; in certain cases, to continue, in a more general way, the financial assistance, by way of loan and otherwise,  offer^&amp;j from the Special Areas lund.&quot; (f) Social,Welfare     Draws particular attention to the  apparent need for a new outlook in Scotland on social welfare schemes,  and suggests &quot;that this question is not inevitably connected with the unemployment problem^&quot;   Sir Arthur Rose points out that, while he has been assisted by many admirable voluntary organisations,  these do not appear to be organised with the necessary voluntary financial backing,  or in such a way as to avoid the dangers of competition and overlapping.    He suggests &quot;that possibly through a federation of all organisations under a Scottish Council of Social Service,  closely associated with the National Council,  much more could be done in obtaining financial and personal support from the community than is possible at present.&quot;   He also mentions one or two smaller problems  of social service,  including that of premises  in the case of youth organisations who cannot  justify such provision for their sole occupation.    Sir Arthur Rose suggests that itmight be possible to achieve a common standard in club premises of this kindj  and states that proposals are still under  examination.

 (g) Corients favourably on the scheme of physical training Classes for unemployed men and women in theScottish Special Areas;  one of the first schemes to be initiated by Sir Arthur Hose as Commissioner. (h)  General     Draws attention to the difficulties of erectingadministrative machinery,  and to the responsibilities  placed upon it, and suggests that such matters will  requireparticular attention if the special developments to deal withthe problem of industrial depression are continued.

Final  Report  by Sir H.  Arthur  Rose, Baronet,as Commissioner for the Special Areas  in Scotland  To THE  RIGHT HONOURABLE SIR  GODFREY P. COLLINS,                       C.M.G., M.P.,                Secretary of State for ScotlandSir,                    I.-INTRODUCTION  1. It is a matter of very sincere regret to me that I have foundmyself unable to complete the term of office as Commissioner of theSpecial Areas in Scotland to which you appointed me in December,1934, but, as you are aware, my resignation is  due to the moststringent medical orders.  I think it is only right to record that onagreeing, unwillingly, to undertake the duties, I advised you that I did so contrary to medical advice and that  I then expressed considerabledoubts about my ability to &quot; stay the course.&quot;  I thank you for the generous terms in which you have acceptedmy resignation.  Although it is only a few  months since I presented my second sixmonths report, it is possible  that it might be useful to you and to mysuccessor in office if I now submitted a final report more or less onthe lines such a report would have followed had I been able to com-plete the term of office originally contemplated and embodying suchconclusions as  I  have been able to arrive at as the result of theexperience gained during my preliminary investigation in 1934, andsubsequently, as Commissioner under the Special Areas (development and Improvement) Act, 1934.The appointment  of Commissioners under the Special Areas Act, 1934  2. The above mentioned  Act was presumably the result of thereports of the four Investigators  appointed to enquire into the situa-tion existing in certain parts of the country following the long periodof depression which had  been  experienced and in my case I  wasspecially directed to regard as my field of investigation the industrial area in the West of Scotland.  In framing my report as Investigator, I found it difficult to isolateany specific area in the West of Scotland as calling for treatmentmore urgently than any other ;  in fact I came to the conclusion ata very early stage that Glasgow and the adjacent industrial districts&quot;f Lanarkshire, Dumbartonshire, and Renfrewshire  constituted asingle  community, in that economic  changes  affecting  any partreacted for good or ill on the area as a whole.
  In determining the limitations of the Areas to be dealt with undetthe Act, however, it  was obvious that  for experimental purposesthese would have to be confined within reasonable bounds, hence the somewhat artificial nature of the &quot; Special Areas &quot; as finally laiddown in the First Schedule of the Act.         II.-THE POWERS OF THE COMMISSIONER  3. I have emphasised in  previous Reports the fact that I have regarded my work as in large measure experimental and in the natureof research into practicable ways and  means  of bringing about igreater measure of industrial prosperity and social welfare.  It maybe useful if I endeavour to form some general conclusion, based uponmy personal experience, about the practical value of this emergencymethod, and to make some  comments on my administration of theAct in direct association with the permanent Departments of Stateand under a  measure of general control by a Minister responsible to Parliament.  In  my previous Reports  I have  refrained fromexpressing any general conclusion, but I now feel that it is incumbentupon me to refer briefly to some of the  difficulties which have been encountered.  If it should be possible to discover the origin of these difficulties and  find a way round them, it may be that the SpecialAreas scheme would function more speedily and more  effectively.  4. In the more experimental types of scheme, the limitation of mypower within an arbitrarily defined area has occasioned no difficulty,but, in the case of many public works, social service, and land develop-ment schemes which I have launched principally in order to determineby positive results whether a wider application would be justified,they  have appeared to many  authorities,&apos;  organisations,  and in-dividuals  as  schemes   adopted  for general  application at  once,Hence, the promotion or assistance of a  scheme in one case has been followed  by numerous claims for similar help.  Where the  circum-stances have been equally worthy of consideration, such  claimshave been difficult to resist, in so far as the confines of the SpedalAreas permit.   This  departure from what I might call the principalconception of my office, which  it is  sometimes extremely  difficultto avoid  when  one  is  faced by an  insistent  demand to produceresults, has undoubtedly led to a good deal of misunderstanding and difficulty.  I have, therefore, been obliged to set very high standards and somewhat unusual conditions, useful for experimental purposes,in undertaking  expenditure from the  Special Areas  Fund, in an endeavour to  avoid anomalies  and to  achieve my main  purpose,Further, in order to obviate any suggestion of inequality of treatment,I have also been obliged to  exercise the most careful discrimination in selecting schemes for action,  as it will be obvious that, if I had offered help in any wholesale manner to authorities and organisationssimply because they happened  to be within the Special Areas, as
[hough I was purely a relief organisation, it would have created ananomalous position  when the  Act specifically  prevented  similarconsideration of many other well-founded schemes from other partsof the country.   The nature  of  the numerous  applications forassistance and of the proposals which I have received from all partsof Scotland provides ample evidence of widespread misunderstanding of the functions of my office.  Necessarily, the common failure toapprehend  the  defined Special Areas as experimental areas, ratherthan specially scheduled depressed areas, has occasioned a good dealof unproductive effort and I think it is at least one factor which mayhave affected the freedom, speed and scale of my operations.  In myopinion, it is of the utmost importance that the nature of the Com-missioner&apos;s task should be fully understood  if  difficulties  arisingout of the territorial restriction of his powers are to be avoided. 5.  Furthermore, the Act provides that a considerable measure ofcontrol and influence shall  be exercised over my work by variouspermanent  Departments. To judge by the discussions in Parliament, it would appear tohave been  the  intention  to  confer upon the  Commissioners  very exceptional powers to enable them to carry out their functions withunusual  speed  and unhampered by many of  the limitations andrestrictions imposed by normal considerations of public policy uponthe  permanent  Departments.   The machinery of ordinary public.administration,  however,  is  so  comprehensive that  I frequentlyfound, in putting forward proposals&apos; for general  approval,  that important questions of public policy, within the province of numerousDepartments, were involved,  and that these  questions had  to  beconsidered before consent could be granted to my operations.  even when due allowance is made for the desire of these Departments to be helpful, such prior examination inevitably caused delays on occasion,which are irksome to anyone faced with a demand to &quot; try out &quot; andto produce  results in a limited period of time.  I have appreciated the need  for some action  on their  part in so far as my proposals were not  wholly experimental, realising that,  unlike  myself,  theyhad  no freedom under the Act to set  aside  their normal policyconsiderations in  passing  comments upon them.  In  the  circum-stances, the matter for surprise  is possibly the fact that so muchhas been achieved in so short a time.  I do not think, however, it willbe regarded as an unfriendly criticism if I express the view  that, in considering my initial proposals, they have tended on occasions,like so many others, to lose sight of the exploratory features of mywork, and perhaps with some justification to harbour the fear that,in promoting a particular experiment, I was initiating a new policy or a  change of policy before its full implications and results could before seen.  I should emphasise that I was specifically enjoined not tok deterred from  any reasonable experiment,  merely because  of afence of failure or because it represented a deviation from existing policy.
  My conclusion is that the value of the Special Areas scheme wouldbe  enhanced if the appointment was  more clearly and generallyconceived, chiefly as that of an explorer and experimenter, proceeding by trial and error to discover the effect of selected schemes upon thevarious problems  involved in industrial depression.   If this was generally  understood, the scale of the operations would then be of less moment than their variety and character, and the wider questionsof public  policy would not normally arise  until the results of the experiments  were  available for examination.   To this extent, theoffice would bear a relationship towards the Governmental machineof the country  similar to that of the research laboratory to industryand proposals  for  practical experiments could possibly be receivedby  the Commissioner from the Departments themselves  as well asirom other sources.  I  have already attempted to  apply this con--ception of my office, but, if this is to be maintained, it would, in myopinion, require to be more clearly established as free, not only fromnormal administrative restrictions, but also from the public anticipa-tion of immediate  and complete solutions in which the experimentalside of the work has tended to lose its  true  significance.  I  thinkin so far as my comments may be said to  be critical, they result in avery large measure from the persistent and widespread uncertainty as to the place  of the office of Commissioner in the general scheme ofpublic administration.  III.-GENERAL STATEMENT  REGARDING  FINANCIAL                        COMMITMENTS  6. In my two earlier reports details have been given  of various schemes which have  been approved and are  proceeding.  I  thinkat this stage all I need do is to bring up to the  end of April the totalof the actual commitments entered into and this will be found inAppendix A.   The only three items of a novel nature are the re-conditioning of the Harbour of Dumbarton and the provision of a hospital for Greenock and one for Lanarkshire including the Burghs,Sewage schemes have only been slightly increased but it is intresting to record  that when those already under construction in Lanarkshireare completed, practically no untreated sewage will enter the ClydeEast of Glasgow.  7. It has been my practice to examine each proposal in some detail and to complete the frequentfy protracted consultations with thevarious Departments and other parties likely to be interested beforeengaging myself to any assistance from the Special Areas Fund. hence the  Commitments which now reach a total of   1,434,799, generallyspeaking, relate to schemes which are actually in hand and in respectof which  actual expenditure will be involved during this and subse-quent financial years.  Each offer of grant has  been contingent uponthe acceptance by the particular authority or organisation of detailedconditions to control expenditure and generally to ensure compliance with the special purposes of the Special Areas Act.
  8.  There remains in my office a large number of proposals whichhave not yet reached the stage  of actual commitments and, accord-ingly, are excluded  from the details given, but some of these, suchas the provision of  financial assistance to  special organisations likethe Trading Estates  and  Land  Development  Companies now in process of formation, involve important contingent liabilities, of which some indication is given in Appendix B,  for which provision will eventually have to be made.  Thus,  quite apart from entirely newplans which may be initiated in conformity with the Act, the figureof commitments shown above is likely to be substantially increased,as general proposals, already approved in principle, are brought to the stage of finally approved schemes.  9. In  the case of most public  works schemes, I have continued toreceive the noteworthy support  of the Local Authorities concerned,and while the  measure of assistance  I have been able to offer has enabled  urgent  works to be put in hand,  it is  only right to  directspecial attention to  the  important additional  contribution made bythe Authorities  themselves, both financial and otherwise,  to theimprovement  of the Special Areas.   The estimated  total cost ofpublic works schemes now  approved  and  in hand is  2,421,706, ofwhich  1,073,074, represents grants from the Special Areas Fund.  10. In other respects it is impossible to  make an  estimate of thelocal financial contribution towards my work, but it will be observedthat my expenditure on all but the  purely experimental types of scheme is largely upon  capital  items.   In such cases the various local bodies have furnished undertakings  to  assume  responsibilityfor the costs of maintenance and operation as a condition of Grant.I  have felt it my duty elsewhere in the report to sound a note of warning about  the  need for greater attention  to  this important question, but I  feel satisfied that  the organisations themselves aregenerally alive to the situation and realise that they cannot look for permanent financial support from public  sources.  In consideringthe question of financial  commitments, however, I feel  that I shouldmake the point that expenditure from the Special Areas Fund repre-sents a  comparatively modest  proportion of the effort,  financialand otherwise,  which is  being made to give effect to  the purposesof the Special Areas Act by all those with whom it has been myprivilege to work.  IV. GENERAL  COMMENTS  AND RECOMMENDATIONS            (1)  INDUSTRIAL AND LABOUR  QUESTIONS[a) Industrial Exploration and Research  11. A  considerable  amount  of  exploration and  research  is in process  and I believe it  should prove to be fruitful.  Probably themost  important  matter in this connection  is the DepartmentalCommittee set up by the Board of Trade  under the Chairmanship(C 22135)
of Sir Alexander Walker to consider the possibility of constituting a Regional Gas Grid for the West of Scotland.  I believe that theprovision of  really cheap gas for industrial purposes would in thelong run go further towards improving the situation in the West ofScotland than  almost anything else.   It would appear that we are on the verge of a great development in coal carbonisation with allit connotes and it would be very desirable that we should be in aposition to take advantage thereof.  12. The Scottish  National Development Council  is  responsiblefor two items :  the first, a survey of the  quantity and  availability of Torbanites and Cannel  Coals in the West of Scotland coupled with analysis of their contents, and the second,  a  survey of thewhole  coalfield in the West  of Scotland jointly by two  firms ofCivil Engineers of the  highest repute in regard to  all aspects ofwater in coal mines.  I anticipate that these two surveys  will havematerial bearings on the future development of the Areas concerned,  13. I have so far made  only two &quot; policy &quot; suggestions for your consideration, the first, the constitution of something in the natureof a planning, co-ordinating and advisory committee for Scotlandand this you have adopted in establishing the new Scottish EconomicCommittee  associated with  the Scottish National  development council.  The  second,  which my colleague,  Mr.  Malcolm  Stewart,  also suggested, that some method should be devised for financing smallor experimental enterprises  which  might  contain  the germs of possible future industries but which meantime  do not come withinthe scope for assistance by  Banks and other Credit suppliers.  I hopethat much useful work will be  found for the Special Areas Recon-struction  Association, Ltd., when it is formed,  following the recentstatement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.(b) Formation of Special Organisations  14. I anticipate  the establishment at a  very early  date of  two&quot; Public Utility &quot; Companies,  one to take over and carry on the experiments  I have initiated in the user of land, apart from LandSettlement as earned out by the Department of Agriculture, as a partial solution of some of the  unemployment problems : the otherto be  responsible  for the  creation and conducting of IndustrialEstates.   I also hope that an appropriate governing body in whichwill  be vested  Carfin  Hall,  will  shortly  be constituted.   I  am confident  that under the right management Carfin Hall will prove to be a social asset  of very great value to the Special Areas.  Indeed,I venture to hope that voluntary support for this centre will be forth-coming on a scale sufficient to  give  Carfin Hall  the opportunitywidely to extend its influence.
(c) Problems of Industrial Labour 15.  I  venture  to  direct  your  attention  to  certain  aspects  ofemployment  and unemployment  which  have given !me  food for serious thought and in regard to which I  feel we have not even yetascertained  all  the facts  of the  problem :   they apply  chiefly  tocoalmining and shipbuilding in its widest aspect. In  coalmining  during the  past year I have received sporadiccomplaints from different parts of the Special Areas (except Ayrshire)of shortage of skilled underground workers.  Consultation with the officials of the Ministry  of Labour has  generally resulted in the deficiencies being supplied, but  with increasing difficulty,  and ofcourse such considerations as distance from homes to pits, popularityor otherwise  of individual pits all have a bearing on the  problem.In spite,  however,  of  these  indications of an apparent  furtherdemand for workers, the percentage figure of unemployment in theindustry  remains exceptionally high.   I  would  have expected  tofind that once mechanisation  had proceeded as  far as it was likelyto go  (which with accompanying  bad trade  should have producedthe peak figure  of unemployment) there should have been a steadyand material diminution owing to (i)  the definite improvement in trade  (ii) the gradual dropping out of the older men and (iii) the relatively  small recruitment of young  labour into the mines, butthis is not so. I believe that it would be most  desirable to examine and analysethis surplus  of mine-worker  labour in far  more detail than hashitherto been attempted.  I hope that the Departments concerned will be able to give further consideration to this question. I believe it to  be both  desirable and even necessary for at least two reasons.   First  to  ascertain what exactly  constitutes  the apparent  hard  core  of unemployed  in  this industry  (Le., age,suitability for employment,  desire for employment, subdivision intovarious  categories, etc.),  in order to  get a measure of what stillfurther  remains  to  be done  in  finding  occupation,  economic  orotherwise ;  secondly to  ascertain  what is  the future potentialsupply of effective mine workers in the West of Scotland. In this  connection  I  would draw your special attention  to onefactor to which I referred above,  viz., the low rate of recruitmentif young labour.  You are of course aware of the  arrangement made.whereby  there  shall  be  no  recruitment of extra  men  into thendustry except between the ages of 14 and 18.  This means that.ao youth over 18 years of age is  allowed  to become a miner unlessk has had  some mine work before that age.   The effect  of this.restriction has been a very serious reduction  in the young entry forITO special reasons, the first, the fact that poor trade decreased theiemand for all labour, but the second and much  more serious cause,&quot;k fact that there is nothing like the  same necessity for boys in ait that has  been mechanised as  there was  under the old system id so the opportunities to get a start are reduced to  a very  serious
extent.  I believe that this condition is of more serious import to scotland  than to any other part of the country because  of thegreater extent  to  which mechanisation  of  production has beencarried and I feel that this matter should be most carefully considered.   16.  In  shipbuilding the  restrictions of entry took a somewhat different  form in that for a lengthy period the opportunities oftraining apprentices had been so reduced by  lack of work on which to train them as to diminish to a serious extent the total effectivesupply of skilled labour.   At the moment  demand  seems still tobe capable of satisfaction but I  venture  to suggest that shipbuildersare already  obliged to take on a proportion of much less  highly skilled men  and this situation would  be accentuated should theGovernment require  a  material increase in  the rate of  naval construction. As in coalmining there seems  to remain a continuingsurplus of a hard core type which I advise  should be analysed inthe same  manner as suggested in that industry.(d) The Unemployment Problem  17.  Having so recently referred to the all-round improvement mthe industrial situation in the Scottish Special Areas, which I hopewill be maintained, it may savour of  unnecessary duplication to mention  this matter  again.  But as I have  already  expressed theview that industrial development, while being the most orthodox,is also the fundamental cure for unemployment I feel that  it wouldbe  desirable  to reiterate  certain  views which  I  expressed  asInvestigator  in  1934  about the nature  of the developments whichcould most readily be encouraged by the Government and to makea few further comments on the general problem of  the &quot; hard core.&apos;  18. The vital  question of labour supply  about  which  I haveiexpressed views above does not in any way alter my firm conviction \that the  Clyde  and the  industrial West of  Scotland will  continue in the future as it  has  been  in the  past,  the  natural home shipbuilding and the important allied trades  and the recent revivalon the Clyde has happily provided ample proof of my assertion in1934 that &quot; the direction of Government orders to the Clyde area would alleviate  in a remarkably wide degree  and out of proportion to what   it would  do in  other areas  the widespread and  severe jconditions of depression which exist therein.&quot;  The  evidence  now  available  shows  an  all-round,   though Icomparatively small,  reduction  in unemployment in a wide variety fof trades, but  the most cursory examination indicates that the&apos;improvement derives its  source  to a  material   degree from the ]increased activity in the shipbuilding yards.   19.  In  other  directions it is gratifying to  note  that this part the country is following the general tendency of increased industrial activity  in basic industries  and,  what is even more important, isgradually capturing  the  interest of industrialists concerned with
new  developments.   I  hope  that present enquiries will  lead topractical results.   In  order to facilitate new developments, I havebeen glad  to  offer assistance to local authorities and others ininsuring that  all  the essential services likely to be  required  by industry are available.  I venture to hope that one or more IndustrialEstates completely equipped will be made available as rapidly aspossible to  attract  the lighter industries. 20. There remains the vital question of labour.  I have already suggested that the important matter  of the  available supply  for(wo  basic industries should receive special attention.  It would be unfortunate if my  reference  to this  particular  problem,  whichresults almost wholly from the depression and industrial  changes  the  two industries  concerned, conveyed  the  impression thatthe large body of unemployed persons in the Scottish Special Areasconstituted an insoluble &quot; hard core.&quot;   On the contrary,  there is,generally speaking, a very considerable number of surplus workers of all categories and age-groups capable of performing as satisfactoryservice  as any in  the country.  The surplus is unfortunately large in the case  of juvenile labour and, while these young persons have a.trong attachment for  their home districts and  have not readilyaccepted opportunities  for   industrial transference  they  would nevertheless provide  a valuable  labour force for new industrialdevelopments.   The  alacrity  with which the unemployed  havetaken advantage of such facilities as I have been able to provide for both actual employment and social welfare  is to my mind  sureproof of their  general desire for useful activity and their favourable:reaction to every opportunity of escape from the evils of idleness. 21. During my Investigation in 1934 into the problem of industrialdereliction,  I  paid particular attention to the permanent surplusof labour or the &quot; hard core.&quot;  In addition to the more experimentalschemes designed to offer eventually some solution of this problem,I attached special conditions to Grants for public works  schemeswith the object of affording older men with responsibilities  whohad  suffered  from  prolonged  unemployment an  opportunity of re-establishing themselves.  One condition that no man should be discharged  on grounds  of unsuitability without a fortnights  trialwas regarded as difficult by some of the  officials and firms responsiblefor the execution of the works.   Subsequently,  however, I havereceived most interesting  reports about  the operation   of  this condition and -many of the  responsible persons have acknowledgedthe really remarkable improvement which has been  made  by someof the most unpromising workers during the trial period.  I understandthat the question  of discharge at the end of the  first fortnight hasseldom arisen.  This fact and the knowledge that  many of the morehopelessly  unemployed persons are returning  to work during  theimproving  industrial situation appears to  me to show that  the&quot;hard  core &quot;  problem  may  react  to simpler  solutions  than is sometimes  assumed to be possible.
  22. The  abolition  of  mere  idleness,  whether by social  welfareschemes, training schemes of all kinds or other devices for providinguseful activity and occupation is, in my opinion, a question of theutmost national importance and such schemes, so far as the scottish special  Areas are concerned, justify their  expense on this groundalone whatever other industrial or social purposes may be in viewFor this reason, if for no other, I specially welcome the developmentof the training and reconditioning centres of the Ministry of labour which has recently been made possible.  I refer elsewhere to certain special matters of general importanceaffecting social welfare facilities.                (2) PUBLIC WORKS AND SERVICES(a) Sewage and Water Schemes  23. My previous reports and the Appendix A to this report show the actual extent of the assistance I have offered to local authorities for the provision or improvement of certain essential services, suchas sewage and water supply.  I justify my assistance on two grounds (a) that such services are essential for public health, and (b) that without such provision the affected districts could not hope to share in new industrial developments.  It is a matter of considerable  satisfaction to be  able  to  record that the schemes  for sewage purification in the  heart of  industrialLanarkshire now  in hand with assistance  from the  Special AreasFund  will  effect modernisation  and removal  of  unsatisfactoryconditions on a scale which would  otherwise have been impossible without  placing  an  enormous additional burden of rates  on the localities.  The matter for surprise, however, is that conditions have remainedunsatisfactory  for so  long in this  important area without apparenthope of remedy.  24. My experience as Commissioner encourages me to recommendthat the Government should consider whether some State assistance could be offered to local authorities in comparable circumstances foithe  provision of modern sewage  disposal and water facilities, thelatter  probably on  a regional basis,  to be administered  by theappropriate Government Department on lines similar to the grants for housing, etc.   I would also be inclined to add that experience has shown it to bepossible  to cleanse large rivers running through densely populatedindustrial areas and this being so, my recommendation is that such agrant as I have suggested above should also be utilised for the cleans-ing of  rivers in Scotland in such areas and I would cite as instances where this would  be particularly useful the River Tweed and RiveiLeven in Fife.
(J) Health Services  25.  I  have  been able to  offer assistance  at  Greenock and  inLanarkshire in connection with comprehensive proposals for modernhospitals, and I venture to hope that these offers will result.in a combined  effort by the  interested  local authorities  to  prepareadequate schemes which will satisfy the full requirements  of large and thickly populated areas without too much insistence on adminis-trative boundaries.  The voluntary hospitals, notably in edinburgh and Glasgow  and elsewhere are taxed to the utmost in  providing services, and,  while I do not think that the situation is such that anygeneral provision of hospitals is necessary, I  understand from myconsultations  with the Department  of  Health for Scotland  thatcertain urgent needs exist of which the two cases to be assisted are good examples.  I am of opinion, however, that, in meeting this need, the provision should be fully in accordance with modern requirements, and that  allclasses of ailment  and debility should be catered for.   Hence, Ihave asked those who  will be engaged in  formulating the definiteschemes  to make provision for, medical and  surgical cases of  allkinds, as well  as for the early treatment of mental cases.[c) Amenity Schemes  26.  From any visit  to the  depressed  industrial districts in theSpecial Areas  in Scotland, the most cursory observation creates theimpression that only a wholesale scheme  of  clearance of  derelictbuildings, waste bings and other unsightly features of the landscapewould render  these districts attractive as places for new  develop-ments, both industrial and social.  Many  of the amenities have beenprogressively  destroyed over a long period of years by industrialenterprise, and the magnitude of the task of effecting improvementsis immediately apparent.  This question  has given me considerableconcern,  and I have consulted with the local authorities and other organisations,  with a view to discovering whether it is practicable,having regard to finance and other considerations,  to make a boldattack upon the problem.  I have reluctantly been  driven to theconclusion that a far-reaching scheme for restoring conditions  ofamenity cannot be considered unless the Government is prepared  toprovide special financial and other facilities over a protracted period,and  to face the fact that the  expense involved would not only  beenormous, but practically invariably uneconomic.   I feel that these facts alone  would be sufficient to rule out any general scheme  ofrestoration, but the subject is complicated by further difficulties.Questions of proprietary rights in the land are involved, and in manycases buildings and sites are entailed, and proprietors have no powersto dispose  of  them.  Furthermore, there is still considerable inter-ference with amenity which may be unavoidable and which is created by current mining and industrial operations, and it would be useless to launch any  scheme for restoring the  amenities of the area, without
powers to deal with current spoliation.  Possibly, the most seriousdestruction is caused by the deposits from mining operations wherethe nature of the deposit prevents or delays amenity treatment suchas the planting of trees and shrubs, and science has not yet discovereda use for the deposits on a scale which would obviate the presentdumping of materials on to heaps or bings.   27. With a view to bringing about some improvement in the more:congested districts, both for the benefit of the inhabitants and forthe  attraction of  new  industrial  enterprise,  I  have encouragedspecific schemes for the  provision  of amenity  and  recreational facilities in suitable places, and the specific schemes of this characterare referred to in my previous - reports and in Appendix A to this.report.  On a limited scale, consultations with appropriate authorities.as to the practicability of dealing with waste bings have been under-taken, and it is still possible that one or more experiments may befound to be practicable, even though economic benefits are extremely doubtful.                    (3)  LAND DEVELOPMENTS&apos;   28. In the report of my investigation into the depressed areas in.Scotland, I placed particular emphasis upon the part which the landcan play in  an economic revival.   In Scotland  agriculture in  one form or  another is generally successful, but there  are large  tractsof land capable of  improvement for higher economic uses.  In mywork as Commissioner,  therefore, I have given a special place  in myplans for experiments in land  reclamation and a scheme for more intensive farming,  both of which, if successful, might  indicate theway to  a development of the agricultural  industry, offering new opportunities of employment  to present and  future  unemployedwho have little or  no chance of absorption into ordinary industrial employment.   29. I have been  able to create, in collaboration with the Depart-ment of Agriculture for Scotland, what might be termed a &quot; ladder &quot;for the transition,  by stages, of industrial unemployed into  usefulagricultural employment and in this connection,  I should especiallystress the fact that before my appointment the Department ofAgriculture had in being satisfactory schemes for the development.of small-holdings, and plots for  the unemployed throughout Scotland,.and the Joint Committee of the Scottish National Union of allotment holders and  Society of Friends and  Local  Associations had madenoteworthy progress with schemes for allotment  cultivation, all ofwhich had made an important contribution to  the alleviation ofindustrial unemployment and rendered  the  adoption  of  similarschemes unnecessary on my part.   My place in the more orthodoxland developments,  therefore, was  to fill  in gaps in  an already ambitious programme  and provide means by which selected men could progress gradually from the spare-time cultivation of land to.the fully-fledged small-holder or tenant-farmer.
  30. There is here, in my opinion, a field for new developments andexperiments and once again the limitation of my powers to a definedarea has prevented me from laying down a co-ordinated programme on as large a scale as the circumstances appear to justify.  The importance of agriculture  as a  Scottish industry and of thework which is  being  done both  through the agency of the aboveDepartment  and by  private  enterprise  is  not always recognised.The fact that in my limited sphere land has been extremely difficultto obtain is  itself  an indication that suitable land is profitably,though not always efficiently,  used.   Hence, I hope that my experi-ments in the treatment of land, for which I have utilised the servicesof the Macaulay Institute  for Soil  Research, and my scheme forintensive farming, which  will be carried on by a specially  createdCompany,  will be  of particular  value as  examples  of what  may eventually be practicable  on a much larger scale.  It may be argued that these schemes do not directly and immedi-ately  offer employment on  a  scale commensurate  with the initialexpenditure involved, but if in Scotland there is to be a permanent solution of the unemployment problem I am convinced that  it mustbe sought by bold experiments in land utilisation which may indicatenew opportunities and  methods  for the permanent  absorption  of surplus labour. 31.  I  particularly commend the  work  of reclamation  of wasteland and experiments in the more intensive  use of land which I haveinitiated to the attention .of  the Government in the hope  that ifthese  prove successful plans relating to Scotland as  a  whole may be formulated for  the largest possible programme of land reclamationand development.   In order that such schemes may be developedmore directly as a means to  the solution of the industrial unemploy-ment  problem,  I  consider  that  the Government  should examineclosely the scope of existing legislation and the financial  provisionnecessary, in  certain cases, to  continue in a more general  way, thefinancial assistance by way of loan and otherwise which I have beenable to offer from the Special  Areas Fund,  together with the possi-bility of  extending  the types  of schemes which I have undertakenas experiments.                      (4)  SOCIAL WELFARE 32.  While I have regarded  the promotion of measures to assistthe economic  development of the Special Areas as the more essential and obvious means of relieving the unemployment problem, I cannotemphasise too-strongly the importance of a well organised attemptto provide  for the social  well-being of the working community inevery respect. I venture to suggest that this question  is not inevitablyconnected with the  unemployment problem  and that it would be a mistake to regard  welfare  facilities as of  temporary importanceduring the continuance of the depression.   Indeed,  I think  it isunfortunate, in  some ways, that some  of the newer and more
interesting  welfare  developments  have  been  founded  on  an&quot; unemployment &quot;  basis.  This  particularly  applies to the efforts of the Scottish and other Councils for Community Service duringUnemployment.   33. It is my belief that Community Service Clubs and  organisedcultural and recreational  facilities  will take  a firmer  hold on thecommunity at  large and that the  busy as well as idle individualswill recognise the value  of a service in which they can break awayduring leisure hours from their usual routine and associations.  It is,in fact with this ultimate object that I have provided funds throughthe Scottish Council for the establishment of a number  of ModelOccupational or &quot; hobby &quot; Centres on the understanding  that theywill be  fully supported and used by all sections of the  community and will illustrate  the possibilities of further developments of thekind on a basis of &quot;  mutual service.&quot;  My funds were made availablepurely  for experimental purposes,  but I  think it is  particularly desirable to stress  the  fact that the success of  these  Centres canonly be assured by  voluntary effort.  Hence I have made it clear tothe Scottish Council as  well as to all other bodies  engaged in theprovision of welfare facilities with my help that they must acceptfull responsibility for their continuance and subsequent development.This question appears to me to be one of organisation, finance and personal service and I think I  should  express a  view on  a matterof some moment not only to  the  Special Areas but  to scotland as a whole.  34.  In the social side of my  work, while I have had notable.assistance from many admirable organisations, the important  facthas emerged that  neither collectively nor individually  can  theycover the whole field.   Hence I have been  obliged to deal  withnumerous bodies and,  in certain  instances, to  undertake direct control  of social welfare schemes.  Furthermore, in dealing with thelarge  number of voluntary bodies which  undertake some aspect of social service it has sometimes been difficult to avoid the dangers.of competition and overlapping.  I feel that this experience  may havea most  vital bearing on the future success of many social efforts and recommend that the whole subject should receive early considera-tion.  Without more detailed examination, it is difficult to suggestin exact terms  what steps should be taken but, generally  speaking,I think there should be some measure of pooling of resources  and effort and that, possibly through a federation of all organisationsunder a Scottish Council of Social Service, closely associated with theNational Council, much more could be done in obtaining financialand personal support from the community than is possible at present.Such  a  body should also be able, without destroying the  specialistelement in  many  valuable existing organisations, to  ensure  the adequate  and  economical  development  of  all forms  of  social welfare  facilities.
 35. I understand that the Scottish Council for Community service during  Unemployment are  issuing  an  early  general appeal  for financial support  to increase  their  very limited resources.   Theresults of previous appeals by this and other bodies in Scotland have.been disappointing.  While this is often taken as an indication of the lack of interest on the part of the community, I am of the opinionthat we have not  paid sufficient attention  to the  importance of organising either social service work or appeals for its support oncomprehensive lines and that attention to the matter of organisaion may produce more encouraging results in the future. It is, I  think, largely  from  this cause  that the maintenance of welfare  facilities for adults and children has occasioned exceptionaldifficulties.  The initiative has been left to the districts  fortunateenough  to be  able to provide for their own needs  and organisationremains on a local basis.  In spite of these fundamental difficulties,much useful work in improving the social welfare of the community in the Special Areas has been accomplished. 36. Having reported  upon  the  various  other  social  welfareschemes in my recent report, I feel that it is unnecessary to do morenow than  mention a few  further  general problems, apart from thatreferred to above.  Possibly one of the most difficult questions forany social service scheme  is that  of premises and, in a lesser degree,.equipment.   In many  districts,  even if  premises  are available atall,  they are often totally unsuitable or only adaptable at considerable expense as make-shifts.  It  is largely for this reason that I haveassisted the Scottish Council for  Community  Service during Unem-ployment  to  establish a number  of  model occupational  centresas examples  of  what may be  done,  if an effort  is made  on well-considered lines, to  further the solution  of this new  and probablypermanent problem of  leisure.   In the case of many of the youth organisations, however, few of them singly can justify the provisionof premises for  their sole occupation.  Yet their  requirements  are often similar.  While assisting them financially in  the developmentof their movements, therefore,  I  have made some  examination of ascheme for providing buildings of a common design for club purposes.which might be supplied for the joint use of a  number of similarbodies by mutual  arrangement.  I  am of the opinion  that  this examination  of  a scheme to achieve a common  standard  in clubpremises should continue. There is no doubt that if such a schemeproved to be practicable many architectural difficulties and financialdoubts would be solved and the development of the youth movementgenerally  could  be planned with  much greater confidence as to  the-initial and running costs and freedom from waste.   At present manyyouth clubs are housed in  rented premises designed for quite differentpurposes or under  make-shift conditions which render  satisfactorydevelopment  impossible  and in new housing areas  or  in manycongested  industrial  districts premises  are often   unobtainable.This matter  of  premises might  well  receive the  attention of  the-
 large central organisations concerned with the  welfare  of youth and provide a  useful  and immediately practicable example oi co-ordinated effort, particularly if some further encouragement by the Government of planned developments is possible.   37. Having  referred to the need  for  greater  co-ordination in many aspects of social welfare as  one  of the fundamental problems, I  cannot with  fairness  fail to refer  to the commendable way in which the various  youth organisations in  the Special Areas are working together and endeavouring  to supplement one  another&apos;s efforts.   Largely  through the good offices of Mr. Troup, of the Scottish Juvenile  Welfare  Office, who   has  provided a most  valuable co-ordinating link,  it has  been  possible to  avoid much  of the competition  and  wasteful overlapping which constitutes such a special risk in some aspects of social welfare work.  Indeed a solution of  the  one common  difficulty in the matter of premises would undoubtedly be followed by a noteworthy  increase in youth welfare facilities for which there  is considerable scope.   38. Possibly the simplest and most effective contribution to the social welfare of the unemployed has proved  to be the scheme of physical training classes  for unemployed  men and women, which has been so ably conducted through the joint efforts of the Ministry of Labour and my own staff.  I have already reported on this scheme in some detail in my previous reports, but in view of the unmistakable evidence of  its value and  popularity, I  strongly recommend its continuance and if possible a wider application.  It may be stated confidently that the classes as they  have been conducted have a direct and  considerable effect upon the employability of those who take part  in them and bring about an all-round psychological improvement.   Their  organisation has been singularly successful and, at  least,  until there is  a more  general  interest in  physical culture  on  the  part of the community which may  energise a much needed  national movement, I feel there is special  merit in leaving the development of schemes  for  the  unemployed  in the capable hands of the Ministry.  I would, however,  particularly commend this scheme to the notice of both the Government and the community.                         (5)  GENERAL  39. The  two  previous  reports,  together with the  Appendix of this report will indicate, I hope, that, in spite of the difficulties and more general problems for  consideration with which this report is  principally concerned,  a  material amount of positive work hasbeen accomplished.  There is, undoubtedly, still much remaining to be done under thevarious  main headings and up to  the  present  time there has been no relaxation in the number and variety of proposals coming forward,all of which involve examination and  action by the administrative staff.
 You will appreciate that within my office it has been necessaryto set up administrative machinery  capable  of  dealing with thereceipt as well as the initiation of general proposals covering a wide variety of  subjects,  examination  of  such  proposals  in detail,involving consultations with numerous  parties concerned,  govern-mental and otherwise,  the preparation of detailed schemes,  offers of grants and  finally either  the direct  and  detailed administrativecontrol of the  schemes themselves  or constant  supervision of thework of local authorities and other organisations.  The combination of broad questions of policy and detailed administrative work in theone office has undoubtedly had its advantages and has contributedin no small measure to the expedition with  which many specificschemes have been put into effect.  The arrangements for obtainingoffice accommodation, acquiring the necessary staff on loan  fromother Departments or by direct engagement all had to be made fromthe smallest beginning and to meet continuous rapid  developmentof the work.  The need for supervising or directly controlling manyof the schemes, often of a novel character, has involved my staff in new problems of staff and  establishment work and administrativeprocedure in  which  the advice  and  assistance  which could  beobtained from other Government Departments was often restricted by the very novelty of the problems. I do not wish to detract from the value of consultation with other government Departments and my staff have taken every opportunityof  seeking  information from  such  sources.   The  Departmentsconcerned have always given willing assistance whenever they werein a position to do so. 40. In the matter, however, of actual staff assistance, with theexception of a few experienced senior officers obtained on loan from various departments, I have been obliged to resort to direct engage-ment to a considerable extent in an endeavour to satisfy my needs.In view of this wide range of responsibilities and new problems, itis not surprising that progress could only be achieved by the accept-ance of extraordinary  and continuous  pressure, constant adaptationand adjustment and by adopting every  possible device to obviatedelay, even when this  has involved a departure from the meticuloussystem of safeguards customary in public administration. I think it desirable to lay stress upon the enormous amount of lessobvious and necessary work which results from the simplest decisionto take practical steps, as this fact can often only be appreciated by those upon  whom is placed the direct  responsibility to act.   Theamount of work and the delay, however, would probably have beengreater if I had not on occasions overruled some of the precautionarysteps proposed by my Civil Service staff in their  desire to protectme from some of the special risks inevitably resulting from myappointment. 41. I draw attention to  the  difficulties of erecting administrative machinery, the heavy responsibilities placed upon it and to  the need.
for eliminating many safeguards in an &quot; emergency &quot;  job such asmine, because I am of opinion that such matters will require particular attention if the special developments to deal with the problem ofindustrial depression are continued.   Those  brought into contact with the  problem in its broader aspects  often  cannot appreciateall that is entailed in a demand for practical steps, while those whosedaily job it is to wrestle with the detailed application of solutionsare sometimes, and naturally, inclined to take  the  long and saferoad to their destination.   The personal freedom which I have claimed as  Commissionerunder  the powers  conferred  upon me has  happily amalgamatedwith the  work of my administrative  assistants  to produce results which I am content to place under examination.                       V.-CONCLUSION   42. In conclusion I should like once more to emphasise the cordialnature  of my  relations with individual  members&apos; of  the variousScottish Departments and the immense amount of assistance theyhave rendered to me. It would be somewhat invidious to say that Ihave received more help from one Department  than another, but probably the greatest burden  was thrown  upon the  Department ofHealth, owing  to the fact that my largest cpntribution to public services was necessarily made to Local Authorities  and naturallyI had to call chiefly upon this Department which normally has the closest  contact in this  field with Local Administration.   To Mr.Highton and his colleagues,  especially Mr. Vallance and Mr. Ronald,I owe a deep debt of gratitude.   43. Of the non-Scottish Departments the Ministry  of Labour hasbeen unfailing in providing not only statistics and information but has also been my chief contributor of assistance in the way of  Staff.To all I tender my warm thanks.   44. The Personnel of the Scottish Office have throughout beenguides,  philosophers and friends.   My  points  of  contact  werenaturally most with Sir John Jeffrey in London or Mr. David Milnein Edinburgh and they were ready at all times to help me.   45. It has been my good fortune in undertaking various responsi-bilities  for different Governments invariably to  have enjoyed theassistance and  support  of efficient and enthusiastic personal  staffsbut on  this  occasion, as I mentioned  earlier it was  difficult to getthe loan of  an adequate number  of senior officers ;  consequently,as the work developed with  considerable  rapidity,  comparativelyjunior officers were being continually required to take on responsi-bilities much above what would normally be required from men intheir particular grades and on no  occasion did they fail me.   46. To  Sir William Goodchild, who up to quite recently has beenmy Assistant Commissioner  I am  indebted  for sound  judgment and
excellent advice and  he frequently and most adequately relievedme on many occasions  when public duties had to be undertaken.He has undertaken the arduous duty of Secretary General to theScottish Economic Committee and I am confident that he will proveof great use to that Body in its difficult work.  47.  In Mr.  L. G. Bullock I found an administrator and organiserof the first rank.   He naturally has been closest of all to me and,as I think he  realises how much I have appreciated and enjoyed our association, I need add  nothing to what I have  said about him on previous occasions.  48.  It may be unusual to mention the Press, but I would like to puton record my gratitude  for  the kindness and encouragement I havereceived  from the Scottish  Press.   It would have been  painfullyeasy for them adversely to criticise my efforts to  carry out the  work with which you entrusted me, but they realised the difficulties of thetask and supported me throughout by helpful  and understandingcomment.  May I once more,  Sir, say with how very  much  regret  I, forprobably the last time, subscribe myself                  Your humble and obedient  Servant,                                       H.
