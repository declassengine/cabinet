THIS DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY  OF HIS BRITAai?IO MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEaMSiT,.secret . P.179(36)                   GAB  I.ST E T.Report of the Committee on the Regulations of theUnemployment Assistance Board.Memorandum &quot;by the Seoretary of State for Scotland.1.      As indioated in the Report of the Cabinet Committee on   the Regulations of the Unemployment Assistance Board   (CP.172(36)) I regret that I am unable to agree in all respects   with the dammittee1s views.   I am anxious therefore, that my   colleagues should have my views before them in considering the   Board&apos;s proposals as described in detail in U.A.R.34(8) and   disoussed in the Report of the Committee*2,      The object of the new proposals is to liquidate the Standstill   arrangements under which at present 56% of the oases in Great   Britain, and 70^ in Scotland, are ruled, not by the Boards   Regulations, but by the transitional payment practice.    These   figures show, not only the magnitude of the task,but that the   comparison  is not between the new and the old Regulations, but   between the proposed Regulations and the Standstill.   Equally   I would suggest that the House of Commons and the oountry will   be interested more in the final result attained when the new   Regulations are in full operation than in the results which will   be achieved during the first three or four months of the   liquidation as illustrated in the tabular statement appended to   the Committee^ Report.3.      As I have urged upon the Committee, the new Regulations   will be judged by public opinion not purely on the abstraot  merits   of the  individual rules and scales , nor by comparison with the   abortive Regulations of January 1935,  , but by reference to      (a)  the final assessment which the Regulations will  yield          as contrasted with the Standstill arrangement now in          operat ion, and      (b)  the fidelity  with which the Government&apos;s Eleotion          pledges in regard to Unemployment Assistance have been          honoured.   If it appears  that the new Regulations will involve substantial   ,lcuts&quot;  in many different types  of case and in many different   parts of the country,  and. that  the Eleotion promises have not   been fulfilled in the spirit and in the letter we may be faced   with a  very unpleasant political situation.    In this  connection   it is worth observing that  but  for the Standstill the present   Regulations would have resulted in cuts in over half  the total   cases in Great Britain and 2/3rds of the total oases in   Scotland.4.      Throughout the  discussions of the Committee I  have urged   that I  should&apos;  be supplied with detailed figures showing as                                                      accurately/COPY HO,    5
tf elaccurately as possible the effect of the Board&apos;s proposalswhen in full operation.   The Board have kindly supplied mewith various statistics and although I have not yet obtainedall the figures which I desire, it is clear from the bestinformation which I have been able to procure from theBoard that the percentage of cases liable to cuts underthe new Regulations will be alarmingly large.   The  /Boardinf ormedme on the 22nd June &quot;that the mathematical resultsof the final proposals are likely to be rather better&quot; thanthose shown in the figures which I give below , but that &quot;thedifference will be slight&quot;,.   As an approximation t-d the finalresults, therefore, they offer a fairly accurate picture.They show that the percentage of household cases liable to suffer cuts as compared with the Standstill in 12representative areas in Scotland, is as follows -Airdrie         42Bathg ate        37iBl ant 2o?e        37trCowdenbeath     40Dundee          43Dunfermline     45Edinburgh       23Falkirk         53Glasgow         31Hamilton        25Johnstone       56Kilmarnock      53This will be the position in Scotland in household caseswhen the new Regulations are in force.   The figures do not take into account the cuts which will result in the case of single men.     The matters upon which discussion has centred  during the deliberations of the Committee have been                   (l) Rent Rule                   (2) Earnings Rule                   (3) Scale allowance to single men in                                       lodgings.(l)  REITT RULE.  (Paragraph 6 of CP.172(36))     I value the concessions described in paragraph 6 of theCommittee&apos;1 s Report &quot;which meet in substance the difficultiesI felt and I am prepared to accept them, subject, however,to repeating the suiamission which I urged upon the Committeethat the proposed definite relaxations of the Rule should be embodied in the Regulations, and not, as it is proposed,in a verbal pledge or in a White Paper.(2)  EARal&amp;GS RULE, (paragraph 7 of CP.172(36)).      The Board&apos;s proposals, approved by the Committee, toallow 14/** plus half the excess- with a minimum allowanoeof 20/- for ages 21 and over , and 12/- plus half the exoessin other cases , with a minimum of 16/- between 18 and 21 ,are in my view, unduly severe.   As a result of a close  study                                                          of/
mof Sbottish oonditions the proposal whioh  .I submitted to the Committee - to allow 17/- plus halfthe excess with a minimum allow ana e of 30/- in ***speo%-of oases of 18 years and over, and 12/-  plus half th*excess in respect of cases under 18 - - is one which I desire to urge upon my oolleagues in view of the hardshipwhich will otherwise &quot;be inflioted on a large percentageof household oases.   In this connection it will he kept in view that the allowance of 26/- for man and wife isat present in almost universal use throughout Sootland andthat the proposed figure of 24/- whioh applies (seeparagraph 5 of CP, 172(36)) only to households withresources will, therefore, in itself operate as an intensification of the Means Test.   It should be home in mind, also that in many parts of Sootland the Board1 a proposed rates for the adolescent dependants of applicantswill he less than is at present being paid.(3) SINGE MEH IS L0DGJNG3.   (paragraph 6, page 5 of                              O.P.l72(36))       17/- is the normal allowance in Scotland.  I am satisfied that the reduction to 15/- would not only involve -----outs in the great majority of oases in Sootland but wouldalso entail seriouB hardship and often a lowering of healthstandards,,                              (Id.)
