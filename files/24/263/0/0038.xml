                    Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1936.SECRET.                                                         Copy No.  41CP. 208 (36).CABINET.TRANS-ATLANTIC ROUTE AND IRISH FREE STATE                   PARTICIPATION.              -Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.    IN  paragraph  15  of  the Report of  the  Irish  Situation  Committee(CP. 204 (36)) the recommendation is made that our representatives should beauthorised to indicate that as regards the development of the Trans-Atlantic air services the Irish Free State would be entitled to participate as full partners inthe development of these services on the lines discussed at Ottawa in December1935.    Negotiations have been going on during the week-end between the Treasury,the Dominions Office, the Air Ministry, the  General Post Office,  and the IrishFree State.    The first question discussed was  the cost involved in and the responsibilityfor the construction of the air base involving both the seaplane  base and  a landaerodrome.  It was estimated that  the total cost of  this would  be in the  region of  500,000.  The  Irish Free State representatives stated  that the  Irish FreeState would be prepared  to finance this entirely,  both as to  capital and as to annual recurring maintenance charges.    The  Irish Free State representatives contended strongly that if they incurredthis large liability, they ought to make either no contribution, or only a modest&quot; token&quot; contribution to the subsidy cost of  the scheme.   The maximum theywould  agree to recommend was  3,000 a year.  The  attached Appendix sets outthe Irish Free  State  provisional offer, and the  counter-proposal of the UnitedKingdom representatives.    We  must  take an immediate decision on the  Irish proposals because it isessential  that  the construction of the base should be begun during the presentsummer and autumn.  The Irish must secure the necessary financial authority from the Dail, and make an announcement there before  it rises at the end ofthis week.   The Irish representatives are to telephone to-morrow as to how fartheir Ministers are willing to go on the suggestions made in the Appendix.    In view of the situation disclosed in the Irish Situation Committee, I must therefore ask the Cabinet urgently for directions in  two respects :      (1) Have we authority to enter into a binding agreement with the Irish Free           State  Government, assuming that  the Cabinet approve  the proposals          on their merits?    (2) Assuming that the Cabinet approves  of our entering  into  a binding           agreement,  I would ask for authority to agree a settlement on the           following conditions:            (a)  That the Irish Free  State accept full financial  responsibility for                 the  construction and maintenance of the base;           (&amp;)  That they agree to pay a net subsidy contribution of not less than                  3,000 per annum.   The British  Government representatives                 should  try to  get the financial terms  for  which  they have                 contended, but if  we cannot get  better than  3,000 a year, I                 suggest that we should close on that.                                                                       S.    Air  Ministry,           July 27, 1936.[13594]

(Payment of this contribution to               enable  the Free State, if it so desires, to participate in  the               Commonwealth Air Mail Scheme subject to the appropriate postal               payment,  without additional subsidy contribution.)
