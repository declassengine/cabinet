I CIRCULATE herewith the paper prepared in the Foreign Office to whichthe Foreign Secretary made reference at  the  last Cabinet he attended (on the6th July).                                                                      H.    July 13,  1936.            Memorandum on the Reform of the League of Nations.     1.  On the 4th July  the  Assembly of the League of Nations  passed a recommendation in the following terms :       The Assembly,     1. Having met again on the  initiative of the Government of the ArgentineRepublic, and in pursuance of  the decision to adjourn its session taken on the11th October,  1935, in order to examine the situation arising out of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute;     2. Taking note of  the  communications and declarations which have beenmade to it on this subject;     3. Noting that various circumstances have prevented the full application ofthe Covenant of the League of Nations;     4. Remaining firmly attached to the principles of the Covenant, which arealso expressed  in other diplomatic instruments, such as the declaration of theAmerican States,  dated the 3rd August,  1932,  excluding the settlement  of territorial questions by force;     5. Being desirous of strengthening the authority of the League of Nationsby adapting the application of those principles to the lessons of experience;     6. Being convinced that it is necessary to strengthen the real effectiveness ofthe guarantees of security which the League affords to its Members;    Recommends that the Council      (a)  Should invite the Governments of the Members of the League to send          to  the Secretary-General,  before  the  1st September,  1936, any          proposals they may wish to make in order to improve in the spirit and          within the limits laid down above, the application of the principles of          the Covenant;     (b)  Should instruct the Secretary-General  to make a  first examination and          classification of these proposals;     (e)  Should report to the Assembly at its next meeting on  the  state of the          question.    2.  The language of this recommendation, particularly in paragraphs 5 and 6,is equivocal and was chosen in order to mask, for the time being, a deep divergence      8715  [13500]   [13605]                                       B
          -                        &apos;    *) -     .....   &apos; -.....&apos;of view that manifested itself in the Bureau of the Assembly when the terms ofthe resolution were being considered.     3.  The difference of.  opinion was two-fold.  In  the first  place certaindelegations, in particular those of France, the Soviet Union and the States of the little and Balkan Ententes, wished it to be made clear that the invitation to submit proposals should be confined to the two articles of the Covenant, articles 11 and 16,which  deal with the question of security in its preventive and repressive aspectsrespectively, and that article 19, which they intend should remain  a dead letter,was not in question.  The contrary view was taken by the delegation of the UnitedKingdom,  the  Dominions,  the  ex-neutral  States  and  Hungary,   who  held that the Assembly ought not to attempt to circumscribe the liberty of members ofthe League  in  this respect.   The Canadian delegate made  a reservation to this latter effect in  the Assembly.     4.   Similarly, the first-named group of States wished the recommendation to lay  down in advance that any change in the terms or interpretation  of thesecurity articles of the Covenant should be in one direction only, namely, that ofincreasing or making more precise the obligations of members of the League,while the second group held that this issue ought not to be prejudged in advanceof the  debate  which will take  place  in the  Assembly  next  September.   TheRoumanian  representative, M.  Tiitulescu, made himself the advocate of the firstview in uncompromising terms.     5.   The text of the recommendation leaves it open to both sides to claim thattheir own view has prevailed, but the clash of opinion, which was confined withinmoderate limits in the private meetings of the Bureau on the present occasion, can hardly fail to be publicly manifested when the Assembly meets in September.    6.   The situation  here  described  is  sufficient to show that there  is no possibility of securing general agreement at Geneva to any substantial amendmentof the Covenant, and that the acceptance of even an interpretative resolution willbe difficult to obtain.    7.   The question now arises what answer, if any, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould  make to the invitation to submit proposals.    8.   The decisive factors in the determination of their choice from amongthese courses may well be first,  as stated above, the undoubted  difficulty,  if notimpossibility, of general agreement at Geneva upon  any substantial change in theterms or method of application of the Covenant; and, secondly, the fact that theirpolicy  as  regards the League is closely bound up with their policy towards germany.    9.   There are, broadly speaking, three types of policy which  are theoreticallypossible in  the  circumstances,  and which it is proposed now briefly to examine,for purposes of review rather than of recommendation.   At one end of the scaleis the policy which would advocate the generalisation of the obligation to  take military action against an aggressor under Article 16, or at least the creation ofan all-European pact of mutual assistance within the framework of the  Covenant.For His Majesty&apos;s Government  to advocate or to assent to  such a  policy wouldbe clearly to imply, though not,  indeed, to assert in terms, that  they were readyto resist by force of arms any and every attempt by Germany to secure territorialexpansion in Europe by resort to war.   It is presumably not the  policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to engage themselves  in advance to intervene by  force against Germany in any  part of Europe, other than the area covered by the locarno Treaty, though it is presumably  also their policy not to proclaim inadvance  that  they  will  not  do  so.&apos;   But  if  they  were   to  have  in contemplation any policy of the extreme kind which  is  now in question,  theywould  have   to ask themselves whether such obligations of mutual  assistance would  be  generally  undertaken  by Members of the  League,  or  such an all-European  impending pact  be capable  of  being concluded; and whether,  if germany struck with all  her might in Central or  Eastern Europe, the obliga-tions undertaken would be fulfilled by the contracting parties; and  if they were,whether the will and power of the coalition, as at present equipped or likely tobe equipped in the  near future, would be  sufficient to ensure the  defeat ofGermany.
9 ^ 9     10.   At the other end of the  scale is the policy which would  advocate  the complete deletion from the  Covenant of those articles  (Articles 10 and 16) by which Members of the League assume an obligation to take  action against an aggressor.  The arguments in favour of this course are  set out at their best and fullest in Sections I and II of the Annex to this paper, and this school of thought is, of course, worthy of consideration.  It is clear, however, that no such proposal could possibly gain general acceptance at Geneva, and it is equally  clear that if one of the Great Powers were ever to advance it, with any considerable measure of support from other Members of the League, this would be to make manifest that the League as an instrument of collective coercion was dead,  and that if  any political functions still remained to it, these would be consultative only.   The result might be to destroy the League.  Por His Majesty&apos;s Government to adopt this line would be a revolution in policy, and they would naturally have  to consider whether, and if so, on  what grounds, this deliberate abandonment by them of the whole oft- proclaimed  policy of &quot;collective security,&quot; in what is its most widely accepted meaning, could be made acceptable  to the public at home.   There is also  the foreign aspect to be considered.  There can be little doubt that any  proposal  for the deletion of Article 16 would be widely interpreted  as constituting the offer of a free hand  to  Germany  in Central  and  Eastern  Europe,  and would be calculated to create alarm and to arouse strong protest  in Europe.     11.   On the other hand, some intermediate proposal for  the future of  the League might possibly be devised, though  it might, of course, suffer  from  the defects inherent in all compromises.     12.   Would  it  be possible  (in  view  of  the  difficulties  set out  above in amending any of the major provisions of the Covenant) to maintain the  Covenant intact in such a way as at  one  and the same time (1)  to lessen, if we  cannot altogether eliminate,  the risk  of becoming involved in  war with Germany  for some cause  other than our vital  interests, in  execution  of a general obligation, and (2) to  ensure that, if it were impossible for us to keep out of war  with Germany, such a war would be unmistakably a League war and one  therefore which might rally our whole people ?  Would  it be possible also and this would be of the essence  of  the scheme (3) to demonstrate to Germany,  by  practical example, that the peace settlement is susceptible of substantial change by peaceful means through the machinery of the League, and  that the  Covenant and the Peace Treaties are separable instruments; and (4) to make suggestions for easing the economic strain that exacerbates and  perpetuates political  differences even if it does  not give  rise to them?  Possible compromises  on  these lines are described in Sections III and IV of the Annex.     13.   In such a case the  deterrent to Germany,  for  what  it is worth, might be the existence of regional or other  limited pacts of mutual assistance, backed by a precise and general obligation for all Members of the League to exercise economic  and financial  pressure upon the Covenant-breaker  in a case where military assistance had been afforded under one of these pacts.  The value of these arrangements as a deterrent must not be overestimated, nor their influence as  an irritant underrated.  It is difficult to  see what regional or similar pacts could be concluded in the future other than those that already exist (Locarno,  the Franco- Soviet and Czechoslovak-Soviet pacts,  the Little Entente,  the Balkan  Entente and the various  French alliances).  Even if further pacts could  be concluded, the military  value of the  resulting complex of obligations would be doubtful.   And it is  hardly necessary to say that the organisation of economic  pressure  by members of the League against Germany could not  be expected to be any more rapid or any more effective than it was against Italy.    14.  If, therefore, His  Majesty&apos;s  Government were  to  sponsor  any  suchcompromise  as this, they should do so  with the knowledge     (1) that it would probably not gain general acceptance by members of the          League;    (2) that it would  still involve some risk of their being drawn into war for          the sake  of other than a direct British interest  (for any general          obligation  to exercise economic and  financial pressure must carry with          it some risk of armed retaliation);    (3) that it could not be counted on as a deterrent, and might merely serve  as          an irritant, to Germany;       !r 13500]                                                     B 2
f     (4) that it  could not  be  counted on with confidence to secure the defeat           of Germany  if Germany  chose  to  attack in  Central  or Eastern           Europe;  and     (5) that it would probably rule out ab initio any return of Germany to the           League, and make it difficult to bring Germany into the Concert of           Europe on equal terms.     15.  The Members of the League are so fundamentally divided on the  issueof League  reform that no lead from His Majesty&apos;s Government one way or theother would be likely to produce a  common opinion.  If His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment had reached a definite conclusion which they were prepared to press  uponthe other Members of the League, there might nevertheless be a good case for theirtaking a lead :  in any other event there is much to be said  for a policy of reserve,at least until after the opposing theses have been developed and debated at Geneva.     In the annex to the present paper, some of the courses open to His Majesty;sGovernment are passed in review.  It is in five parts.     In Section I the case is put for a &apos;&apos; Consultative League &apos;&apos; without repressivefunctions and for the deletion of article 16.  In Section II suggestions  are madefor attaining this object by other means.     In Sections III and IV alternative suggestions are made for achieving the compromise solution referred to above.  They maintain article 16, but modify its application.     Section V gives a summary of the suggestions of  the French  Governmentcommunicated semi-officially by the French Ambassador on  the 22nd June.  ThisFrench plan has since been publicly proposed at Geneva.  It has likenesses to the suggestions made in Sections III and IV, but with important differences.
ANNEX.                                     I.Proposal to Delete A rticle 16.    In the present condition  of the League, the fullest and most unprejudicedconsideration of its ailments is essential.  It may well be that a major operation will be necessary if it is to recover.   Up to now we have pinned our  faith to&quot; collective security.&quot;  But collective action, in its present incomplete form, hasin the Italo-Abyssinian dispute failed us.  There must now be  &quot;stocktaking.&quot;The lessons of the dispute must be considered by the League. The League has,we admit,  failed in the present instance.  It must be made, if possible,  effective for the future.    Various proposals to  this end are being put  forward.  Members of theLeague, it  is said by some, must undertake more automatic and more far-reachingobligations. They must be prepared to fight whenever and wherever the Covenantis  violated.  But this lends itself to the retort that in the present dispute nations have shown themselves reluctant to fulfil their existing obligations, where theirown vital interests have not been engaged.   Are they likely in the future to fulfilyet more stringent obligations ?   It may be safely  assumed that an automaticobligation  to lend military aid against an aggressor in  all parts of the world, oreven in all  parts of Europe, would not be acceptable to the people of this country.Nor would it be acceptable to  the other  nations of the League.    Those who recognise this  fact and are yet anxious  to preserve to the Leaguesome  coercive powers, put forward various suggestions  for modifications orreinterpretations of the existing Covenant, which would take account  of the factthat nations will only fight where their own national interests are involved.    It is suggested, for example, that there should be a general obligation on all members  of the League  to  apply automatically  certain  mild   economic andfinancial sanctions  in the event of action by an aggressor involving a breach ofarticle 16.  Over and above this, there should  be regional agreements  between nations interested in particular areas,  by which they should bind themselves inthe event of a breach of  article 16 to fight the aggressor.    Another suggestion  is  that there should be no general obligation  to  applysanctions of any kind. &quot;Members of the League  would have the right  to contractin  or out  of all their obligations under article 16.  Regional pacts would be negotiated, but Members of the League outside the area concerned would be free of  all obligation.   The breach of  article 16 would have made the aggressor anoutlaw.  It would  be open to any Member of the League to take against himwhatever action it liked.  But there would be no obligations on it to do so.    The inherent weakness of all these proposals seems to be that the action takenby nations not parties to the original pacts is likely to be ineffective.  Even  ifmild  economic and financial sanctions were widely applied, they  would  not stopaggression.  The League has already tried such measures under most  favourable circumstances in the present dispute, but without success.    To try to build the new peace system on inadequate  foundations  wouldprobably be to doom it to disaster from the start.  Collective security, if  it  can bemade so effective as to give complete confidence, is  the ideal policy  for  peace.Otherwise  it is highly dangerous, creating obligations without the necessaryconfidence  that they can or will be successfully fulfilled.   What  justification  is there for retaining the explicit obligations of articles 10 and 16 in the Covenantwhen it is  manifest that they will  not and cannot be fulfilled ?    Are we not in danger of losing sight of the conception originally  in the minds of the framers of  the  Covenant?  Their  intention was not &quot;primarily tosupport the victim of aggression against the aggressor.  It was to marshal suchoverwhelming forces against  the potential  aggressor that the aggression  wouldnot take place  at all.  But it was a plan entirely dependent on  the assumptionthat the League would be universal.   If the League is not now  universal, it  ischiefly because of the existence of the  coercive  clauses of the Covenant.   Thereare some nations, like the United States, who are deterred by these clauses becausethey are afraid that they will entangle them in European wars. There are others,like Germany and Japan, who regard them as the buttress of a status quo which       [13500]                .                                     B 3
they are not prepared to accept.   If the objections of these nations  are to beremoved, this can be done in one way only :  that is, temporarily at least, to cutout of the Covenant all its coercive provisions.   Then, at some future date, whenthe League was approximately universal, it might take to itself coercive powers which,  under  such circumstances, would be  really  effective.  The  essentialfoundation for effective  collective&apos;  action would have been laid.  It can almost certainly be laid in no other way.                                          -:&apos;-:)    It may be  urged that  a League shorn of its coercive powers would fulfil no useful purpose. This is not so.  The meetings of Foreign Ministers at regular intervals to discuss international problems would remain of inestimable value,and could well  become an essential cog in the machinery of international affairs.We have already the example of the Imperial Conference, the consultative centralorganism of a confederation.  This experiment has proved its value.  Why should it not be extended ?  A consultative League  would be the central organism of a world confederation of States, the  moral authority of which, by the very fact ofits universal nature, would be in some ways far greater than that of the presentLeague.    If the Powers  were  free to speak and to act at Geneva, as they thought fit,without the restraint imposed by an obligation to apply sanctions, their wordsmight carry greater weight than  at  present.  Any Power which  flouted world opinion would  be faced at  any rate with the risk of action against her.  Plainspeech at Geneva would be more likely if it were not restrained by the cautionwhich accompanies commitments.    There are  dangers in every course.  But at any rate, by seeking to recreateuniversality, we should be  making  a move in the right direction.  We  should beattempting to rebuild the collective system on what is in reality the only securefoundation. Surely that is wiser than to try to shore up a tottering fabric which,after  the shocks of  the last year, will  afford no protection to anyone and can onlybe a source of danger to those who  trust to it.                                     II.Alternative Proposal for Disposing of Article 10.    Another view is that, while anything beyond a consultative League is likelyto prove an unreal safeguard so far as our interests are concerned,  and that, onthe other hand, it may always expose us to the same risks as those we have justincurred, an open initiative by  us  in favour of a  consultative  League  mightaggravate the dangers of the situation in Central Europe and produce action byGermany for which we should, in such circumstances, be blamed.    It is therefore suggested that consideration should be given to the possibilityof the limitation of any initiative by us to a statement in the following sense.    The practical application of article 16 in the  Abyssinian dispute has not beenthat envisaged by the signatories of the Covenant.  Economic and financialsanctions did not have the expected effect, and there was a disinclination on thepart of many Powers to consent to their effective application in view of the risk that war might result.  Moreover, while promising us their military support insuch circumstances, even the Powers principally  affected were not, for technical reasons,  in a position to give any  immediate support  of this kind.  In  thesecircumstances, the effect on our relations with Italy was particularly grave, aswe for a number of reasons had been obliged to take the lead in the League action.We cannot allow  ourselves  to be exposed to  such reactions in the  future.  Wetherefore propose a reconsideration by  the League of the repressive clauses of theCovenant,  designed to discover means by which  these results can be avoided inthe future.  Pending the result of that reconsideration, and until we are satisfiedthat arrangements can be made to secure the working of the repressive clauses inthe manner in which they were conceived, we must make all reserves as  to themanner in which we ourselves will execute them.    It would be improbable that any  agreement would, in fact, be  forthcomingas a result of this enquiry, and it might therefore be hoped that without any openinitiative by us we should  have reduced  the functions of the League to those of.consultation.
 Compromise Proposal (1).     The proposals made in sections.I and II above contemplate that article: 16 of the Covenant should be either deleted or placed in cold storage.  The proposals that follow in sections III, IV  and V&apos;are based on the alternative  assumption that article 16 will be retained, but that its manner of application will be revised.     The following proposal is  based generally,  though with variations, upon a memorandum  submitted  by  M.  de Madariaga for the  consideration of  the Governments of the so-called ex-neutral countries.     It is designed not so much to perfect the Covenant as a legal instrument as to find a practical way of making it more effective in political conditions as they exist to day.                                            &apos;     It seeks to avoid, if possible, any amendment of the Covenant, for the reasons that the process of amendment might destroy the balance  of the Covenant as a whole; that the procedure of ratification is so complicated that the early coming into force of an amended Covenant could not be hoped for;  and that there might be some advantage in preserving the Covenant intact to serve as an objective towards which the future development of the League should be directed/   .  ;..     It starts  from  the obvious  facts that the  lack of  universality makes  the complete application of article 16 impossible; and that  this,  together with the non-execution  of other articles of the Covenant, in particular article 8, might make the application of article 16 in certain cases a matter of extreme embarrass- ment,  if not of grave danger, to some if not all members of  the League.   The Covenant can  hardly function satisfactorily  until the League is universal and until political  circumstances allow of the equal application of all its articles.     In these circumstances  the following suggestions are made :-     (1) Members  of  the League would be  within their  rights in making  a reservation in regard to their obligations under  article 16 so long as the League is not  universal, and so long as political circumstances  do not allow the  strict application of article 8.  Members  of the League would thus reserve the  right not to  apply article 16 in the conditions defined above.   It might not be necessary for a similar reservation to be made in  regard to the obligation in article  10 to preserve the territorial integrity and political independence of members of  the League, because by  article  10 it is for the  Council to advise on the means by which this obligation should be  fulfilled, and the Council would,  in the circum- stances now postulated, take existing  political conditions into account; and because there is good authority  for the view that the  procedure  to be followed in the application of article  10  in  the event of a war of  aggression should  in practice be that of article 16 itself.   But the obligations of article 10, whatever they may be, would have to be interpreted in  the light of this  reservation in the case of the members of the League who made it.     (2) Members of the League having thus freed themselves from  their general obligation  under  article 16 to  take  economic and  financial   action,  or  (in appropriate circumstances)  military action, it would be open to them! to reassumethe full and complete obligations of article 16, economic, financial and military!, in respect  of  political or  geographical  regions clearly  defined  by themselves, within the sphere of their  own  direct political or geographical  interests.   As : the application of economic and  financial pressure alone on a regional basis canobviously not be effective, the object of this provision would be the organisation&quot;of military action within the framework of  the Covenant.   When States had made declarations as  to the  regions or the circumstances in respect of which theywould  be prepared to take military  action under article 16, it  might be possibleto co-ordinate those declarations in the form of regional political understandings for effective mutual assistance.     (3) In a case where States which had made such declarations  as are contem- plated in (2) above were engaged in war against the Covenant-breaking State, the position of the members of the League who had made no such declarations req uires- consideration.; It would presumably be .open to any of them,: while abstaining from military action,  to apply economic and financial pressure under article 16 if they saw fit to do  so.   But  if they did not, what is their position to be?   One solution would be for them to fall into the position of pre-war neutrality, so that they would be - entitled to&apos;  continue commercial - and  other relations with the Covenant-breaking State except in so far as they could be  prevented under the
 old rules of war and neutrality.  But a situation in which members of the League were busily engaged in assisting the Covenant-breaking State by supplying him with everything of which he was in need, except in so far as this could be prevented under the rights of belligerents, would  be quite inconsistent with the  &quot; spirit of the Covenant,&quot; and it may indeed be doubted whether the League could survive such a situation.   A solution for which there may be something to be said and which would not seem to be opposed to the interests of this country would be that, while these members of the League were under no obligation to sever any relations with the Covenant-breaking  State, they would have no right, as against the members of the League which had gone to war with that State under article 16, to continue commercial and financial relations with it, and would therefore not be entitled to object on treaty or similar grounds to measures which those members of the League found it necessary to take to prevent the Covenant-breaking State^ from being assisted in this way.  They could not, for instance, object to measures such as  embargoes  or  rationing, which were  adopted  to prevent them from becoming sources or channels of supply to the Covenant-breaking State,  on the ground that the measures involved violations of  their  commercial treaties,  or (though this is not a point that we should want to emphasise) claim that measures taken at sea went beyond the old rules of  belligerency and neutrality.  Another point which  we should not want to emphasise, but   which  is  not  without importance, is that they would be unable to present a large claim for compensation against other League States engaged in imposing a blockade  against  a  declared aggressor.   The question,  however, is one which obviously  requires careful consideration.     (4) One possible variation in the foregoing proposals has been suggested.  It is for consideration whether the general reservation referred to in (1) above should not be made subject to one exception.  It  might be agreed that in the  event of military action being taken against an aggressor in accordance with the Covenant,whether  in virtue of a regional  agreement or directly  under article 16 itself, all members of the League should concert to apply at least  some means of pressure- such, for example, as an embargo on arms and on loans and credits.     In addition to these proposals  relating to the repressive functions of the- League, there is a further suggestion which concerns its  preventive functions :-      (5) Some  improvement  in  the working  of  article  11   is desirable.  In particular, means might be found, short of an amendment of the Covenant, to secure that the adoption by the Council under article  11  of measures for the preservation of peace in advance of an outbreak such, for  example, as an arms embargo, would not, as at present, be blocked by the votes of the parties and, in particular, by the vote of a State which is obviously contemplating aggression.     (6) There  remains the question of the procedure  by  which  the measures- proposed above could be put into effect.  They could probably be achieved without any amendment of the Covenant.  M. de Madariaga&apos;s own suggestion is that any State or group of  States  that wished  to  do so might,  by means  of  a written declaration registered with  the Secretary-General of  the League,  adopt the proposals outlined above;  a  joint declaration made by a group of States  would naturally have greater authority.  There would be some advantage in securing- simultaneous action in this sense by as  many members of the League as possible, though in  order to achieve this,  a  considerable effort  of  negotiation and co-ordination  would be required.  Alternatively, the procedure might be, as  in 1921, to proceed by resolution of the Assembly.     There are two further steps which it  might be desirable to take,  though in this case some amendment of the Covenant would be required.   These are :       (7) The separation  of the  Covenant  from the Treaty of Versailles. For this purpose certain minor amendments in the  Covenant would have to be made, and once these had  come  into  force  the  Assembly  would  adopt the revised Covenant as a separate instrument independent of the Peace Treaties.     (8) A provision designed to secure  that in future it  could not be maintained that the vote of a Covenant-breaking State can block  any action of the Council or the Assembly as such in connexion with the operation of article 16.   It was - this  situation that made  the   constitution  of  the  Co-ordination  Committee.necessary; otherwise, the Council or the Assembly itself could have organised. sanctions.
    Finally, in order to widen the scope of the discussions and to contribute somepositive  element  to  the proceedings,  His Majesty&apos;s  Government might make proposals                        .   ,    (9) For the consideration by the  Assembly under article 19  of one of thetreaty provisions which has become inapplicable,  or one of  the &quot; internationalconditions,  whose  continuance   might  endanger  the  peace  of   the  world &quot;(e.g., perhaps, the situation in  the Free City of Danzig).    (10) For  the study and solution of some of  the  economic  problems  whichcontribute, if they do not wholly give, rise, to the present political tension.                                    IV.     .Compromise Proposal (2).    If it is thought undesirable, as a matter of law, to make a general reservationin regard to article 16, as proposed in Section III above, the following alternative scheme is suggested :     (1) In the event of a resort  to  war which  brings article 16 into  force, all members of the League would immediately take steps  to prohibit     (a) The, supply and transit of arms and munitions of war;  and    (b) The &quot;grant  of  loans or credit facilities to the aggressor  or  Covenant-           breaking  State.    So long as article 16 remains in being, members of the League could hardlydo less than apply these measures, which are similar to  those which the UnitedStates of America applied against both belligerents in  the Italo-Abyssinian war.It is hardly conceivable that members of the League could  continue to supply armsand money to  a declared aggressor.    These measures  alone would not, of course, be  an effective means of pressure,but they would at least be a manifestation of solidarity with the  victim, and apractical condemnation of the aggressor.    (2) The  members  of  the  League  would then consult together in order  todecide what, if any,  further economic and financial measures it would be possible and  appropriate  to  take under  article 16 (1), in the  special conditions of theparticular case that had  arisen, and  in the political and other  circumstancesruling at the  time.   It might be found possible to apply most  of the measures for which article 16 (1) provides;  or it might be found undesirable to pass beyondthe two primary measures mentioned above.   The Assembly might perhaps, in itsresolution embodying such a scheme, express  the opinion  that a case where othermembers of the League had intervened by force of arms in support of the victimwould be one in  which it would be incumbent  upon the other  members of theLeague to  apply a maximum rather than a minimum  of economic and financialpressure to the aggressor.    This  scheme  could be  accompanied by the other suggestions  made  inSection III, namely       (1)  Improvement in the working of article 11;     (2)  Separation of the Covenant from the Treaty of Versailles;     (3)  Exclusion of the vote  of  the Covenant-breaking State in connexion withthe operation of article 16;     (4)  Consideration by the Assembly of some caseunder article 19;     (5)  Study of economic questions.                                     V.The French Plan.    The provisional views of the  French Government on League reform, as semi-officially communicated by the French Ambasador on the 22nd June, have certainaffinities with the proposals outlined in Sections III and IV above, though theydiffer from them in some important respects.    The French  Government  consider that any amendment  of the Covenant  is out of the  question, and that such changes in its application as may be necessarycan be made by resolution of the Assembly, as in  1921.  They think  that attention should be  confined to the articles relating  to preventive and repressive  action(articles 11 and 1.6).
     As regards article 11, they suggest that a new interpretation is necessary, onthe ground that,  as at present interpreted, it obliges the Council (when a threat of war exists arid when the League has the duty of taking  &quot; any action that maybe deemed wise  and effectual to safeguard  the peace of  nations &quot;) to act by unanimous vote, including the vote of the representative of that State which maybe threatening the peace of the world.     As regards article 16, while they deprecate, as likely to be misleading, the drawing of any general conclusions from the experience of the Abyssinian affair,they think that it is now clearly established that recourse to progressive economicaction alone for the  purpose of stopping a war that has already begun will notavail.  What is required in such an event is &quot;as rapid an application as possible of the entire means at the disposal of the international community.&quot;     As this ideal is  not attainable in practice, they suggest the following as the nearest approach to the ideal that is likely to be attained :       (1) As an  unconditional engagement by  all members of the League to makewar  in all circumstances against an aggressor is out of the question,  &quot; measuresof military  assistance should be regionalized on a  fairly wide basis,  and theyshould be accompanied by  the  general  application of  economic and financialsanctions.&quot;     (2) While  it  is essential  to preserve this  general obligation to all members ofthe League to take economic  and financial action against an aggressor, it mightbe agreed that the general obligation to apply economic and  financial  sanctionsshould be conditional upon  the  operation of regional military assistance.  Themilitary action of a group of Powers, acting  as the result of the deliberations ofthe Council of the League, would be supported by collective ^economic action.     (3) Arrangements of this  kind  might considerably  reinforce  european security, but only on condition that no Great Power definitely stated  in advance that  in no circumstances would it intervene actively in a possible future conflict,even though it  might not be prepared to  bind itself in advance to the promise ofmilitary assistance.  (In other words,  although His Majesty&apos;s Government maynot be prepared to make  a declaration in advance that they  will take up  armsagainst an aggressor in regions over and above (say) the Locarno area and theEastern Mediterranean, they ought not to make the converse declaration  that inno circumstances  will they take up  arms  in areas other than the two mentioned.)-
