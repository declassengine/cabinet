Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1936.SECRET.                                                         Copy  No.CP. 225 (36).CABINET.PALESTINE SITUATION.            Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.     I CIRCULATE with  this  memorandum,  for  the  consideration of  my colleagues      (1) A  despatch  from the  High  Commissioner,  dated the 22nd August,           containing his  appreciation  of  the  present situation in  Palestine,           together with his  recommendations (Appendix I);     (2) A memorandum by the Air Officer Commanding on the military situation           in Palestine and Transjordan (Appendix II);     (3) The High Commissioner^ comments upon Air Vice-Marshal Peirse&apos;s           memorandum in Appendix II (Appendix III); and     (4) A memorandum by  the High  Commissioner  giving  his views on  the           strength of the Arab  national spirit in Palestine (Appendix IV).     As will be seen, so far from  the situation showing any signs of improvement, there are indications that it may seriously deteriorate, unless some political action is taken which will bring about a change of spirit in the Arab  leaders and their supporters.     Owing  to the danger  of an  increased number of acts of retaliation  and consequent higher feeling which may be aroused between the  Arab and Jewish communities, the High Commissioner, with the concurrence of the Air Officer Commanding, has asked that  an additional infantry battalion,  preferably at full Colonial  strength, may be despatched to Palestine with the least possible delay. In making this request, the High Commissioner stated that it was his duty to add that should the situation further deteriorate it might be necessary for him to ask for a third brigade of three battalions, including the battalion referred to above, and that  the Air Officer Commanding  in Palestine,  Air Vice-Marshal Peirse, concurred in this view. After consultations between the Air Ministry and the War  Office the High Commissioner and the Air Officer Commanding have been informed  that arrangements have been made for a battalion of the King&apos;s  Own Scottish Borderers, at present at Malta, which is &quot;about 550 in strength, to be sent to Palestine, where it  should arrive by  the  30th August.   They have  also  been informed that if a third infantry  brigade is required it must be  sent from this country, and that a decision of the Cabinet will be required beforehand; that there is no battalion available in this country at Colonial strength, but that, subject to Cabinet approval, three weak battalions could be  sent,  which, together with the battalion of the King&apos;s Own  Scottish  Borderers, could be made up into a four- battalion brigade.    In his despatch of the 22nd August the High Commissioner sets out and discusses  what he regards as the only three possible courses of action betweenwhich it is open to His Majesty&apos;s Government to choose :     (1) The continuance of our present policy on its present lines and methods of          action.    This, both Sir Arthur Wauchope and Air Vice-Marshal Peirse agree, holdsout no prospect of speedy success in the restoration of order.
  .   (2)  The second possible course  is the granting of concessions  to the Arabs,          : but. &apos;&apos; not , ... ;..,. of such  a nature as to give the impression of yielding           in face of violence and disorder which we have been unable otherwise           to end.&quot;     (3)  The third course would involve a  complete departure from the present           moderate measures  adopted,  and recourse  to much  more  violent           measures designed to subdue lawlessness in the shortest space of time.           By this is meant ruthless action,  including the bombing of villages and           towns,  after due notice to the inhabitants,  and the imposition of           Martial Law over at least a large part of the country.     To carry out this third course,  it would be necessary, in the opinion  of the Air Officer  Commanding,  for  the garrison to be greatly increased, namely, by three, or possibly six, Infantry Battalions and ancillary troops (see paragraphs 18 to 20 of Appendix II) as well as two Royal  Air Force Squadrons to carry out the air action contemplated (see paragraph 11 of Appendix II).     The High Commissioner gives what I think must be accepted as very strong reasons for not adopting  course (3) except in the last resort; and in view of the improbability of satisfactory progress being made with the present  moderate measures of suppression alone, he recommends the adoption of the second course, viz., the granting of some concession with a view to bringing about a cessation of disorder at an early date.  As will be seen from Section V (B) of Appendix I, Sir Arthur &quot;Wauchope suggests that he should, in the first place, endeavour, without compromise- economising himself or His Majesty&apos;s Government, to ascertain the views of  a few of the Arab leaders, with a view to securing agreement on the following lines :      (1) A declaration  from Arab  leaders  calling on all people to cease from          methods of violence and lawlessness.     (2) Suspension of  immigration till after His Majesty&apos;s Government have           announced  their  decisions  on the recommendations of  the  Royal           Commission.     (3) Acts  of  clemency  to those  guilty  of offences other  than  violence and          promise of immunity from  arrest to  Arabs possibly connected with          the present disturbances, but not at present under arrest nor proved          guilty  of any definite criminal act.     He submits  that if the leaders were to make a public  appeal to end disorder and  this  appeal  were followed by  a  marked diminution of attacks, it is  for consideration whether it would not be  wise  to make a concession at this moment when its granting would be of  influence, rather  than later when it could have no effect on  events.     The High Commissioner&apos;s proposal clearly would involve a complete reversal of previous Cabinet decisions and of the statements made by me in Parliament in June and July  based on  those decisions,  more  particularly in regard  to  the suspension of immigration.  I  may recall  that  I raised this  question  in  the memorandum which I circulated to the Cabinet on the 4th July, 1936 (CP. 190 (36)).  When  the matter was discussed at the meeting on the 9th July decision was  reserved  pending my further  consultation with the High Commissioner, particularly as to  the time when the announcement  should be made,  if a decision in favour of  the  suspension of immigration should be taken.   Sir  Andrew Wauchope expressed the view that to announce such suspension at the same time as the  terms of  reference  and composition of  the  Royal  Commission would be looked upon in  Palestine  as a surrender to violence,  and for that reason he strongly  recommended &quot;that  the announcement  of  suspension  of  immigration should be deferred until law and order were restored. &apos; As a result of further consideration  by the Cabinet on the  15th  July  it was decided that it  shouldfoe announced  that the Government  could make no statement  as to their  future intentions with regard to this question until order had been restored. -     It was  originally contemplated that a statement  to this  effect should bemade in  connection with  the  announcement which  I made in the House of Commons on the  29th July  of  the  composition and terms of reference of the Royal Commission.  It was, however, found more convenient to make this statement in reply to a  question by Mr. David Adams on the 22nd July  whenhe asked me whether I would assure the  House that no change in  the-declared
policy of the Government with regard to the immigration of Jews into palestine would take place until after the Royal Commission had reported.  My reply toMr. Adams was as follows :.....         &quot; As I informed the House on the 19th June, His Majesty&apos;s Government    can contemplate no change of policy whatsoever with regard to Palestine    until they have received and considered the report of the Royal Commission.    As  regards, however, the suggestion that  there  should be a  temporary    suspension of immigration while the commission is carrying out its enquiry,    I am not at present in a position  to make any statement as to the intentions    of His  Majesty&apos;s  Government beyond  saying that their decision  will  be    taken in due course on the merits of the case, and that there is no question    of its being influenced by violence or attempts at intimidation.&quot;    The possibility  that  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government may  decide  to suspendimmigration during the inquiry by  the  Royal  Commission has already&quot;  been widely canvassed in Jewish circles and has resulted in a great number of strongly-worded  protests  representative of a  considerable body  of influential  Jewishopinion  both in this country, America and elsewhere.                ,    ,    There is no doubt that if His Majesty&apos;s  Government were to decide to adoptthe High Commissioner^ present  recommendations,  and  suspension of immi-gration  resulted^ they would be charged, with some reason; with breaking theirword to the Jews and with pusillanimous surrender to crime and violence;  Everyeffort  would be made by the Jews, not only  in this country,  but in  the UnitedStates, South  Africa and various parts  of the  Continent,  to  arouse  adversecriticism against the British Government and an extremely hostile receptionmust be  expected from all parties  in  Parliament friendly to the Jews  as  soonas it reassembles.    On  the other hand, it is difficult to see any alternative course, which is not open to equally grave objections,  and I feel that the Government wouid  beincurring serious responsibility in  rejecting  the considered recommendations ofthe High Commissioner, whose experience and knowledge  of local conditions isindisputable and in whose judgment I and my predecessors have  always reposedgreat  confidence.  I therefore, but with the greatest reluctance,  recommend tomy colleagues that the adoption of the second  course discussed in Sir arthur wauchope&apos;s despatch should be very seriously considered  before it is rejected.    I should make it clear  that the adoption of his proposals must necessarily be something of a gamble.  There can be no absolute certainty that the Arabreaction would be as favourable as is hoped.    In order to get a  clear idea as to what would be involved in a temporary suspension  of all permanent immigration into Palestine,  I have consulted theHigh  Commissioner and  have obtained from him a considered statement, thesubstance of which is briefly as follows.    If the decision to suspend immigration were to mean merely that no furtherauthorities for permanent immigration should be granted after an assigned date,it is clear that the effect  in practice  would be the continuance of immigrationover a period of several months, but  at a reduced rate.  For example, if no furtherauthorities for immigration were issued between the 1st  October and the  31stDecember next, and if persons authorised before the 1st October to enter Palestineas immigrants were permitted to immigrate after that date, it is  estimated that,including heads of families  and their dependants,  something like  12,000  newarrivals would enter Palestine during the three months in question.  Of these,over 7,000 would be dependants of immigrants who have entered or have existingpermits  for entering under the  various  categories.  I  think it is  clear  thatsuspension with such a result would serve no useful purpose.  The Jews wouldbe certain to protest strongly against  any decision to suspend immigration, andthe extent to which the normal flow  of immigrants had thereby been reducedwould probably be considerably exaggerated.  On the other hand, the Arabs would see a continuance of the flow  of immigration despite the decision in favour of suspension, and would  regard  this as  evidence of the inability of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to withstand Jewish pressure.    It is difficult, therefore, to escape the conclusion  that either the proposalfor the suspension of immigration must be abandoned altogether, which action,in view of the publicity which has been given by the Jews to the suggestion that
there should be a  suspension, would be regarded by the Arabs as  a furtherindication of Jewish influence upon British policy; or that, despite the hardshipswhich would be involved,  the suspension should be  applied drastically; that isto say,  that not only should no further authorities  for permanent immigrationbe issued  after an assigned date, but also no further  arrivals in Palestine shouldbe admitted, after  the assigned  date, of immigrants granted  authorities priorto that date, except in the case of immigrants actually at sea or on an over-landjourney to Palestine at the assigned date. The High  Commissioner feels strongly that any exceptions to the complete suspension of immigration should be as fewas possible, as a decision  to this  effect  would equalise the inevitable hardshipsover the whole Jewish community.     I  feel that there is a  good deal  of  force in the High Commissioners view as to the scope of suspension.  At the same time I think that there is one otherexception which might reasonably be made,  viz., the dependants of those who arealready actually  residents in Palestine.   It is  estimated that,  if  these wereexcepted  from the  suggested prohibition, about 3,200 persons in this categorymight  be  expected  to enter  Palestine  between  the  1st October  and  the31st December next.     It  is  obvious that the longer notice that it is possible to  give of the  date from which immigration will be suspended, the smaller will be the number of casesof hardship which  will be  created.  It would seem, therefore, desirable that, onthe assumption that it would still be  possible for the Royal Commission to leave for Palestine in the early part of  October and that suspension should take effect as  from  the  1st  October,  the   decision  to suspend  immigration should be announced as long  as possible before that date.  If, therefore, an attempt is tobe made to  carry out  the  High Commissioner^ programme, I  consider that heshould be  authorised to endeavour to secure, without delay, the declaration whichhe suggests should be made  by the Arab leaders calling for the cessation of violence,with a view to the  announcement shortly afterwards of the decision  to suspendtemporarily all permanent  immigration into Palestine  with effect  from  thebeginning of October.

 Secret Despatch from the High Commissioner for Palestine to  the Secretary of                            State for the Colonies. (Secret.) Sir,                                                       August 22, 1936.     THE disturbances in Palestine have now lasted over four months.  During this period some 65 Jews have been killed, some 9 soldiers and airmen killed and 71 wounded, and some 8  police killed and 88 wounded.   The communications of the country are still constantly being seriously damaged, intimidation is rife, and trade is hampered  in every direction.  At the  same time  the  rebel forces  are stronger and  their  determination seems  greater  despite the  large number, estimated at nearly 900, of their ranks who have been killed and wounded.    The supply of money and arms seems to have increased rather than diminished.     The armed bands have not been destroyed or forced to inaction as I had hoped by military action,  and the number of individual acts of murder  and terrorism have greatly increased.     The Arab  leaders now find themselves in the  position in which  retreat is impossible because they cannot control the extremist element unless they have some concession to offer  to  their followers, which they consider would alone form a bridge to the ending of disturbances.     II.  The additional troops you have been good enough to send have hitherto served to prevent any attacks on a large scale being launched against  the Jews, and have prevented the country falling into a state of chaos.   But in spite  of every  effort, constant hard work and zeal shown  by  Commanders and men, these troops have failed to restore order, and there are no signs of this end being within sight.     On the contrary, were  Arab officials to join in the  general strike, were the Mufti to raise the religious cry and close the Mosques,  or were armed bands  to enter  Palestine from Syria or Trans-Jordan, the situation would become much more serious than it is even to-day.     The success of the Egyptian negotiations which started after the  disorders in Cairo, encourages Arabs to continue resistance till some concession is granted.     If negotiations succeed in  Syria  no one doubts that many men with arms will come from  Syria to join our armed  bands.     III. It is therefore time to review the  situation and to decide on our future policy.     IV.  Our immediate  aim is clear, the maintenance  of British prestige and early restoration of law and order.  But as you stated on the 10th June, 1936, this is not  our only aim.   It is also our aim  to achieve some  settlement that will not leave an embittered,  sullen, and in their hearts, rebellious Arab population, ready to rebel in any future year.    Now if we establish law and order only through the employment of what may be termed drastic air and military action, we may achieve the first aim but will certainly endanger if we do not ruin the chances of success for our second aim. It is this patent fact which has so greatly increased my  difficulties and those of Air Vice-Marshal Peirse during the last  three months.    V.  As I  view the situation, there are three  alternatives, each of which suffers from grave drawbacks, but one of which must be adopted and pursued.&apos;(A) The continuance of our present policy  on its present lines and methods  of         action.    I  have stated above and the Air Vice-Marshal agrees that this policy holds out no prospect of speedy success in achieving our  aim of restoring order.  Troops under  our present methods can achieve no more than they are now. doing.    It is true that in all struggles the opponent may be labouring under greater difficulties than are  patent, difficulties which in  this instance might cause the strike  to peter  out and resistance  to cease.   Or some outside factor such as the intervention of  the Arab  kings  might at least split the  combined opposition  to Government forces.  Nuri Pasha is now  here as my guest, and assures  me he is telling the Palestinian Arabs they must end their present resistance.  I  hope the leaders will pay  heed to his advice,  but in  this appreciation I must deal with facts:as they are and not as I wish them to be.APPENDIX 1.
     In  Appendix  I,  I  enclose   an  Appreciation   of   the   situation  byA ir Vice-Marshal Peirse.     In Appendix II,  X have expressed my  views on the strength of the Arabnational spirit in Palestine.  I may say here I consider the forces  of  disorderhave grown  stronger and the national  spirit is  even more determined than amonth ago.(B)  The second alternative is the granting of  some concession to people with whom         it is most important we should live on friendly terms in future years, but         not granting  a concession of such a nature as to give the  impression of         yielding in face of violence and disorder which we have been unable         otherwise to end.    - Were a policy of  moderate concession adopted,  it is  hard  to say whatconcessions would be necessary to ensure the  ending of methods of Violence.  the concessions would have to meet with the approval of the extremists, otherwise Ido not believe that methods of violence would be ended.  The extremists are made up  of the Shabab or Young Men Party and  the Istiqlal Party led by Auni BeyAbdul Hadi.  I do not believe the Mufti will have the courage to  oppose in the open the demands of this party.   What  action he rriay take behind the scenes ishard to foretell.  There are many factors that weigh with that  astute mind, butperhaps his chief fear is to be left alone in the open, liable to be accused by friendand foe of treachery to the Arab cause.  We can expect  little backing from that quarter.     Auni Bey has written to me saying,  in effect, that the Arab leaders might beprepared to  call off the strike and  disorders if they could be assured that therestoration of order would be followed by the complete stoppage of immigration.     I have consistently refrained from discussing any concessions, because I knowany such discussion would be looked on as a  sign of weakness and proclaimed asan  argument that His Majesty&apos;s Government was weakening  and methods  of violence winning.  But without compromising myself or  His  Majesty&apos;s  Govern-ment, I believe I can ascertain the views of a few leaders besides Auni Bey.  Ifyou approved I would endeavour to secure agreement on the following lines :--         A declaration from Arab  leaders calling on all people to  cease from     methods of violence and lawlessness.         Suspension of immigration till after His Majesty&apos;s Government have     announced their decisions on the recommendations of the Royal Commission.         Acts of clemency to those  guilty of offences other  than  violence and     promise of immunity from arrest to Arabs possibly connected with the present     disturbances, but not at present under arrest nor proved guilty of any definite     criminal act.     It will be remembered that Arabs having lost faith in British promises, and being especially embittered at this  juncture, will demand deeds rather thanpromises.   Also the power of the leaders to restore order may not prove fully effective till His Majesty&apos;s Government have made some response to their declara-tion.  Consequently, the two suggestions  outlined above would have to be yieldedbefore order  had been  completely restored, but not before the leaders had made their declaration public, urging the cessation of the strike and acts of lawlessness.     It has been conveyed to me that certain leaders say they believe in any promisemade personally by me, and suggest the following course :       (i)  A public declaration by Arab leaders  that methods  of violence should           cease and armed bands should end their activities.     (ii)  Within  one  week a public declaration simultaneously  made  by the           Secretary of State in London and the  High Commissioner in Palestine           that immigration will be suspended.   No term to the  period to be           mentioned.     (iii)  The leaders  would desire  the  suspension to  start  from  the date of           declaration.     (iv)  The announcement of some  moderate measures of clemency in respect of           persons not  actually convicted of offences.     I have throughout  been of opinion that no concession should be made  till lawand order has been restored.  But I submit it is a matter for your consideration
whether, if the leaders were to make a public appeal to end/disorder, and this appeal were followed by a marked diminution of attacks, it would not be wise tomake a concession at this moment when its granting would be of influence, ratherthan later when it could have no effect on events.  I must add that many officials and nearly all residents who have been a long time in Palestine are of opinionthat in face of the growth  of the Arab national  spirit, some concession is theonly course open to us by which we can  attain the  two  objects mentioned inparagraph IV.   .    It is further argued that the weariness and economic losses are so widespreadthat a small concession would now  serve to bring disorder  to an end; but thetemper of the people is  such that without  some concession there can be  nocombined effort  to end disorder.(C) The third alternative, as explained by Air Vice-Marshal Peirse, &quot;means a         complete, departure  from  our present  moderate  measures  to  those         designed to subdue lawlessness in the shortest space of time.&apos;.&apos;    These measures would include intensive bombing on villages or towns suchas Nablus, the inhabitants being  warned previously to evacuate their homes.    The application of martial law  either  to certain districts or  the  whole country.    These and some subsidiary measures would, he considers,  &apos;! cow the countryand cause the quick subjection of the fellaheen.&quot;  In conversation, the Air Vice-Marshal told me he considers this can be  done with little  loss  of life, andsubjection of certain villages would not cause serious  risings elsewhere.    I  regret to say I disagree with this  opinion.  I fear resistance would be considerable and loss of life large.   Certainly before adopting such measures,we must be prepared to meet a situation of general revolt were this to materialise.    I  note that Air  Vice-Marshal Peirse in his Appreciation suggests that  weshould require under certain  circumstances an addition of six infantry battalions and the ancillary troops set out in paragraph 18 of  his Appreciation, as well astwo Royal Air Force squadrons before starting to bring about the quick subjectionof the people by  bombing and other drastic methods, exclusive of an additionalinfantry brigade to maintain order in Trans Jordan.    There are other difficulties in the application of this method  of intensivefighting.  At present the fact  that  chiefly prevents punitive measures, such asheavy collective fines or destruction of houses,  is lack of evidence of guilt againstdefinite individuals or definite villages.   By employing this intensive method  weshall  make many more innocent  people  suffer all the more  severely,  and by so doing greatly intensify the already bitter feeling  in town  and country.    Apart from the future results of such a policy we must therefore  also considerits immediate effects.  For  example, the inhabitants of a village  say, of  600inhabitants are ordered to evacuate before their village is bombed  from the airas Air Vice-Marshal Peirse  suggests in his Appreciation.  Roughly, half these will be children and 150 will be women; what provision will Government have tomake for  dieir maintenance and housing during the winter?  Roughly, 150 willbe men.  Homeless, will these become peaceful citizens or join armed bands?    It is obvious the bombing of a  single village  will not restore order; nor isbombing calculated to bring back armed men from the hills to the labour of tillageand husbandry.    As I have only to-day received Air Vice-Marshal Peirse&apos;s Appreciation, I-cannot  discuss  it  in detail, but I may say I  am in  full  agreement with paragraph 17 and paragraph 21.    In my Private and Personal telegram of the  18th May  I said  I consideredthe deportation of the Mufti and other leaders might become necessary.  HithertoI have considered the disadvantages outweigh the gains.    But if we are  forced to adopt  action as outlined in the last paragraph ofthis  despatch, then  I think  it likely that deportation of  the Mufti  and other leaders will be necessary.    VI.   Summing  up, I have always considered  our present policy to be thebest if not  the  only  policy calculated  to  secure  the  two  aims defined  inparagraph IV of this despatch.   But as the present methods have not succeeded in restoring order during the last four months, and as acts of violence are growingmore widespread and brutal  reprisals more frequent, I consider some change ofpolicy is now called for.
whether, if the.leaders were to make a public appeal to end. disorder, and  this appeal were followed by a marked diminution of attacks, it would not be wise tomake a concession at this moment when its granting would be of influence,, ratherthan later when it could have no effect on events.

     1 consider the policy of &apos;&apos; cowing the country&apos;&apos;  should be postponed till all other methods have failed, since such action will inevitably defeat our second aim. and is certain  to cause bitter  protests from all Arab  peoples and  probably throughout the Moslem world.     I do not advocate concessions to violence.  I do  suggest that  I should be authorised  by you to ascertain  what are the  minimum demands  of the Arab leaders.     I would  then refer these demands  to you, and if at  all possible we should accept them.  If they are not possible of acceptance, then I suggest I should be instructed to inform  the Arab leaders  clearly that  His Majesty&apos;s  Government will not accept their  proposals,  and if  the leaders do not at once actively and publicly do all they  can to end  violence, His Majesty&apos;s Government will  be compelled to employ air and ground troops with the one object of re-establishing order throughout  the country with the least delay possible, even  though this will cause great suffering to the people generally.     If we  are forced to adopt  this policy  with all its immediate  and lasting drawbacks then I think,  for reasons put forward  in Air Vice-Marshal Peirse&apos;s Appreciation, it were better that martial law be declared at least in the district of  Samaria, since it would be difficult for the Civil Administration to initiate the strong military repressive measures  that would be  necessary and better that it should be disassociated therefrom.                                          I have, &amp;c.                                                 A.  G.  WAUCHOPE,                                            High Commissioner for Palestine. The Right Hon. W. G. A.

Memorandum by the Air Officer Commanding on the Military Situation in                         Palestine and Trans Jordan.                                  Headquarters, British Forces in Palestine(Secret.)                                  and Transjordan,Your Excellency,                               /erusalem, A ugust 20, 1936.    I HAVE the honour to submit certain recommendations concerning military policy in this  country consequent upon  the  present  and  anticipated politicalsituation.Political and General  Situation.    2.  During the first week of August there was some  hope that the efforts of the Amir Abdullah  might have a moderating influence upon the  Arab higher committee in the cause of peace.  These  hopes have proved vain and it  is now clear that the Arab Higher Committee are unable or unwilling to moderate their course of action.    3.  I have already pointed  to the likelihood  that when the  effect  of  the armed bands was neutralised by military action the leaders would  change theirtactics.   This is borne  out by    (a) the recent determined and well organised effort to cause a general strike           in Haifa; particularly directed against the railways;    (6) increase of assassinations amongst British personnel of the armed forces,           Palestinian Police and Jews;  and    (c)  considerable increase in bomb attacks and sabotage.
 Forecast.     4.   The political leaders, finding themselves  in a position in  which retreat is impossible          (a) because- they cannot control the extremist element, and  .         (b) because no face saver has been provided by Government,  - appear to have no alternative but to follow in the wake of the extremist elements. Their  feeling is one of desperation; and they still seem to cherish the idea  that provided His Majesty&apos;s Government is sufficiently harassed by lawlessness,  they will eventually gain their ends.     Time is, however, important to them, and it is likely they will, either through sheer desperation or because the present season  is  most propitious to lawlessness, try to bring things to  a head in the near future.     5.   If my assumption in paragraph 4 is correct their method  is likely to be one directed to paralyse the country by stoppage of work on public services (e.g., railways),  general  strike  of industrial  employees,  strike or  defection of Palestinian Police and  Arab  Government officers  to  the  accompaniment of terrorist acts of  all sorts; including  assassination of British Government  and Military Officials.     There may,  in addition,  be  an  attempt   to raise  revolt in  Transjordan;. assistance from Syria  and the raising of the religious cry. Alternative Measures.     6.   This  stage of  affairs, if allowed  to continue,  will involve the whole country in chaos and calls for very different treatment than  that which has been possible  with the Armed Porces  in aid of the civil  power during  the  last 3-j months.     7.   We are therefore faced with a choice  of one of two alternatives (your Excellency&apos;s  telegram   to  the  Secretary of State dated the  3rd June, 1936, refers):      (a) settlement of immediate deadlock by negotiation; or     (6) introduction of martial law together with measures  designed to crush           Arab resistance.     8.  The  adoption  of alternative (a) is  now infinitely more difficult  than it was  three or even  one month ago.   It might take  the form of       (i)  The  immediate despatch of the. Royal  Commission coupled  with  a           statement  that immigration would cease during, its  deliberations           (possibly made by  the  Commission after arrival in the country); or     (ii)  An  announcement  that   immigration  would  be  suspended  un-           conditionally from the moment order was restored; or     (iii)  Other possible variations on the same  theme.Whichever it is, however, such a course can  only be interpreted as retreat.    9.   The adoption  of alternative (b) means  a complete departure from  ourpresent moderate measures in aid of the civil power to those designed to subduelawlessness in the  shortest space of time.    The  principle  I recommend is     (a) (i) Neutralisation  of strikes (when  they affect  public  services) by          employment  of  Jewish  labour   wherever  possible protected  and          reinforced as necessary by military personnel.               (ii) Protection  of  essential  communications  and  their main-          tenance.               (iii) Maintenance of law and order in Jerusalem and main towns          by military and British Police.               (iv) Protection  of  British and  foreign personnel and interests.          Protection of Jewish settlements.    (6) Coercive measures against towns and villages intimately connected with          formation and maintenance of armed bands and intimidation.
     10.  9 (a) (i) to (iv) to be undertaken by ground forces.          9 (b) to be undertaken by air action.     11.  Air measures  properly controlled  lead to enormous economy of  force, are discriminate and avoid unnecessary loss of life since they are only applied after due warning of evacuation.  They are a threat of sufficient power to induce compliance with the terms imposed (see paragraph 12).  Avoid the necessity for ground forces actually taking part in  the punitive action.     In short, if  air measures are used (and  some form of artillery fire and demolition is in any  event essential), two squadrons are likely to be able to  carry out all the &quot;striking&quot; action required whilst the ground forces maintain all essential services and give the necessary protection to  life and property.     12.  The  terms to  be  imposed and  method  to  be  adopted would be as follows :      (a) An initial warning that bombing would take place in twenty-four  hours           and that the  village or area was to be evacuated.               The warning would also add that bombing would be repeated in           48  hours  unless a  specified number of serviceable  rifles  had been           brought  in (or such other  terms as might be applicable  had been           complied  with).     (b) Precision bombing with  high explosive  would  be undertaken.   The           number of bombs to be dropped would depend on the size of the town           or village, the amount of damage considered necessary and target           selected, to obtain submission.     (c) Failure to comply would entail repetitions of the bombing after due           notice. General Plan.     13.  Without  going into  detail the  plan can be  considered  broadly as follows :       Consequent upon the circumstances within the country Martial Law  could be declared either in the worst area or areas or to include the whole country.     The initial area  for subjection would undoubtedly be Samaria, and since the ultimate vote  for peace or war  lies now with the fellaheen, their subjection  must be the primary object.     I  am  convinced  myself that action taken along the lines explained above, provided a good example was  made of Nablus and a  selected number of  other villages closely concerned with armed bands  and lawlessness, at the very outset, coupled with certain other and immediately-applied  measures referred to in paragraph 14 would cow the  country and  furnish adequate grounds for the abandonment  of general opposition.  Moreover, subjection would  be  obtained in the shortest possible time.     The prospects of revolt in Trans Jordan,  it is considered, are  lessened by the adoption of strong  punitive measures in this  country which  can  easily be applied to that country if necessary.     Inversely, contrary  to opinion which holds that drastic action may cause a general outburst elsewhere in the country, I am firmly of the opinion that if the initial action is adequately severe, opposition will not be evident elsewhere.  Nor will the religious cry be  effective.     14.  Other measures complementary to the military plan to be taken on the outset of Martial Law :       (a) Arrest and  deportation of the Mufti and other leaders  unlikely to be           required as Government intermediaries with country.     (&amp;) Imposition of censorship.     (c) Introduction in  towns  of  intensified searching of all Arab persons for           arms.     (d) Curfew and  other restrictive measures in towns.     (e) Prohibition of movement of Arabs on railways and  highways.     (/) Introduction of  forced labour by internees on essential roads.
 Estimate of Forces Required.      15.  The estimate of  forces required, to  implement  the  above plan  will depend       (a) on the general and political state of the country at the moment Martial            Law is declared, and      (b) consequent  upon  (a), the  likely  reaction  following  introduction of            Martial Law.      16.  If Martial Law was imposed to-day, or in circumstances akin to those existing  to-day, it is  likely that the  sudden change in policy  and immediate punitive and other coercive measures would  take the country by surprise  and break further opposition  with the minimum  of punitive action.   The ultimate effect cannot, however, be foreseen.  It might be one of general relief that the Government had compelled  abandonment  by force  majeure of,  to many,  an intolerable  situation;  or had forced an  issue in a situation which had become one of complete stalemate.   On  the other  hand, thwarted by force, the Arab reaction might be one of sullen passivity and withdrawal of all co-operation from Government.   This  latter  contingency  would  entail  (amongst  other  things probable boycott of the Royal Commission)  assumption by the Armed Forces of control and working the civil machinery necessary to maintain  the  life of the country.     Martial Law can  compel submission and abandonment of lawlessness.   It cannot, however, compel a sullen  people to work for an unpopular Government. Economic pressure may enforce this, but it  is  fair to assume a period when the services of Arab Government officials,  police,  judicature, municipal bodies, &amp;c, may  be withdrawn!.  Including also all Arab labour on essential services,  e.g., railways, ports, electrical generating services, water supplies, &amp;c.     17.   Considering 15 (a) and (b), it is clear that if Martial Law (or any strong- punitive and coercive policy) is imposed,  we have to estimate not  only the forces required to put that policy into effect at the time of imposition but the forces which may  be required afterwards to hold and maintain the country in  the circumstances envisaged in the foregoing paragraph.     18.   It will be easier to  consider the worst case first (Palestine only).     Assuming the  following :      (a) 100 per cent, withdrawal of all Arab police, officials and employees  in           Government Service and essential services.     (b) An increase  in active opposition with better organisation and control           and religious incentive.     (c) Absence of Naval support from Haifa other than  one &quot;D &quot; class cruiser.     (d) Replacement of not less than 60 per  cent. Arab labour by Jewish. And  directing particular attention to      (e) Maintenance of essential road communications.     (/) The port of Haifa.     (g) The I.PC. pipe-line and  installations.     (h) The Palestine  Electric Corporation installations.     (i) Certain other vulnerable civil installations,  factories and storage areas.          Jerusalem Water  Supply.     (j) Anti-intimidation  measures.     (k) Special provisions to deal with rioting, &amp;c, in urban areas.     (I) Protection of Jewish communities, &amp;c.,  in urban areas.    (m) Protection of Jewish colonies.     (n) Provision of local reserves and reliefs.Also, after assession in conjunction with the  Chief Secretary,  the  assistancerequired by Government Departments.   It is considered the following additionalforces will be required :     Two Brigade Headquarters.    Six Infantry battalions at full Colonial establishment, with unit M.T. and        two mortars each.    One field company, Royal Engineers.
     Seven n.c.o.&apos;s and 48 other ranks, Royal Corps of Signals.     Two Brigade Supply Depots.     One M.T. Company and 60 30-cwt. vehicles.     One M.T. Company of 100 30-cwt. vehicles to replace hired M.T. now in use.     One Ordnance mobile workshop  for repair of unit M.T.     Two hospitals, each with 120 beds.     Eight ambulance cars.     One Company, Royal Navy, for  Haifa Port (Customs guards; boatmen; Port         and Marine section police).     19.   If air forces are  not used for punitive measures, and such have to becarried out by ground  forces, then the above estimate is increased by      Two mobile columns  for  allotment to any  Brigade as  required;  each         consisting of     One Battalion  (at Colonial Establishment, with unit M.T. and two mortars         each).     One battery 4-5 or 3-7-inch Howitzers.     Two sections, Field Company, Royal Engineers.             Total: Two battalions.                    Two batteries.                    One Field Company, Royal Engineers.     20.   Whilst I consider  it essential that His Majesty&apos;s Government should bein no doubt regarding the  possible  ultimate military and air  commitments inPalestine, I consider Martial Law could  safely  be introduced with the additionof one Brigade of three Infantry Battalions at full  Colonial Establishment, inother words,  without  approximately 50  per cent,  of  the estimate given  inparagraph 18, but the remainder should none the less be  prepared and ready tomove if the situation depicted in paragraph 16 arose.  -     The above is all exclusive of  the additional Brigade already estimated forTransjordan in my Appreciation dated the 29th  June, 1936.     21.   The  present  policy of military aid to the civil  power,  under severelimitations, can  check  the more violent forms of lawlessness   (exclusive  of terrorism), but will not terminate the resistance.     Continuation of the present state of affairs, coupled with present politicaldeterioration, is likely to lead to a long-drawn-out  situation demanding furtherreinforcement, the limits of which cannot be foreseen.  Moreover,  the prospects of the present or a larger garrison being required here during the winter months(after the end of October), with little prospect of  any winter accommodation, mustbe faced, and urgently.Choice of Alternatives.    22.  I fail to see how at this stage His Majesty&apos;s Government can capitulateto the demands of the Arabs.   None the less, they should be left in no doubt ofthe two courses now open and of the effect of the adoption of either as far as canbe foreseen.  I am certainly unable to appreciate the effect of alternative 7 (b) onMoslem countries outside Palestine. I therefore recommend for your Excellency&apos;consideration the following course :  .    (a) that the most representative leaders should be called upon by yourself to           state their minimum  demands  which would enable them to  restore           law and order and  enable the  sending of the Royal Commission to           Palestine;    (5) that these demands should be forwarded to the Secretary of State, together           with explanation of alternative 7 (&amp;), for the consideration of the           Secretary of  State, together with whatever recommendations you think           fit to make.                                 &apos; .-    23.  There is one factor, however, which cannot be excluded, and that isTime.   It. seems very likely that,  for the reasons I  have already given,  a crisis
may be precipitated of  such, moment that martial law in the Samaria Area or elsewhere may become essential before His Majesty&apos;s Government have had timeto give due consideration to the problem.   This possibility, I consider, should be pointed out to His Majesty&apos;s Government, with the warning that in such  event,Martial Law must of necessity be imposed at once.    24.  Finally, I  consider the introduction of Martial Law should be preceded by an ultimatum  to the  leaders, giving them a last  chance (with specified time)in which to comply with  His Majesty&apos;s Governments demands.                               I have, &amp;c.                                    R. E. C. PEIRSE, Air Vice-Marshal,                                       Air  Officer Commanding British                                       Forces in  Palestine and  Trans-                                                   jordan.APPENDIX III.    Comments by High Commissioner on Air Vice-Marshal Peirse&apos;s Secret                     Memorandum  of August 20, 1936.Paragraph 3.    The assumption that  &quot;when the effect of the  armed bands was neutralisedby military action, the leaders would change their tactics&apos;&apos; is unfounded  forthe reason that the armed bands have not  been so neutralised.   They are more vigorous and  numerous than  a month ago.   The methods  described in  para-graph 3 (a), (b) and (c) are additional not alternative to the armed bands.Paragraph 4.    I agree that the leaders have ho hope of influencing the extremists unless they have some concession to offer to their followers.  The difficulty is to strikethat happy medium of concession  which  would  enable the leaders  to  work effectively for peace and at the same time not establish a precedent of yielding toviolence which would be embarrassing to Government in the future.Paragraph 8.    Before considering the introduction of martial law, I should wish to examinecarefully  a  detailed exposition of the reasons  justifying  it and the  preciseadvantages we  should gain by adopting it.Paragraph 9.    (a)  (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) The policy recommended by the Air Officer Commandingis precisely our policy for the last three months and is carried out when troops are available.    (6)  Air Officer  Commanding&apos;s proposal here also is precisely  what we havebeen doing whenever we can  get  evidence.   But that is  the crucial  difficulty,which is not touched on by the Air Officer Commanding.  Hitherto, such evidence as we have obtained would not justify the bombing of any particular village asa whole.    As  regards paragraph 9 as a whole the chief  change in our present policy proposed by the Air Officer Commanding is that coercive measures against townsand villages should foe carried out by  air forces and not by ground  forces.Paragraph 13.    As  explained in my Secret despatch of  to-day&apos;s date, I am unable to acceptthe Air Officer Commanding&apos;s assumption  that  the bombing of Nablus and a selected  number of other villages in Samaria  would &quot;cow the country and  furnishadequate, grounds for the abandonment of general opposition.&quot;    Nor do I  think there is at present sufficient evidence in our possession tojustify such drastic air action.
     If peace were imposed by this means, it would not last long.  A sullen and embittered population would seize every chance of disturbing the peace whenever a favourable opportunity  offered.  We should have to employ drastic methods on an increasing scale to  obtain final  success, which could only be  by creating a desert and calling it peace.     I doubt also the opinion that the prospects of revolt in Trans Jordan would be lessened  by the adoption of strong punitive measures in Palestine. Paragraph  14.     (a) It will be difficult  to select the &apos;&apos; other  leaders&apos;&apos; as  the  policies of different parties vary rapidly.     The advantages of deporting the Mufti are  known to all; what I want are precise proposals for overcoming the grave drawbacks which are many and deep, and which it is folly  to ignore till they  arrive.  We must beforehand consider the  evils with which  we probably shall  be faced,  and the  ways and  means to overcome them.     The Mufti has very considerable influence as  head of the Moslem  Community in Palestine.  He is also something of  a figure in other Arab Moslem countries, and is not unknown in India and even further afield.   He has also great political power through the control  of Moslem funds, through patronage and through the employees of the Awqaf and the Sharia  Courts  throughout Palestine.  If it is legally possible to remove him from his  post as President of the Supreme Moslem Council is it expedient to do so? Would  that stop  the disturbances in Palestine or would it  make  them worse and more widespread ?  What would be  the effect in neighbouring  Moslem  countries ?.  And those further afield ?   Could he be effectively replaced by someone who  would be acceptable  to the Moslems and amenable to British authority ? These  are some  of the questions which suggest themselves.     (6) Censorship of the  press is  cumbersome, and when  last applied,  resulted in a strike of the Arab press.  The disadvantages of no press are greater than the disadvantages  of  a  press tempered  by suspensions whenever such  appear necessary.   Suspensions are also more  severe.     (c) I shall consider the introduction in towns of intensified searching of all Arab persons.     (d) Curfew and other restrictive measures are already in force where we think such measures useful.     (e) I shall give further consideration  to the practicability of the prohibitionof the movement of Arabs on railways and highways.Paragraph 23.     The Air Officer Commanding  suggests that declaration of martial law isessential to carrying out of severer  measures.  I am inclined to agree.APPENDIX IV.Memorandum by the High Commissioner giving his Views  on the  Strength of                    the Arab National Spirit in Palestine.    I.  The  bitterness  of  the country against  the  policy of  the last eighteen years cannot be over-estimated; it is  that bitterness which  finds expression inintimidation, violence and increasing brutality.  I see no sign  of that bitternessdecreasing, or of its manifestations becoming less frequent,  and the danger of widespread reprisals grows greater every week.    II.  It is true that it  is a minority of the  people who are active in taking part in or promoting acts of  violence.  But  it is equally true that it is thisminority which dictates the line of action to be taken by the  Arab people.    There is no collective  opposition  to the  minority,  only  a  great number of individuals desirous to  see an end  to constant strife,  and  an end put to  the increasing ruin of the country.
    III.  These people cannot make their voices effective, because there are noleaders  who have the courage to stand for peace without some emblem, sham orreal, of  victory.    IV.  In the course of a National struggle it is  hard for any leader to proclaim the advantages of  surrender, that is to  say,  in Palestine  to-day the ending of the strike and the ending of armed resistance.    The Mufti is not a morally courageous man, and it  would be contrary to hiswhole nature to take a decisive lead in ending  disorders when he would be criticised loudly by his many opponents as a traitor to  the Arabs and a tool ofthe English.    V.  During the last three months many different people have been suggested as the real leaders of the strike and of violence.  The real leaders throughout havebeen the extremists.   The extremists  lead and they frighten those who, like the mufti, refuse to stand in  the open and declare  themselves wholeheartedly forviolence or wholeheartedly for acceptance of Government offers.    VI.  The Amir  Abdullah has tried  and is  ready  to try again to call offviolence and armed resistance to Government, but he  knows he has  little or no chance of success  without something to give,  so that  the  extremists cannotdamn his proposals as a complete and obvious surrender.    VII.  The Amir considers  the  Istiqlalists  and the Mufti as the mainopponents to his policy of mediation.  The Amir has many enemies, but the failureof his attempted mediation was  inevitable because he had nothing to offer.    The unexpected constancy and tenacity of purpose shown by the Arabs duringthe past four months has surprised everyone, including the  Amir and most, if not all, Arab leaders.    I have said before, this tenacity is due to the Arab  fear of being submergedby the Jews.  Suspension of immigration would be a  definite act as distinct from a promise which in their eyes would show that His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthad regard for  this danger.    I fear no mere promise will have this effect.  I have  no reason to believe thattheir tenacity will weaken unless some temporary concession as to immigrationis made.
