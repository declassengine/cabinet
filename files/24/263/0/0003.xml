TWENTIETH REPORT.                 Survey of the economic situation, June 1936    BY our terms of reference we are directed to supervise the preparation of periodical  reports on the economic situation;  and  in accordance with these instructions we now submit  the  twentieth  of  these  periodical  reports.  Thereport represents  the general views of the committee, without  attempting toexpress the different shades of opinion held by individual members.    2.  In part 1, we summarise the chief  economic events of recent months.In part 2, we discuss certain  aspects of  the present situation.   The paragraphsrelating to France in this part of our report were  written before M. Blum made his declaration of policy.

SURVEY  OF  THE  ECONOMIC SITUATION,  JUNE 1936                Part 1. Summary of recent economic events                                (a) Finance.    THE main  feature of  the foreign exchange markets since the time of our last report has been the continued export of capital from France.  In  spite ofthis export, the  sterling exchange has shown only a slight appreciation, havingbeen kept stable  in the latter part of February and in March by the transfer ofa sterling credit of   40 millions granted to the French Government by  a group of London Banks, and more recently by gold exports.  In the face of this outflow of capital the French bank rate was raised from 3^  per cent, to 5  per  cent, onthe 28th March  and again to 6 per  cent, on the 6th May.  We comment on theexchange situation at length in the second part of this report.  An importantdefection  from  the gold bloc  occurred  when  on  the 27th  April  exchange restrictions were imposed in Poland.  It is expected that in future the Polishgovernment will  pursue a more liberal internal financial policy.  The course ofthe exchanges in London on New York and Paris are given  in table 1.                                 TABLE 1.Average of mean London daily rates of exchange from May 1934 to April 1936.

Inview of the difference in the costs incurred by the authorities on the one handand by private dealers on the other when transferring gold from one centre toanother movements of gold appear to take place to London from Paris when the premium on gold is comparatively small, but in the reverse direction only whenthe premium is comparatively large.   It follows that even  when the average price of gold for the month as a whole is lower in London than Paris there mayte a net movement of gold from Paris to London.

The gold holdings of the principal foreign central banks since March1934 are given in table 3.   During the first quarter of 1936 the gold holdings ofthe United States Treasury  showed only a small increase, but  in  April  theirupward movement was resumed.  The Bank of France lost little gold in the first quarter, thanks to the London credit of  40 millions; in April a serious outwardmovement of gold took place which was continued in May.   Holland and Switzer-land have increased  their gold holdings since the end of  the year.  No figures have been published of the Italian gold holdings, but they are known to havebeen substantially reduced  in the first quarter.

    3.  During the  first four months of 1936 total imports of gold into GreatBritain amounted to   53  millions,  of which imports of  gold from Britishcountries, mainly  from  South Africa, amounted to  42 millions.    Of  these imports, nearly  40  millions were retained in Great Britain, the balance  beingexported.  Net imports from France amounted to  4-^ millions, which were almost exactly balanced by  net exports to the Netherlands.  Net exports to the UnitedStates amounted to a little over  3 millions.    4.  The rates of discount on Treasury bills  was rather lower in the first quarter of 1936 than in the preceding quarter.  The bills issued by tender fellby  73 millions from  566 millions at the end of 1935 to  493 millions on the28th March.  In the course of the first quarter of 1936 the excess of ordinaryreceipts over  ordinary  expenditure  amounted to   133  millions.  Between the28th March and the  16th May bills allotted by tender increased by  60 millions and ordinary expenditure exceeded ordinary revenue by   31 millions.  Thus bythe middle of May the outstanding amount of bills issued by tender was nearlyequal to the amount  outstanding at the end of the year.  Bills issued &quot; throughthe tap &quot;  on the other hand were nearly   100 millions  lower at  202 millions on the 16th May.  A factor in the reduction in the outstanding amount of tapbills may  have been  calls on subscriptions to the issues of 2\ per cent, fundingloan and the 1 per cent, treasury bonds issued in December.    5.  Bank deposits decreased between  December  1935  and  March 1936,  asis normal at that time of year.  In April they expanded by  44 millions andregained four-fifths of the losses in the two preceding months.  It is possible thatin this month deposits were affected by the inflow of funds from France.  On theasset side of their  balance sheets the most notable developments are a reductionof  58 millions in discounts since December, and an increase of  60 millions inadvances.   This is in part a  normal development associated  with the paymentof taxes in the first  quarter.   The increase  in  advances is, however,  abnormallylarge  and is connected with  the credit of  40 millions  granted to the FrenchGovernment.

     6.  The international events of  the first quarter of 1936 had  perhaps lessinfluence  on the  prices of  securities  than might have  been expected.   But,nevertheless, the price of 1\ per cent,  consols fell from 154-5 per cent, of the1928 level at the end of 1935 to 151 - 7 per cent, at the end of April 1936.   Theprices  of  industrial shares advanced in January and February, but  also sufferedin March, and their upward movement has received a check.  New capital issues were heavy  in the first quarter of 1935, the bulk of these issues being for homeindustrial purposes.   There has also been a considerable  amount of borrowing onbehalf of  British local authorities, though this  borrowing has required a slightconcession in price in order to  prevent the market from becoming overstockedwith undigested issues.   The indices  of the prices  of securities compiled by the institute of Actuaries are given in the following table :                                   TABLE 5.

Food-stuffs have declined somewhatin price since January, this decline being partly of a seasonal nature.  Americanprices remain stationary.  In France, on the other hand, there has been a marked increase in prices.   During 1936 this increase has been almost confined to theprices of agricultural commodities, especially cereals and wine.   German pricesshow a slight upward tendency, but  it is questionable whether much significanceattaches to these figures.                            (b) United Kingdom.    8.

In February unemployment in the building trades was notabnormally high in comparison with the last quarter of 1935, having regard tothe usual  seasonal variation;  but employment continued rather  below the december level.  By March this level had been regained, and in April a further advance occurred.  Unemployment among insured persons aged 16 to 64 amountedto 1,807,500 in April, compared with 1,858,000  in December, and 2,030,300 inApril last year, an improvement of 222,800 in the year.  We have brought up todate, in table 9 below, the analysis which we have given from time to time of theinfluences  which have affected the  demand for labour in insured occupations.We would repeat that this analysis, which requires an estimate of the effect on employment of imports and exports of goods produced in the industries coveredby insurance, is of a rather unreliable nature; moreover, we have assumed thatthe numbers of persons insured in  each group of industries has  grown at thesame rate as between July, 1934, and July, 1935, an assumption which will nodoubt prove incorrect.   It will be observed that as far as the  home market isconcerned, these figures indicate a continuous growth in the  demand  for labour.Home investment continues its steady expansion, even though the figures for thefirst quarter of 1936 were affected  by the heavy unemployment in  the buildingindustry in January.  Moreover, the demand for labour in the group of industriescovered by this heading is soon likely to be  affected by expenditure on armaments.The demand for  labour  to  produce consumable goods  and  services  is alsoincreasing, though not at so rapid a  rate.  On the other hand, a larger proportionof the home demand for manufactured goods was satisfied through imports in thefirst quarter of 1936 than at any time since 1931, and the demand for british labour to produce for export actually declined.  This decline  was, however, morethan accounted for by the falling off in British exports of coal to Italy.[13290]c

On the other hand the value of planspassed for other buildings is again very high, with  the result  that  one total,though not so high as in the third and fourth quarters of 1935,  remains higherthan a year ago.  In April plans passed for new dwelling houses by 143 out ofthe 146 reporting authorities were  15  per cent, lower than last year,  but planspassed for other buildings were 13 per cent, higher than last year, and the total was 6 per cent, lower than last year.  It is. perhaps, still too soon to attach muchsignificance to the falling off in the plans passed for new dwelling houses, but itis not impossible that, as far as dwelling houses are concerned, the peak of thebuilding boom has been reached.    11.  Iron and steel production showed a further remarkable increase in thefirst four months of  1936.  In April  it  reached  almost  a million tons.  this increase  has been entirely,  due to  a  great  expansion in home  consumption.Exports this year have been rather lower than in 1935, and imports rather higher.       [13290]                                                     c 2    9.  According to the Board of Trade index industrial production in the first quarter of 1936 reached 123 per cent, of the average for 1930 and was 2 per cent.greater than in the last quarter and 9 per cent, greater than in the first quarterof 1935  Production in the iron and steel industry showed a particularly largeexpansion, and was higher than in any previous period.  The coal industry musthave benefitted from this improvement, for in spite of reduced exports, production was higher than in any quarter since the first quarter of 1930.  The productionof textiles was higher than at any time since the first quarter of 1928.    10.

The money value of retail trade (table 12) appears to have been rather higher in the first quarter of 1936 than in the last quarter of 1935, if account istaken of normal seasonal changes.  The figures for March and April  are,  how-ever, always difficult to interpret owing to the changing  date of the Easterholiday.  Compared with last year,  retail trade increased by 10-8 per cent, inJanuary, by 7-3 per cent, in February, by 7-9  per cent, in March, and by 5 percent, in April.

                           (c) The  United States.    13.  The level of production reached in the United States in the last quarter-of 1935  was not quite maintained in the first quarter of 1936.   The changedseasonal nature of motor-car production was responsible for part but not thewhole of the decline.   Production was also delayed by the unfavourable weather conditions experienced in  January and February, and  by the floods in March.Bad weather was  also responsible for a  recession  in retail trade in the first twomonths of the year.  Retail trade in March, however, was very satisfactory.  Thepreliminary trade reports  for April  and the beginning of May suggest that  bythat time the ground  lost  since December had been fully recovered.   attention is being directed  in  America  to  the important place which the  sale  of goodsnormally effected on the instalment system is playing in the expansion of demand.This tendency  may  be accentuated  when the  veterans&apos; bonus is paid off  this summer.  In the following table we give indices of industrial  production, factoryemployment, and retail trade up to the end of March.TABLE 13.Production, employment and retail trade in the United States in 1934 and 1935.

Construction contracts awarded continue to be well in advance of thoseof the preceding years,  though the  February  figure was definitely lower, bothabsolutely and after adjustment for seasonal variations, than the figures for thethree preceding  months.  In March, as in other branches of  economic&apos; activity,a recovery occurred.  Residential  building  contracts increased  substantially inthat month.                                   TABLE  15.

The slowly rising tendency of American monthly wage rates continuedtill the end of 1935.  In January 1936, however, there was a decline of nearly1 per cent., which was more than made good in February.  A further advancetook place in March.  The prices of raw materials were increasing up to the endof February, but declined in March.  Retail prices appear to be stationary.   the pound has been  appreciating slightly  in relation to the dollar.   None  of  these changes is of  sufficient  importance to  affect the appropriate valuation of the pound and the dollar in relation to one another.

     , .                           (d) France.     18.  Production in France has continued to expand, and was in March 1\ percent, greater than a year earlier.  The industries showing the greatest increases are, in order of the increase shown, rubber (up 31 per cent.), textiles (up  19 percent.), motor cars (up 15 per cent.), metal manufacture (up 13 per cent.), leather(up  12  per  cent.) and paper  (up .8 per cent.);  mining and engineering showcomparatively small improvements, and building is still substantially lower thana year earlier.  Thus the industries which have benefitted lately, are for the mostpart  those which supply consumers&apos; goods,  a conclusion which is, on the  whole,supported by the figures of employment.  The improvement in demand in these industries may be explained partly by the  natural resilience of demand after a prolonged depression associated with the  hoarding of money by consumers,  partly by the improved condition of the agricultural parts of France now that the pricesof wheat and wine have increased, and perhaps; also by anticipatory buying by persons expecting a rise  of prices  after  the devaluation  of  the  franc.   Theimprovement in metal production may be associated with an increase in armamentexpenditure.  The effect of dear  money is seen in; the continued  depression  of thebuilding industry.     19.   The improvement in  production  has  not  been   associated  with  a comparable increase of employment, though the number of unemployed in receiptof relief is  considerably lower  than a year ago.  According  to the publishedindices, there has been a slight falling-off in the number of persons employed, butan  increase  in the average working week.

     20.  The financial position of  France remains disturbed  and is commentedon at length in the second part of this report.                               (e) Germany.     21.  There were some indications in the first quarter of 1936 of a slightrelaxation of the tension under which the German economy was working in thesecond half of last year.   The food situation was more favourable, fewer instances of shortages  being  reported.  In part,  this improvement  is attributable to anincrease in production.  In the case of pork in particular, supplies are now more plentiful, as a considerable part of the reduction in breeding  stocks made afterthe drought of 1934 has  been made good.  In  addition prices  have been allowedto rise with  a view to bringing demand into closer relationship with  supply.Imports of food and raw materials were also rather greater  in  weight than ayear before.    22   On  the other hand  production in the first quarter was slightly lower than in the last quarter of 1935, even when corrected for the normal seasonal fall.This reduction was more than accounted for by a falling off  in the productionof investment goods.  The  output  of consumption goods on the other  handincreased, and there was  also an increase,  in comparison  with  the previous year,in the value of retail trade.   Employment in December, January,  and February,was lower than in previous months, owing to the usual seasonal causes.  In Marchit expanded considerably almost to the  level of last November.

                           (f) International trade.    23.  The League of Nations&apos; indices of the volume and value of world tradeare given in the following table (table 20).  The quantity of world trade fell inthe first quarter of 1936 by less than the usual seasonal amount with the resultthat the  adjusted index stands at the highest figure since the  last quarter of1931.  The volume of international trade, however, remains  very  low,  havingregard to the improvement in total productive activity which has occurred since that time. Moreover, the indices do not reflect the decline in Italian trade which took place in the first quarter  of  1936.  The gold value of world trade is  alsosubstantially higher than a year ago, subject to the same qualification.

Some indications of  the relative  fortunes of  different groups of countries can be found in  the following table (table 21).   The sterling area forthe purpose of these tables is defined as those countries in Europe, Africa, Asia,and Australia whose currencies are linked with sterling,  excepting Japan.   Thegold bloc group  includes, in  addition  to  France, Holland, and Switzerland,Belgium, the colonial possessions of France, Holland, and Belgium, and Poland.The latter  country has recently instituted exchange restrictions  and may there-fore be held to have ceased  to belong to the gold bloc.  The exports of the sterling area include exports of gold from  South Africa.   The most noticeable features of this table since the beginning of the year 1935 have been the growing imports into North America; the continuous decline in the exports of the gold bloc; thedecline in the exports  of South America in the fourth quarter of  1935,  and theexpansion in the exports of North  America in the same period, and  finally, the continuous growth in the share of  imports and exports accruing to the  sterling area.  The figures have been corrected for seasonal variations as far as is possiblehaving regard to the comparatively short period for which they are available.13290J

Exports at  139-5 millions  were only  1 - 0  million  greater than  1935  and re-exports at  21 - 8 millions  were 3 - 7 millions greater.  Thus the adverse balance of trade in the first four monthsof the year was  24 -1 millions greater than in  1935  and  10 - 3 millions greaterthan in 1934.  The percentage expansion of British  exports in comparison withthe  corresponding month of the previous year  is shown in the following table : TABLE 22.The monthly increase in British exports since January 1934 as a percentage of the          exports in the corresponding months in the previous year.JanuaryFebruaryMarchAprilMayJuneJulyAugustSeptemberOctober ..NovemberDecember    26.

                  Part 2. The economic situation, June 1936                       -     (a) Exchange policy.     28.  The survey which we have given in the preceding section shows that inthis country, after a not unusual hesitation in the first two months of the year,the tendencies previously operative have reasserted themselves.  The most markeddevelopment has been  the  growth of employment and production in the heavy capital goods  industries.   The production of steel,  in particular,  has beenexceptionally heavy in the  last few months.  Abroad, the recovery in the UnitedStates, which at the beginning of the year was held up by unfavourable weather conditions, is now again in evidence; in Germany, a slight falling off in the levelof industrial production has been associated with  rather more plentiful suppliesof ordinary foodstuffs;  and in France,  there  has been some  improvement in production, and a fairly substantial rise in wholesale prices.  World production is expanding fairly rapidly, but international trade  appears still to be onlyimproving  slowly.     29.  Optimism as to  the prospect of  steady  progress  in the  field  ofinternational trade must be restrained so  long as the mechanism of internationalfinance has failed to provide an adequate solution of the difficult problems that have existed ever since the war.  Shortly expressed, the heart of these problemslies in the  extreme mobility of capital between different international centres, in circumstances in which the movement of goods between nations is circumscribedby every kind of restriction.  Movements of capital have taken a great variety offorms,  the piling up of  short-term  liabilities,  the  sale  of  securities,  andparticipation in stock exchange speculation.  But in the event they have led to thesubordination of internal credit policy to the exigencies of a dangerous exchangesituation.  Since 1929, Germany, Great Britain, the  United States and, finally,France have in turn been  the victims of a drain of capital  abroad, which hasscarcely benefitted the  receiving nations, and has caused severe dislocation in thenations which have suffered from it.     30. . The last twelve.months have seen few major changes in the  principalexchange  rates.  At  the same time the exchanges  have been  under  constant pressure as the result  of large-scale capital movements.   These movements havebeen caused by the anticipation of two events, the devaluation of the franc, anda relative appreciation in the values of American industrial stocks.  The flow ofcapital arising from both these causes has had important repercussions in GreatBritain. We may deal with them in order.     31.  The loss of gold from the Bank of France between the end of March 1935and the middle of May 1936  has amounted to 24-6 milliard francs.  In addition,the  sterling credit of  3 milliard francs, raised in February and March of thisyear, represents,  in effect,  a charge on its remaining gold stock.   The adverse balance on income account  in the same period was probably comparatively small,amounting  perhaps to  three  milliard  francs.   It  follows  that as  much  as25 milliard francs  or nearly  350 millions sterling has been transferred abroadon  capital account.  This movement of  capital took place  on three occasions,separated by intervals of comparative tranquillity.  In April and May of 1935the Bank of France lost gold to the value of 11 milliards of francs; in november to the value of 5\ milliards,  and between  the end of February and the middle ofMay of this year, allowing for  the sterling  credit,  to the value  of nearly12 milliards.  In the remaining eight months some gain of gold was  recorded.During each wave of  distrust  lack of confidence  in  the franc  spread to everwidening circles, and the extent of  the loss was probably determined as much bythe  extent of the readily  realisable reserves of the  classes affected as by the precautionary measures taken by the Bank of  France.   The recent outflow ofcapital was apparently characterised by the participation of persons of small andmoderate fortune, for it was accompanied by a reduction in the level of savings bank deposits, and by a demand for English notes for  hoarding, as well as by theopening  of  a  large   number of  comparatively  small  accounts  with  theEnglish banks.
     32.   The assets, investment in which is open to a Frenchman contemplatingthe devaluation of the franc, may be divided into three categories, according to theeffect of devaluation upon them. In the first place there are those whose price is largely determined in world markets, and which would appreciate in terms of the franc on devaluation, for instance, gold, foreign currencies and securities and rawmaterials.   Next   come  those  which,  though  not  immediately  affected  bydevaluation, would  benefit in the event of a rise in  internal prices, for instanceland and  industrial shares.   Finally,  there are those  assets whose value  is expressed  in francs,  namely,  debts,  money  and government  securities.   Theanticipation of devaluation is inducing holders of assets of the last category  tosell them and purchase assets of the first category; and since, so long as the goldparity of the franc  is maintained,  this action on their part can have little effect in increasing  the price of the latter,  its full weight is felt as  an influencedepressing the price of the former.  In so far as the debts concerned have a  distantredemption date, a fall in price can readily occur.  It is probable that  to-day theprice of,  say, 4 per cent,  rentes has been forced down to a level  at  which thepossibilities of capital appreciation after  devaluation are as great as in the  caseof many forms of investment  more directly affected,  with the result  that it is nolonger likely to be profitable  to sell rentes and buy, say, gold.   In the case *ofmoney,  however, and of short-term obligations, such  a fall in price cannot occur;and  the tendency for resources  to be diverted from francs, and  short-term debtsexpressed in francs to gold, dollars, primary materials and the like, must continue until conditions of such stringency have been produced in the money market that further transfers are impossible.  Such a stringency can, of course, only occur  ifthe central bank permits it.     33.  Hitherto, the Bank  of France has  pursued a rather undecided policyin regard to its rate of discount.  Whenever a serious drain  of gold has beenin progress, it has raised its rate;  but as  soon as conditions have allowed it, therate has been reduced to 3 or 3^ per  cent.  The  motives have been clear.   Thedepressed industrial situation and the  difficulties of  the Treasury in securingcash, both pull in the  direction of lower interest rates.  Moreover, as long asdevaluation was  not generally  regarded  as inevitable, confidence  in  the francwas  probably increased by a  comparatively  liberal discount policy.  We doubt,however,  whether  these  temporary  relaxations  of  credit stringency will be permitted in the  future.   At the same time,  the banking situation in France  is such that any material  increase in the degree of stringency prevailing  in the-money market might be attended with serious results.  As the result of the greatrepatriation of French funds from abroad  in 1931, the cash resources  of theFrench  banks reached extremely high proportions.  In the next three years thesereserves were reduced by the  withdrawal  of deposits either for hoarding in theform of notes, or gold, or for  deposit with the savings banks.  As a consequencethe  deposits on  current account  with the  Bank  of  France  showed a  greatcontraction, though the commercial banks were not,  in this period,  forced tomaintain  their balances there by rediscounting bills.   Last year,  however,  the-four banks which publish monthly balance sheets, lost over three milliard francsof deposits, and this loss was  met by a reduction of two milliard francs in theirholdings of cash  and deposits with the  Bank of France,  offset to the extent ofone milliard francs by increases in deposits with other banks, and by a reductionof two  milliard francs in  their discounts.  In January and February 1936 the^cash reserves of these banks declined  by a further 300 million francs, and  theamount due from banks  increased  by 40  millions. .  Bill  holdings,  however,increased by 330  millions and deposits by 40 millions.  The  Bank  of  France inthe same  period increased  its holdings  of bills and advances by six  milliards.Thus the French banking system is to-day entirely dependent on the rediscountingfacilities of the Bank of France for the maintenance of its cash reserves.  Anyserious  reduction   of  these   facilities  would be  attended   by  widespreaddisorganisation.     34.  The situation in France is thus reaching an extremely critical  phase-On the  purely economic side, indeed, there are signs of improvement, due to theexpansion of expenditure on armaments, to the natural revival of demand after a prolonged depression, as well as to the improvement in agricultural prices,which appears to be a world-wide phenomenon. It is conceivable that, providedthese influences are maintained, the economic situation will at least  show no
 deterioration, even though a period of  credit stringency lies  ahead.   In the financial sphere, however, the difficulties are acute.  The budget, in spite of great improvements, is  not  so balanced as to preclude the necessity for  continued borrowing by the state on a very substantial scale.  In so far as this borrowing takes the form of short  term issues,  which can be reciscounted at  the bank, it increases  the amount of  money  which  can be  converted  into  gold, and we may assume  that the Bank of France would wish to set an upper  limit to the amount of money which  it is called upon to advance on government paper.  On the other hand, to borrow in the long  term market  to-day would be  extremely expensive, even if it were possible on a scale appropriate to the Treasury&apos;s needs. In other words, the power of the French government to spend beyond the  income accruing to it from current taxation is limited on the one hand by the amount of gold which the Bank of  France can afford to lose, and on the other  hand by the new money which  it is possible to raise  in the long term market.    35.  In  these  circumstances the maintenance of the  present  gold parity is a  grave limitation on the freedom of action of the new French  government, but it would  appear  that  if  the government  wishes  to  maintain  this  parity it will be   in  a   position  to  do so.   There  have been  some  indications that  this  will  be  its  purpose  at any  rate  for  some  time.   The   hopes of  the  parties  of  the  Front  populaire,  on whom the  present  government relies for support, must have been that devaluation would occur during the interregnum  which preceded their taking office.   But the late government made it plain that without the support of  their successors in the maintenance  of the franc, they would  resign immediately and throw upon them the whole responsi- bility,  a responsibility which they were unwilling to assume.  How  long the government of the left will remain attached to the principle of  maintaining the present gold  parity we cannot foretell.  The international situation  is such that further demands on the French Treasury for military expenditure must continue, and the Front populaire  has committed itself during the  election to a revival of employment through the  acceleration of  expenditure on public works.  Sooner or later in the absence of a marked  revival in public confidence in  the franc, the French  government will  have to choose between the  demands of these items in their  avowed policy and the maintenance of the franc.   Moreover, their  diffi- culties are likely to be somewhat increased by the growth in the adverse balance of trade which has been apparent since the beginning of the year.    36.  We  pass to the other group of international  capital movements, the flow of funds into America.  Three  sources  have  contributed to this flow, the return of  American capital invested abroad at short term in 1933 and 1934; the growth  of foreign  deposits with United States banks,  largely the complement of the export of funds from France and other European gold standard countries; and funds transferred from Europe for investment in the American stock market. Light is thrown on these movements by the recent  report of the Department of Commerce on the balance  of payments for 1935. The favourable balance on income account amounted &quot;to $147  millions.  At the same time, there  was an  inflow of precious  metals of f2,075 millions,  of  which gold  accounted  for  $1,739 millions and silver $336 millions. To finance this import of precious metals there must have been an  inflow of capital amounting to $1,928 millions.  The informa- tion in the hands of the Department of Commerce is not sufficiently comprehensive to determine  accurately how this inflowing capital was divided between  money invested at short term, and money invested in  securities.  But  the latter was certainly considerable, and may well have amounted to between a third and a half of the whole.   Moreover, this investment by foreigners in United States securities did not begin in 1935.   The recorded inflow of long term capital in 1934 was about half that recorded  in  1935,  and  a  substantial part of  this no  doubt represented investment in American securities. The inflow of long term capital in previous years arose principally from the sale to  foreigners, generally at a heavy discount, of foreign bonds floated in the period of prosperity.  The effect of this inflow of capital into a market such as the American  stock market, on which, as at present, no demands are being made for new  issues, is  to force up the  pricesof securities  to a point at which as much capital  is withdrawn by the originalowners of  securities, as is introduced from abroad.  The inflow of foreign capitalmust, therefore, have been one of the principal  factors contributing to the risein American share prices since the spring of last year, which at one time amounted      [13290]                                                      K
to nearly 60 per cent., and is still in the neighbourhood of 50 per cent.  It mustbe borne in mind that a withdrawal of foreign money from Wall Street,  wouldbe associated  with a  decline in prices, all the more so as  the United  states treasury is providing in the financing of its budget deficit  an alternative outlet for the new savings of Americans.  For this reason, unless there were somegrounds  for expecting a real reversal of the upward trend of American businessactivity, funds would hardly  be withdrawn  very  rapidly,  even though thereshould be a reversal of speculative opinion as to the prospects  of American commonstocks.    37.  A  substantial  part  of  these  investments   in   America  musthave  been  made by Frenchmen,  who were apprehensive of the  effect on theirdomestic security markets, of the steps taken to prevent the  devaluation of the franc, or of  devaluation itself.  Dutch and Swiss  capital has  taken  the samecourse for  similar reasons.  In addition, a very considerable  volume of Englishmoney has been  invested  in  America.   This  latter  investment was  probablyfinanced, in part, out  of  the  substantial  favourable balance accruing to thiscountry on income account.  The British balance of payments  on  income account,including therein net exports of silver amounting to  14-5 millions, amounted in1935 to a credit of  37 millions.  New issues of foreign loans were very small in1935, at  21 millions, and probably fell short of receipts  by  this country throughsinking funds and the like, by possibly  as  much as  30 millions.  The  countrieswhich might normally  expect to benefit from a resumption of British overseaslending did not so benefit last year.    38.  A second  source from which British  investment in America may havebeen  financed  is from  the funds invested by French  and other continentalcapitalists  in the English money market or security market.   Such investmentshave taken place on a substantial scale, but  it is always possible that some at least of the foreign  exchange becoming available from  this source has been offset bypurchases of gold or  foreign exchange by the exchange equalisation account.Finally, exchange may have become available through the accumulation of sterling balances in London by members of the sterling area,  an  accumulation which,  inview of the important part that the export of gold plays in the trade of the BritishEmpire, would  be naturally associated with an accumulation  of newly mined gold.It is impossible to judge from the recorded gold movements how great  a contri-bution to the financing  of British investment in America Las been made from thesesources, but their joint effect has no doubt been considerable.    39.  The  Report  of the Bank of  International  Settlements sums up the movements of capital to and from Great Britain as follows :          &apos;&apos; In Great Britain the gold reserves of the Bank of England, which are    valued at the old parity, increased during the year by  7 - 8 million,  which at    the present value  of sterling corresponds to about  13 million.  It can be    concluded,  however, that in addition  the  Exchange Equalization  Account    increased its gold holdings by an appreciable amount.  Net imports of gold    into Great Britain in  1935 had a value of  70 million at the current gold    price.  The Board of Trade  in its carefully worded comment on this figure    explained  that &apos; as in the  two previous years the net inward movement of    gold during 1935  was  no doubt again  due  in part to gold being sent to this    country and held  here on foreign account, though perhaps not to  the same    extent as in 1935  and 1934.&apos;  An increasing proportion of the net imports    has thus been available for purchases  on British account, i.e., for the Bank    of England and the Exchange Equalization Account.  It is of interest  to    relate this  conclusion to the world figure, already given  above, of the amount    of gold which &apos; disappeared &apos; in 1935.   The total supply  of gold from current    production and the East  was 3,860  million  Sw.  frs.,  and  if industrial    requirements of about 160 Sw. frs. be deducted,  there remain 3,700 million    Sw. frs.   Now the reported reserves of banks  of  issue  and governments    increased  by 1,700  million Sw.  frs.,  leaving an amount of 2,000 million    Sw.  frs.  or about  130 million sterling to be accounted for in other  ways.    Part of this gold,  as has been explained above, was absorbed by fresh private    hoarding, and part went into the holdings  of central banks outside reported    reserves, but a large amount must have been taken by government exchange    funds, and especially the British Exchange Equalization  Account.
         &quot; The increase in the reserves of the British monetary authorities are    the net result of a number of diverse movements.  There was, on the one hand,    a surplus on the current account of the balance of payments estimated by the    Board of Trade at  37 million,  and a further surplus of something like the    same amount derived from the repayments on foreign loans over and above    new foreign issues; against this must be set,  however, an amount not known    exactfy,  but evidently fairly substantial,  representing  private  investments    abroad, particularly in American securities.  In relation to  the United States    there was, further, a transfer of balances to the New York market;  but this    decrease  in foreign liabilities was  more than  counterbalanced by an increase    in the amount of funds held in London by countries  of the  sterling area and    the continent of Europe.  Although a certain proportion of the continental    funds went to reduce sterling  liabilities rather  than  accumulate sterling    assets, there would seem to have  been on balance a net increase in the foreign    liabilities of the London market, but this increase would appear to have been    well within the additions to the  gold  stocks of the Bank of England and the    Exchange Equalization Account.&quot;And again in a subsequent passage the following comment is made :          &quot; During the year 1935  the  flight of European capital went largely    through  London en route for New York, sterling being a sort of conduit pipe    through  which these funds passed;  but part of the capital remained  in    London,   continental  countries  increased  their  bank   balances,  bought    securities on  the  stock  exchange and repaid sterling  liabilities, e.g.,  on    commercial account,   On the other hand, American funds invested in London    and moneys previously held on deposit and in gold moved towards the United    States.   As a  whole,  outside the sterling area, for which. London is the    natural  centre,  the  foreign short-term assets held,  in  the market did not    greatly increase in 1935.  But during the first quarter of  1936  there was a    large flow of continental funds to England, only a minor stream passing on    to the United States; the foreign short-term liabilities of the London market    thus rose rather steeply, but the  increase was fully covered  by an addition of    corresponding assets in gold or foreign claims.&quot;    40.  The movements  of  capital  which we have discussed  in the preceding paragraphs are,  at any rate as i*egards a considerable part of them, of an unstablenature.  That is to say,  they represent  a transfer of  funds  away  from  theirnatural resting place in search of an  anticipated speculative profit.   They may therefore be expected to be reversed  if and when  this profit fully materialises orthe hope of it evaporates.  In that event, the pressure on the  exchanges and onthe credit situations in  the  countries concerned will  also be reversed.  Theposition which has  so far been reached may be summarised  as follows.  . TheFrench, by the export of gold, have bought considerable holdings of american and British  investments,  and have acquired large holdings of liquid  capital inLondon  and  New York.   Their loss of  gold has been  allowed to  cause greatmonetary stringency in France.  The British have used part of the cash receivedfrom the French to buy American  securities.   They have supplemented  these purchases by others, financed by a credit balance  on current account.  Some partat least of the cash received from  the French has been retained by the exchange equalisation  fund in the form of gold;  and  has not been  allowed  to influencecredit  conditions.   The Americans have  received a  great quantity of  gold and silver in exchange  for securities sold, for liquid American capital  repatriated,and for short term foreign deposits.  This gold and silver was, until  recently,allowed to have its full effect  in cheapening credit in a market where conditions were already extremely easy.  As a consequence of  these movements  of funds,security prices in America have shown  a  relatively sharp appreciation, while those in France have been depressed, though, in view of the improved prospectwhich they  would  hold out  in the  event of devaluation, this  depression onlycommunicated itself to the market for ordinary shares when the election resultsmade the advent of a left-wing government inevitable.   The British market hasbeen under the influence of two opposing  forces, the sales of British securities to finance the purchase of American securities, and  the purchase of securities of aninternational character from British owners by French investors.       [13290]                                                     E 2
    41.  This piling up of capital abroad may not yet have  reached  its peak;though there is some evidence, for example the recent lack of resilience  shown bythe American stock market, that, as far as long term  capital  is concerned, onlycomparatively minor movements are now taking place.  But in the near futurewe must expect the flow of funds which we have been witnessing to cease, and itmay be profitable  to consider the alternative directions in which the  situation may then develop.   There are the following alternatives :      (a) the present disposition of capital between Great Britain, France  and           America may remain unchanged for a period;     (b) a change of opinion as to the profit to be expected from  holding American           securities may occur without any change in opinion as to the dangers           of holding francs;     (c) the converse of the last, there may, either&apos;because of the devaluation of           the franc or a restoration of confidence in its stability, be a  return of           capital to France, unaccompanied by any change in  opinion regarding           the advantages of holding American securities;    (d) there may  be a concurrent movement of capital out of American  securities           and into francs.    42.  If, for a time, major capital movements  were to cease, we should not anticipate  from that cause alone that there would be any serious disturbances inthe level of the exchanges.  It is unlikely that the  capital movements of the past year have  had the effect of weakening  sterling.   At the same time,  the table(table 21) which we give earlier in this report, showing the percentage of worldimports  and exports falling to the sterling area,  does not suggest that exports from the sterling  area have recently  been unduly high or that the balance ofpayments of the countries in it have been too favourable.  The  American balanceof payments is still slightly favourable, and the French still slightly unfavourable.And so long as they remain so some movement of  gold from France to Americawill continue, even though large-scale capital movements have ended.    43.  If  we take the view that the capital movements  of the past twelvemonths  have not  in  fact greatly  affected the  level  of  sterling, particular importance attaches  to  our next two  alternatives,  namely, a  movement ofEuropean and British capital  out of  American securities, unaccompanied by a return of capital to France, on  the one hand, or, on the other, a return of capital to France,  unaccompanied by sales of American securities.   For  in both thesecases there will be  a movement of capital in one direction only, as between sterling and the two gold currencies, dollars and francs; in the first case a movement  intosterling, in the second a  movement into the gold  currencies.   In either case indefault of offsetting action by our monetary authorities, substantial, but oppositemovements in the  value of sterling may be expected.  If, for any reason, Britishfunds are withdrawn from Wall Street before the return flow of capital  to Francebegins, sterling will tend  to appreciate in terms of gold. And  if the return  flow of capital to France begins while the present British interest in American capitalis maintained, sterling will tend to depreciate in terms of gold.     44.  We may  briefly consider the last of our alternatives.   If English capitalis brought  home  from America  at  the  same time as French capital  is being brought  home from London, the net effect  on the gold value of sterling would be smaller than if these movements occurred in isolation.  However, it is unlikelythat the two movements  would exactly  balance one another.  In  these circum-stances,  some intervention by the monetary authorities would be required, but itis impossible to say in advance in which direction this would be required.     45.  We have discussed the recent movements of capital between  France,the United States and this country in  some detail because they illustrate the peculiar disadvantages attaching to these movements in present world conditions.Before the crisis  of  1931, movements of capital were  in  a  large degree  self-regulating.  An outward movement of capital for long term investment from a country, forced down  the spot exchanges  in terms of  the  forward exchanges  toa point  at  which  inward movements of  short term capital from  abroad becameprofitable.   After  this initial operation, it was necessary for the  country importingshort term capital to  maintain its short term rate of interest at a level whichwould retain these imports, until repatriation of the exported long term capital
took  place.  The higher rates of interest prevailing in the exporting  centreultimately affected the level of prices in the security markets, and thus reduced the advantages of investing abroad compared with those of  investing at home.The great change which has taken place since the crisis of 1931, is that the fund of volatile short term funds, the movements of which  used  to  compensate formovements of largely  speculative long term capital,  is no longer directed fromone centre to another by small changes in the rate of interest, but by considerations of  speculative exchange  advantages  which under the.  gold  standard were of comparatively small importance.  It thus happens that the movements of shortterm  funds can only be expected to compensate for movements of long term fundsif the latter  are  permitted to bring about  short term fluctuations in  the level ofthe exchanges of importance enough  to attract  speculative  money.   And thesefluctuations would, if they were permitted, tend to obstruct the normal processes of foreign trade.    46.  In  these circumstances,  the  practice has grown up of allowing move-ments of capital, in so far as they are not due to balances on income account, totake their effect through movements of gold and, in the case of the United States,of silver.   Two consequences flow from this practice.   First, the reserves of goldwhich are required to be maintained by central banks and the  like are very much larger than  was the case when speculative  capital  movements  were offset bymovements of short term  funds.  Secondly, gold  reserves, being subject to much wider fluctuations than hitherto,  are no longer a suitable basis for the regulationof credit.   It is for this reason that the last four years have seen the developmentof a  number of  devices  for insulating the credit  structure  from the effects ofgold movements,  There is the exchange equalisation account in this country.  InAmerica, the Treasury may be developing a technique for offsetting gold move-ments by varying the extent of its deposits between  the Federal  Reserve  Bankson the one hand,  and the member banks of the reserve system on the other.  For,in spite of an increase in monetary gold stocks of 700 million dollars since theend of October,  member  bank reserve balances with  the  Federal  Reserve bankshave  scarcely been allowed to increase since that time,  largely  as  a result of increases in the item known as &quot; Treasury cash and balances with the federal reserve Banks.&quot;   Even in France the effects of the recent gold movements havebeen nullified as  far as central bank credit is concerned by the Bank of  Francediscounting increased quantities of government paper.    47.  A condition of uncertainty as to the future level of the exchanges hasthe advantage of liberating internal interest rates from the  influence of worldforces; for though there is  an indirect connection through the yield on ordinary shares, the prices of which are linked by international speculative  investment,this is obviously  not strong enough to prevent fairly wide discrepancies  in the yield  of other kinds of securities from appearing in  different national markets.In this respect the technique of exchange control, which we have been describing,has advantages over the more automatic gold standard.  But it is important notto assume  that  this technique is capable of dealing easily with all exchangeproblems.   In particular, the long period problem of maintaining an appropriatebalance of payments requires solution.  It is natural to  regulate the purchasesand sales of gold by selecting an arbitrary level for the exchanges, and offsettingany pressure on the exchanges which carries the rate away from this, by operating in gold.  But this pressure is, of course, made up of two components, first the pressure of capital movements, and secondly, that arising from an inappropriatelyadjusted balance of payments on income account.  Whereas pressure of the firstkind  is properly  resisted by purchases and sales of gold;  pressure of  the secondkind should be allowed to exert its influence on the level of the exchanges.  For,if this does not happen, a dangerous situation may  subsequently arise;  and itmay be found that the level of prosperity, which a country has  been enjoying,has only been made possible by undesigned borrowing from abroad.    48.  The difficulty of discriminating  between these  two  forms of pressurehas been solved  by a number of  countries in whose economic  life internationaltransactions  play a comparatively minor part, by  the institution of  systems ofexchange  clearing, by means of which  transactions on income account  aresegregated from  those on capital account  and are  kept, sometimes by means ofa system of import licences, in a state of approximate equilibrium.  Such devices
 are  open to the objection that they unduly hamper the development of  inter- national trade.  On the one hand they prevent any tendency to equilibrium of prices to assert itself between nations;  on the  other, they limit the volume of transactions to the selling capacity of the nation  whose currency is relatively overvalued.  Moreover, they must inevitably restrict the use of the machinery for the financing of world trade which has in the past contributed substantially to British earnings from abroad.  In this  country reliance should  rather  be placed on the use of all the statistical material available, if it  is to be  possible to anticipate the pressure of a gradually accumulating balance of payments  on current account.  Should this statistical information suggest that the balance of current payments was inappropriate, having regard to the policy being pursued about foreign  lending, it  should  be possible to take corrective measures  early, preferably by gradually altering the point  at which the exchanges were  pegged. An  alternative course, which  for reasons  given in our last report  we should deprecate,  would be to make gradual alterations in credit  policy,  checking the expansion of internal activity by higher interest rates if the balance of payments showed signs of becoming adverse, and  vice versa.     49.  The question of what information is  available bearing on the  current state of the balance of payments of the sterling area for it is the sterling area and  not Great  Britain alone which must be taken into account and how it may be supplemented and. interpreted is  one of great practical moment.  We  suggest that this information may  be classified under  three  headings.   First comes. information bearing directly on capital movements between the sterling area and the rest of the world.   If  these were known accurately it would be possible, by adjusting purchases and sales of  gold to  their  variations,  to  insure that the pressure on  the  sterling exchange corresponded closely with  changes  in thecurrent balance of  payments of the sterling area.   Since the publication of theMaL-millan report steps have been taken to compile figures bearing on variations in the level of  London&apos;s short  term foreign obligations and foreign assets.  Aswe have seen, however, in the last few years movements of capital on short term account may easily be of smaller importance than movements of long term  capital. It is therefore becoming increasingly necessary to  supplement  these figures byfigures of purchases and sales of  securities  between different  stock exchangeshaving  an  international  business.   The  process  of  achieving   approximate^ accuracy would, however, take time; but that such figures would soon give an important indication of the trend of this class of capital movements is clear.  In interpreting them,  if it proved possible to collect them, it would of course haveto be borne in mind that they referred only to Great Britain, and that in certainmarkets, for  example,  that in South African gold shares, transactions  may takeplace between  an outlying member  of  the  sterling  area and members of  other-currency groups.     50.  A second group of statistics having a very direct bearing on the problem before us consists of the figures for the sterling balances maintained by membersof the  sterling area.  These balances represent  the first line  of reserves main- tained by the countries concerned against an adverse flow of payments, and theyare  extremely  sensitive to  the  undervaluation  or overvaluation  of sterling. Indeed  if at any time in the past twelve years the value  of  sterling  had been regulated by this criterion it is probable that many of the exchange difficulties ofthat period would  have been avoided.   Unlike the changes on  capital account considered in the previous paragraph, an increase in these balances is prima facie evidence of an  undervaluation of sterling and vice versa.     51.  Finally very  important if not always very up-to-date information may be obtained from a study of the combined trade statistics of  members of the sterling area in relation to the  combined trade statistics of the whole world.  In the years 1928 to  1931, for example,  the  share  of  the sterling area  in world imports was increasing whereas its share  of world exports was  stationary or declining,  a  clear  indication of the overvaluation  of sterling.  Between  1931 and  1933 on the other  hand there was little  change in its share of world imports, but an increase in its share of world exports.  By the use of  such figures a fairly clear indication of  the position of sterling  payments on income account  may be obtained, for a large part of the  other elements in the balance of payments, e.g., interest and dividend  payments are made between members of the sterling area and  consequently do not affect  the combined figures.
     52.  By the combined use of these three sources of information it should be possible to arrive at a judgment as to whether the existing level of the exchanges was satisfactory from the point of view of maintaining the balance of payments of  the  sterling  area in equilibrium.  We do not suggest that this is  the  sole criterion which  should govern exchange policy.  Account must be taken of the level of new investment, as contrasted with the transfer of securities, by members of the sterling area in countries outside  that area.   Moreover  it may from time to time be advisable when world trade is depressed for a strong financial group such as the sterling area should form, to acquiesce in some loss  of gold on income account in  the hope that the consequent improvement in the  financial  position elsewhere may lead to a higher level of  general activity.   By  similar reasoning- it may sometimes  be  advisable to attract gold on income  account against the possibility of  a subsequent depression in world trade.     53.  These  considerations are  likely to be of importance in the next twelve months, for a  number of events may occur within this period to affect the British balance of payments on current account, in a sense possibly distinct from the movements of international capital.   Foremost among these is the devaluation of the franc.  This will affect the foreign trade of the  sterling  area in two ways. In the first place, it may lead to  a general improvement in trade within  the gold bloc countries, and consequently to an increase in imports of raw materials, which would benefit not only the coal trade of  this country, but  the primary producers of the Empire also.   On the other hand, the competitive power of French industry would be increased, and a number  of our manufacturing  industries, notably the woollen industry,* would suffer some loss of exports.   Though we cannot foretell in advance.what will be the net effect of these two reactions,  experience of the American devaluation suggests that after a brief period of restocking, during which  the  purchases of the gold bloc countries  would be  affected much more strongly than their sales, devaluation would have  the effect of improving the French  balance  of  payments,  and of worsening the balance of payments of the sterling area as  a whole.  Moreover, within the sterling area itself,  it would, in the first instance, improve the position  of primary producers at the expense of Great Britain itself.     54.  A second, but minor, respect in which adjustment in the present  levelof exchanges may be called for in  the current year, arises from recent  changesin the  agricultural outlook in America.   The great reduction in the favourable balance of  payments of the United States on income account in 1935,. was,  in alarge measure, due to the contraction of agricultural exports, a contraction whichwas, to some degree, attributable to the drought of 1934, the effects of which mustsoon be beginning to pass away.  As an importer of agricultural produce, thiscountry stands to benefit from this; but in so far as the increased United Statesagricultural production enters into competition with the production  of countries within the sterling area, the effect is to require payments previously made in sterling to  be made in dollars and thus to weaken sterling against the dollar.     55.  Finally, the rearmament programme is a factor  the effect of which on the exchanges requires to be taken into account.   The fact that hitherto  thiscountry has been making smaller efforts in this direction than a great number of    * The effect of  the depreciation of sterling, and of the  British and other tariffs on Frenchexports of woollen goods may be seen from the following table.French exports of woollen goods.        1930-1934.

 other powers, has been an influence favourable to sterling;  for it has maintained the world prices of a number &quot;of our principal exports, the production of which calls for much the same kinds of plant and personnel as do armaments.  The extension of the British armament programme will probably enhance the prices of these products; but it will reduce the capacity of British factories available for production for the export market, and their competitive price  position.     56.   The  new gold system which is  emerging from  the experience  of the years since 1931, is still very imperfectly developed.   One of its main features to-day is, as we have observed,  the very extravagant use of gold.  According to the recent report of the Union Corporation the stock of gold in central banks and treasuries, excluding any held by exchange equalisation  funds  or  in  private hoards,  has increased from just over 500 million ounces to nearly 650 million ounces.  At the same time, thanks to the devaluation of a number of the principal currencies, and to  the fall of prices  expressed in terms of the currencies which have not devalued, 60 ounces of gold to-day can  do the work-of 100 before the depression.  Thus  the effective supply of gold is now twice as great as in 1929. Moreover, the  yearly  rate of increase  in  the stock of monetary gold has risen from 13-6 million  ounces  or 2-5 per cent, of the total supply  in 1929 to 34-3 million ounces or 4-7 per cent,  of the present supply; and even so, the outlook for the future is for an increase in  output nearly in proportion to the  growth in the stock of gold, for some years to come.   South African production should increase from approximately 11  million ounces to-day to 15  million ounces within the next five or six years; and the Russian output will, it is claimed, increase from 5^ million ounces in 1935, to 10 or 11 million ounces by the end of 1936. Altogether it is anticipated that world production of gold mav rise to 40 million ounces by 1940.     57.   Should the supply of monetary gold increase to, say, 850 million ounces in the near future,  it is clear that the surplus of gold over the legal requirements of  central banks might easily amount to  between 300 and 400 million ounces, which at present prices would have a value  of between 2,000  and 3,000 million pounds.  Having regard to the scale  on which movements of speculative capital appear  to take place, this would  constitute  an ample balancing  fund against currency  disorders  due to capital  movements.  At the same time such a  fund might not be altogether excessive.  The new use which has been found for gold as the medium for balancing international movements of  capital is, perhaps, the main explanation of the paradox of the comparative stability of  gold prices at a level far below that prevailing in 1929, in spite of a very  considerable increase in the available supplies of monetary gold.                   (b) Rearmament and the economic outlook.    58.  In our eighteenth report, written in July of last year, we took the viewthat the  present period of comparatively good trade would  be brought to  a closeby the falling-off in the demand  for house-building.  That such a falling-off willoccur, and that it will be a serious aggravation of the next depression, we stillbelieve.   But  in view  of  the programme for  the expansion  of the nationalarmaments announced by the government, we cannot feel confident that the onsetof the next general  depression will coincide with the onset of a depression in thehouse building industry.    59.  It will be recalled that in our eighteenth report  we anticipated thatthere might be &apos;&apos; a  substantial decline in building activity in many areas beforethe end of 1936,&quot; and that &quot;this will have become general before the end of 1937.&quot;If this anticipation proves correct, house building will be falling off just at thetime when the  armament expenditure will  be making its greatest demands uponemployment. It is  unlikely that, in these circumstances, the building depressionwill lead to a general depression.  Though  we  should expect to see an increase in umemployment  in the building and allied  industries themselves, it may not,  on balance, be associated with an increase in  unemployment in other industries.2,  Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,          June 1936.
