THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.SECRET.CP. 185 (36)Copy No,REGULATION OP Y/AGES IN TRANSPORT OP GOODS BY ROAD.MEMORANDUM BY MINISTERS OP LABOUR AND TRANSPORT.     The attached memorandum describes the present position with regard tothe regulation of wages and conditions of service in the transport of goodsoy roado  The existing statutory provisions are not working satisfactorily and strong representations have been made to us by responsiblerepresentatives of both sides of the industry in support of further legislation in the direction of making agreed wages and conditions compulsory.     VThile agreeing that an early remedy must be found for the  present difficulties, we thinlc that the matter needs further ventilation, and thatan opportunity should be given for conflicting views to be expressed, beforeproposals can be framed by us.  We therefore propose, if none of our colleagues objects/ to set up a small committee of independent persons of standing, with the following terms of reference:-&quot;To examine the present position in regard to the regulationof wages and conditions of service of persons employed in connectionwith the carriage of goods by road (whether in vehicles authorisedunder &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; or &quot;C&quot; licences) and to make recommendations as to theaction which it is desirable to take&quot;.(Intldj) )E.B.(Intld.)

                  WAGES  AND  CONDITIONS  OF  EMPLOYMENT.I.  Existing Powers of Regulation.   1.   Apart from the safety limitation of drivers1 hours imposed by Section 19   of  the Road Traffic Act, 1930, which has effected some curtailment of excessive   hours but cannot be regarded as setting a standard for a working week, the   statutory requirement concerning wages and conditions of employment are as   followso   2.   Section 93 of the Road Traffic Act, 1930, provided  (l)  that  the wages   paid and the conditions of employment observed by the holder of any road service   licence (passenger transport) shall not be less favourable than the wages which   would be  payable and the conditions which would have to  be observed under a   contract  which compiled with the Pair Wages Clause applicable to  Government   contracts,  and (2) that any organisation representative  of the persons engaged   in the road transport industry may make representations  to the Traffic Conpissionei   to the effect that the wages paid to, or the conditions  of employment  of, any  persons employed by the holder of any road service licence arc not in  accordance  with the  above requirements, and that if the matter in dispute is not  otherwise  disposed  of it shall be referred by the Minister of Labour to the Industrial  Court for settlement.  3.   Section 32 of the Road and Rail Traffic Act,  1933,  extended  the operation  of Section  95  of the Road Traffic Act,. 1930, so  that the Pair Wages requirement &apos;                                                                                    ; j  should apply in relation to  persons employed as  drivers  or statutory attendants  of authorised vehicles by the  holder of an &quot;A&quot;  (public carriers&apos;) licence or of  a &quot;B&quot;  (limited carriers&apos;) licence.    It also provided that where  any matter is  referred  to  the Industrial Court under Section  93  the Court,  in arriving  at its  decision, shall have  regard  to  any determination which may be brought  to  its  notice  relating to  the wages or conditions  of service of persons  employed in a  capacity  similar to  that  of  the persons  to whom  the  reference relates  and  contained in a  decision of a Joint  Industrial Council, Conciliation Board or other&apos;-  similar body, or in an agreement between organisations representative  of  employers and workpeopl g -  4.  Section 93 of the  1930 Act provided that if the  Industrial Court decides  that the licence holder has been guilty  of a breach of the Pair Wages requirement  he shall be liable to be  dealt  with  as if he had failed  to comply with a. condition                                    1.
Illattached to his licence.    Section 13 of the 1933 Act gives to the licensing authority, in certain circumstances,  and subject to appeal to the Minister ofTransport, power to revoke or suspend a licence on the ground that a conditionattached to the licence has not been complied with.   Section 9 of the same Actprovides that any person who fails to comply with a condition of a licence shallbe guilty of an offence for which penalties are provided (by Section 35 of theAct) on conviction under the Summary Jurisdiction Acts.The National Joint Conciliation Board (England and Wales).5.   During the passage of the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, an undertakingwas given on behalf of the Government in the House of Lords on 7th November, 1933(by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Earl ofPlymouth) in the following terms:-     n......my Right Honourable friend, the Minister of Labour,      proposes to consult with the organisations of employers and      workpeople with a view to the establishment of a joint voluntary      body or bodies which will have as their object the settlement of      proper working conditions.   It is to the interest of all con-      cerned that such agreed conditions should be settled and every      effort will be made to establish a position in which this will      be possible.6.   In pursuance of this undertaking the National Joint Concilation board for the Road Motor Transport Industry (Goods) was inaugurated in March,  1934.It was not possible, owing to the low state of organisation in the industryto establish a Joint Industrial Council but all the members of the Board werenominated by organisations and were themselves experienced and authoritativepersons.   The inaugural meeting was  attended by the Ministers of Labour andTransport (Sir Henry Betterton and Mr. Oliver Stanley) and the Minister ofLabour at this meeting said:-     &quot;The Road and Rail Traffic Acts  require the observance of fair     wages and conditions in the case of drivers or statutory     attendants of vehicles employed by holders of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; licences.     It will be your  task not only to agree as to what should be fair     wages and conditions but also to do all in your power so to organise     the industry that the aspiration becomes a fact.   I do not think I     would be guilty of an unjustifiable paradox if I said that the limited     measure of compulsion in the Act was put there by Parliament with the     primary object of stimulating the voluntary system of collective     bargaining to the fullest possible extent.   The complexities of your     industry make your task a formidiable one.   When you are dealing with     on industry which has developed with such rapidity as the Road Haxilage     Industry, it is natural to find a good many divergences in local     practice which can only be resolved in the direction of uniformity by     way of careful study and well considered action.&quot;
                                                                        119                                                                        -i 1 &amp; 7.   This National Board drew up a standard set of working conditions and laid down the principle on which the country should be graded for the purposes of wages.   Area Boards were set up for the respective Traffic Areas and were entrusted with the task of grading their areas, a temporary arrangement being put into operation pending settlement of final grading.   The date originally fixed for the operation of final grading was postponed again and again until finally it was fixed for 1st January, 1936.   In four areas the task of grading was successfully accomplished but no agreement was reached in the remaining six areas, and in accordance with the provisions contained in decisions of the National Board the matter was referred to an AppealsCommittee.    The Appeals Committee reached decisions in five of the areas but in the case of Yorkshire no agreement was reached and the independent Chairman issued an award in pursuance of powers conferred upon him by the Board.   In some cases  the operation of finally grading was extended to 1st April and in others to  1st October, 1936.8.   During the course of the period of over two years which have elapsed since the inauguration of the National Conciliation Board it became increasingly evident that there was only a remote prospect of achievinguniform acceptance and observance of the decisions concerning the rates andconditions.    The evidence of employers and workers, and of licensing authorities is conclusively to the effect that over the greater part of thecountry there is non-observances of those decisions on the part of a majority of the holders of &quot;A&quot;  and &quot;B&quot; licences.9.   At the request of the National Conciliation Board a deputation wasreceived by the Ministers of Labour and Transport on 24th March, 1936, when the Board emphasised the difficulties of the present situation and pressed for the introduction of legislation endowing its agreements with statutoryforce or such other means as the Ministers might consider advisable, due regard being paid to the position of the &quot;C&quot;  licence holder. 10.   in Scotland a separate Conciliation Board was established and this Boardhas reached a permanent agreement.    Difficulties are known to have arisen  in securing observance of the fair wages provisions of the statute but these difficulties have not, so far, been the subject of representation to theDepartments.                                      3,
1191 1*3III. Difficulties of the Present Position.    11.  First among the difficulties is the low level of organisation of the    employers and the workers.   The road motor haulage industry is a new and    still rapidly expanding industry, the personnel having increased by some 50%    in the last twelve years.   The average number of vehicles per &quot;A&quot; licence    at the end of 1935 was 3.49 and the corresponding number per &quot;Bw was barely    half of this.   On one traffic Area (Northern) 47% of the &quot;A&quot; licence holders    and 72% of the &quot;B&quot; licence holders operated only one vehicle and the    percentages of those operating 2, 3 or 4 vehicles were 39 and 25 respectively.    It is not surprising,  therefore,  that organisation among both employers and    workers is weak,  and,  among employers,  unstable.    It has been roughly    estimated that only some 15$ of the licence holders in the industry are in    fact members of the various existing organisations of employers.    12.   The industry is almost entirely without a background of such voluntary    collective bargaining as is found in older industries.   While the National    Board set up with Government encouragement is theoretically better equipped    than it could have been without the inducement offered by Section 32 of the    Road and Rail Traffic Act,  1933,  in actual fact it lacks the stability and    authority which are normally to be found in machinery which is based upon    organised and collective strength of both sides.    13.   The cumbersome nature of the machinery for enforcing the Fair Wages    requirement and the lack of finality tend to influence the minds of those    employers who seek to avoid the decisions of the National Conciliation Board.    The initial step in the process of enforcement is necessarily by way of    representation to the Licensing Authority;   that  Authority has no power to    intervene unless and until representations have been made.    The right to make    representations is confined to representative organisations whose ability to    proceed is largely nullified by the reluctance of the workers directly    concerned to run the risk of victimisation and possible loss of livelihood    as a result of giving the necessary evidence.   Even when representations    have been made,  the Licensing Authority cannot act in the matter unless and    until a decision has been given by the  Industrial Court that an employer has       fact been guilty of a breach of the  statutory  requirements.    Moreover,  if       authoritative  decision in the  case of a  particular employer has  been                                        4.
Difficulties of the Present Position.11.  First among the difficulties is the low level of organisation of theemployers and the workers.   The road motor haulage industry is a new and still rapidly expanding industry, the personnel having increased by some 50$in the last twelve years.   The average number of vehicles per &quot;A&quot; licenceat the end of 1935 was 3.49 and the corresponding number per MBn was barelyhalf of this.   On one traffic Area (Northern) 47$ of the &quot;A&quot; licence holdersand 72$ of the &quot;B&quot; licence holders operated only one vehicle and thepercentages of those operating 2, 3 or 4 vehicles were 39 and 25 respectively.It is not surprising,  therefore, that organisation among both employers and workers is weak,  and,  among employers,  unstable.    It has been roughlyestimated that only some 15$ of the licence holders in the industry are infact members of the various existing organisations of employers.12.   The industry is almost entirely without a background of such voluntarycollective bargaining as is found in older industries.    While the national board set up with Government encouragement is theoretically better equippedthan it could have been without the inducement offered by Section 32 of &quot;theRoad and Rail Traffic Act,  1933, in actual fact it lacks the stability and authority which are normally to be found in machinery which is based uponorganised and collective strength of both sides.13.   The cumbersome nature of the machinery for enforcing the Pair Wagesrequirement and the lack of finality tend to influence  the minds of thoseemployers who seek to avoid the decisions of the National Conciliation Board.The initial step in the process of enforcement is necessarily by way of representation to the Licensing Authority;   that Authority has no power to intervene unless and until representations have been made.    The right to make representations is confined to representative organisations whose ability toproceed is largely nullified by the reluctance of the workers directly concerned to run the risk of victimisation and possible loss of livelihoodas a result of giving the necessary evidence.    Even when representationshave been made,  the Licensing Authority cannot act in the matter unless anduntil a decision has been given by the  Industrial Court that an employer hasin fact been guilty of a breach of the  statutory requirements.    Moreover,  ifan authoritative  decision in the case of a  particular employer has  been
obtained in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Acts, thatdecision docs not apply automatically to other employers in tho same Area,,The Licensing Authority must, await decisions in respect of each employerseparately before he can take action.  The decision of the Industrial Courtdocs not settle the general position as to fair wages and all complaints mustgo through the same.procedure even though in similar cases the wages paid mayhave been declared &quot;unfair&quot;.  Moreover, a change of circumstances may be putforward by an employer to justify a reduction in wages and the wholeprocedure must be started again.   In the two years which have elapsed sincethe National Conciliation Board was established only one cceeihas been referred to the Industrial Court,   Finally, it is  to be noted that even werethe machinery of enforcement free  from defect there is no means of securingarrears of wages for the workers  concerned and that the penalty for non-compliance (i,o, revocation or suspension of licence) falls upon the workers,who may lose their employment,  as  well as upon the employer.&quot;C&quot; Licence-holders,14*   The National Conciliation Board had originally (August 1934) expressedthe hope that its recommendations  concerning wages and conditions ofemployment to be observed by the holders of &quot;A&quot;  and &quot;B&quot; licences would be reflected in the wages and conditions of emplojinent observed by the remainingclass of licence holders, but in March,  1936? the  Board represented thattraders wore effecting considerable economies by dispensing with the services provided by the professional haulage contractor  and operating their own orhired vehicles under a &quot;C&quot; licence, a lower rate of wages being paid,15*   On the other hand,  several large associations of employers holding &quot;C&quot;licences have represented that no  action be taken  to bring  &quot;C&quot;  licenceholders within the statutory requirements as to  wages and conditions ofemployment on the grounds that  such requirements would cut  across the  systems of negotiation which  exist in the  particular industries and that the vehiclesare not continuously  employed and  tho  drivers are  engaged on work other thandriving.
