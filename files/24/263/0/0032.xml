General           4111D. C.THE WAR OFFICE,    23rd July, 1936.                ANGLO-GERMAN-FRENCH  WAR GRAVES AGREEMENT    1. In a Memorandum which I addressed to you  last December and which1  youcirculated among the  members of the Cabinet, * I traced the  successive stages in  thenegotiations leading  to the  conclusion  of the  Anglo-German-French War  GravesAgreement of 20th December, 1935.    Before reporting further progress, I  have waited  until this Agreement had beenfruitful of practical results and had survived the danger common to such international agreements.    2. Under Article 7 of the Agreement a Mixed Committee was set up composed ofrepresentatives appointed by each of the three parties concerned.   After some hesitationon the German side, it was arranged for the first meeting of this Committee to be heldin London on 8th June, and, at the suggestion of the French, it was,  as the inauguralmeeting,  attended by honorary  as well as  by official  members.   The following werepresent :          Lord Trenchard ; Generaloberst von Seeckt  and  Prince Otto von Bismarck    (in the place of  the late German Ambassador in London) ; M. Roger  Cambon    (representing the French Ambassador in London)  and General  Guillaumat, who    had been delegated by the French Government to represent the French Ambassador    in Berlin.   The  British Ambassador in  Berlin was unavoidably prevented from    attending.   The  following Official  members  were  also present : (British) Sir    Fabian Ware, Sir George Macdonogh,  Sir Edward Peacock and Mr. J. J. Lawson  ;    (German) Dr. Barandon (representing Dr. Gaus, the  head  of the  Legal  Depart-    ment of the German Ministry for Foreign Affairs), Herr Rodiger (the head of the    Department  of  the  German  Ministry  for  Foreign  Affairs responsible for the    Official  German War  Graves Organization)  Herr  Horning  (the  head of the    Official German  War Graves  Organization)  and  Dr. Eulen (the  Leader of the    Yolksbund, a semi-official organization, largely supported by voluntary contribu-    tion,  for the care  and maintenance of German  War Cemeteries and graves)  ;    (French) General Vincensini, the  head of the French Service  des  Sepultures    Militaires.CP. 242 (35) ; Cabinet Meeting 1 (36), Conclusion 10.
      3. Lord  Trenchard, on behalf of the British members,  welcomed  their German  and French guests and General  Guillaumat and Generaloberst  von Seeckt replied.  Lord Trenchard&apos;s speech concluded with the words :            &quot; I believe that the formation of  this Committee may prove to be, in its way,      a turning point in human affairs.   We have&apos; already, each in the manner which      seemed to us most fitting, honoured our fallen comrades.   May it not be  that in      this wider remembrance of them all, and  in common and constant recalling of their      heroism and  their sacrifice, we may be permitted to hear their voice speaking for      themselves and guiding our feet into the way of peace ? &quot;      4. The most important item on the Agenda  was  the  final approval,  by all  three  parties as was necessary, of a form of permanent memorial for  German graves in British  cemeteries in France, which  hitherto have  only  been marked  by wooden crosses.  - On  the adoption of the report by the Secretary-General on this matter, the German members  undertook that  the  requisite number of headstones  should  be  manufactured  and  despatched with as little delay as possible.   It is most gratifying that this  undertaking  has  now   been implemented and that the first consignment of stones  has  been  received in France, admitted by the French authorities free of  duty, and a number have  actually been erected in the British Cemetery at  Armentieres.   The  erection of  these.  headstones on French soil, thanks to the initiative of the Governments of  the  British  Empire, will be regarded as an event  of far  reaching importance by those who have  watched the  relations  of the French and  German Governments since  the War in  connection with the care of German graves in French territory in accordance with the  terms  of the Treaty of Versailles.      5. Among other  subjects discussed at  the Meeting was  the permanent marking  and care of German war graves in the British Isles.  After the meeting had broken up,  Dr. Eulen, Herr B.odiger and Dr. Tischler, the Architect of the Volksbund, accompanied  by Major  H. F. Chettle (the Secretary-General of the Committee) made a ten days&apos; tour  of inspection of the cemeteries in the United Kingdom in which German war graves are  situated.  As a result of the tour, the German  members are submitting recommendations  to their Government for the improvement of the general appearance of these cemeteries  at the  cost of the German Government.      6. The  satisfactory relations which  have  now  been  established between the  Imperial War Graves Commission and  the German authorities in the work  of caring  for British War Cemeteries in Germany, have led to permission,  overcoming legitimate  objection and difficulty, to reconstruct the British  War Cemetery in Berlin, situated in  a pine  wood, so that, as all our cemeteries in France and Belgium, it may reproduce the  effect of an English garden which has given  such  general satisfaction.      7. It was also agreed at the meeting  that an inscription  should be carved on the  gateway to our cemeteries in Germany making it clear to the German public that these  cemeteries had  been constructed by the Governments of  the  British Commonwealth at  their own cost and were maintained by British personnel.      8. The members  of the  Committee were received by His  Majesty the King at  Buckingham Palace, and by the Duke of York (President of the Commission) and the  Duchess of York  at 145,  Piccadilly,  on the  afternoon of  9th  June.   They  were  entertained at  luncheon on the  same  day by  the German Charge d&apos;Affaires.  The  military members  were  entertained at luncheon by the Chief of the Imperial General  Staff on 8th J une.      9. On the afternoon of Sth J une, Generaloberst von Seeckt and General  Guillaumat,  on behalf  of the German and French members  respectively, laid a wreath at the&apos;Cenotaph.  The German wreath was placed first, the  French wreath a quarter of an  hour later,  when  the French representative  expressed the  desire  to lay  his wreath alongside the  German wreath, the French and  the  German national colours thus appearing side by  side for the first time on our National Memorial to the dead of the Great War.      10. The text of Generaloberst von Seeckt&apos;s speech, containing a reference to the  possibility of future wars, is attached as an appendix to this  memorandum.                                            (signed)    FABIAN  WARE,                                                                  Vice- Ch airman.  IMPERIAL WAR GRAVES COMMISSION,       32,  GROSVENOR GARDENS,                      LONDON, S.W. 1.      2Ut July, 1936.
                                      APPENDIX SPEECH  OF GENERALOBERST VON SEECKT AT THE  INAUGURAL  MEETING OF THE          ANGLO-GERMAN-FRENCH MIXED COMMITTEE, ON 8TH JUNE, 1936    &quot;Within the English Cemeteries there are the last resting places of many a German soldier  side by side with the dead of  this vast Empire and  in France, British and German soldiers are buried in  great numbers along with the  children of the soil.  The  comradeship of  Death  has succeeded  the strenuous fight of the living.    In the course of the flowing time it may be again that man will fight  against man, if his country and his honour require the fighting, but after the fight has been fought even to the bitter end, the former enemies will be able to  shake hands in mutual esteem and  in sympathy, deploringtheir dead.    Thus the opponents of War will grow into Comrades in Peace we are assembled in order tostrengthen this bond.  Our aim is to honour our dead in holding their memories sacred by faithfullykeeping their resting places, and also the hope that after the enormous and painful  sacrifices of theGreat War, the result may be a  long period of human  comradeship and peace.&quot;(B36/8)  70 7/36  W.O.P. 9733
