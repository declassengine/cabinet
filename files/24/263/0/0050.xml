I CIRCULATE to the Cabinet a paper prepared in  the Foreign Officeregarding the preparations for the proposed conference  of the  five LocarnoAugust 19, 1936.        PREPARATIONS  FOR  THE  PROPOSED  FIVE-POWER                              CONFERENCE.     THE  London communique  of the 23rd July, referring to the proposed meeting of the five  Locarno  Powers, described  the agenda of the proposed Conference in the  following terms :           &apos;&apos; The first business to be undertaken should .... be to negotiate a new     agreement to  take the place of the Rhine Pact of Locarno, and to resolve,     through the  collaboration of  all concerned,  the  situation created by  the     German initiative of the 7th March.&quot;     After stating that it was intended to approach the German and Italian Governments with a  view to obtaining their participation in the meeting thus proposed, the communique continued as follows :           &quot; If  progress can  be made  at this meeting, other matters  affecting     European peace  will necessarily come  under discussion.  In such circum-     stances, it would be natural to look forward to the widening of the area of     the discussion in such a manner as to  facilitate,  with the  collaboration of     the other interested Powers, the settlement of those problems the solution of     which is essential to the peace of Europe.&quot;     The primary  objects of the  forthcoming Conference  are, therefore,  (1) to negotiate a new Western Pact, and (2) to resolve the situation created by  the German initiative  of  the 7th March; it is intended, however, that the discussion of these two problems should lead to the discussion of wider  problems affecting European peace.     The present paper is a  first attempt to state the facts of the situation as affecting the programme  of  the  forthcoming Conference, and  to examine the wider questions  which arise  therefrom.     Now that the German and Italian Governments have accepted in principle the invitations for a Five-Power Conference, it  is a matter of considerable urgency to put in hand  the preparatory work required  to clear the ground before theproposed Conference can take place.  As the  Secretary of State said in his speech in the House of Commons on the 27th July :           &apos;&apos; If our invitations  are accepted, then there should be an agreement in     general terms  on our objectives.  But -the methods of realising them will     still require much study and consultation.   Much work through the diplo-     matic channel will be called  for before  the  meeting of the five Powers can     take place.  Many obstacles yet remain to be surmounted.&quot;     As  a matter  of  fact, before we  can embark upon  any such  study and consultation through  the  diplomatic  channel  it will be  necessary  for  HisMajesty&apos;s Government to decide on the general lines which they themselves would wish to follow.   This  will involve the examination of a variety of questions, andthe formulation of certain general principles.  It would seem desirable that his powers.A. E.[13707-4]B
Majesty&apos;s Government should reach the necessary decisions without delay.  Other-wise, the French and Belgian Governments may be the first to lay down general principles for the coming negotiations, and thus deprive us of the initiative whichit is highly desirable that we should retain.     The probable  attitude of France and Germany emerges from  the review ofthe situation which now follows.   Belgium may be expected to follow  on thewhole the line  taken by His Majesty&apos;s. Government.   As  regards  Italy, it isdifficult at present to foretell what attitude she will adopt.  It will largely be governed by the extent to which when the time comes she finds herself co-operating with  Germany  in  international  affairs, and thereby bound to support german policy so long as the latter does not directly conflict with Italian vital interests.     The possible reactions of the Spanish question on relations between Germanyand France and Italy are impossible to estimate at the present juncture, but mayhave an important influence on  the Five-Power negotiations.         ELEMENTS IN THE  NEGOTIATION OF THE NEW WESTERN PACT.                            (i)  Treaty of Locarno.    Under the Treaty of Locarno, Germany  and Belgium, and Germany andFrance, mutually undertook &apos;&apos; in no case to attack or invade each other or  resort to war against each other &apos;&apos;; and  the five  Powers  collectively and  severallyguaranteed the frontiers of  Germany  and Belgium and Germany and France;and, in the event of a violation of either of these frontiers, each of the  five Powersundertook to come  to the immediate assistance of that one of their number  whosefrontier  had been  violated.   Thus,  the Treaty of Locarno comprised a non-aggression undertaking by  Germany as against Belgium  and France, and  byBelgium and France as  against Germany,  and a general undertaking to  assistthe victim of aggression in  the event of a violation by Germany of the Belgianor French frontiers or by France or Belgium of the German frontier.  It did not provide for any guarantee in the event of an attack on the United Kingdom oron Italy.                        (ii) The  Proposed Air Pact.    The Air  Pact  first  proposed in  the Anglo-French  communique of  the3rd February,  1935,  and of which  British,  French and German drafts were subsequently  elaborated,  was  based on  a  different  principle.   Its purpose was a guarantee by each of the five contracting Powers &apos;&apos; immediately to give theassistance of their air forces to whichever of them might be the victim of unpro-provoked aerial aggression by  one of the contracting parties.&quot;   The intention was  to  guard  against  sudden attack by air  by providing  for  immediate assistance  by  other  parties  in  the  event  of  such  aerial  attack:  this assistance  to  be   rendered not  only  to  France,  Belgium and  Germany,but   also to   the   two   guarantor  Powers  of   the  Treaty  of  Locarno the  United  Kingdom  and Italy.    In  the  negotiations  which  followed the Anglo-French  proposal  for an Air Pact, it was agreed that arrangements would be made to provide that these  mutual assistance obligations would  notapply as between the United Kingdom and Italy.  Thus the important distinctionbetween the Air Pact and the Locarno Treaty was, so far as we were concerned,the guarantee of assistance which the Air Pact would have  secured for us fromGermany in the event of a Belgian or French attack on the United Kingdom, andfrom Belgium and  France in the event of a German attack.                     (iii) German Proposals of March  7.    On the 7th March, 1936, the German Government proposed, &apos;&apos; for the purposeof ensuring the sanctity and inviolability of the boundaries in  the West,&quot; a25-year non-aggression pact between Germany, France and Belgium;  the UnitedKingdom and Italy were to guarantee this Treaty, and the  possibility of  theinclusion of the Netherlands was left open.   The German Government were alsoready to conclude  an Air Pact,  presumably on the lines proposed in February1935, thus giving the United Kingdom, as well as the other contracting parties,guarantees against unprovoked aerial attack.  Further, the German Governmentwere ready &quot; to enter at once into negotiations with France and Belgium withregard to the creation of a  zone demilitarized on  both  sides, and to  agree  inadvance to any suggestion regarding the depth and nature thereof on the basisof full parity.&quot;
               (iv) Anglo-Franco-Belgian Proposals of March 19.    According to the Proposals of the 19th March, it was agreed to examine theGerman proposals of the 7th March, to consider the  future of the Rhinelandand to press during the negotiations for the limitation of  fortifications in the rhineland, and to draw up mutual assistance pacts open to all the signatories of locarno.  &quot; So far  as  concerns the Four Powers  represented  in  London, the reinforcement of  their security provided for will include, in particular, obliga-tions of mutual assistance between Belgium, France,  the United Kingdom andItaly, or any of them, with suitable provisions to ensure prompt action by the signatories in case of need as well as technical arrangements for the preparationof such measures as would ensure the effective execution  of the obligationsundertaken.&quot;                     (v)  German Proposals of March 31.    Finally, in their memorandum  of the 31st  March, the German government proposed that Germany, Belgium, France, the United Kingdom and Italy should agree &apos;&apos; to enter into discussions, under the leadership of the British  Government,for the  conclusion of a twenty-five years&apos; non-aggression pact or security pactbetween France and Belgium, on the one hand, and Germany on the other &apos;&apos;; thatthe United Kingdom and Italy should sign this pact as guarantors; that germany should assume  such  special obligations  to render military assistance as should arise  out  of these agreements; that there should be  an Air  Pact;  that theNetherlands should be included in the proposed Western arrangement, if desired;and that an international Court  of Arbitration should be set up to ensure the observance of  the  above  agreements.   The relevant  sections of  the  GermanProposals of the 31st March are shown in Annex  I. ELEMENTS  IN  THE NEGOTIATION OE A SETTLEMENT  TO  RESOLVE  THE SITUATION              CREATED BY THE GERMAN  INITIATIVE OF  MARCH 7.    All that  Germany has offered so  far is the reciprocal and  provisionalarrangement for the four months which expired  on the 1st August (points 2-8of the German  Proposals of the 31st March), and the declaration in point (9) ofthe German Proposals of the 31st  March, that the German  Government  &quot; are willing, on the basis of complete reciprocity, to  agree  with  their two Westernneighbours to any military limitation on the German Western frontier.&quot;    On the other  hand, according to our letter of the 1st April to the French and belgian Governments, we stated that, if the effort of conciliation attempted in theproposals of the 19th March should fail, His Majesty&apos;s  Government     &quot; (a)  Will at once consider, in consultation with your Government and the           French Government, the steps to be taken to meet the new situation           thus created;    &quot; (6)  Will immediately come  to the  assistance  of  your Government,  in           accordance with  the Treaty  of Locarno, in respect of any  measures          which  shall be jointly decided upon;    &quot; (c) Will, in return for reciprocal  assurances from your Government,  take,           m consuita tion with your Government,  all practical measures available          to His Majesty&apos;s Government for the purpose of ensuring the security          of your country against unprovoked aggression;    &quot; (d)  Will, for this purpose, establish or continue  the contact  between the          General Staffs of our two countries contemplated in paragraph III (2)          of the  said arrangement.&quot;Since then we have maintained, and the  French and Belgian Governments  have accepted, the view that, although the German Government have rejected theproposals of  the 19th March for  resolving the situation created by Germany&apos;sreoccupation of the Rhineland, nevertheless, the effort of conciliation should not&apos;beconsidered to have failed in  view of the attempt now being made to call together the Five-Power Conference.    As  regards the meaning  of  the words &apos;&apos; through  the collaboration of allconcerned,&quot;  which appear in the communique of the 23rd July, in connectionwith the proposal to negotiate a new agreement to  resolve the situation created bythe German initiative of the 7th March, it has been explained to  the Germain      [13707-4]                                                B 2
Charge d&apos;Affaires in London that this merely means that it is our desire that thenew agreement should be negotiated by the five Powers together and not by thethree,  and- that there was no intention of inviting  more  than the five Powers tocarry through this particular piece of work.                         QUESTIONS  FOE DECISION.     In order  that the Foreign Office may make the necessary preparations forthe forthcoming conference, it will be necessary for us to be clear with regard tothe  general line  of  policy which we wish to adopt in respect of  the  various questions which are  bound to arise.  The more important of these questions areenumerated below.  From the preliminary explanatory comments  attached  to each of these questions it will be seen that at least eight, viz.,  questions 4,  5, 6,7, 9,  10,  11  and 12, require examination  by the Committee of  ImperialDefence, and  steps  are  being taken to refer these  points to the  Committee.As soon as a general line of policy has been settled, the Foreign Office will be ina  position  to take  the  initiative  with the  other  Governments  concerned,probably by communicating  to  them,  for their consideration,  a memorandumregarding  the various questions at  issue.    It is  hoped  that  in this  way.London may become a kind of clearing house for the purpose of these preliminary discussions, and that the other Governments concerned may agree to communicatetheir views to us in the first instance for co-ordination and circulation.     It seems as yet premature to endeavour to make any arrangements regardingthe time and place of the proposed conference.  These matters of detail will haveto be left until the preparatory discussions through the diplomatic channel havereached an advanced stage.     The following are the fundamental questions  which now  seem  to call  forconsideration : (1) Should the new agreement simply reproduce the old Locarno Treaty, with       the omission of all reference to the Demilitarised Zone?Comments.     To judge by the language of the German proposals of the 31st March, it looksas though Germany wishes to reproduce the framework of the Locarno Treaty(i.e., non-aggression pact between Germany and France and Belgium, guaranteed by Great Britain and Italy), but it is equally probable that she will be opposed inthe new agreement to the machinery  provided for  in the  old  Locarno Treaty(i.e., the rble of the League Council  in deciding aggression).  She may even objectto the renewal of the arbitration treaties with France and Belgium,  at  any ratein their present form, since they provide for the use of the Permanent Court ofInternational Justice.  We, on the other hand, would be in favour of  altering the framework of the  old  agreement  (as  shown in  the  comments  on the ensuingquestions), and would prefer to preserve its machinery both as regards the Councilof the League and the arbitration conventions (though it would not seem  essential for us to insist on the use of the Permanent Court of International Justice if someother suitable tribunal were suggested as an alternative).(2) What machinery  should the  new  agreement  contain for  bringing the       guarantees into operation?   Should the  League be employed  for this       purpose in the same way as in the old Locarno Treaty ?Comments.    In the new agreement there must clearly be some authority to decide if andwhen an act of unprovoked aggression  has  been committed.   To judge  fromGermany&apos;s proposals of  the  31st March, this authority is  to  be the new inter-national court of arbitration mentioned  below, under Question (3),  and would thus replace the League Council which fulfils  this role under the old  locarno treaty. It is a moot question whether it would be possible for us to agree to theLeague Council being deposed in this fashion.  In any case, the proposal to create a new court will again raise the question put in paragraph 11 of our Questionnaire(Annex TI).
(4)  Do we wish in the new agreement to be guaranteed ourselves instead of being      merely a guarantor ?   If so,  against whom and by whom are we to be      guaranteed ?Comments.    We presumably wish in the new agreement to be guaranteed  by France  andpossibly Belgium (and this  would, for  the sake  of  equality,  involve equally aguarantee by Germany).  But the fact of our being a guaranteed  Power as wellas a guarantor would involve considerable modification in the  scheme  of the oldLocarno Treaty.  Among other things, if we were  to enjoy the  advantages of guarantees,  we should probably be  required to conclude non-aggression  pactsand arbitration treaties with France, Belgium and Germany.    The  C.I.D. are being asked to consider the implications of our acceptanceof a guarantee from France,  Belgium and Germany.(5)  Should the Irish Free State participate in the new agreement ?Comments.    The position  of the Irish Free  State  would  appear to require  special consideration.  The Dominions are not parties to Locarno, but  in view of the growing importance of military aviation the Irish Free State, on account of itsgeographical position, may  be concerned  in  the new Western  Pact.  Thecounsellor of the French Embassy in London has, in  fact, informed the ForeignOffice that the Permanent Head of the Irish Free State Department for external affairs has recently raised with the French  Minister in Dublin the question ofthe  Free State&apos;s collaboration in any new mutual guarantee treaty for western europe.    This question is  being referred to the C.I.D.(6)  Is Italy to be  guaranteed?  If so, against whom and by whom?Comments.    Under the old Locarno Treaty we and Italy were the two guarantor Powers.If now we become a guaranteed Power it would be difficult to refuse the sameadvantage to Italy if she asked for it.  But it may be taken for granted that mno circumstances would we or Belgium be prepared to guarantee Italy, so thatin effect  Italy would only be  guaranteed by  France against Germany,  and by     There is also the case of a flagrant violation to be considered.  We would have presumably to resist any attempt by Germany to argue that, in  such a case, no assistance could be given to the victim of aggression until the new &apos;&apos; international court of arbitration  &quot; had given its verdict. (3) Should the new agreement contain provisions for arbitration and conciliation       as does the old Locarno Treaty ? Comments.     The old Locarno Treaty contained arbitration conventions between Germany and (1) Belgium, (2) France, (3) Poland, (4) Czechoslovakia.  It is probable that Germany would refuse  to discuss at the Five-Power Conference the renewal of (3) and (4), since  this would at once bring Czechoslovakia and Poland into the Conference.  On the other hand, France will probably insist on such a renewal. The best line might be to endeavour to secure our aims through the acceptance of Herr Hitler&apos;s offer to conclude agreements  by  direct negotiation  with  all Germany&apos;s neighbours,  instead of as part of the Western Pact.  As regards (1),and (2), Germany will probably agree to renewal on condition, to quote the German proposals of the 31st March, that provision is made for the &quot; constitution of an international court of arbitration which shall have competence in respect of the observance of  the  various agreements concluded.&quot;
Germany against France.  Whether France would undertake this obligation with-out our co-operation is a doubtful point.  The whole of this question is  beingreferred to the C.I.D. -(7) Should  Belgium be relieved of giving any guarantee and her commitments       limited to an undertaking to defend her own territory \ Comments.     Recent unofficial hints show that in certain quarters in Belgium there is a desire that Belgium should be relieved of the duty  of  guarantor in any new agreement.  This feeling is prevalent in Flemish circles, and it  is probably due to the fact that as long as Belgium guarantees France, the French General Staff are inclined to make plans whereby in Flemish eyes the Belgian Army is relegated to the position of fighting with the French Army in defence of French territory rather than in defence of Belgian territory.  Incidentally, the old Franco-Belgian Military Agreement was terminated some months ago because it  had become for these reasons unpopular in Belgium, and at present there exists only an exchange of notes providing for a restricted form of staff conversations.     It would have to be clearly understood that Belgium, if she only undertook to defend her own territory, would not be at liberty tacitly to allow  foreign aircraft to cross her territory to attack a third Power.     From our point of view this question is one on which the advice of the C.I.D. is being sought in the first instance. (8)  Are the non-aggression provisions to be so framed (as Locarno  was) as  to       reserve the right of any party to come to the assistance of a non-party which       has been attacked by another party ? Comments.     It would seem essential that the new agreement should  be so worded.  We must therefore be careful to resist  any attempt by Germany to interpret our guarantee as imposing upon us an obligation to use force against France in the.event of her implementing her obligations to come to the assistance of her Easternallies against Germany.  Our guarantee did not have this effect in the old agree-ment, and it would not seem desirable that it should have it in the  new agreement..     Germany  might argue  that  in  the new agreement the  non-aggressionprovisions   should be  modified  on  the  ground  that the   situation  had been   entirely  altered  by  the  conclusion  of  the  Franco-Soviet Pact.   Infact,  Germany  might  take the following line :  Although  ready to acquiesce in  the continuance  of  the Franco-Czech  and  Franco-Polish  Agreements,since  these  were already  in  existence  when  the  Locarno  Treaty  was concluded, she must insist, before concluding a new Western Mutual AssistancePact, that France shall modify her recent Pact with Russia, since in  its present form it has completely altered the balance of power to Germany&apos;s  detriment. Germany might,  for instance, demand that the provision should be  eliminatedwhereby  France has to come to Russia&apos;s assistance in the  case of  a flagrantviolation without waiting for any decision by  the League Council or any other body. Her argument in such a case might be that, so long as there was a possibilityof such an attack by France on Germany, Germany might have,  in self-defence,to take  the initiative,  and  that  Germany  could  not  agree  that  in such circumstances the British  guarantee under the new Western Pact should operate-in France&apos;s favour.    As regards our position, it would clearly be useless to expect the French, andmore especially the present Government of France, to modify and still  less  togive up their pact with Russia.  It would seem equally useless to try to persuade the Germans to adhere to the Franco-Soviet Pact, for,  although that pact  is open to their adherence, neither the German nor the Polish  Governments could resonably be expected to welcome the  idea  that  Russian troops should  march.across their territories to Germany&apos;s aid to  repulse  French aggression.  If,therefore, we have to  rule out (1) the possibility  of  securing? tils cancellationor  modification  of  the  pact,  and  (2) the  possibility  of turning it intoa mutual assistance  pact for Eastern  Europe (with German  participation),.
 the  question remains  whether  the present Franco-Soviet  Pact  can in  any way  be  clarified  to  meet  any  reasonable  objections  which  the  German Government may put forward, more particularly with regard to the case  where France and Russia claim the power to  act without a League decision.  The real. safeguard in such cases is, of course, to be found in the fact that if France were to attack Germany in what the other parties to the Western Pact considered to be unjustifiable circumstances, the latter  would have to intervene against France. This fact might possibly be reinforced in some way during the negotiations. (9) Do we wish to make special provision, in  the new agreement for air attack ? Comments.     So long as the Locarno Treaty existed it was quite reasonable to supplement it by a special air pact providing for mutual guarantees against air attack. But now that a new agreement is to be made, it is natural that provisions for dealing with air  attack should be embodied in this  new agreement.   The old Locarno Treaty provided for immediate assistance (without waiting for a finding by the Council) in a case of unprovoked aggression where by reason of the crossing of the  frontier, or the  outbreak of hostilities, immediate  action  was necessary. It would seem that all that is necessary is that in the new agreement this definition should be extended so as to cover  the case of attack by air, especially by bombing. The C.I.D. are being asked to consider  this point. (10) Do we wish to make special provision  in  the new agreement  for  air       limitation ? Comments.     The proposed air pact was always linked up with the proposal for an agree- ment for air limitation.  It will have to be considered, in the first place by the C.I.D., whether we ought to continue  in the forthcoming negotiations to press for the latter.  If we do it will at once raise the problem of the Russian air force and bring us back to the question put to the Germans in paragraph 9  of  our questionnaire (Annex II). (11) In view of the fact that our present liberty to bold Staff  conversations with       France  and Belgium,  without  any  corresponding conversations with       Germany, derives from  Germany&apos;s  repudiation of Locarno, and will  not       necessarily  continue  if Locarno  is replaced by a  fresh agreement with       Germany, do we  wish in the new agreement  to provide  for Staff conversa-       tions with France and Belgium ? Comments.     The views of the C.I.D. are being obtained as to the value they attach to the continuance of the Staff conversations initiated last March, and as to whether they would like them to be repeated and their scope extended.  (In this connexion the question has been raised as to whether they  might not be limited to Belgium alone see Annex III).  The German Government will probably try and stipulate for no  Staff conversations of any kind under the new agreement. In any case they will certainly insist that if there  are to  be any such conversations they shall take place between  all  the  signatories.   The C.I.D. are being asked to advise howfar  such a stipulation would in practice render Staff  conversations between ourselves and the French and Belgians valueless. (12) Should Holland be asked to accede  to the new agreement?  If so, should she       assume all the obligations of the agreement or only certain obligations ? Comments.     There has been a good deal of discussion on this subject by the C.I.D. with special reference to the proposed Air Pact.   The latest views of  the Chiefs of Staff  are  that  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  the  inclusion  of Holland  in an Air   Pact would be  about  even,  and  that,   if  Hollandshould desire to be included in a  future treaty,  her wish should not be opposed.Nevertheless, the Chiefs of Staff have pointed out that, as Holland in her present
 undefended condition is merely a temptation, we should be unwise to encourage her to become  a member of an air convention unless she undertakes to take all possible measures for her own defence.  (There is now evidence that she is taking certain measures to this end.)     The time has now come when we will have definitely to make up our minds whether or  not  we  want  Holland to  accede to  the proposed  new Western Pact  of Mutual  Assistance,  and,  if  we  do,  how best  she  ought  to be approached.  As regards the part she might play, it is probable that for much the same reasons as Belgium she would prefer not to give any guarantee beyond that of undertaking to defend her own territory.  The C.I.D. are being  asked whether it would be worth while our  giving her a guarantee if this is  all we  got in exchange.   (As in the case  of Belgium it would have  to be understood  that Holland was not at liberty to acquiesce in the flight of foreign aircraft over her territory to attack a third Power.) (13) In  guaranteeing the integrity of Belgium are we prepared  in all circum-       stances to guarantee her against all attempts by Germany to  recover Eupen       and Malmedy?   If not, should we, before guaranteeing Belgium, require       from Germany a specific assurance  that for the duration  of the treaty       she will not raise the question of  Eupen and Malmedy? Comments.     The German  Government have recently, as shown in Annex IV, made it clear to the Belgian Government that &apos;&apos; there could be no question of the German Government considering Eupen and Malmedy as permanently settled.&quot;  In these circumstances,  and in view of the likelihood  that the Germans  will maintain troops and construct fortifications in the Rhineland opposite the Belgian frontier, the  danger  of  a  German attempt to recover those  provinces will obviously be greater in future  than it was when the  Locarno Treaty was negotiated.  The main danger, so far as this country is concerned, is that Germany might attempt a surprise occupation of Eupen and Malmedy with the assistance of the German inhabitants of that area, at the same time making it clear that  there was no intention to threaten  Belgian  independence or  integrity as existing before 1914. Such a coup would bring the British guarantee into play in respect of territory which does not from some points of view fall into quite the same category as the rest of Belgium.     It would seem essential that Germany should undertake as part of the new treaty some non-aggression obligation in regard to the existing frontier, and this would imply an undertaking that she would not use force to settle her claim to Eupen and  Malmedy.   It would,  however,  appear undesirable to  ask Germany not to raise her claim by peaceful methods, for  such a request might meet with a German refusal, and this refusal might prejudice the chances of obtaining a new European settlement on what is, to some extent, a minor point.     It would be easier to expect Germany not to use force to settle her claim  if it were possible to strengthen the machinery for the  peaceful  revision of  inter- national disputes, i.e., if Article 19 of the Covenant could be made  to function. (II) Should  the  provisions for  &quot; resolving through  the collaboration  of all      concerned the  situation  created by  the German  initiative  of the 7th.      March &apos;&apos; form part of the new agreement for mutual assistance ? Comments.     Germany is almost certain to refuse to allow any such provisions to figure inthe Five-Power Agreement.  In view of the unlikelihood of any agreement being;reached on this subject, it will probably be better to keep  the  two  subjectsseparate; but, in that case, the question will arise as to the relationship betweennegotiations for resolving the  situation created by the German initiative of the7th March,  and the negotiations for the conclusion of the new agreement for mutual  assistance.  The  French and Belgian Governments will probably  argue that they are inter-dependent,  and may even ask that the negotiations regardingthe German initiative shall precede any negotiations for a new Five-Power Pact.While having perhaps to agree to the two negotiations being carried on con-currently, we will  presumably insist that a breakdown in one&quot; negotiation shallnot affect or delay  progress in the other.
(15)  If there  is a  breakdown  in  the  negotiations for &quot;resolving through  the       collaboration  of all  concerned  the  situation  created  by  the German       initiative of  the 7th March,&quot;  shall  we  recognise  that  the effort  of       conciliation, referred to in our Letter of the 1st April, has failed, and that,       therefore, the provisions  of the above Letter shall be brought into force ?Comments.    We  would presumably  strongly resist  such a  view, unless and until  theconcurrent negotiations for the new agreement of mutual assistance had equallyfailed.(16)  How  far ought we to support France and  Belgium  in  trying to  obtain       concessions from Germany by way of resolving &quot;through the collaboration       of  all concerned the  situation created by the  German  initiative  of  the       7th March?&quot;Comments.    Our view during the March conversations was that as regards the reoccupa-tion  of the Rhineland by German troops  France  and  Belgium had receivedadequate compensation by our agreeing to Staff conversations, and by our giving them the  Letter of the 1st April.  Even so, France may still wish to stipulate that German troops shall continue to be limited in number and withdrawn fromthe actual frontier, on the lines of Germany&apos;s provisional offer.  Germany wouldcertainly  not  agree  to this  unless  France was prepared to give correspondingundertakings  as regards  her  own troops on her own territory.   Although itappears unlikely that important results could be achieved through such negotia-tions regarding the number  of  troops near the frontier, the French  government might be pressed to explore the possibilities of a settlement on these lines.    As regards the refortification  of the Rhineland, France and  Belgium havenot yet received any compensation.  At the  Geneva meeting on the  10th april the idea was that such compensation should be obtained through Germany givingsatisfactory undertakings with regard to France&apos;s allies in  the  East.  This wasthe origin, in  our questionnaire (Annex II),  of paragraphs 6, 7,  and 8 regardinggenuine treaties, and paragraph  10 regarding  the nature of the non-aggressionpacts which Germany was prepared to conclude in  the East.  The French will certainly raise again the question of fortifications.  Germany, from what she  has said,  will refuse to  give any one-sided undertaking in this matter and Franceobviously cannot discuss the destruction of  her existing fortifications along  thefrontier.   Also it  is doubtful whether, in  the place  of any limitation as tofortifications,  Germany would be ready to give France any undertakings which France would consider satisfactory regarding her Eastern allies. Thus the task of resolving the German  initiative of the 7th March is  likely  to prove one ofthe crucial points in any negotiations, and we shall probably have  to make itclear to the French and Belgian Governments that we will not allow a breakdownto occur on this point, and that they, will have to content themselves with whateversatisfaction they can get out of our renewed guarantee of  French and Belgian territory and out of any further bilateral agreements which Germany may makein the East.(17)  In the invitation it is stated that,  &quot;if progress can be made under this head       (i.e.,  the conclusion of a Western Agreement  for Mutual Assistance and       the  resolution  of the situation  created by the  German  initiative of  the       7th March), other matters will naturally come under discussion ....  in       such a manner as to facilitate ....  the settlement of those  problems  the       solution of  which-is essential  to the peace of Europe.&quot;   If such  an       extension occurs in the field of discussion, what do we propose to work  for       in the further negotiations contemplated ?Comments.    This  question is likely to be put to us at an early  stage by both France andGermany, and for  diametrically opposed reasons.  Germany will doubtless urge that a general settlement of Europe will be fully attained if the Conferenceconcludes a Western Pact for Mutual Assistance.  Germany may be expected to resist any attempt by France and ourselves to interfere in any further bilateraL       [13707-4]                                          1          c
 arrangements which she may be prepared to make with her Eastern neighbours, and, above all, Germany may be expected to refuse flatly to conclude any arrange- ment at all with Russia. France, on the other hand, may be expected to urge that, unless Germany gives guarantees  satisfactory to France as regards not only her Eastern neighbours, but also and particularly as regards Russia, there  can be no general settlement, and that thus the &quot;effort of conciliation &quot; will have  failed, thereby bringing the terms of the Letter of the 1st April into force.     This conflict  of  policy  is likely to prove  another  crucial point   in the negotiations and may well come to a head at a very early stage, that  is to say, before  &quot;progress has  been made &quot; with  regard to  the Western Pact and the settlement of the  situation created by the German initiative of the 7th  March. Generally speaking, it  may be said that a Western Pact, unaccompanied by any general settlement, would be merely a poultice applied to one of the few parts of Europe which at  present  are not  inflamed. As such, a Western agreement in isolation  might be actually dangerous, since it would create in the West a false sense of security,  while giving to  Russia and to the lesser  Powers of the East and Centre the feeling that they  had been abandoned to their fate.  In these circumstances it ought presumably to be our policy -from  the outset to make it clear that we decline to disinterest ourselves in the East,  and that we  intend to insist on the need  for a general settlement, while at the same time urging France not  to wreck a  Western agreement,  and  indeed  a general  settlement,  by maintaining impossible demands in the East. (18)  Although our invitation does not mention Germany&apos;s return to the League,       ought it to be raised during the diplomatic consultations  in preparation       for the Conference? Comments.     The course of negotiations will probably be such that Germany&apos;s relations with the League will inevitably have  to be taken into account.  It is important to note that the negotiations with Germany regarding the proposed Western Pact are closely interlocked with the discussions regarding the reform of the League, and more especially with the possibility of making some  use hereafter  of article 19, so as to  enable treaties to be revised by peaceful means.  Germany may reasonably argue,that before she can implement her offer to return to the League she must know what League she is expected to return to. In these circumstances it might be worth  while to explore the ground in order to  discover whether it is feasible that Germany  should  be  invited to take part in  any committee  which may be set up in Geneva to consider the reform of the League, so as to deprive her of the excuse that she was  being expected to  return to  a ready-made League in the reform of which she  had no voice or say.                               CONCLUSIONS.     In  the  light of the above review of the situation, the  following  tentative conclusions  are submitted.  They  are not intended to represent  in any  way a definite policy, but merely to give general indications of the  direction along  which His Majesty&apos;s Government should proceed during the exchange of views which itis intended to carry on through the diplomatic channel in preparation for  the Conference itself. New Western Pact.     A..  While not excluding altogether the possibility of  accepting  Germany&apos;s proposed new &quot; international court of arbitration,&quot; we should prefer to use the League Council, as in the Locarno Treaty, to decide if and when an aggressionlias taken place.  (Questions 1 and  2 above.)     B.  As regards the Locarno Treaties of Arbitration, we should press  for their renewal in the same form as in the Locarno Treaty; subject if necessary to provision  being made for Germany&apos;s new &quot; international court of arbitration.&quot; If Germany objects to the treaties with Poland and Czechoslovakia forming partof the Western Pact, we should try to secure our purpose  by making use of  the German  offer  to  conclude bilateral  agreements  by  direct negotiation  withGermany&apos;s neighbours.  (Questions 1 and 3 above.)
     C.   We -should want in the new treaty  to  be both a guaranteed and  aguarantor Power.   But we should not wish either to guarantee or be guaranteed by Italy.  (Questions 4 and 6 above.)    - D.   Subject to the views of the C.I.D., we should be prepared to consider a request by Belgium that she should not be a guarantor Power, but should merelygive an undertaking to defend her own  territory.  (Question 7 above.)     E.   We should resist any attempt by Germany to interpret our guarantee ascompelling us to use  force against France if she  implemented her obligation tocome to the assistance of her Eastern Allies.  Similarly, we should give Germanyno encouragement if she asks that France should cancel or modify her treaty withRussia.   On the other hand, the implications  of this treaty might be furtherclarified so as to reassure Germany. (Question 8 above.)     F.   Subject to the views of the C.I.D., special provision should be made inthe new treaty for attack by air.   (Question 9 above.)     G.   Subject to the views of the C.I.D., we  should explore the possibility ofan agreement for air limitation, bearing in mind, however, that  the strength ofthe Russian  air force is a factor which complicates the problem of securing an air limitation agreement between the Western  European Powers.  (Question 10above.)     H.   Subject to the views of the C.I.D., it is contemplated that Staff conversa-tions should  be  provided for as part of the agreement,  even though  such con-versations would have to take place with Germany also.   (Question  11 above.)     I.   Subject to  the  views of the C.I.D., we should be ready  to consider the accession of  Holland to the new  Western Pact.  If agreed to,  the method of approaching  her should in due course be discussed with  the other Governmentsconcerned.   (Question 12 above.)Negotiations to resolve the Situation  created  by the  German Initiative  of         March  7.     J.  These   negotiations might,  if  the  French   insist,  be  carried  onconcurrently  with those for the new  Western  Pact,  but a breakdown  in  onenegotiation ought not to affect or delay progress in the other.  (Question 14 above.)     K.   Unless and until the negotiations for  a new Western Pact have failedwe  should resist the  view that a  breakdown in the negotiations regarding  thesituation created by the German initiative of  the 7th March must represent  a failure  of the &quot; effort of conciliation &quot;  mentioned in our  letter of the 1st April,and  thus bring the provisions of the above letter  into force.  (Question 15  above.)     L.   If Germany refuses to make any concessions by way of resolving  thesituation created by  the German  initiative of the 7th March, we should urgeFrance  and Belgium  to content  themselves with whatever satisfaction they can get out  of our renewed guarantee of French and Belgian territory and out of anyfurther bilateral agreements which Germany may make in the East.  (Question 16above.)General Settlement.     M.   We should decline to disinterest ourselves from the East and Centre ofEurope and continue to insist on the need for a  general settlement, while urgingFrance  not to wreck a Western settlement by maintaining impossible demands inthe East and Centre.   (Question 17 above.)Germany&apos;s Return to the League.     N.   Since the question of Germany&apos;s relations with  the League must reacton the  course of the negotiations, we  ought to consider whether it would be feasible for Germany to be invited to take  part  in any committee which may beset up in Geneva to consider the reform  of the League.

Phipps (Berlin).(No. 541.)Sir,                                          Foreign Office,  May 6,  1936.    YOUR Excellency will  be  aware that His Majesty&apos;s Government in  theUnited Kingdom have for some  time past had under the most careful considera-tion the memoranda communicated to me by  the late Herr von Hoesch on  the7th March, 1936, and  by Herr von Ribbentrop on the 24th  March  and  the1st April,  1936, respecting the  reoccupation of the demilitarised zone and  thepeace proposals of the German Government.    2.  Such consideration was naturally indispensable in view of the importance which, as your Excellency is aware, His Majesty&apos;s Government attach to  theestablishment in Europe of a real and lasting peace based on  the recognition ofthe equality of rights and independence of every State, together with respect by every State for  the engagements entered into by it.   It is  the desire of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to make  every effort within  their power to co-operate inthe promotion of the objective described by the German  Government in  thememorandum of  the  31st March, as  &quot; the great work of securing European peace &apos;&apos;; and it is accordingly with this aim in view  and in order to open the wayto fruitful negotiation  that  I address to you this  despatch  and request  yourExcellency to seek an interview with the German Chancellor.  You should prefaceyour remarks by a statement to this effect.    3.  Certain of the German  Governments  proposals deal, as  your Excellencyis aware, with temporary arrangements  in the  demilitarised  zone pending  thecompletion of the first stage of the general negotiations for the peace of europe which were proposed by the German Government.  On these temporary arrange-ments  it is not my purpose to  comment  in the present despatch,  though  yourExcellency knows that  His Majesty&apos;s  Government regret  that the  GermanGovernment have not  been able to make a more substantial contribution towardsthe re-establishment of the confidence which is such an essential preliminary to the wide negotiations which they both have in view.ANNEX&apos;  I.
    4.  In the course of my interview with Herr von Ribbentrop on the 2nd April,I informed his Excellency that His Majesty&apos;s Government regard the proposalsfor the future in the German memorandum of the 31st March (that communicatedto me on the 1st April)  as most important and as deserving of careful study.This  study is now  at  an advanced stage;  but His Majesty&apos;s Government find difficulty in carrying it further without discussing more closely with -the GermanGovernment (as foreshadowed in the  Geneva communique of the 10th April) acertain  number of points in the three memoranda, particularly  in  those of the24th  and 31st March.    His Majesty&apos;s  Government  feel sure that  the GermanGovernment will share their view that the greatest possible precision is desirablebefore general negotiations can  open, in order that in the future no  misunder-standings may cloud the confident co-operation of the Powers of Europe, which itis the most earnest hope of His Majesty&apos;s Government, as they are sure also of theGerman Government, that the proposed negotiations may advance.    5.  There are a number of passages in the German memoranda of the 24thand 31st March  which leave  His Majesty&apos;s Government in some  doubt  as tothe conception held by the German Government of the basis upon which  the future settlement should be founded.    6  The first point on which it is desirable to be clear is whether Germanyregards  herself  as  now  in  a  position  to conclude  &quot; genuine  treaties.&quot;There are passages in  the second sub-paragraph of paragraph 1 of the german governments memorandum of the 24th March, 1936, which seem to  suggest thatit is the view of the German Government that by their action in the Rhinelandthey  have established  this position.  On the other hand, there are passages inparagraph 2 of the  memorandum of the 24th March which might be  capable of adifferent interpretation,  which,  however, His Majesty&apos;s Government would not themselves wish to  draw.  It  is, of course, clear  that negotiations  for a treaty would be useless if one of the parties hereafter felt free to deny its obligation onthe ground that  that  party was not  at  the time  in a  condition to conclude a binding treaty, and His  Majesty&apos;s Government will welcome a clear declarationfrom the German Government to remove any uncertainty on this point.    7.  If the  argument  set  out in paragraph 6  of the  German Govern-ments  memorandum of the 31st March  is intended to be of general application,it might give rise to doubt as to the view which the German Government take ofthe continued maintenance in force of  the remaining operative  clauses of theTreaty  of Versailles, and, indeed, of any agreement which might be  said to havehad its origin  in the  provisions of  the  Treaty  of Versailles.   His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment do not wish to enter into controversy as to the historical interpreta-tion of  events set forth in that paragraph,  and consequently they do not proposeto state their views here.  But they must, of course, make it clear that they areunable  to  accept the  views put forward  by the German Government  in the paragraph in question.    . 8.  There is in paragraph 4 of the memorandum of the 31st March a furthercause for  uncertainty.  It is stated in that paragraph that  &quot;  the GermanGovernment have received from the German People (&apos; Volk &apos;) a solemn generalmandate to represent the Reich and the German Nation (&apos; Nation &apos;) to carry out apolicy  which  implies  the  preservation  under  all  circumstances  of  their freedom,  their independence and at  the same time their  equality of status.&quot;A distinction is apparently drawn between the Reich and the German Nation.The  question is really whether  Germany now considers that  a  point has  beenreached at which she can signify that she  recognises and intends to respect theexisting territorial  and political status of Europe,  except in so far as this mightbe subsequently modified by free negotiation and agreement.     9.  I turn now to other matters.  Sub-paragraph 13 of paragraph 22 of thememorandum of  the 31st March refers to  &quot;the  conclusion of an  Air Pact to supplement and reinforce these  (Western European) security agreements.&quot;  Inthe spring of 1935 the German Government were understood to hold that the negotiation of an Air Pact should not be complicated by an attempt to accompanyit by an  agreement for  the limitation  of  air forces.   Since then  a  somewhat-contradictory position seems to have arisen.  In the Reichstag on the  21st May,1935, Herr Hitler mentioned the possibility of an agreement for air  limitation on the basis of parity between the great Western Powers, provided, so  we under-&quot;would be necessary.  The Chancellots speech of the 21st May, 1935,  was made
 after  the  signature  of  the  Franco-Soviet Treaty; yet  in  December  1935 he informed your Excellency that that Treaty had made air limitation impossible. A  decision not to attempt to accompany a Western Air  Pact by a  regional agreement for limitation of air strengths would be very much regretted by His Majesty&apos;s  Government;  and  the statement in  paragraph  2 of  the . German memorandum that the German Government are impressed by the results achieved in  the limited sphere  of the  recent agreement respecting naval armaments encourages them to hope  that the German Government will be able to fall in with their views on this point.     10.  His Majesty&apos;s Government are gratified to see that, in sub-paragraphs 10 and 14 of paragraph 22 of  the memorandum  of the 31st March, the German Government  propose  the conclusion of non-aggression pacts between Germany, on  the one  hand,  and France,  Belgium  and  possibly  Holland on  the other. They note that the German Government are willing  that these pacts should be accompanied by treaties  of guarantee.  The exact  form which these instruments will assume must be a matter for detailed negotiation.     His Majesty&apos;s Government also note the proposal in sub-paragraph 17 of paragraph 22 for  non-aggression pacts between  Germany  and the  States on Germany&apos;s south-eastern  and north-eastern  frontiers.  His Majesty&apos;s Government would venture to recall the general outline of such pacts given to Sir John Simon-by Baron von Neurath in Berlin on the  26th March, 1935.  They would be glad to know whether the  German Government  suggest that these pacts should follow generally that outline, and whether they  agree  that these  pacts  also may be guaranteed by mutual assistance arrangements.     The announcement which the German Government have been able to make of Germany&apos;s readiness  to re-enter  the League of Nations permits His Majesty&apos;s Government  to assume that no difficulty  will arise as regards the conformity of the proposed non-aggression pacts with the obligations of members of the  League of Nations, and that the operation of these pacts will take place within the framework of the  Covenant.     There are two further points to which  attention should be drawn.  The first concerns the  meaning of  the words &quot; the  States on Germany&apos;s south-eastern  and north-eastern frontiers.&quot;   His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot but feel that the general settlement would be very greatly facilitated if the German Government could see their way to interpret these words so as to cover at least also the Soviet Union, Latvia and Estonia, as well as the States actually contiguous to Germany. In this connexion His Majesty&apos;s Government would venture to recall that in their memorandum of the  26th March, 1935,  the German  Government  stated their readiness to  conclude pacts of non-aggression with &apos;&apos; the Powers interested in East European questions.&quot;     The second is that  of non-interference in the affairs of other States, as distinct  from non-aggression  against  them.  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government recall with satisfaction the Chancellors statement in the Reichstag on the 21st May, 1935, that the German Government were  &quot;ready at  any time to agree to an international arrangement which will  effectively prevent  and render impossible all attempts to interfere from outside in the affairs of other States.&quot;     11.  In   sub-paragraph  19  of paragraph  22  &quot; Germany proposes  the constitution of an international court of arbitration which shall have competence in respect of  the observance of  the various agreements  concluded.&quot;   Presumably, these agreements are those mentioned in sub-paragraphs 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,  14  and 17 of paragraph 22.  It would be desirable to know generally the functions  and constitution of the proposed court and  the relation which the former would bear to the functions of the Council of the  League of Nations  and of the Permanent Court of International Justice.     In view  of the announcement of  Germany&apos;s willingness to return to the League of Nations,  the German Government will, no doubt, be willing to indicate their future  attitude towards the  Permanent  Court  of  International Justice- (particularly  in relation to   the Optional Clause) and towards  the  various provisions  for arbitration, conciliation or  judicial settlement contained in treaties to which Germany is  a party.     12.  When your Excellency sees  the  Chancellor, I request that  you will discuss with  him the points raised in  this  despatch and leave with him a copy. Your Excellency should explain that these are  not exhaustive.  There are other matters  which will have to be raised at  a  later date;  and before the return of
Germany to the League of Nations comes under discussion, the German Govern-ment will no doubt think it  desirable to give some definition of the phrase &quot; the separation of the Covenant of the League of Nations from its basis in the Treatyof Versailles setting,&quot; which occurs in sub-paragraph 18 of  paragraph 22.  Atthe moment  His Majesty&apos;s  Government prefer only to deal with  points  theelucidation of which is essential prior to the opening of the general negotiations with, as stated above, they are sincerely desirous of promoting.                                                 I am,  &amp;c.                                                      ANTHONY EDEN.ANNEX  III.-(Secret.)My dear Prime Minister,                       Foreign Office, June 6, 1936.     YOU may remember that when I sawT van Zeeland recently in Geneva hesuggested that it  would  be to the  interests  of our  two countries if staff conversations could take place between Belgium  and ourselves apart from therecent Anglo-French-Belgian Conversations in London.  He suggested that such conversations could be held by the  Service Attaches quite quietly, and that thekind of subjects for discussion would be air co-operation, landing grounds, types of aircraft, strategic considerations concerning the portions of the front to beheld, and the defences of the Belgian coast.     To appreciate  this proposal, it is necessary to recall briefly what passed atthe recent Three-Power Staff Conversations.  The military  conversations dealtprimarily with the arrangements for getting  a British expeditionary force intoFrance, but in  no way with the part of the line to be held.  The naval conversa-tions  were  really  only  concerned with movements  of  ships,  and the  airconversations with the suitability  of  various aerodromes for  the operation of squadrons.     There  was, further, in  the course  of  these conversations  an importantstatement made by the senior French Military  Officer &quot; that France was perfectly well able to look after her own frontier and would prefer that any aid that mightbe given by Great Britain should be sent to Belgium &quot;; further, we learned thatthe Belgian coast was undefended.     I  think that van Zeeland&apos;s recent remarks to me are the logical sequence ofwhat passed at the Three-Power Conversations, and particularly of  the remarks-of the French Military Representative.  My understanding is that what  passed at the Three-Power Conversations could in large part also equally well have passed had we had conversations with Germany, and van Zeeland himself pointedthis out to me.  But van Zeeland now evidently wants to go further than this, and discuss with us alone, as quietly as may be, the  question of plans.  This, of  course,would  rule out  corresponding conversations with Germany.     I  told van Zeeland at the time that, while his suggestion  would be very carefully considered over here,  I felt doubtful  if the present was an  appropriate moment for its  adoption.  We were  trying hard to start negotiations which would lead to some agreement with Germany, and I feared that any intimation that wewere engaging  in additional conversations with Belgium would be  seized upon by the German Government as a pretext for  returning an unfavourable reply.Indeed, we have recently received a  hint somewhat to this effect from the german military Attache here in connexion with the question of the fortifications of  the rhineland.  I  still feel  that it would be a blunder on our part to enter uponfurther conversations whilst our negotiations  with Germany  are hanging in  thebalance; we must not give  her the excuse which we believe she may be looking;for to  break off the  negotiations.     On the  other hand,  I am impressed by the remark of the French military representative  in London, which I have  quoted  above, and  I  do think that ifwe have to go further in conversations and we may very well have to do so if,as I fear is only too probable,  the German negotiations break down there is alot  to  be said  for  conversations between us  and  Belgium  alone.  The  Frenchevidently are quite prepared for that, and if we had to have further conversations
there are strong arguments for an agreement with Belgium only from the pointof view of our public opinion.   Thus,  the British public is prepared to defendBelgium and understands that it might be  asked to  defend  her.  It could notbe said of Belgium as of France that she would use our commitment to prosecutea forward policy in some other part of Europe.  We could not in a military agreement with Belgium undertake engagements which would affect the distri-bution of  our forces in other theatres,  because it could be  argued that we haveto defend Belgium anyhow on account of our vital interest.  On the other hand,by any military agreement with France it might be said that we might becomepolitically committed as we became to some extent before the war by assigningto the French one theatre for defence and by ourselves engaging to defend anothertheatre.  Lastly, the Germans would find it much more  difficult to object to aBritish military agreement with Belgium, and its existence would not necessitate a corresponding agreement with Germany.    If you agree with the foregoing views, I think, that  it would be useful toarrange for an early  preliminary examination of this question so that, in theevent of the  German  negotiations finally breaking down, or even coming to acomplete standstill, we should be in a position to take a decision on van Zeeland&apos;suggestion.  If you agree with these ideas, I would be  very grateful if you would speak to Inskip on the subject and perhaps give him a copy of this letter.                                                 Yours ever,                                                     ANTHONY  EDEN.                               ANNEX IV.         Sir E. Phipps to Sir Samuel Hoare. (Received December 6.)(No. 1266.)Sir,                                              Berlin, December 4, 1935.    WITH reference to my despatch No. 1080 of the 25th October last, I havethe honour to acquaint you that the Belgian Ambassador in Paris came to Berlinfor the day on the 2nd December and paid me a short visit.    2.  Count  Kerchove said (what he had not told me before) that he had, athis parting interview with the  Chancellor,  described  in my despatch under reference, suggested the advisability of some public statement being made to theeffect that Germany had no territorial claims upon Belgium and that the questionof Eupen and Malmedy might be considered to be definitely settled.  The BelgianGovernment would for their part declare that they warmly welcomed this recogni-tion  of the status quo and were determined to live on the  best of terms withGermany.  Herr Hitler had declared  that he could not undertake to make anysuch statement, for although a plebiscite had been taken over Eupen-Malmedy, he did not regard  it as a satisfactory solution of the matter.  However, this was anaffair which concerned only some 40,000  German-speaking persons, and he was quite ready not to pay any undue attention to it for the present (in other words,to leave it in cold storage).    3.  Count  Kerchove told me that the German Ministry for Foreign affairs were  so anxious that there should be no misunderstanding in this matter  thatthey instructed the German Charge d&apos;Affaires at Brussels to make it clear to theBelgian Government that there could be no question of the German Governmentconsidering Eupen and Malmedy as being permanently settled.    4  Count Kerchove brought with him to call upon us Vicomte Davignon, thepresent Belgian Minister at Warsaw, who is to succeed him here, and VicomtesseDavignon.    5.  I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at brussels.                                                    I have, &amp;c.                                                         ERIC PHIPPS.
