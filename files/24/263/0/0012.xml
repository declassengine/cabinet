CABINET.ANGLO-EGYPTIAN TREATY  CONVERSATIONS.                                  SUDAN.         Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    THE  Cabinet in their meeting of the 23rd June enquired &quot; whether therewas any risk that, at the end of twenty years, the League  of Nations, at the instance of Egypt, might be able to secure the right to appoint the Governor-General of the Sudan,&apos;-&apos; a right which is guaranteed by Condominium agreementwith Egypt.    This enquiry was directed to the point whether the League might secure for egypt the  right to nominate and appoint the Governor-General.  The answer tothe enquiry seems to be as follows :     The position of the British Governor-General  is assured constitutionally under the  Condominium agreement of 1899, by which both the United Kingdomand  Egypt  are  bound by  the  proviso that the  Governor-General shall  beappointed   by the  Egyptian Sovereign  on  nomination  by  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment.  If the Constitution (of the Sudan) were  Changed at the instanceof the League of Nations, this as well  as any other provisos and safeguards(from our  standpoint) might be modified.    But (a) it would seem inexpedient to draw attention to any such contingencyin the present negotiations.    (b) Presumably our influence with the League of Nations would prevent theLeague recommending a change  of constitutional practice that would  seemcontrary to the  legitimate  interests of His  Majesty&apos;s  Government and the sudanese  Administration  and  which  would be contrary to the  terms of  anagreement which both parties have agreed to without time limit.    Attention is also invited to the following passage in CP. 176  (36),  p. 3:&quot; At the end of twenty years the Egyptians may ask for the  Sudan article  to be revised, and if the United Kingdom and Egypt cannot agree as to the terms ofthe revision, the Council of the League, acting unanimously  (or some othertribunal if the parties can agree upon  one) decides in what  manner the Sudanarticle might be revised.  Theoretically  this means that the  arbitrator coulddecide in  favour of such a  radical  change in the existing  arrangements that egypt became the active and the  United Kingdom the sleeping partner in the condominium.  At  first  sight this seems an  alarming  possibility.  Erom thepractical point of view, however,  I do not think there is  any great risk  in accepting it.  The League of Nations would be bound, in considering the mannerin which  the government of the  Sudan was to  be allocated as  between the condominium Powers, to put in the  forefront the mandatory principle, i.e., theinterests of the Sudanese. It is inconceivable that a Council of the League actingunanimously could decide that the interests of the Sudanese would be favoured bythe government of the territory being put into Egyptian hands.&quot;      8684   [13414]               ...   Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1936.    . .  ......,  .,11 i JV             -       &apos;              :--SECRET.                                                        Copy No.CP. 182 (36).
    In view of the above, His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner will proceed to seek agreement  with the Egyptian delegation on the Sudan article  as  set out  in cp. 176 (36), Annex A) subject  as regards paragraph 7 (which deals with theindebtedness  of the Sudan to Egypt) to  the results of the discussion 5whjch;v[is,about to be held between the Treasury and the Foreign Office, with the assistanceof the Governor-General.                                                a n                                                                    A. &quot;E    June 25, 1936.           3Si J i- j  iii i
