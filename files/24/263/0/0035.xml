yf!.P.205(36) .(THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY  OP HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERWViENT)Copy Ho.CAB INE T.WAGES OP FAHVI SERVANTS IN SCCTLAJED.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.In England and Wales the wages and conditions of employmentof farm workers  are  regulated by the Agricultural Wages  (Regulation)  Act,1924.   When that  Act was  passed neither employers nor employees  desiredits application  to Scotland where the system of private  bargain,  or in some districts,  local voluntary agreements,  had worked satisfactorily.conditions of employment  and remuneration of farm workers in Scotland have created dissatisfaction.   With my approval and assistance negotiations between the Scottish farmers1 and farm servants&apos; unions were entered intowith a view to the establishment of a system of voluntary wage regulation.The proposals upon which representatives of the two bodies agreed were,however,  rejected by the local branches of the National Farmers Union ofScotland,  and, fooling that in those circumstances,there was a prima faciocase for inquiry and possibly Scottish legislation on the lines of the 1924Act, I appointed a Committee in January last to examine the whole systemof employment and remuneration of farm workers in Scotland.   Tho Chairmanof the Committee, which was independent in character, was lord Caithness, theConvener of the County Council of Aberdeen, a landlord in the County and theChairman of the Association of County Councils in Scotland.   Its membersincluded two farmers and two gentlemen with practical experience of labour questions.that there is  an immediate need for the introduction by statute  ofmachinery for  securing the proper regulation of wages and conditions  ofemployment and it recommends the establishment in Scotland of;     1.  District Wages Committees (twelve in number)  comprising  equalrepresentation of workers and employers,  with an impartial Chairman,  who wouldfix minimum rates of wages, andUnder the economic pressure of the last few years, however,The Committee has now presented a unanimous report to the effect
                                                                           9 K %                                                                           F* IJ tS  .     2.   A Central Wages Board similarly constituted, but including a chairman and two impartial members officially appointed, with the duty ofgiving effect by order to the Committee&apos;s findings, and with power in certaincircumstances to vary such findings, or to fix rates in the event of failure by the Committee to do so.          I am in general agreement with the view of the Committee that acase has been made out for Wages Boards for agricultural workers in Scotland.I accordingly desire the authority of my colleagues for the preparation andsubmission to the Home Affairs Committee, with a view to its passage into lawnext Session, of a Bill providing for the regulation of the wages and conditionsof service of farm servants in Scotland in general conformity with the Committee&apos;srecommendations.          I should perhaps direct the special attention of my colleagues tothe fact that these recommendations differ in one important respect from thepresent English practice.    The Committee propose that the Central wages board should have power to vary the findings of the District Committees,whereas the Central Board in England cannot modify wage  rates fixed by thelocal body.   I understand that the Bill introduced by the Labour Government in1924 contained a provision on the lines of that now recommended by the ScottishCommittee,  but that it was abandoned in view of both Liberal and conservative opposition.   While I am reluctant to depart from the unanimous findings  of theCommittee,  I appreciate the difficulty, at a time when farmers generally,  and6at growers in the North-East in particular,  are not enjoying prosperity,  ofestablishing in Scotland a system of central regulation which is not in operation in England, and which would be much more unpalatable to them than a  system oflocal regulation.    It must be remembered that in any event there will beopposition from farmers to the Bill.    I should accordingly,  before  submittingthe Bill to the Home Affairs Committee  and the Cabinet,  propose to reconsiderthis point, along with the Minister of  Agriculture and the Treasury,  in the lightof the discussions which I am instituting during the recess with the  farmers&apos;and farm servants&apos;  organizations.    No  public announcement will,  of  course,  beoade in the meantime.                                              (Id.)  G.P.C.24th July,  1936.
