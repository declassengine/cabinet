Of the increase of 1.5 m. in manufactured goods  426,000 related to machinery and  294,000 to non-ferrous products.  Exports of UnitedKingdom produce,  36.4 m. were  1.2 m. more and re-exports,  5.6 m., were  75,000 more than in May, 1935.     EMPLOYMENT.   The total number of unemployed persons on the registers at the 25th May, 1,705,042, was126,188 fewer than at 27th April.    The main variations were20,196London............South Eastern.....  -13,884South Western..... -12,352Midlands.......... -10,182North Eastern........ -26,326North Vifestern........ -19,637Scotland............. -15,651Wales................ - 7,960     The estimated number of insured persons aged 16-64in employment was 10,831,000 - 119,000 more than at27th April and 472,000 more than at 20th May, 1935.The improvement since April was most marked in building and public works contracting, engineering, iron and steel,motor vehicle, metal goods, and cotton and hosiery manufacture,textile bleaching, dyeing, etc., tailoring, printing andbookbinding, the distributive and transport trades, hoteletc.  s-services and the fishing industry.   In none of theprincipal industries was&apos; there any marked decline inemployment.
     RAILWAY TRAFFIC.   In the five weeks ended 31st May-railway traffic receipts increased by  633,000 (4.52%)  comparedwith the corresponding period of 1935.    The increase in passenger traffic amounted to 5.97%;   in merchandise, minerals and livestock to 6.19$;   and in coal, coke and patent fuel to2.51$.     SHIPPING-*  The Chamber of Shipping index number  offreights (1913 ss 100)  was 88.46 in May as against 85.81 inApril and 76.62 a year ago j but the tonnage in employmentappears to have been less than in April.     BANKING,  Short money was in moderate demand.    Discountrates were slightly firmer.   The average Treasury Bill raterose from 10/5d on the 1st May to 11/5.54d.  on the 29th.  the spot franc was weak owing to the flight of capital from paris and the three months forward rate exceeded 6 francs discount,representing an interest rate of 32$.   The New York rate on london weakened to nearly ^5, following the export of Frenchgold to U.S.A.   The price of gold fell from 140/10d. to139/3d. in sympathy with the franc.   The rise in the Bank ofEngland note circulation was due to hoarding of Britishcurrency by foreigners and to Whitsun holidays.     COAL.   The average weekly output of coal during the 13weeks ended 23rd May was 4.5 m.  tons as compared with 4.35 m.tons in the corresponding period a year ago - an increase of3.4$.

     IRON AND STEEL.  &quot;Activity was well maintained.New business was somewhat restricted after Whitsun but therewere numerous enquiries.   Manufacturers are cautions inundertaking new commitments and delivery periods are tending to lengthen.   Pig-iron production (661,000 tons) was 18.3$greater than in May, 1935 .   Prompt business was ratherdifficult to arrange.   The price increases seems to have hadno effect on demand.   In the semi-finished steel department,continental imports helped to ease conditions somewhat andconsuming industries experience no great difficulty inobtaining supplies.   Output of crude steel (963,000 tons)was 12.9$ greater than in May, 1935.     The finished steel department was Very busy..   Heavysteel works were operating almost to capacity.   Export tradeimproved slightly.     Scotland.   Steel production remained at a very high level.   Rolling mills worked at nearly full capacity  and extensions are in progress.   In the sheet market conditionsfluctuated.   Re-rollers are fairly well occupied.     North East Coast.   Demand for pig-iron was exceptionallystrong, but users of foundry grades obtained better deliveriesSteelworks operated practically to capacity and the semi-finished steel section was very busy.   Domestic demand forsheets was very satisfactory and exports improved slightly,     Sheffield.   Activity  continued at a very high level,Some large furnaces worked throughout Whitsuntide.   Theexpansion of business in stainless steel continued,   Busiro:-;cin high speed steel was moderate.     South Wales.  Steelworks  were well employed.   The tin-plate Industry worked to 60$ of capacity and demand improvedslightly.   The galvanised- sheet section remained ratherslack.

Imports of complete new private cars andtaxis amounted to 859, 61-? less than a year ago.     LIGHT METAL INDUSTRIES.  Conditions in most hranchesremained satisfactory.   The output of tools in the Sheffieldarea was probably greater than ever before.  In the cutlerytrade work was unevenly distributed between the various sections.  Most non-ferrous mills were working to capacity.     ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY,.    The improvement was maintained in both heavy and light sides of the industry.   The telephoneindustry was extremely busy as a result of extended facilities offered by the General Post Office.  Consumption ofelectricity amounted to 1,457 nr. unite - 9.8% more than inMay, 1935.     COTTON.   Activity increased somewhat during May.Average weekly deliveries of raw cotton to spinners were29.73 m, lbs. against 26.95 m. lbs. in April.  Takings of american and Indian cotton increased though takings of egyptian cotton declined.   Raw cotton prices increasedappreciably and spinners&apos;  margins declined.  Yarn exportsat 12,4 m. lbs,  were rather more than in April 1936, andin May, 1935: Roumania took substantially more than in April,,Exports of piece goods at 145.8 m. sq.  yds. were 4.6 m. sq. ydsmore than in April (due partly to the greater number ofworking days);  exports increased to Canada, Australia,Denmark, Colombia and Argentina but declined to India, FrenchWest and  Equatorial Africa and British West Africa.
     WOOL.   There was a slight increase in general activity, theimprovement  being mainly apparent in preparatory processes of theworsted section.   Raw wool prices weakened slightly.   Exports oftops, yarns  and  tissues were  greater than in April.   New orders and enquiries  were scarce.     SILK AND  ARTIFICIAL SILK.  Generally speaking there was a bettertone in the  rayon weaving trade.   The underwear and. piece goodstrades were  adversely affected by the cold weather.   Exports ofall-rayon fabrics were larger than in May, 1955, but exports of rayonmixture fabric declined.     In the  silk trade, sales still suffered through the coldweather and  Court morning.

In the leather trade business was on thewhole rather below the average for previous months of this year.     POTTERY.  Wages have been advanced in all sections of thepottery trade, except sanitary earthenware.

The money value of retail sales in April was 5%greater than in  April, 1935.   The seasonal improvement wasappreciably  less than in 1935, due mainly to the unfavourable weather conditions and Budget increases.  Sales of food end perish-ables rose by  9. 1%, but of other merchandise by only ,5%,^roliminary  returns for May show greater increases.     AUSTRALIAN  TRADE.  2,669,501 bales of wool were received into  store from the  1st July to the 30th April

remarkably during the first quarter  of  1936;  trade withthe United Kingdom declined sharply,     Peru, Trading conditions  continued satisfactory, butthe agricultural outlook was less favourable.-  Total exports and imports in 1935 increased  in value  by  1.3$ and 5.7 respectively over 1934.
