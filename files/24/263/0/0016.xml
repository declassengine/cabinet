(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT).                           CABINET.                          TRUNK ROADS.                        f/If36\                                  *              COPY NO.  Hi &apos;____             Me.morandumt by the Minister, of  Transport.           In view of the great and continuing growth  of  motor  traffic/ and the necessity for modernising the layout of our  main lines of communication by road, as most other  countries  are  now doing, I have become more and more  impressed with the  disadvantages of the present system, under which even the great  trunk routes are a matter of local responsibility *    In  such  circumstances it is extremely difficult, and often  impossible,  to  secure improvements of layout, and the uniformity in  width,  surfacing, signalling, etc., which is necessary for the  safety  of  all classes of road users and the convenience of traffic.   These  difficulties are naturally greatest when the chief  interest to  be  served is that of through traffic.   Individual local authorities  are not always willing, and in many cases, by reason  of  their  restricted financial resources, are not able, to attain  and maintain,  adequate standards on these roads.      (2)  Already it has been necessary to reintroduce special  rates of grant for works of Improvement on the roads  in  question,  ranging from 75 per cent, to 85 per cent, and even these are  regarded as insufficient by many authorities to enable them to  proceed.   It would seem better to secure a readjustment of burden  by a clean cut transfer of a responsibility which may fairly be  regarded as national, than to attempt to secure some  modicum  of                                                                     1  progress by a mixture of pressure and special financial                                                                     I  inducement which even when successful leads to great  delay.rt A census on Class I roads has shown that the number of vehicles   passing 4830 comt)arable points was 34.6$ greater in August   1935 than in August 1931.
USMoreover, the financial assistance which the Road Fund is ableto offer on a percentage &quot;basis is most easily claimed by thewealthy authorities whose resources enable them to raise their share of the cost without undue strain, while other authoritiesin poor areas, where in the interests of through traffic theroads often stand in far greater need of improvement, may be incapable of providing so great a local contribution, with theresult that their lengths of through roads remain unimproved,despite the offer of  abnormal rates of grant.    (3)  The 516 miles of the Great North Road from london to the Scottish Border is an example of the unsatisfactorycondition of a through route.    There still remain 190 milesor nearly two-thirds of its length, where the road cannotcomfortably accommodate more than one line of traffic ineach direction,  and where,  therefore, a stationary vehiclereduces the road to a single track, and where footpathsand adequate visibility at corners have not been secured.The unimproved sections lie for the most part in agriculturalcounties, such as Bedfordshire, Huntingdon, the two divisions  Jof Lincolnshire, the North Riding, and the northern part ofNor thumb e rland.    (if)  Borne of the county councils may perhaps suggestas an alternative policy that they should be given 100 percent,  grants from the Road Fund to meet expenditure upon theroads over which they would still retain formal control,and which they would administer through the ordinary systemof local government.   This is not a solution which could be satisfactory from the point of view of transport,  nor is itone which, on general financial grounds,  could be  regardedas sound.
   (5)     I am,  therefore,  forced to&apos; the conclusion thatthe time has come to recognise  as national roads  some  4500miles of trunk roads (oractically all of which  have already-been selected under previous improvement programmes forspecial treatment), and to  transfer responsibility for themto the Minister of Transport.   (6)    The Lecal Government  Act of 1929 took a greatstep forward in transferring the highway functions of rural District Councils to  the  County Councils, and it isbut a further step in a natural evolution to relieve thecounty councils themselves  from the burden of administering the trunk  roads which are in truth &quot;routes nationales1&apos; hereno less than abroad.   In addition to the motoring organisationsthere is a good deal of Parliamentary and public opinion  infavour of  some change of this kind.   Nor will proposals  onthe lines  which I have outlined come as any surprise to thecounty councils.   In fact, the County Councils&apos;  Associationhave for some time been exploring the matter through aspecial sub-committee which recently recommended that havingregard to  the substantially higher standard of road construction and maintenance now required to meet moderntraffic, the reconstruction, improvement and maintenance  ofcertain roads of major importance should become thefinancial  responsibility of the Ministry of Transport, thework thereon being carried out by the highway authorities asagents.    (7)     1 have  just been furnished, with a copy of a circular letter  to  the individual county councils, issuedwith the authority of the Executive Council of theAssociation,  explaining the considerations which led thesub-committee to  their conclusions.   An extract from the circular letter  will be found  in the appendix t o this
&quot;MRx I memorandum and it will be seen that  the view is taken thatif complete financial responsibility be assumed by theCentral Government as is suggested,  such control of policy as the highway authorities still possess with regard to theroads in question must be surrendered,  but that with themachinery in existence the actual work  could and should, becarried out by the county authorities.authorities would thus continue unimpaired and it does notappear to the Sub-Comma, ctee that in view of the extent towhich grant aided schemes already require departmentalapproval much real difference in practice between the presentsystem and that which they have recommended is in fact likelyto ensue&quot;.   It is significant that the circular letter- pointsout that it is neither reasonable nor practicable for theAssociation to ask for any appreciable increase over the substantial percentages of grant already available whileclaiming undiminished control at the same time.   (8)    I am thus strengthened in the belief that a schemeof the kind suggested will be welcome as a substantial reliefnot only from present burdens but from the prospectiveliability of having to improve these important roads upon which an ever increasing strain of traffic is bound to be thrown,and I hope that one result of affording them this reliefwould be to assist them to find the necessary time and money-for the improvement of the important classified roads and. the network of local roads which will still remain in theircharge.   Indeed, by meeting the position in this way we shallbe on far stronger grounds for resisting the other demands which the Association are disposed to prefer for increasedassistance to other types of road.&quot;The administrative integrity of the county highway
   (9)     The cost to the  County Councils in respect  ofmaintenance of these roads,  after allowing for presentcontributions from the Road Fund, is in the neighbourhoodof half a million pounds  per annum.    It is not possible toestimate even the approximate cost of the improvements  whichwill be necessary during  the next ten years, but a [provisional estimate of some seventy  millions to be expended over aperiod of not less than ten years has been tentativelyformulated.   In fact? this expenditure would tend to bespread over a substantially longer period.   (10)   When I assume administrative responsibility fortrunk roads, I must necessarily also assume financial responsibility.    It is,  however, a matter for discussionhow far local authorities should contribute towards theexpenses which will be incurred by me in  the future.   Itwould not, I think, be appropriate that they should pay a specific percentage of the costs which will actually be incurred.   Inability in some cases at all events to find,in relation to the schemes necessary in the future, the moderate percentage of cost which now falls on the localauthority^ is indeed one reason for the present proposal.Moreover, such a scheme would inevitably lead to a claim for a share In the administrative responsibility,   any contribution would have to be based on the expenses now andrecently incurred from which, apart from a contribution,local authorities will be relieved.   (ll)   It is not practicable to require a contribution evenon this basis towards improvement costs which vary considerablybetween authority and authority and between year and year. Local authorities will therefore obtain complete relief from their liabilities for future improvements.   AS
regards maintenance costs, there has &quot;been less variation in expenditure though even here it is st 11 appreciable.    After-discussion of the whole problem with the Chancellor of theexchequer, I propose that only such financial contribution should be required as can be obtained by operation on thegeneral block grant to local authorities.   A substantial reduction of local expenditure justifies an immediatereduction of the block grant in order to bring it to theappropriate percentage of the new total local expenditure.Whether more than this should be demanded should, I propose,be a matter for consideration in the general review of the block grant which is now being undertaken in consultation&quot;with local authorities by the minister of health and theSecretary of State for Scotland.   (12)   The roads which would he selected for transfer areas shown on the accompanying map.   Subject to certainadditions amounting to about 500 miles of road (e.g. theLondon-Portsmouth Road, a connection from Newport toShrewsbury, a road from Southampton through Oxford toBirmingham, -Harrington and Preston with a spur to Chester, a road from Peterborough through Lincoln to Ctrirnsby, and severalcross-country connections in the North of England) of whichthe general character and situation justifies their inclusionfrom the present point of view, the roads selected have long-been regarded by the Ministry of Transport, and accepted bythe highway authorities, as forming the backbone of nationalcommunication, and in that respect distinguishable from theordinary  classified roads.   Although some of the latter maycarry as heavy a traffic, much of that traffic is of a more.local character.
   (13)  in generals therefore? it should not he difficult todefend and secure acceptance of the selection of these roads,on which a practicable scheme can &quot;be based, though in order toprovide for changes of circumstances, it is for consideration whether power should not he taken in the Bill to add. to theoriginal schedule other roads or parts of roads which assume the character and function of a trunk road.   It may headvisable to make the exercise of any such power subject to theapproval of parliament,,   (14)  It is not proposed to include within the scheme theportions of roads, in continuation of trunk roads, which liewithin the boundaries of county boroughs, large burghs inScotland, or the administrative County of London.   The LocalGovernment Act, 1929, distinguished betv/een county boroughs, andcounties by including classified roads within the scope of the block grant in the County and Metropolitan boroughs, on theground that in their case even these roads possessed a high degree of local importance and in Scotland the Local Government(Scotland) Act, 1929, contained corresponding provisions withregard to classified roads in counties and large burghs,,   Thesame argument applies, if not with quite equal force, to the category of trunk roads, and while no doubt there is something to be said for the view that the sections in these boroughsconstitute and should be treated as part of the through route,it must be admitted that for a variety of reasons theopportunity for effective central control is much less.    Inmany cases,  moreover, the proper solution is a by-pass lyingoutside,  or mainly outside,  the boundaries of the boroughitself, and  where this solution is adopted the expense  will,under my proposals,  fall upon the poad Fund,  while the borough will be relieved of the congestion of traffic.
    (15)   On  the financial  sides  I understand  that  the Treasury  consider  that  there  is  an  overwhelming case for excluding the  county  boroughs9 the  large  burghs 9  and the administrative County of London  from relief of the  general burden  of maintaining and  improving these roads.    (16)   As  between one county and  another the relief9  though widely9 will not be equally spread;,  but practically all will benefit?  no  serioiis anomalies would appear to arise9 and it  is9 therefore,, not proposed to complicate the scheme  by any attempt at  special adjustments  through a formula,,   At the same time9 in  their  final negotiations as to the adjustment  of the general Exchequer contribution  to  the block grant for the next quinquennium,,  the  Treasury will  be  able to pray in aid  the fact that  in this important  respect the  burdens of the counties.,  and particularly their prospective burdens9 are being lightened.    (17)   Administratively9 the basis of my proposal is  the simple  one that the Minister  of  Transport should9  as from the 1st April next (in Scotland 15th May) assume  the  functions and obligations  of a highway authority  in relation to  the specified roads.    (18)   The intention  is9 by a  process of delegation analogous to  that permissible under  the Local  Government. Act9  1929s as between county councils and district councils,,  to  use the county  councils as agents  for purposes of maintenance and minor improvementss  and  wherever possible  also  to utilise the existing organisation when  it  is suitable for supervising maj.or    : improvements,,  which will usually be  carried out by contract. The employment of  direct labour  by  the Minister of Transport would thus be  avoided or kept at a minimum.    (19)   With the  concurrence  of  the Treasury and otherDepartments concerned  the drafting of the  necessaryBill  has   been well  advanced, and  subject to
                      -9-                               123 approval of its principle9 could be submitted to the Home Affairs Committee at a fairly early date.   But before it is put into final shapes it would I suggest he advisable to take the county councils into confidence as to the main features of the scheme and it would be most helpful if I were free to consult them fully upon its administrative details.   Certain points of difficulty^ including the complications arising out of the Restriction of Ribbon Development Act9 1935, need adjustment on lines which could be most usefully discussed with the county authorities which  .2? 0 S o intimately c oncerned.    (SO)  The authority of the Cabinet is therefore requested?          (1) To complete the preparation of a Bill for              transferring the control of specified trunk              roads from county councils to the Minister of              Transport as from the beginning of the next              financial year (or some later date to be              appointed by him)5  with a view to the              introduction of the Bill in the autumn.,   The              Bill to be submitted to the Home Affairs              Committee in the usual way.          (2) To make an announcement in parliament in general              terms of the Governinents s intention to introduce              a Bill  to transfer  the Trunk Roads to the              Minister of Transport.          (3) To explain the proposals3  and their financial              effect  to the local authorities generally in the              course  of the discussions as to the adjustment              of the  General Exchequer  Contribution which are              now being conducted by the  Treasury and the              Ministry of Health  and Scottish office and  to              pursue  discussions  with the County councils&apos;              Association at  once in such detail as may seem              desirable of the  nature of  the  scheme with  a view              to enlisting their  cooperation..&apos;  193^.

As is well known, the basic grants for  improvement  and maintenanceare, and have for some years been  GO per cent,  in  respect of Class roads and RO per cent, for Class 11 roads.    So far as majorimprovement works are concerned, however,  it  has long  been thepractice of the Ministry of Transport to give larger grants in special circumstances, and this practice has  now been  regularisedunder a system by which, following the  application of  a formulasimilar to that prescribed for the purposes of the Local government act, 1529,  grants as high as 85 per cent.   (in areas not built-up)and 80 per cento (in built-up areas) are payable,  the  maximumpercentages being available in respect  of  trunk roads  in the leastwealthy counties.  It is nevertheless contended by man:/ countycouncils that, apart from the question  whether the formula operatesequitably as between the various counties,  the balance left to beborne by the rates represents too  heavy a  burden,  mainly inconsequence of the substantially higher standard of construction andlay-out now required to meet modern traffic conditions.o,  With this contention the Sub-Gommitte          will be seen fromtheir report,  entirely in agreement, and they do not think that anything less than a 100 per cent,  grant in respect of certain roadswill meet the case,  especially in  those  counties where the rateable value is low and there exist important  roads  mainly used by throughtraffic.7*  If,  however, complete financial responsibility be  assumed  by  theMinistry,  as is now suggested,  it  appears  to  the Sub-Committee tofollow logically that such control of policy  as  the highway authorities still possess with regard to the  roads  in  question will [1pass to the Department but,  with the machinery in  existence,  they see every reason why the actual work should be carried out by  thecounty authorities.

But financial considerations alone have not been responsiblefor the proposal now undLer discussion.   4s your Council will doubtless be aware, the past few months have witnessed a strongcampaign in the public press and elsewhere for the nationalisation of roads, attention  being drawn to the verylarge number of highway authorities, with the result, so it isalleged,  that there is an undesirable lack of uniformity inmethods of construction and maintenance.   This campaign is, ofcourse, not new, but the Sub-Committee are impressed by thecircumstances that, in contradistinction to the past, thetransfer of roffs to some central authority is now beingadvocated by people and journals of  unimpeachable responsibility.10.  That the number of highway authorities dealing with roadsof national or semi-national importance is in fact excessivemust,  the Sub-Committee think, be admitted, a nd there is, intheir opinion,  considerable danger that, in the absence of  somecounter-move on the part of the authorities themselves,nationalisation of roads on a substantial scale will eventuallytake place.   Therefore it is for this additional,  and in their view,  important reason that the Sub-Committee have recommended the limited transfer described above.
11,  Finally, as regards the roads  to which  the recommendationapplies, it will be observed that the phrase  &quot;certain  roads  of major importance&quot; has been used  in  the Report.   This  isintentionally vague, as there does  not appear to be  any precisedefinition of the hind of road which the Sub-Committee have  inmind.   The principal trunk roads would., of  course,  be included,but there are, so the Sub-Committee are informed,  certain otherClass I roads in respect of which the burden  of through traffic and consequent expenditure is such as to justify 100  per cent,grants.    The Sub-Committee do not  contemplate for a moment  the wholesale transfer of highway administration  to the  Ministry,and they  venture to suggest that,  on this assurance,  a closerdefinition of the roads involved should remain in  abeyancepending such negotiations with the  Ministry  as they  may beauthorised to undertake,12,  In view of the importance and  urgency of this matter  itis hoped that you will be able to take early  instructions from your Council and. inform the Association  of their  viewswithout delay.   In the event of disagreement with the Sub-Committee^ recommendation, the submission of a constructivealternative proposal for dealing with the problem  would be helpful,
