Copy  No.CP. 178 (36).CABINET.PALESTINE.     i   Memorandum by the Secretary  of  State for Foreign  Affairs.    FOR some time past I have had an uneasy feeling that the present troublesin Palestine may affect unfavourably our relations with various Arab countriesin the Middle East, and therefore circulate to my colleagues a memorandum whichI have had prepared in the Foreign Office to show the present situation in thoseStates.                                                           &apos;&apos;    &apos;   r&apos;    i .z  , -    r-.5  .   - : - . ..  ...                          . .          A. E.    Foreign Office, June 20, 1936    THE,recent troubles in Palestine have been watched with the keenest anxietyin the neighbouring. Arab and Moslem,countries.  .... ; .;&apos; &apos;.      .....i&apos;:.  2. -Th Iraq, a wave of sympathy fbr the Palestinian Arabs has swept overthe: country;   The  Iraqi press has  freely expressed  such  opinions  as thefollowing ::                                                              .. s    (Al Isiiqlal) :                     &quot;  -    -     &apos;..                &apos;&quot;    &apos;         &quot;Responsibility for the calamities besetting&apos; the Arabs in Palestine falls    upon the Mandatory Power who has imposed Upon them the castaways Of all    nations and turned their country into a field of struggle and strife. . . . .&quot;    3.  A writer in another paper writes :-. ;..                   -&apos;-&apos;.    &quot;  &quot;What adds to the indignation and pain&apos;of the Arabs is that  policy    which, instead of meeting at least in part the demands of-the Arabs- in regard    to the stoppage of Zionist immigration- into Palestine, has encouraged immi-    gration by agreeing to an increase in the number of immigration certificates    to be issued to Jews in various countries of the world.&quot;    4.  But the agitation is not confined  to the  press.  Members Of the iraqi government and  leading  personalities in  Iraq have joined in supporting theArabs of Palestine in what  they are convinced is their life and death struggle against  absorption into a Jewish State in which they would  be reduced to apowerless minority.  The Prime Minister recently told  Sir A.  Clark Kerr thatthe Iraqi Government were receiving hundreds of  requests for  help from  allkinds of organisations concerned in the efforts now being made in the interests ofthe Arab  cause in Palestine.  He said that in his opinion the vital issue wasthat of  Jewish immigration,   The Arabs foresaw that  if  it continued withoutrestriction they would be reduced to  the position of an impotent minority  underthe sway of an alien people whose intellectual and financial resources were farsuperior to their own.  It was the realisation of this fact that was  now driving    -  8678  -f13395j  -
 them to distraction.   He felt it necessary.to give His;Majesty&apos;s Ambassador a friendly,, but -serious  warning to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government-would,&apos; see the greseiu stateirf affairs-s between tiie two. peoples, much damaged if a solution of.the p roblcmi..were:not soon found..: For the moment;theJraqiGovernment! did not desire to be. drawn into taking any action in the matter,: but they might -not&apos; be ableli^^                                  was. heingclbrought upon&quot; them to champion the Arab cause. .         ,%               (i          (        ^    ,;,,.   -: 5.  His .Majesty&apos;s  Ambassador  has  received protests  from  various;i:Arab:&quot; organisations.-and Nationalist societies, notably f^ notables,--condemning  and  protesting  against  the  continuance  of  present immigration into&quot; Palestine.  Other similar protests have been received from the Moslem Youth Society.   ;;,:6.( ;,Nuri-uPasha, ion his recent  visit to  England, spoke  seriously  of the probable adverse reaction on Anglo-Iraqi relations of a continuance of the present Jewish immigration into Palestine.  He himself had come to the conclusion that the only way of bringing the present troubles to an end, and indeed of preventing their assuming far more serious proportions,  was for some means to be devised to put  a stop to the present immigration of Jews into the country.  He  had indeed suggested as much to Dr. Weizmann, to whom he had proposed that a spontaneous offer1 to restrict ihimigration on the part of the Zionist Organisation  would  go a long way towards  easing the situation and recreating a measure of goodwill amongst the Arabs.:   .     7: - The; Arab revolt against the absorption of the Arabs into a Jewish State has  placed  King Ibn Saud, who has hitherto been so strong a friend of His Majesty&apos;s Government, in an extremely  difficult position.   -,&apos;S.  King Ibn Saud is now receiving many appeals from Moslems all over the world, begging him to take  the lead in  liberating the Arabs from  the menace of Jewish domination.  He recently caused his Acting Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs (Yusuf Yasin) to discuss the matter with Sir Andrew Ryan.   Ibn Saud had  received from Haj Amin Husseini, one of the Arab Supreme Committee, a telegram imploring his aid  for their Arab brethren in Palestine.  Ibn Saud  did not wish to interfere, but sought guidance as to how he was to reply and how he was  to safeguard his position.  He has since,  through his  Minister in London, taken up the matter earnestly with His  Majesty&apos;s Government and expressed his anxiety about &quot;the position,  on the ground that the Palestine question concerns Saudi Arabia;iri&apos;fevery aspect,  and that, while Ibn Saud would prefer to maintain an attitude of detachment,  he has received  so many letters and  telegrams of protest from Moslems and Arabs that he must justify his attitude amongst both Arabs; and Mohammedans.   He  has  prevented demonstrations by his subjects whether of the Hej az or Nej d; but he would be glad of guidance as to the attitude he should adopt so as to avoid disturbance amongst his own people  and of his friendship with  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government.   The  Minister emphasised  Ibn Saud&apos;s desire to maintain this friendship and his conviction that agreement with His, ,Ma.jesty,&apos;s.^Government was in the interests both of his own country and of the Arab?; in, gerierah/lVis clear that unless some kind of detente is brought about in Palestine-, in/tli$&quot;p$$r, &quot;future the/reaction&quot; upon Anglo-Saudi relations &quot;will be seripus..       .,i nf  &quot;-             &apos; :   -       -   -     9j  Saudi Arabia, the Yemen and Iraq have now become of great importance to His Majesty&quot;&apos;s-Government from the point of view of Imperial communications. The  air route to India and Australasia must  cross over either Iraqi or Saudi territories; between  Cairo and  the Protected States of the Persian Gulf, and it is notppen tp,p!pubt.tha.t. .if Iracj and Saudi Arabia were to become hostile to british policy,th^              seriously to interrupt Imperial cdmmunications with the.^a          . jsb3  tbsM srfj Zi         &apos;wo oi i;;; ;.oi.crri iso-u/oa  isnJo .nb&apos;&apos;5 ttoqKn     10.  The importance to His  Majesty&apos;s Government of the Arabian coast of the Red Sea has also recently become even greater^, than-, before owning, to.,Italian expansion in Abyssinia.  It is  of paramount importance to Sis Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment that any extension  oOtaliamin^                       territory should be prevented, for the establishment of Italian influence on both sides of the Red Sea would seriously endanger  British maritime communications with the East.

As regards Egypt, the official attitude towards the  Palestine disturb-ances has so. far been ]entirely correct;.but-it -would-be dangerous1 !toi.assume  thatthat^tjfcitude.. will:, continue indefinitely;.-if . the : disturbances . show; no  signs  of.abating.   The  Egyptian politicians are subject to  continual  pressure fromPalestinian societies and delegations, who urge them to take up a strong andvigorous attitude.  Although the official Egyptian attitude has been correct;-the-feelings  of  the  Egyptian  people are entirely on the  side of  the Arabs,  andMr. Kelly reports that Nahas Pasha &quot; is risking some loss of popularity (his mosttreasured possession) by  openly restraining  the press, and this  despite his  ownstrong  inclination to pose as champion of distressed Arabs.&quot;       -:        -    13.  Nahas  Pasha&apos;s  own view was clearly expressed when he told Mr. Kellythat &quot;  Egyptian Moslem  feeling was getting worked up and manifestations were,only not occurring by &apos; a miracle.&apos;   General feeling of the Arab world was  thatthe present  policy in Palestine must  inevitably result in reducing all Palestine.Arabs  to a proletarian status owing to the superior financial power and business.ability of the Jews.....Could not the numerical limit of Jewish immigration,be arranged for the sake of British relations with the whole Arab world ? &apos;&apos; This &quot;attitude was supported by Hafez Afifi Pasha, who explained that the Arab delegation to Egypt was opposed to the promised Royal Commission because they said that they feared that, while it was investigating,  there would be a  huge influx of Jews.Hafez  Afifi Pasha thought that this meant that the announcement of a temporarystoppage of immigration during the sitting of the Commission would modify thesituation.  This appeal was subsequently strengthened and supported by; nahas pasha, who claimed that such  a stoppage would at once restore peace and enable&quot;the Commission  to get to work.                              ;; - .&apos;&apos; c.&apos;&quot;-.i: i )    14.  While  no doubt these disturbances,  which  have  by. now assumed the proportions of a rebellion,  have been  fomented to some extent by Italian  money and intrigue, it  would be idle to deny that they spring ultimately from a Causewhich  is fundamental- -Jewish  immigration.  The realisation that  the &quot;Jewishexodus from  Germany  will  now  provide,  to  all intents and, purposes, , aninexhaustible supply of  fresh alien immigrants into Palestine lias; fanned, intoflame the growing Arab resentment against the implications&apos; of, the /balfour declaration.                                                         ^  ...    15.  It is not improbable that the recent events in Syria and.the.discussions that are now in progress  in Paris in regard to the grant of a measure of indepemdence to Syria and the associated States have given  the Palestine Arabs greatercourage to go to all lengths to obtain their demands for a cessation of immigration iand an embargo on the sale of Arab lands to the Jews.    .;    .   ;     - .    &apos;j    16.  This problem is obviously  not a temporary one and^slwndderefi^bjr^lje;;Arabs  not. only  in Palestine  but all over the East to strike at the;. root- of. thefuture of the Arab people.  The ultimate remedy is a matter for investigation  by/&apos;the Royal Commission which  His Majesty&apos;s Government have  announced their-readiness to set up as soon as order has been restored.  Meanwhile, the immediate problem is to bring about an easing of the present dangerous situation. -    iixl eill    17.  The Arabs have effectively shown their determination to continue theiractive  opposition until immigration has ceased  and  it is  clear.from what hasbeen stated above that their determination is receivingArabs  and Moslems all over the world, asjw^support from other sources inimical to our interests in the Near East.
