Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1936.SECRET.                                                         CoPy No-CP. 175 (36).CABINET.THE TWO  NEW  CAPITAL SHIPS.              Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.    TN connection with the steps to be taken to order the two battleships of the1936 Programme,  there  are two matters which are likely to  cause  criticism,and to which  I  think  I  should  draw the attention of  my colleagues.  I know that the Chancellor shares my view that this question  is one about which  theyshould be apprised and their concurrence sought.    (1) We propose to order the two ships from two firms to be  selected without           competition.    (2) We do not propose to wait for the Report of the C.I.D. Sub-Committee           on the Vulnerability of Capital Ships to Air attack.  f .                                                      ..  ....... ,,                        Absence of Competition.            .      ; ;  .-a&apos;  2.  It  will  probably be unnecessary at this  stage to  argue the case  forcommencing the  replacement of  the Battle Fleet at the earliest date permitted by Treaty.    J3.  The earliest date at which, under the terms of the London Naval Treatyof 1930, the keels  of the ships may be-laid  down  is January 1937;  if this is,to be,done,  the ships must be ordered in July  1936, that  is, six months before thedate. for laying the keels.  Even so, it is not anticipated that the ships will becompleted before July 1940.    4.  Although complete specifications will not be ready, sufficient  data  willbe available by the middle of July 1936 to enable the building contractors to order the materials required for laying  down the keels in January 1937 and to commencedrawing office  work.                           &apos; ;  ry.-.-----  :i; 5.  If, however, competitive tenders are to be called for, we must wait untilcomplete specifications  are ready, viz., in  October 1936;  we must allow  a further;two months for tendering and another month  for the consideration of; tenders.In that event the ships  will not be ordered till January 1937, the  keels will not belaid till July  1937, and  the ships  will  not be completed before the middle ofJanuary 1941. ;.  6.  Moreover,  no new capital ships have been built for ten years, and  thenumber of firms who can now build these ships is small.   Harland and Wolff have only recently received an order for a warship (the cruiser Penelope) after a longinterval in  building for the Navy, and must be ruled out.  Scott&apos;s would requireto extend their  fitting-out basin at a cost  of  200,000 to  300,000,  and  thispreparatory work would require  to be commenced 12 months before an order  wasreceived.  This leaves to be considered Vickers-Armstrongs  at Walker-on-Tyne,John  Brown at  Clydebank, Cammell Laird at Birkenhead,  Fairfield at  Govan,and rSwan Hunter at Wallsend-on-Tyne (who have not previously built a capital ship).   Of these, the Admiralty consider that Vickers and Brown have at presentthe greatest experience, and they  could start work at once.  The Admiralty would much  prefer for these reasons to give the first two orders to these two firms.   (The       [13418]
placing of the order for a second &quot; Queen Mary &quot; mayy however,&apos;affect Brown,and possibly lead to the choosing of Cammell Laird, but I need not complicate thematter by entering into details about this:)      -             -    :   &apos;    -7.  The Admiralty therefore seek permission  to dispense with competition for the first two ships.  : .. 8.  It will be remembered that three more capital.ships are due to be begun in 1937 and  two  in  1938.  The Admiralty do  not  anticipate. any markedalteration in the specifications for these ships.  They consider that other firmscan be invited to tender for them, and, in fact, we shall be able to return to thenormal tendering procedure.    9.  In order to control the prices in the absence of competitive tenders,  itis proposed to place the orders on the condition that the firms will undertake  to quote their prices within two months after they have been  supplied with the fullspecifications; also,  to allow the  full facilities which may be required by theAdmiralty for the examination of their estimates of cost, and,  failing agreementoh the prices by negotiation, to accept the decision of the Board of Admiralty (or possibly the First Lord;  the Treasury Solicitor is being consulted  on this point)as to the prices to be paid.  In  coming to a decision, the Admiralty will,  ofcourse,  have the advantage of  considerable Dockyard experience in shipbuilding,and also of being able to consult  Sir Malcolm Robertson&apos;s Advisory Committee on contracts. The reservation of the final  decision on the  question of price to theAdmiralty is,  of course,  an exceptional  provision which has been  introduced  atthe suggestion of the Treasury, and is modelled on the arrangements made by theAir Ministry in connection with their expansion programme.  The Admiralty donot anticipate that the selected firms will object to  it.                  Report on  Vulnerability of Capital Ships.    TO.  Though  much  was  said  in  Parliament and  in  the   press  on theimpropriety of spending money  on battleships before the Committee  on the vulnerability  of  Capital Ships have made their report, such criticism  will  befound  to have  little substance when closely examined.  The Committee&apos;s main purpose is to enquire into the  extent to which capital ships are vulnerable to air attack,  and to consider in particular the experiments that have been carried outin this  connection.   While their report  will doubtless indicate their opinion  ofthe ship&apos;s design and the manner in which certain forms  of attack have  been met,together with their views as to the experiments that have been and  will  in  future be carried out, the existence of the type  itself is not a matter on which they are called upon to report.  The Admiralty are satisfied that the type must continue  if for no other  reason than that 11 Capital Ships are building in  Europe  aloneto-day,  and any recommendation that the Committee are likely to make will notbe prejudiced by the preliminary work  now proposed.  For instance,  the steelplates, armour and other materials that contractors will require  do not  dependon any matters now before the Committee;  nor does the work on gun mountings,which is urgently necessary if the programme is not to be delayed.  It is  thereforemost unlikely that any  action taken now will have to be undone, or that any moneyspent now will be wasted.    11.  It has also been argued that since not even a  35,000-ton Capital Shipcan be  made invulnerable, it would therefore be better to build smaller vessels andrely on larger numbers.  This argument partly rests on the error of supposing that a battleship is rendered more vulnerable by her size.   The precise oppositeis the truth, for the larger the ship the more severe and numerous are the blowswhich  she can withstand from modern weapons, and it must be remembered thata ship  may have to withstand  such blows over long periods in  war.    If,  by reducing size, we could provide  a considerable  increase of  numbers for  the samecost  of construction  and  maintenance, the  matter  would  be worth furtherconsideration, but, unfortunately, this is not the case.   Moreover, in the  recentnegotiation the United States refused to accept a  lower limit than 35,000 tons,and France, Italy  and Germany  are already building or contemplating ships ofthis tonnage.  So long as the  present agreed limit of 35,000 tons  is being built up to  by other nations,  we  cannot risk  building smaller and  therefore lesspowerful fighting units for our own seamen to fight in.
  : -120  For these reasons I  would propose that an,announcement, be made to.Parliament  and the Press  as soon as the firms are finally selected. .. This  is thenormal procedure and, in any case, in view of the natural desire, of -Parliamentto know when  the  orders  will be given, it would be difficult  to withhold theinformation once the firms  have been told.                             :    13.  I should, perhaps, add a note on the effect of the action proposed on theSpecial Areas, though, of course, the question of the best method of dealing withthese  Areas  requires separate consideration arid is being dealt  with separately.In the first place, 1 would point out that the firms which do not build capital ships will be eligible to compete for other ships,  and that with the full Naval Programmenow contemplated  there will be ample work for available firms.  In&quot; the second&apos;place, I would point out that the building of a capital ship is  a  complicatedprocess and  that hundreds of sub-contracts have to be  placed with firms in widelyseparated areas over the  country.  And in the third place, I would point out thatupwards of 80 per cent, of the  cost of these ships is spent directly or indirectly on wages to workmen  in  this country.   The distribution of  existing shipbuildingorders provides a remarkable illustration of the effect on the distressed areas ofNaval Construction programmes.  Out of a total of  23  million  worth of orders, 20 million  have been allocated to the distressed areas  ( 13-1 million to special and  6^ million to  Preferred  areas).(Initialled)S. H.Admiralty, S.W. 1, June 25, 1936.
