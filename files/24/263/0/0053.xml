August 1936.Copy  No.  45CABINET.THE REFORM OF  THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS.         Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.     THE difficulty in making a  change in the Covenant is no doubt almost so great as to be insuperable.  Nevertheless, if there are sound reasons for amendment, the attempt ought to be made.  There will be at least this advantage even from an unsuccessful attempt that an opportunity  can be taken to say some things which at present  are kept in the background with the result that there is  a good deal of make-believe about the Covenant.  Nothing could be more damaging to good relations between the members of the  League than the feeling that the Covenant is largely a  sham.   That that is the  impression left on most minds as the result of the Sino-Japanese and the Italo-Abyssinian conflicts is I think undoubted.     2.  Most people would agree that in the case of trouble between two or more minor Powers the  machinery of the Covenant can be and  has been made to work by the big Powers who have a common interest in preventing  trouble where they they do not want  it.  In the event, however, of a strongly armed nation being an illegal aggressor in circumstances in which it  is inconvenient for any of the big Powers to intervene the provisions of Article  16 simply will not work.  Nor is it any  good blaming the Governments concerned and saying as General Smuts is reported to have said this week at Durban that it was not the League which required  reform but the great Powers who fail to work the Covenant.     3.  The  weakness in  the structure of the  Covenant was  foreseen with remarkable accuracy by a number of experienced observers.  Sir Maurice Hankey in 1916  pointed out that nations only fight well or apply  economic  pressure effectively  when  their vital interests  are  concerned.   Sir  Eyre  Crowe&apos;s memorandum in the same year is full of criticisms  the gist of which is that moral force is alone binding on the Powers unless there is  one Power or  a combination of Powers strong enough and willing to use military action against evil doers. The Phillimore Committee in 1917  expressed  doubt whether, when the time came, States would fulfil their contract to  use the whole powers of the League to enforce submission.   The  Admiralty  comment  in December  1918  on  the Phillimore Report reaches the heart of the matter  in  pointing out  that an obligation to take  military action without regard to the  wisdom of the step as a military proposition is a serious matter and creates a &quot; considerable danger.&quot;    4. I find it impossible to overlook these opinions now that they have been tested and proved  sound by experience.  No answer so far as I know  has ever been made to them.  One or two suggestions for getting  round them have been made.  An International Police Force  is one proposal; a  federation of nations which have agreed to forego  in some undefined way their full sovereign rightsis another.  Both these suggestions are only remotely, if at all, practicable.  We come back to the  fundamental weakness of the  Covenant.  It is  a treaty; if one of the signatories breaks it who will play the part of the policeman ?  Is itan answer to say &apos;&apos; all the good  boys ? &apos;&apos;  Experience has shown  that it is not an answer.SECRET.CP. 223 (36).
     5.   It does not follow that &quot; collective security &quot;  is unattainable  because it cannot be guaranteed.  But the first step after what has happened seems to me to restore confidence in the reality of the Covenant.  The Emperor of Abyssinia implicitly believed in  it and from the very start of  the  Italian aggression  even down to his recent appearance at Geneva expected  the  League to appear  as a deus ex machina.   A  great many people outside Abyssinia, especially after the speech  of the British Eoreign Secretary in last year, expected that the Covenant sanctions would operate inexorably.  Everyone realises now that  the automatic procedure of Article 16 is a sham unless  Great Britain in the absence of the United States and of Germany, is  prepared to  assume  the immense burden of responsibility for enforcing the Covenant remembering all the time  Sir Eyre Crowe&apos;s words that &quot; nothing  will serve but adequate  force &quot; and &quot; coercion ultimately means  military action, bodily fighting.&quot;     6.   At the present moment  any  such assumption  is  out of the  question. France  is much more unready than is generally supposed.  France is simply not in a position,  and  so far as can be foreseen is not likely to be in a position, to embark on a war of national effort,  except in resistance to  direct  invasion. Her present state of unpreparedness is such  as  to make it most unlikely  that she could fight a long war and in any case she would  depend upon  Great  Britain for  necessary supplies in circumstances in which it  would be very  doubtful whether we could  provide them.     7.  So far as our own position is concerned even  looking forward  to 1940 when our  present plans  for  rearming  will  be substantially carried  out, an automatic liability to  engage in  a  war in which our vital interests were not concerned,  probably in South-Eastern Europe, would cause me  a  great  deal of apprehension.  The German Air Force and Army appear to be undergoing almost indefinite expansion.   For instance by the end of 1940 it is probable that  instead Of the peace-time  army of 36 divisions which will be ready  by the end of 1936, Germany will have between  70 and 80 fully equipped divisions.  The contrast with an army of divisions  no more  than can  be  numbered  on one hand is disquieting  if we  are  in advance committed to  a war  anywhere.     8.   The plain truth in the light of these facts is  that it is inconceivable that the Nation, still less the Dominions would fulfil a contract in the terms of Article  16 wherever the casus belli might arise.  A half-hearted  attempt  to keep faith with the nation  that comes under the harrow  of  the  aggressor would be worst of all if only in so far as we added possibly one more nation to  the  two former  allies who have already been alienated from us by our efforts  to apply Article  16.   Is it not better frankly to propose that  the stereotyped plan of sanctions embodied in Article 16 should be replaced by a declaration of intentionto co-operate with other nations in protecting common interests as to which each nation will  be its own judge.   It is safe to say that  the co-operation  in  war of the various units of the British Empire has  been secured by the voluntary nature  of the liability to. defend Imperial interests.   If there had been  any compulsory commitments it is likely that first disillusionment and  then an open breach would have been the price to be paid.    9.   My conclusion is that substantially the proposal discussed in Annex I ofFTP. 06  (5)- should be adopted.   I should like,  however, to see Article 16 recast rather than deleted and I contemplate a clear declaration as to the light in whichwe should, regard any attempt to interfere with France or Belgium or Holland-As to other  interests which we  might be called on to  join in defending, there isno  necessity  for  any declaration excluding  any  particular circumstances. Freedom to every nation including ourselves to decide as  to the use of sanctionsis, I believe, the most hopeful plan for producing &apos;&apos; collective security.&quot;  Anyhow,it represents the de facto position, and the pretence that  Article 16 overrides in advance sovereign  rights so as to bind every nation to fight whether it is  able ornot seems to me the worst of both worlds.                                             (Initialled)       T. W. H. I.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,     August 20, 1936. .
