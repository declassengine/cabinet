Copy No.CP. 177  (36).CABINET.ANGLO-EGYPTIAN TREATY NEGOTIATIONS.                        OCCUPATION OF ALEXANDRIA.          Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    IN paragraphs 13-16 and  17 (3) of memorandum CP. 156 (36) circulatedto my colleagues on the 8th June, the question of the continued occupation ofAlexandria was raised.    The paragraphs in  question read as follows :     &apos;&apos; A lexandria.         13.  Egypt will not agree to a British right to station troops at or near    Alexandria for  an unlimited  period  of  years.  But Nahas  Pasha  has    admitted the possibility of our troops remaining in Alexandria longer than    in Cairo.         14.  Nahas Pasha had already agreed to improvement of road and rail    communications  westward  from the Canal Zone, amounting practically to    the  construction  of a completely new system; and  also to our liberty of    unlimited reinforcement in the Canal Zone in the event of an apprehended    emergency.  These  offers by His Excellency render the continued occupation    of Alexandria by British troops less necessary than hitherto.         15.  In a telegram (No. 263) of the 1st  April the High Commissioner    reported that the Commanders-in-chief  &apos; feel that even the provision for    communications alone would be worth more than the retention of one battalion    at Alexandria for  an indefinite period.&apos;         16.  It should also be noted that even if the British troops have left    Alexandria they can under article 8 be sent back there in the event  of war    or menace  of war.  Moreover, the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, who    is Nahas Pasha&apos;s right-hand man  and the most powerful influence in the    Wafd,  told the  Acting  High Commissioner  on the  6th June that the    Egyptians  were fully prepared to incorporate the &apos; apprehended  emergency &apos;     formula in article  8.   This would mean giving the right to send  British    troops to  any  part of Egypt,  including Alexandria,  in  the event  of an     &apos; apprehended emergency.&apos;     Conclusions.         17. (3)  As regards Alexandria, His Majesty&apos;s Government should agree     to the occupation of the  British forces  being limited to a fixed period of     years.&quot;     No  recommendation with  regard to  this question has been  made  by the Egypt Conversations Committee of the Cabinet.   A  decision is  required and I trust that my colleagues will reach one in order  that  Sir M. Lampson  may be able to leave for his post on or about  the 26th June with complete instructions on the military clauses.       8671  [13384]
    I submit that His Majesty&apos;s Government should accept my recommendation that the occupation of Alexandria should be limited to a fixed period  of years.I am advised that the maximum period to which we can hope to secure Egyptianagreement is ten years and that seven years may  well represent the most whichwe  shall  be able  to secure.  I urge therefore that His  Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould authorise Sir M. Lampson to put forward ten years as the time limit, andto agree to seven years if it prove impossible to  secure the higher figure.                                                                   A. E.    Foreign Office, June  19, 1936.
