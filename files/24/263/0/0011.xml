COPY No. jffcfJLL,      MgIl2 .^.^M. l3.^...!1)1^ Minister of Transport.            It is desired to introduce a Bill to place the following appointments on a pensionable basis;-     (l)  President of the Railway Rates Tribunal appointed             under the Railways Act,  1921;     (2)  Chairman of the Road  and Rail Traffic Act, 1903,             Appea1 Tribuna1;     (3)  Chairmen of Traffic Commissioners appointed             under the Road Traffic Acti 1950.            The President of the Railway  Rates Tribunal  is appointed under Section 20 of  the Railways Act,  1921,  for a term not  exceeding 7 years but is eligible for re-appointment. Proposals &quot;were included in the Railway and Canal Commission Abolition Bill (1933;,  which was introduced in the House of Lords but not  proceeded with,  to place this appointment  on a pensionable basis in accordance with the  scale authorised by  - Section 123 of the  Supreme Court of  Judicature (Consolidation) Act,  1925,  with retirement  at  the  age  of  72 (with possible extension to  75).    In  this  case there would  be  concurrent reduction of  salary  from  ,33, GOO to  3,000 per  annum.            The  Chairmen of Traffic Commissioners  -  twelve  in number  -  are full-time  salaried  officers  appointed by  theMinister  of Transport for  such  term not exceeding 7 years  as may be  determined at the time  of their  appointment and are eligible  for re-appointment (Section 63 of the Road traffic act, 1930).   The standard salary of the Chairmen is 51,500a year.
           The Chairman of the appeal Tribunal under theRoad and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, receives a salary of  2,000a year and ie appointed by the Minister of Transport afterconsultation with the Lord Chancellor for such term, not being less than 3 years, as may be determined at the time of his appointment, but ie eligible for re-appoint merit.           The work attaching to these posts is of apermanent character and, in view of the qualifications requireand the nature of the jurisdiction, it is not satisfactorythat the appointments should be restricted to a short term ofyears and renewable only by further Ministerial appointment.It is,  therefore,, proposed to provide that subject to theusual requirement of ability to perform the duties, the postsmay be held subject to a normal retiring age of 65 and maximum retiring age of 70 and shall be on a pensionable basis on the usual Civil Service scalo modified by omission of the requirement of the Superannuation Act, 1909, that additionalallowances and death gratuities shall be reduced for eachcomplete year of service after 65.           The Lord Chancellor and the President of the board-dof i&apos;rade (in whom,  with the Minister, the joint power of recommendation for the appointment rests)  have signified their concurrence in the proposals  affecting the President of theRailway Rates Tribunal and the Lord Chancellor has signifiedhis concurrence in the proposal as regards the Chairman ofthe Road and  Rail Act  Appeal  Tribunal.           The Treasury also  concur in the proposals.           I  seek approval for the  drafting and  introductionof a Bill - which should be uncontroversial -  with  a view toits passage as early as  possible  next  Session.                      (Initialled)  L.H.-B.
