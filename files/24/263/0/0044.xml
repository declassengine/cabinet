Printed for the Cabinet.  August 1936SECRET.    -----                                                   Copy  No.C.P. 2M (36).CABINET.REFORM  OF  THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS.               NOTE BY THE FIRST LORD OE  THE ADMIRALTY.    MY  colleagues  will  wish  to  see  this  Admiralty Memorandum,  which represents the views of the Service Members of the Board. Whilst I have already circulated my own suggestions to the Cabinet, I would point out that apart fromthe question of method  there is no disagreement in  the broad  conclusions that my advisers and  I have reached.  We are equally clear that our  commitmentsmust be reduced to a point at which we can carry them out without endangeringthe whole structure of Imperial defence.                                                                   S. H.    August 17, 1936.                         ADMIRALTY MEMORANDUM.                     Reform of the League of Nations.    The possible revision of the  Covenant of the League of Nations is a matter that affects the Admiralty very closely.    2.   From the earliest days of the Covenant the Admiralty have been much concerned with the commitments involved  in our adherence to it, and they have pointed out on many occasions that  in any dispute the burden of upholding the actions of the League would be likely to fall  largely on the British Navy.    3.   Recent events have proved the truth of this forecast,  and in the absenceof both the other principal Naval Powers from the League, there can be no doubtthat the Covenant as it stands to-day throws  unduly heavy responsibilities on theBritish Navy.    4.   At first sight,  Article 16 of the League Covenant  seems to place uponthe members  of the League certain  very definite and  clear responsibilities, butif the matter is examined more closely, it  will be seen that this is by no means the case  in practice.   To begin with, the 1921 Resolutions  (interpretative  ofArticle 16) laid down that it is the duty of each member of the League to decide for itself whether a breach of  the Covenant  has been committed.  This  is not amatter of importance when there is a clear  case of aggression, as  in  the  Italo-Abyssinian dispute, but it is obvious that, if the dispute is one in which thereis room for difference of opinion  as to which side is the aggressor, an opening isafforded to any country to evade its  obligations under the Covenant,  since itwould be impossible to show that  it had not come to an  honest conclusion.    5.   The 1921 Resolutions also laid it down that it  was not possible to decidebeforehand and in detail the various measures  of an economic, commercial andfinancial  nature to be taken in each case economic j^ressure was to be applied.The Council was, therefore, to recommend to the members a plan for joint action,and also  to propose a date on  which the enforcement  of economic pressure was      [13677]                                                      B12
to be begun.  In the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, this  duty, for technical  reasons,devolved upon a Co-ordinating Committee, and four sanctions recommended bythat Committee were put into force,  but not by all  members of  the  League, asthe following table shows :                                                    Ntimber of Number which                                                     States   put,proposal                                                    accepting..-  into, force.         Proposal 1 (Arms embargo)      ...     ...      52         50         Proposal 2 (Loans and Credit embargo) ...      52         48         Proposal 3 (Embargo on Italian exports)      50         44         Proposal 4 (Embargo on certain minerals,             &amp;c.)    .........     ......      51         47     Four members of the League (Albania,  Austria, Hungary and  Paraguay)took no action at all, and Ecuador decided in advance of the other members to revoke the measures it had taken.     Although the defaulting States are all unimportant, and  their number small,it is clear that a precedent has been established for  States being free, if they wishto do so,  to  avoid acting on  recommendations  of  the  Council (made under  the1921 Resolutions) for the imposition of economic sanctions,  even if they have accepted the view that a breach of the Covenant has  taken place.     6.  As  regards military  sanctions, the position  is still more  indefinite,because Article 16 itself gives to the Council only the power of recommending tothe several Governments concerned what effective military, naval or air force  themembers of  the League shall severally contribute to the armed forces to  be usedto protect the Covenants of the League.  Holland and the Scandinavian countries have,constantly expressed the view that they must be free to decide  for themselveswhether or not they will participate in military sanctions, while similar viewshave been expressed by the Dominions, and particularly by Canada, who claims that she cannot be involved in war without the consent of her Parliament.   Thedraft Collective Note to  Germany drawn up at Locarno in  1925 expresses  theview that a  State, while expected to co-operate loyally and effectively,  is onlydefinitely  obliged to help in resisting aggression to  an extent which is  compatible with its military situation, and takes its geographical position into account.  Thisopens the way to considerable discretion being allowed to the country which is togive support as regards the extent of the support to be given.     7.  The view expressed by the Admiralty on Article 16 in  the past has alwaysbeen that  it is desirable to limit  our obligations under it as far as possible, andparticularly to avoid any increase of those obligations.   To this extent it may besaid that the tendency in practice to limit the scope of its obligations is all to  thegood, but, unfortunately, the effect is to increase very  seriously the uncertainty ofwhat other States will do.    Experience showed that in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, despite the fact that every endeavour was made to keep in line with the French, the steps taken by italy were such as to  single us out especially for attack and, as a result, we  were compelled to increase our forces in the Mediterranean and denude them else wherein order to meet  the Italian action.  No other members of  the League took any steps whatsoever to indicate that  they would come to our assistance, and althoughat a later stage promises of co-operation from France and other Mediterraneancountries  were obtained, and  contact was established with the French Staffs, itwas clear that in the early stages of a League War we would receive no effectivesupport from League members, and that afterwards  we should have to bear  the brunt of it.   In other words &quot; collective security &quot; would have been the  british navy and little else.&apos;     8.  The lesson to be learned  is that other countries are not to be relied uponto run the risks  incurred by military action,  and that, so far from the  presentsystem of collective security  provided by the&apos; Covenant reducing our military commitments, it seriously increases them.  However open to objection the pre-warposit ion might have been from other points of view,  it did at least, viewed fromthe: military, standpoint, have the advantage that our  likely enemies could always be clearly foreseen, and our diplomacy could be directed towards preventing or
delaying  a clash occurring until we were  ready for  it.  This  policy gave  our military advisers the following advantages    (a) They were able to decide what the strength and composition of our forces          .should be.    (b) They were  able  to dispose our forces about the world as was clearly           strategically sound.    (c) The expenditure oh creating and maintaining our military strength could           be reasonably regulated.&apos;After the war, on  the contrary, we became involved in  a system of collective security under which our military advisers  are  totally unable  to  foresee whatnation we  may be obliged  to&apos; face next and,  in  consequence, we are unable todecide ;     T) in what circumstances, and in what areas, sea, land or air, we. may have           to fight.    (ii) what time we have to prepare.With an  Empire  which,  from the  militar^  point  of  view,  is  disjointed,disconnected, highly vulnerable and very difficult to defend strategically, such apolicy, even with considerably greater forces than we possess at the  present, mustbe a dangerous one;  with our present weak forces it is,  looked at militarily, simplyinviting  disaster,    9.  It is quite  clear, therefore, that  the main  Admiralty interest in  thediscussion of Revision of the Covenant is that in some manner or  other the presentall-embracing nature of  the Covenant  guarantees should  be got rid  of and  our responsibilities and commitments should be confined to  those which we know wecan undertake, and  preferably to those which are essential to the maintenance ofour own  security.    10.   From this point of view, the obvious course is to  remove Article 16altogether, but the Admiralty recognise that this is not in present circumstancesa practical policy, and that we must fall&apos;back oh some form of compromise.  (Itis assumed that there is  no intention under present conditions of extending thescope of sanctions provided for by Article 16.)    The  Foreign Office,  in paper F.P. (36)  5, mention two  possibilities.   Thefirst is  that members should be  relieved of their  present  obligations underArticle 16 on the ground that the lack of universality of the League makes thecomplete application of that  Article  impossible, and this,  together with  thenon-execution of other articles of the  Covenant, in particular  Article 8, might make the application of Article 16 in certain cases a matter of extreme embarrass-ment, if not of grave danger,  to some,  if  not  all,  members of the  LeagueMembers, however, should reassume such obligations in respect of regions defined by themselves in which they had special interests.  In the event of war under such  a Regional Pact, other members  of the League could apply  financial  andeconomic sanctions  or. not as they wished;  if they did not, they would, however,have no claim for losses due to action by other, members under the Covenant.   Itwould be a matter for consideration whether in any case all members should agreeto apply an arms embargo and an  embargo on loans and  credits against  the aggressor.   Under  this scheme,  presumably  if membership of  the League everbecame universal, the original provisions of Article 16 would be restored.   Thesecond possibility, with much the same result, is to regard Article 16 as obligatoryonly as regards the imposition of an arms embargo and an embargo on loans  andcredits against the  aggressor, leaving members free to take such further  steps asthey might think fit.    The French wish to regionalise measures of military assistance  on  a fairlywide  basis, and to preserve the general basis of economic and financial sanctions.Presumably what they have in mind is  a reorganisation of mutual assistance on a european, or approximately European, basis. &quot;     11.  Provided  that it is understood that any form of blockade or other action by a country outside its own territorial&apos;jurisdiction, or&apos;such action as closing&apos;the suez  Canal, would  be regarded  as a military sanction, and would  in ho way becompulsory on any member except in pursuance of its obligations under a RegionalPact, the Admiralty would see no objection to either of the  two possibilities       [13677]                                                    B 2
mentioned by the Foreign Office,  though they would prefer the second, for thereason given in paragraph  15.  The Admiralty would, however, stress the viewput forward  during the recent emergency,  that  even economic  and financialsanctions are very likely to lead to war if they prove effective.     12.   The method by which  the object of  getting rid of the general commit-ment should be attained  is really outside the sphere  of the Admiralty,  but a formal revision of the Covenant in  any direction acceptable to us seems clearlyout of the question, since apart  from the attitude  of France and Russia theagreement of the small States, who would think they were  losing  somethingvaluable, would be impossible to obtain, and until such States will face facts morethan they will at present, it  seems that formal revision must be abandoned.     13.   A possible alternative  is that we should proceed by a  process of inter-pretative resolutions similar to those of 1921.   (The French Government suppor tsuch a course.) It does not seem, however, that this line of advance is much more hopeful than the problem of formal revision.  The 1921 resolutions were to  allintents and purposes unanimous, and it is from this fact that  they derive suchvalidity as they possess.  It seems very unlikely that  we could get  anything likeunanimity on interpretative resolutions in the form we should like them, and infact even a bare majority on such resolutions seems unlikely.     14.   The only general course left is that we,  in conjunction with as many other countries as would agree to do so, make a multilateral  declaration of theway we intend to interpret the obligations of  the Covenant.  If the Governmentwill give a satisfactory interpretation in this manner, the Admiralty point of view would be  met and it is satisfactory to note that some  declaration in this form isthe  least  action  suggested  in the Foreign  Office  paper.  Whether  the  othermembers of the League would accept such a course of action which, however good the reasons for taking it, would really  be a  unilateral repudiation of the fullCovenant obligations is a matter for the Government to decide.     15.   From the general point of  view, it is felt that, for the League to playits full part in world affairs,  it should be a universal League.  A universal League,even with very small paper power, would be likely to  be a far more powerfulinstrument for the peace of the world than a League with the greatest theoreticalpower which does not number among its members several important States especially the U.S.A., Japan and  Germany.   It would  seem, therefore, that themain object of our policy should be to reform the League in such  a way that thereis a hope that in time it will become universal.  There  is little doubt that the only way to achieve this is by reducing the commitments of the Covenant at least far enough to remove the risk of a country which signs it being  involved through its obligations in a war in which it has not a vital interest.   For this reason, thesecond Foreign Office alternative is considered preferable, as being more likely to attract those countries which are not now members to join or  rejoin.     16.  As regards the question  of Regional Pacts in which we should, under such an arrangement, take part,  the only one on which any announcement of our interest has in the past been made to the world is that of the Low Countries.  Itwould seem that the wisest course would  be to restrict any definite military com-commitment to this area, unless there are very strong reasons to the contrary.     The  question of  a  general Mediterranean  pact, to include France and Italy,has recently been raised in a Foreign Office memorandum (CP. 165/36, reprintedas C.O.S. Paper  476), as a useful possibility at some  future date, but it was recognised by the Foreign Office  that we have not reached the stage when such astep need be contemplated.  The desirability of an Eastern Mediterranean under-standing with Greece and Turkey has been under consideration by the Chiefs of \Staff, who reported on  the 29th July (C.O.S. Paper 506) in favour of everything possible being done to maintain the most friendly relations with Turkey, but that nothing should be done that is liable to alienate Italy and that no new military commitment should be entered into.  This would not preclude some internationaldiplomatic arrangement between  all the Mediterranean Powers with a view to themaintenance of the territorial status quo, which would  be all to our advantage.It is understood that this report  will shortly be considered by the Cabinet.     An understanding with  Turkey based on financial arrangements is  alsopresumably a  possibility.
                                     5 t.    The: question  of the Dutch East  Indies  was. recently considered by  theCommittee of. Imperial Defence.-on; the 10th July,  and by the Cabinet ,on  theloth July, but. although, it-was considered: that  their  integrity was a major.;British interest, it was, thought unadvisable to announce  this publicly, or to give.any guarantee of active support to the  Dutch. .       ...   ,    While it is very undesirable that we  should  enter into any fresh military commitments in respect  of these  regions,  it might be  possible; to  make someunilateral declaratioii iii regard to them in very general  terms, e.g., on the linesthat&apos;we should regard the maintenance of the communications of the BritishEmpire as a matter of vital concern to us, and that,  while we were  not. preparedto enter  into any  Regional Pact  involving any  definite military  commitmentsother than for  Western Europe, we should undoubtedly bear this  fact in mindin deciding what action we should take under the Covenant  in the event of  any act of aggression  which seemed to threaten those communications.   Such a formula would have the  advantage of covering Egypt and the Suez Canal,  and iraq and  the Persian Gulf.    17.  The above remarks deal with Article 16.   Steps have also recently been proposed to secure that action by the League under Article 11 is not frustratedby the necessity of securing unanimity to any decision reached.   The admiralty would see no objection to some arrangement being made to prevent action beingblocked by the  votes of the parties to the  dispute, but they  desire to emphasise the desirability for action by the League under this  article being&apos; strictly limitedto action which is not likely to provoke war, and that individual members shouldbe allowed to exercise their full discretion as to whether they comply or  notwith any League  recommendations.  Obviously,  if discretion is to be allowed in the application of Article 16, it must a fortiori be allowed in the applicationof any other article.     18.   There have been proposals from time to time in the past to provide for decisions of the League being reached with a two-thirds majority.  The Admiraltyare not aware whether any such proposal is likely to come up at the next Assembly,but they would like to make it clear  that  they would see very strong objectionsto any alteration in the present provisions, other than is  necessary to prevent the blocking  of action under Article 11 by  parties to the dispute.   Obviously, itwould not be safe to allow a general rule under  which matters vitally affectingour  interests might be dealt with  by a majority.     19.   Presumably no revision of Articles 10 or 19 will be possible.  Article 15also has  not been mentioned, and it is assumed will  remain  unaltered.   Anyprdposal  to remove  from Article 10 the guarantee of  the territorial integrity of members of  the League, or to open discussion on. Article 19, is almost certain to be strongly opposed by the small Powers, as well as by the French group.  our commitments under Article  10 will, however, presumably  be  limited to thoseinvolved in the revised interpretation of Article  16.    20.   The conclusions reached may be summarised as follows :       (1) Under present-day conditions we can expect very little  effective support           from other members of the  League in the early  stages  of a League           War, and afterwards would have to  bear the brunt of it; with an           Empire so difficult to defend, the world-wide and indefinite military           commitments which we  now have under Article 16 of the Covenant,           even with greatly strengthened forces, would be a source of  danger           to us; with our present weak forces, they may bring,us  to disaster,     (2) From the military point of view, it would be to our great advantage to           be relieved of all commitments  under Article 16.     (3) If this is not politically possible, a compromise  in the form of. either of           the  alternatives mentioned in the Foreign Office Paper  F.P.  (36) 5           (CP. 210. (36.)) would be acceptable,  provided it: is understood.,  that.,           no country outside the area covered by  a, Regional Pact  to which  it us           a party  is committed to  any  sanctions of a military nature..  Even:           economic and financial sanctions, however, are very  likely toilead.to,          . war if they prove effective.        f&apos;f       - - .-  .    u:.ti) ;;-.?:,;-::-,;.-::   -     (4) Of  the two schemes mentioned: in; the paper, the second mss considered           preferable, as more likely to lead to  the entry .or re-entry of those           Great Powers which are not now members of the League.
(5)  It  is  very desirable that our  definite  military  commitments under      Regional Pacts should be limited to a Western European Pact, but      there would be no objection to a statement in general terms  that we.   -  regarded the communications of the British Empire as  a matter, of      vital concern to us, and that our action under the Covenant would be      governed by those views.(6)  The revision of Article  11  so as to prevent action being blocked-by &quot;the      votes of one or other of the interested parties is not open to objection      provided that action  by the League under this Article  is  limited to      action not likely  to provoke war, and that individual  members are      given  full discretion  as to whether they  comply or not  with any      League recommendation.(7), Very strong objections are seen  to  any proposal that League decisions      should be reached by  a two-thirds majority.August  15, 1936.
