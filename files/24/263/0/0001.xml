(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.) SECRET. CP.  171  (36),                                            COPY Hp//-/                         CABINET.                   IRISH SITUATION COMMITTEE,       THE NEW IRISH FREE STATE CONSTITUTIONAL PROPOSALS.                            REPORT.           1.     In accordance with Cabinet  42 (36),  Conclusion 7 (b)           we  have considered the questions  relating  to the new Irish           Constitutional Bill mentioned in  the Memorandum (CP.  167 (36)           of  the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.           2.      As stated in that Memorandum,  the Government of the           Irish  Free State propose to introduce in the Autumn a Bill           to  set up a new Constitution.   While according to Mr.  de           Valera,  it is not proposed that the Bill should change the           constitutional position so far as the external affairs of           the Irish Free State are concerned,  important  changes  re-           garding the position in the internal affairs of the Irish           Free State are contemplated;   for example,  the office  of           Governor-General is to be abolished,  and an office of  a           President &apos;elected by the people&apos;  is to be  created.           3.      In the time available,  and on the information before           him, it has not been possible for the Attorney-General to           give his considered opinion on the  important legal aspects           of  these proposals,  but we understand that  in  his  view           abolition of  the office of Governor-General would,  in  the           absence of the express  consent of the United Kingdom to           such abolition,  involve a breach  of the Treaty of  1921,                                    -1-
 and that  the  creation of an elected President  might  have even more serious  implications,  though until  the  full scope and meaning  of  this  particular proposal  have &quot;been ascertained it  is  not possible  to  express  any  definite opinion in regard  to  its legal effect. 4.     In any event we agree with  the  Secretary of State for Dominion  Affairs  that  these  proposals  raise matters in  which  the  United Kingdom Government are. or may be, concerned, and  that it is  desirable  that their implications should be  fully elucidated  by means  of early discussions between the two Governments.     We  also agree  that a reply to  the  communication  ?/hich Mr- de Valera made to the  Secretary of State on 8th June,  through Mr. Dulanty, must  be sent  to Mr. de Valera. 5.     We have  carefully considered whether this reply should be  limited to  the constitutional issues mentioned in  the communication  of 8th June,  or whether it should also  suggest  that discussions should now be opened on all the  outstanding questions at present at issue between the two Governments. 6.     As  the Cabinet  are aware, we have for some time been examining  the various proposals contained in theMemorandum (CP. 124  (36))  of the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs for  arriving at a comprehensive settle-ment with the Irish Free State.     We have not as  yet reached any conclusions on  the proposals,  and while we are not at the moment in a position to submit recommenda- tions to the Cabinet,  we hope to be able  to&quot; do so, in regard at  any rate to some  of the proposals,  in the nearfuture.
7.     We are apprehensive of the results of limiting the reply to Mr. de Valera to the constitutional issues raised in his communication of 8th June.  Mr. de Valera eitherwould not reply or in replying would maintain his view thatthe matters were no concern whatever of the United Kingdom.There would &quot;be a deadlock,, it would be difficult for discussions to start at all and in the course of at most afew months we might well have to face the question whetherthe action which the Irish Free State was taking amountedto separation from the Commonwealth.8.     In such an event the reaction on public opinion athbrnfej when the facts became known., might well be seriousoIt would be said that the Government, with knowledge inadvance of Mr. de Valera&apos;s intentions, had made no seriouseffort to Induce the Irish Free State to remain withinthe Empire, for example, by offering to negotiate with herover the whole field of controversy, and that if we had so done and the negotiations had failed through Irishintransigence, no possible blame could have rested on theGovernment of the United Kingdom.  Public opinion in theother Dominions would be likely to take the same line.  If, asa result of our failing to make every possible effort, theIrish Free State left the Empire, she would go with someDominion sympathy.  If, however, she went after a genuine attempt had been made to reach a comprehensive settlement, the Dominions would be much less likely toextend any sympathy or encouragement to her.9.     For these reasons we favour a reply which, afterconveying that in our view the issues raised in the communication of 10th June, should properly be discussed
&quot;between the two Governments, would then proceed to state that forsometime we had been examining outstanding questions between our two countries with a  view to suggesting discussions andaimed at a comprehensive settlement.  The reply should suggestsuch comprehensive discussions,, and that in the firstinstance5 they should be private and informal with a view todiscovering whether a basis for agreement exists upon whichformal negotiations could then be undertaken.10.    Subject to Mr. de Valerars agreement, the preliminaryprivate and informal discussions might take place between officials of the two Governments.,lie    If the Cabinet approve the course of action suggested above., we recommend that the reply to Mr. de Valera shouldbe on the lines of the draft attached as an Appendix to thisReport o12o    If Mr. de Valera accepts our proposal for comprehensivediscussions on all outstanding questions, it will be necessaryfor the Cabinet to reach decisions on the line to be taken bythe representatives of the United Kingdom in regard to eachof the various items.  These decisions should be reached as early as possible, and in any case well before the Summer Recess,and with this end in view we propose to expedite our examination of CP. 124(36) and the submission of our recommendations thereon to  the Cabinet.13.    We must, however, warn the Cabinet that it is by no means improbable that Mr. de Valera may refuse toenter into any discussions with us in regard to theconstitutional issues, and may decide possibly at very short notice to publish his new constitutional proposals.                          -4-
It would, in our vie?/, be serious if in such an event the Government of the United Kingdom were caught(possibly during the Parliamentary vacation) unpreparedwith a policy designed to meet such an emergency, and we propose to study the attitude which should be taken up by theUnited Kingdom Government in the event&quot; of a sudden announcement by Mr; de Valera requiring emergency action.14.          V/e recommend the Cabinet -             (1)  That the reply to Mr. de Valera&apos;s                  communication of 8th June should not                  be limited to the constitutional                  issues mentioned therein, but should                  indicate our willingness to open dis-                  cussions on all the outstanding questions                  now at issue between the two Governments,             (2)  That,  if the Cabinet agree to (l) above,                  the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs                  should be authorised to send the reply in                  the form of the draft appended to this                  Report.             (3)  To take note that the Committee propose                  to complete their examination of C.P. 124                  (36) and submit their recoiumendations                  thereon to the Cabinet as early as                  practicable, and in any case before the                  Summer Recess.             (4)  That the Committee propose to study                  the attitude which should be taken up by                  the United Kingdom Government in the                  event  of a sudden announcement by Mr.                  de Valera requiring emergency action,,Signed on behalf of the Committee.STANLEY BALDWIN.CHAIRMAN;.2, Whitehall Gardens. S.w.l0j    19th June, 19360
          We have taken note of the information -which Mr.de Valera asked the High Commissioner to convey to us as amatter of courtesy concerning the new constitutional proposals which the Irish Free State Government arec o nt emp 1 at ing.          In the absence of more detailed information we find it difficult to reach a definite conclusion as to what theseproposals involve.   But we feel bound to call attention tothe bearing of the Treaty of 1921 on the proposal for theabolition of the Governor-General, arid to say that theproposals in general appear likely to raise wider issues which in our view should properly be discussed between us.          We are anxious for the most friendly relationsbetween the Irish Free State and this country.  We haveourselves for several weeks past been considering thequestion of inviting discussions with a view to a compre-hensive settlement of all the matters outstanding bet-weenour two countries,  and are engaged upon an examination ofsome of these matters.  Our examination has not yet reachedthe stage when we are ready actually to commence such discussions, but in view of the communication from the HighCommissioner mentioned above we think it well to state our intention shortly to propose them to the Irish Free StateGovernment.   In the meantime we may say that we feel that thebasis of such discussions should be that     I.   they cover5 every aspect of the relations between          the two countries.  No question should be excluded
          from their scope, and the constitutional          relationship should be included -Without          prejudice to the views of either side          concerning the implications of the proposals          of which the Irish Free State Government have          re cent ly i rif o me d us.     II.   they be conducted in the first instance          privately and informally.   This would enable          us to discover whether a reasonable prospect          of agreement existed before formal negotiations          commenced, and. would avoid any premature          publicity.We should be glad to know whether this suggestion commend itself to the Irish Free State Government, and whetherthey would co-operate in arranging for such discussions.
