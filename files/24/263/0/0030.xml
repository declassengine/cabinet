(THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OP HIS  BRITANNIC            MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).COPY NO.   c J &amp;SECRET.(CP. 200/36.             C A .B I N E T                 INDIA       Appreciation of the Political Situation, bythe Government of India, dated 16th July, 1936.       Circulated  for the information of the Cabinetby the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the PoliticalSituation in India, dated the 16th July, 1936,issued on the authority of the Secretary of         State for India.      The  first  half  of  the  year  1936 has been most satisfactorily  free  from any  serious trouble in  any part of  India.   There have  been no major communal disturbances; in  the Punjab,  in spite of  the fact that the judicial decision  in the Shahidgunj  Mosque case, reported in the last  appreciation, is resented by the Muslims, there has been no  deterioration in  the  situation and the Muslim public seem  to be content to await the  result of the appeal which has been  preferred against  the decision of the District Judge, and to be satisfied  with  the injunction issued against the Sikhs prohibiting them  from  building on the  site pending the decision of the  High  Court.   In Bengal, improvement in  the terrorist situation  is shown by the fact  that it has been possible to continue the policy of releasing detenus gradually and since  last  January the number confined in jails and camps has  fallen  from  11+98 to 128h..    The activities of communist  conspirators are being hampered by  the action taken  against them.   Some 70 Indians are known to have been trained  at Moscow, of whom about hO have returned to India.    Though the task of identification and keeping a watch  on  the  activities of these secret workers is not easy, yet the police have met with considerable success;    20 of them have been rendered innocuous by executive action,  while others are kept more or less under close observation.    In a recent criminal case in Bombay, two leading communists were convicted under the Criminal Law
                                                        &amp; i :A Amendment  Act for assisting the operations  of the  Communist Party of  India which was  declared  an unlawful association some  time  ago;   a sum  of  about  Rs. 5,000  found with them on  arrest  was also confiscated  as  forming a part of the funds of  that unlawful association.    The trial was expeditiously completed in  refreshing  contrast to  the long  protracted  Meerut conspiracy  case of h years  ago, and the result is satisfactory  as showing  that, in certain circumstances, the Criminal Lav/ Amendment Act can  be effective  even against conspirators working in secret.    2.   In  Congress circles, attempts are  being made to secure a &quot;united front&quot;;  but it is too early yet  to  say whether these attempts have been successful.    There have for example  been negotiations with a view to  bringing the Congress Nationalist Party  back into full co-operation with  Congress...   The former party, it will  be  remembered, is strongly  opposed to  the  communal award which Nehru treats as  a  matter of  trifling  importance,  but recent reports of the Hindu political  grouping  in  the Punjab in opposition to  Congress are evidence of the  outstanding importance of the  issue, in particular in that province.All parties may now be  said  to be  concentrating on  theirpreparations  for  the forthcoming elections.     Congress,although hampered  to some extent by differences in  theirown ranks and probably  also by lack of funds,  starts with agreat initial advantage of  a widespread organisation:other parties and  individual opponents of Congress  areattempting to improvise the necessary organisations.   Fromthe United Provinces it is reported that leading Muslimshave resigned from the Muslim League Parliamentary Boardstarted bjr Mr. Jinnah,   and  considerable progress is said to
 have  &quot;been  made  in developing a National Agricultural Party which,  it is hoped,  will consist of members  of  all communities.    In the  Punjab, the position has  changed materially in the last imff days as a  result of  the death of  the great  Muslim leader Sir P.  Hussein.    Though embarrassed,  possibly  more than other provinces, by personal,  party,  and communal feuds,  the Punjab could claim with justice that it was alone  in having  in  Sir P. Hussein a  leader  who,  by common consent, could  be  the first  chief Minister,  and  it will be  no easy matter to find  a successor  to  him.    3.   It is  not possible to speculate on what lines  the election campaign will develop.    As  far as Congress  is concerned,  present  indications are that the right  wing predominates, but it is by no means clear what  happenedat a recent meeting of the Working Committee  at Wardha,  though there  is no doubt  that Mr.  Gandhi  took a leading part  in the proceedings.   Though  the strength of the Right wing restrains  Nehru from  pushing  his  socialist policy, yet, as  observed by  the Punjab  Government  in a report on his tour  in  that province,  he  must  be  regarded as &quot;a potential danger  of  the first  magnitude&quot;.    In recent meetings  in the United  Provinces some  passages  in  one of his speeches clearly indicated  the  necessity for revolution  and rebellion  if &quot;Swaraj&quot;  is to  be  obtained.    By &quot;Swaraj&quot; he does not mean merely the replacement of British and Indian Officials but a &quot;Panchayat Raj&quot; or, in  other words, a Soviet regime.  The agrarian  campaign  with election cries  of &quot;reduction  of  rent&quot;   &quot;cancel  debt&quot; and &quot;abolition oflandlordism&quot; needs to be watched most carefully and it
 is possible that in some areas those engaged, in the campaign will overstep the limits of legitimate electioneering.     14..   It is now possible to give a considered appreciation of the reception accorded to the Viceroy&apos;s broadcast address, to which a reference was made in the appreciation for May.    In spite of the difficulties of effective publicity in India, the address reached a large audience and its reception by the press and the public was most favourable and,  in particular, his sympathetic reference to the needs of the agricultural population was universally approved.    One mild criticism was that it was deeds, not words,  that were needed, but that criticism is being effectively met by the steps which are being taken for &quot;rural uplift&quot; in all provinces. Another crore of rupees has been allotted to the provinces- for this purpose and in making this allotment Government have emphasised the necessity of securing the co-operation of the villagers themselves and of giving help only to those who are  also prepared to help themselves. Steps have also been taken to prevent undue diffusion of efforts and to concentrate control of work in the hands of District Officers.    In order to enable District Officers to become fully acquainted with the needs of the villagersand to  establish friendly relations with them,  the  question of freeing them as  far as practicable from routine and office work, with a view to enabling them to devote more time to touring,  is also  being considered,  but  apart  from increasing the volume  of work devolving upon District Officers,  the Civil Disobedience Movement and the  disturbed conditions of recent years have also prevented  officers  from
paying adequate attention to this vital psirt of their work,and it is satisfactory that conditions are now more tranquil.          Though the Muslim press has paid attention to .affairs in Palestine and criticised severely the police andthe British Government,  and though Palestine Day was observedgenerally throughout the country on June 19th, there appearslittle real interest in  the situation or any genuineenthusiasm for the Arab  cause.
