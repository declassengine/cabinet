REPORT.    WE have had under consideration a Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs  (CP. 165 (36) )* in which are discussed the problems facingHis Majesty&apos;s  Government in the Mediterranean as a result of the Italo-LeagueDispute.  The Conclusions reaehed in that Memorandum  are  summarised asfollows :     &quot;I. If sanctions are withdrawn by the League, we ought at once, without            waiting for the French, to state that we still are ready during the            present period of uncertainty to come to the assistance of our recent            collaborators in  the Mediterranean in the  circumstances set forth            in the. attached draft Declaration.     II. We ought not in present circumstances to hope to restore the prestige of            the  League  by   any   special  arrangements  regarding  the            Mediterranean.    III. The  Chiefs of Staff  should be  asked forthwith  to  report  on the            strategical questions raised in this paper, and on the validity of the            assumptions on which the proposals in this paper are based.     IV. When we see, after  sanctions have been withdrawn, how  the situation            develops, we ought subject to the views of the Chiefs of Staff- to            consider further the question of an Eastern Mediterranean under-            standing with Turkey and  Greece on the  lines suggested  in this            paper.      V. While a general Mediterranean Pact without Italy would in all circum-            stances be open to serious objection, the time may come when some            sort of Mediterranean Pact, including France and Italy, may prove            useful  as part of, and in order to facilitate, a general detente with            Italy.   We have not, however,  at  present reached the stage when            such a step need be contemplated.&quot;    2.  It will be seen from the  above that there are three means suggested forstabilising the  Mediterranean position after the withdrawal of Sanctions :     (a)  A declaration to the Council of the League, on the lines of the Annex to          the  Memorandum (I above).    (b)  An  Eastern  Mediterranean  undertaking  with  Turkey  and  Greece          (IV above).                 -    (c)  A general Mediterranean Pact including France and Italy (V above).                            * Paper No. C.O.S. 476.      [13379]       Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.  June  1936.
     In this Report we deal primarily with the first of these proposals.   It isclearly the most urgent of the three and although the other proposals are being studied, and some of the factors we now discuss will affect these also, we doubtif any useful opinions can be formulated until the effect, probable or  actual,  ofthe removal of sanctions is better known. Moreover these later questions will nodoubt  be affected by the policy which is adopted in regard to the proposed draft declaration.     3.  We have  examined  therefore the draft Declaration  with care,  and wenote that paragraph 3 of the Declaration appears to give a unilateral promise of support to  Turkey, Greece or Yugoslavia  in certain circumstances.  It hasbeen emphasised on more than one occasion  that it is of paramount importanceto British strategical interests that we should be free from commitments in theMediterranean if  our defence arrangements are to prove adequate to  deal witha threat of hostilities either in the Far East or at Home  and to give us breathing space  in which to  recondition the Services.   It is evident that to achieve  this we must return as soon as possible to a state of friendly relations with Italy, andthat the period of antagonism should not be  avoidably prolonged.     4.  It is also, of course, desirable that we should be on good terms with otherMediterranean countries, including, in particular, Greece and  Turkey,  but weshould greatly prefer that this result should be achieved by other means than bya  declaration  pledging  ourselves to  any extra commitment to come to their assistance.  Any action  likely to offer  provocation to Italy, and carrying theinference that  we  are not prepared to take at their face value her intentions  of goodwill in the future, might well prolong rather  than relieve the present stateof tension and defer a return to normal conditions in the Mediterranean area.With the withdrawal of sanctions, we  hope for a relief of tension rather than anexacerbation  of Italian opinion.     5.  Until  tension is  relieved  it will be  necessary to remain in our  present state of readiness in the Mediterranean and we could not return to peacedispositions and at the same time maintain effectively the assurances it is proposedto give to Greece, Turkey  and Yugoslavia.   Weakening our present strengthmight  well, in the eyes of those countries, throw doubts  on the  sincerity of our declaration.   Yet one of the objects  that has been put  forward in favour  of raising sanctions against Italy was to enable  us to reduce our commitments  inthe Mediterranean  and  so accelerate  our  own defence  preparations  and  the reconditioning of  the Services.  A public  Declaration  as now envisaged  is a commitment which may  require  us to maintain abnormal forces  in  the Medi-terranean for perhaps an indefinite period,  forces which can ill be spared forthat purpose  and which will result in a continued insecurity  as  regards defence measures elsewhere.    6.  The necessity for the proposed Declaration of a guarantee  is based uponthe contents of the opening paragraph of the Enclosure to CP. 165 (36), which states  that with the disappearance of sanctions the countries are  automaticallydeprived of the guarantee of the other League Members,  and more particularlyGreat  Britain and France, which they enjoyed under paragraph 3 of Article 16of the Covenant.  But it would seem that, until a revision of the Covenant  isundertaken, the guarantee contained in Article 16 would still remain in being in case of further aggression by Italy against  any Member  of the League.    7.  We think it necessary to point out that the proposals contained in theDefence Requirements Reports were based on the assumption of a friendly Italy,an assumption that was  endorsed by the Sub-Committee  on Defence Policy  and requirements.  The steps now suggested may  well enlarge  rather than reduce our present commitments in that area and for an indefinite  period.   If, as ofcourse is the case, we aim at an ultimate accommodation with Italy, then we hopethat no action will be taken which will postpone  it.  In the contrary event, acomplete revision  of the whole strategical situation  and of the  needs of  theServices would become necessary.     8.  In conclusion, we would point  out that the  amount of assistance we could expect from Turkey and  Greece, and  especially from  Yugoslavia,  is very smallindeed.  It would  largely be  confined to the use of  naval facilities, such as ports and  harbours  and of aerodromes.  If this country  undertakes new commitments
84in respect of these nations it may be  found that militarily we give much and receive little.  If war were to breakout in the Mediterranean by far the greatestpart of the  burden would fall upon this country, and we trust that air meansmay be adopted to reduce the likelihood  of war and the period of  tension.    9.  To sum up     (a) Our interests lie in  a peaceful Mediterranean,  and  this can only  be          achieved by  returning  to  a state  of friendly  relations with Italy.          This should be our aim even in the earliest  steps we take to liquidate          the Mediterranean situation.    (&amp;) One of the objects of raising sanctions is to enable us to withdraw our          extra forces at present in the  Mediterranean, and to return to  a state          of normal distribution which will permit us to be more ready to  defend          our interests at Home or in the Far East.  A Declaration in the form          suggested if  considered provocative by Italy  would postpone that          event.  Moreover, in order to give practical  effect to our  assurance we          could not return to normal defence  arrangements.    (c)  Although we want to  have a friendly Greece and  Turkey, it is most          desirable that that  end  should be  reached  by  means which  will not          increase or perpetuate tension.  This applies with even  greater force          in the case of Yugoslavia, which is very weak and where purely British          interests are very  small.    (d) Even after sanctions are raised,  Article 16 of the  Covenant presumably          remains  in force to check any further aggression by Italy in  the near          future.   This would appear to provide a guarantee to Greece, Turkey          and Yugoslavia.    (e)  The  assistance  we could expect from Greece,  Turkey  and Yugoslavia is          very small.  This country would give more than it receives. The main          burden  would fall upon our forces, and we  hope that all means will          be adopted to reduce the likelihood of war and  the period of tension.(Signed)ERNLE CHATFIELD.C. J.
