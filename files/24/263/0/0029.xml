SECRET.Copy No.CeP.19D(36).C ABI NET-,-m-INTERNATIONAL  IABOIJR  ORGANISATION.Maritime Conference - October 1936.Memorandum by the Minister of lab our * is   A special session of the International Labour Organisation is due to open at Geneva on 6th October in order to consider various maritime questions, the most important of which will be the proposal for a. convention dealing with hours of work and manning in ships at sea.   There is no doubt that as a result of the observations which have been received from Governments on these subjects a convention will be drafted and will be submitted for consideration to the Conference in October.   There is reason to think that if the representatives of HoM* Government at the Conference make it their objective it will be possible to secure the adoption of a draft convention which is substantially in harmony with British practice.  The question now for decision is whether thoserepresentatives are to engage in the preparation of a convention or are to take the line that the matter is one that should be dealt with either by way of recommendation only or purely by national settlement.                                                 \2,   The question of hours on board ship was first considered as a subjectseparate from hours of labour generally at the Conference which took place at genoa in 1920,   At that Conference the United Kingdom Government Delegatesproposed a convention on the general lines of a 48-hour week for engineers andstokehold hands,  a 56-hour week for deck hands and a week not exceeding 70 hours for stewards, tho hours in port to be 44 weekly.  This proposal  was rejectedand the draft convention which was eventually submitted to the Conference wasframed on tho lines of French lav/, that is a 48-hour week (45 in port) for allhands excluding officers, with compensation of hours off when in port and extrapayment for anything over 48 hours each week worked at sea.   This draftconvention failed by a fraction of a vote to secure the necessary two-thirds majority required by the Peace Treaty for a convention.3.   A further Maritime Session was held in 1929 and as a result a questionnairewas circulated to Governments9
4,   The Conference to consider the  replies to this questionnaire did not take place until November 1935 when  for the first time the  question ofmanning was added to that of hours of work, the two to be considered as onesingle question.5* .  The instructions to the United  Kingdom Government Delegate  were to theeffect that as the information obtained in answer to the 1929 questionnairewas no longer up to date and as the  question of manning had been added tothat of hours the proper function of the 1935 Preparatory Conference was merely to decide upon the questions  on which Governments should be asked foatheir views.   He was instructed to  take no part in the discussion orpreparation of a convention at the Preparatory Conference,   This view was eventually accepted by the Preparatory Conference, but with reluctance and only on the understanding that HtM,Government will make their attitudeknown and do their best to settle the question one way or the other at the1956 Conference,6,   The broad question is whether the Government Delegates should or should not engage in discussions upon the preparation of a convention, witha view to its signature and eventual ratification if its contents are satisfactory from the point of view of this country.   This raises two important issues     (a) our entry into an international convention on hours and manning         without reference to other conditions of employment, such as         wage s;     (b) so far as this country is concerned^ we should, in effect, by         ratifying such a convention, be giving legislative force to a         joint industrial agreement.     So long as the convention did not go beyond our national arrangements the detrimental effect of ratification would be that of placing veryserious obstacles in the way of any change in those arrangements in thedirection of less favourable labour conditions if the shipping situation deteriorated,
into account.   (i)  In  the first place the attitude of the Government Delegates on this   particular question must be considered in relation to the policy of   H.M.  Government on questions of hours in industry generally, both at home   and  at  Geneva.   The  general policy of H.M. Government in relation to   proposals for international labour conventions dealing with hours of work   has never been one of opposition on grounds of principle or in all   circumstances.   A distinction should be made between (a) proposals for the   reduction of hours, whether nationally or internationally, to a number   such  as 48, which may be regarded as setting a reasonable human standard   from  the point of view of health, safety and leisure, and (b) proposals for   the reduction of hours below the number ordinarily worked in the industry,   as for example, the 40-hour week.   As regards (a), it has been indicated   that  H.M. Government would be prepared to consider the ratification of   conventions which were framed with due regard to the circumstances of   industry.   In fact a Bill has just received Royal Assent for the purpose   of allowing the ratification of a draft convention limiting hours of work   to 42 per week in automatic sheet-glass manufacture, an industry where   special conditions of employment prevail.   H.M. Government has also   indicated that it is prepared to ratify the Coal Mines Hours Convention 1935,   if the other countries specified also ratify it.   As regards (b), however,   H.M.  Government has taken the view that a convention dealing solely with   the reduction of hours to 40 per week, without regard to wages and other   conditions of employment, is not a practicable proposition.   (ii)  H.M. Government has also acted on the view that a distinction is to   be drawn between legislation which would be prejudicial to agreements   reached by voluntary collective bargaining and legislation designed for   the purpose of giving statutory force to joint agreements arrived at in   that  way.   A precedent already exists in the case of the Cotton   (Manufacturing) Temporary Provisions Act which, while still  being   regarded as an experiment, has been taken as an indication that  H.M.  Government is not necessarily adverse to legislation to supplement                                       3.
 voluntary  agreements.   The Fair Wages Clause which appears in a number of  Acts, notably those dealing with road motor transport, is a further example of  statutory effect being given, though in a different form,  to wages and  conditions of employment laid down in voluntary joint  agreements. (iii)  If it were made  clear at the forthcoming Maritime Conference that H.M.  Government were not prepared to co-operate in framing a convention, even one which was in harmony with United Kingdom practice as laid down  in the recent National Maritime Board Agreement for hours  of work for  deck hands in ocean-going vessels, they would lay themselves open to the charge that their real policy was one of rigid  opposition to any international conventions for the establishment of minimum international standards.   Apart from the fact that such an attitude would appear to be inconsistent with membership of the International Labour Organisation, it would justify the critics who say that the public statements of H.M. Government are not borne out by their actions, and the effect would be to make the position most difficult  both politically in this country and in any future international discussionso (iv)   An international convention, if it was adopted by the principal  maritime countries, would mean that other countries would be under an obligation to accord the same treatment to their seamen in  the matter of hours as were being accorded in this country. In considering this question allowance must be ma.de for the fact that all countries are not as scrupulous as ours in actually implementingtheir  international obligations.   On the other hand, it is unlikelythat the existence of an international engagement would be without effect  in  any country which was a party to it, and the record of the chief maritime countries in the matter of enforcing conventions isbelieved to be on the whole goodo
     (v) It is extremely likely that, whether or not H.M. Government     participates, a convention will in fact be concluded, hut the fact of     this country&apos;s decisions as to participation or non-participation in its     drafting is hound to have a marked effect on the nature of the convention     which will emerge.   It should be borne in mind that whilst our     participation might be expected to result in the conclusion of a convention     of a kind generally suited to our conditions, our abstention might well     mean the conclusion of a convention repugnant to our views and our     practice.   A convention of the latter type would of course not be ratified     by this country at present, but future governments might find themselves     unable to resist pressure to ratify it and implement it by legislation.     (vi) As it is important to ensure that our prinicpal competitors undertake     obligations no less stringent than our own, provision should be inserted     in any convention that may emerge, making its oonrLng into force dependent     upon its ratification by a number of specified important maritime countries.8.   The attitude adopted by the representative of H.1I. Government at theforthcoming Maritime Conference will in effect demonstrate either that theGovernment is prepared to consider conventions requiring hours legislation in suitable circumstances or that the Government is opposed on principle to any and all attempts to deal with the subject of hours apart from other conditionsby means of international regulations,,   It seems to me that the latterattitude would be inconsistent with the whole trend of Government statements and action and would create serious political difficulties.   It is because ofthe importance of this issue that I have thought it necessary to put thematter before my colleagues for decision.9.   The President of the Board of Trade is in agreement with my conclusion thatthe Government Delegates should be instructed to take part in the drafting of aConvention on the conditions mentioned above, hut although the immediate subject matter of the Maritime Conference is within his province, the main issue whichniy colleagues should consider is a more general one and it is for this reason that, by the President&apos;s suggestion, I am circulating this memorandum.                                               (int.) E.B.17th July, 1956.H.Q. 815-65 G.P.
