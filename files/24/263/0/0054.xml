SECRET.                                                          Copy No.  45CP. 224 (36).CABINET.REFORM OF  THE  LEAGUE OF  NATIONS.      Memorandum by the First Commissioner of Works, commenting on                          Paper No. CP. 210 (36).    THE Covenant was drafted in the belief that membership of the  League ofNations would be universal and world-wide.   Had that belief eventuated, therecan be little doubt  that it might have been possible, provided all the nations ofthe world had been prepared  to carry out their League obligations to the  full, tohave  prevented war  from breaking  out, or, in the unlikely event  of  a waroccurring, to have brought it to a speedy conclusion.    The premises have not been fulfilled.    Membership of the League  is not universal and, partly for that  reason,nations are not prepared to  carry out their League obligations if such action may involve them  in  a  risk of war, or, indeed, even in  a serious dislocation oftrade.   The consequence has been that, when a powerful nation, such as Italyor Japan, has taken some action contrary to the ideals of the League, the Covenanthas failed to achieve its purpose.   It failed, not because the Covenant was lackingin precision,  and that,  consequently,  member nations did not understand fullytheir obligations, but because they were not prepared to face the risks or losses which those obligations would have involved.  No amendment, therefore, of theCovenant in making its obligations more binding is likely to lead to a differentresult in the future.  Indeed, if  the aggressor State had been Germany insteadof Italy, we know that  several of those nations who imposed sanctions on italy would have refused to face the risk of imposing them on Germany a strongerand nearer neighbour.    2.  The Foreign Office paper points out that  there  is likely to be seriousdivision of opinion at Geneva, when in September the Covenant comes up  fordiscussion, and suggest that it might be advisable under  the circumstances thatthe United Kingdom delegation should adopt an attitude of reserve.   Such an attitude does  not  get rid  of the necessity of having  to arrive at a decisioneventually, but it does entail  the handing over of the initiative to other nations.It is not difficult to surmise  what that initiative will be.   The smaller nations will all endeavour to secure that, whenever any one of their nations is in danger, thegreater nations shall pledge themselves to come to their rescue with all  the forcesat their disposal, both economic  and military.  We shall have an impassionedappeal from M. Titulesco, for instance, proclaiming  that, while Rumania, being a poor country, can do little for herself and certainly nothing to help  even in asmall way a stronger nation should one of them be threatened, it is the privilege of the rich and stronger nations to help poor little Rumania.  It will be no easierafter such an  appeal has been made to  adopt a negative attitude than to assertearly in the proceedings that  England is not prepared to become the unpaid andunsupported policeman of the world.

    .3.  What. then, should be the attitude of the United Kingdom delegation ?     X suggest that our delegations, shall declare that                  &apos;   &apos;     (a) In Article  10, while  we  shall, continue  to  respect  against extermi!           ..aggression the territorial integrity and existing independence of all           members of the League,  we shall only guarantee &apos;: to preserve &apos;&apos; such           integrity and  independence when  we have  or, in the future, may           subscribe to regional agreements to that effect.     (b) In Article 11 (action in case of war or danger of war) we shall press that           the consent of the parties between whom any threat of war arises shall           not be necessary  in the unanimity required of the League as regards           its recommendations under this Article.     (c) In Article 16 (sanctions)  we shall prohibit the export of arms to,  or the           raising of credits for, any nation  which has  been  declared  by the           League to be the aggressor or threatening to be the  aggressor under           Articles 11, 12, 13, 15 and 17, and that we  reserve  to  ourselves the           right to participate should we desire to  do so in  such  other  action,           economic or military, as the League shall recommend.     (d) In A rticle 19 (Review of Treaties) we shall recommend that  the Covenant           be separated from the  Treaty of Versailles.     4.  I  recognise that the above  proposals  are not heroic and that they will meet with considerable opposition  at home and still more from some of the member States of the League.  It is dangerous, however, to subscribe to obligations which, whatever members of the  League of Nations Union in England may affirm, no Government in the United Kingdom would give effect to up to the point of going to  war. Moreover, if the League  cannot prevent the  outbreak  of a  war or bring  it to a  speedy conclusion, the best thing it can  do is to localise it.  The Covenant as it exists does exactly the opposite.     It appears to me that the defection one by one from the League of member States  is an  even greater  loss to  its effectiveness than the cutting down of its obligations.  The first duty  of the League therefore should be to bring back  if possible into the League such nations as now stand outside it.   It is doubtful whether any obligations greater than those  suggested  above would in the near future be acceptable to either Germany or Japan it  is, unfortunately, useless for the present to expect collaboration from the United  States if the Covenant contained  any obligation  to undertake  more  than  the  passing of  pious, but ineffective, resolutions.  It is still  more doubtful whether  any greater obligations, short of an all-embracing pledge to go to  war against an  aggressor State, would, in fact, provide  any real  deterrent to the autocratic  nations of the world, or whether, in the words of the  Foreign Office paper, they might merely serve as an irritant.     5.   If the terms of the  Covenant are to  be modified  as suggested,  how is this to be done ?     It is almost certain that it will be impossible to obtain for any amendment, whatever it may be, the unanimity of the members of the Council and the support of the majority of the members of the Assembly as required under Article 26. I suggest therefore  that the United Kingdom delegation be authorised to put forward amendments in the form of resolutions and that, in doing so, they should state that, while prepared to  consider and perhaps to accept amendments to their proposals, they will, failing  acceptance of resolutions on the general lines they have put forward, declare  that these proposals will in future govern the actions of this country under the Covenant.    Unless our proposals are accompanied by some such declaration as  I have indicated it would seem probable that  the speech in which they are  put forward will be followed by set speeches from the representatives of other nations, and the diversity  of opinions will be such that no conclusions will be reached.  No one will then  know  whether  the proposals which we have put forward will in future govern  the policy of this country or whether we remain bound under the present interpretation of the Covenant until  such time as a different interpreta- tion has been agreed upon between  the nations.    6.   I recognise that the action proposed  above  is  bold  and that it will undoubtedly incur severe criticism in some quarters.   That, however, will be the case whatever we do or leave&apos; undone.  The world, however, is waiting for a lead,

W. 1,      August 14, 1936.and it is for,England once again to give it. ;Nothing is to be gained.1 by leaving the initiative to any other  country and grave risks are  incurred by so, doing. :    Still more  is this country&quot; waiting for a lead from the Government on thismatter. The public has learned much from the Italo-Abyssinian dispute.  It haslearned that &quot;collective security &quot; is neither collective nor does it give security.It has become seriously disillusioned and has begun to understand that it cannotunder  the Covenant obtain security on the cheap.  It is, therefore, beginningmore and more to consider whether it should not reduce its commitments.  Recentdebates in the  House of Lords  show how far  the movement has already goneamongst the ranks  of supporters of the Labour party and  still more amongstIndependent Liberals.   From the political point of view the situation would be serious were the Labour party to adopt non-interference as their slogan whilethe National party  was left with an  indeterminate policy which would satisfyno one.  The suggestions here made are  not,  however, put forward for  that reason, but because I believe them to be those that accord best with our interestsand with the historical  traditions of  this country. They differ somewhat fromall the solutions put forward in the five appendices to the Foreign Office paperalthough they approximate to those in Appendix III.
