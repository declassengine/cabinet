CABINET.                               GERMANY.         Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a report on the impressions derived froma recent visit to Germany by a trusted and trained observer, who had the oppor-tunity, during his visit, of meeting a number of prominent personalities in thatcountry.    I would draw special attention to the suggestion that an attempt is likelyto be made by Germany before long to liquidate the position at Memel and Danzig,and to the further expression of opinion that, if &quot;Western Europe tries to inter-vene in Russo-German disputes, it will mean war.                                                                   A. E.    July 20, 1936.    GENERAL IMPRESSIONS GAINED DURING A VISIT TO GERMANY BETWEEN                        JUNE  18 AND JULY 8,  1936.    THE first impression after an absence of two years was the surface normalityof the population  in general -an  increase in prosperity, motor cars, &amp;c. the bearing and assurance of the people the fine physique of the young.    The Nazis certainly know how to manage the average German, the countryis orderly and, one feels, voluntarily so by virtue of the   new spirit.&quot;  whatever may be said to the contrary, as a result of the ceaseless propaganda the majorityof people of all classes with whom  one  spoke seemed imbued with their  newreligion of  &quot; Kameradschaft.&quot;  The  method worked in U.S.S.R. and is working in  Germany.   The  former used  mass  execution  for  opponents the  latterconcentration camps and work.    Underneath this  normal surface  one  sees  the unflagging  energy  of  the managing Directors of Germany.                     &apos;    Stripping one&apos;s conversations of all propaganda, there is abundantly evidentthe determination to see the programme through.  The  tactics to be employed arethose  so successfully used up to the present,  i.e.,  take first, and. if anyone wants to argue, let him come.    That part of National Socialism which was sold to the  Army for its necessarysupport is gradually being  gathered^ back by the party.  The young officers ofthe conscript army are  Nazis, and one has the impression the time  has gone forthe military to make a  coup.  Hitler  will act when and where he pleases.    Germany now considers herself strong enough to tackle the minor points ofher programme.  That she is  strong enough, or will be in the very near  future,one cannot doubt.   In almost every town of any size whatever, barracks, barracks      8727   [13545]                    Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1936.SECRET.                                                        Copy No.  42CP. 201 (36).
and  more barracks appear to be under construction or completed.   &quot;Whereveraerodromes are seen, they  are very large 50 per cent, seem as yet unoccupied,yet already the Air Force is  about 1,000 strong,  according to recent estimates.     Rearmament seems to be  on a scale only hitherto heard of in U.S.S.H., andto man all this equipment the whole youth of Germany is being trained one way or another.  From the age of  10, the German boy becomes a prospective soldier.His  training at 16 is purely military by the time he leaves the Arbeitsdienst tojoin the army, he is a complete soldier except for a short technical training.     The impression,  therefore, is of  a normal surface with a vast militaryunderside. In this respect East Prussia was very illuminating.  Here, Eric Kochis carrying  out  a real socialisation of  the country as  regards  industry,  landsettlement and town planning, whilst, interwoven with this, the whole State ishoneycombed with barracks and troops.  East Prussia, one feels, is the modernMarienburg of the Teutonic Knights, expressly  for the penetration of the East.     The spirit of this very interesting man is clearly seen when he expressed the wish to be buried by the side of the Grand Masters of Marienburg with his faceto the East.     Koch is a character worth studying bluff, hearty, indefatigable, a real leaderand, unlike the average German, sincere.     During a good many hours&apos; conversation, Koch spoke perfectly frankly.His  theme was  simply the determination of the  Germans to carry out theirEastern expansion programme in spite of all  comers.   He is  perfectly sincerewhen he puts forward the theory that just as wars started between  clans,  thentribes, then principalities, and later between countries, so the future war will be between  races Asiatic, European and  certainly in  East  Prussia Asia  isvery close, just across the border.     Koch explained to us the growing canker of Memel. It is certainly festering,and  rapidly.  The Guarantor Powers can only blame themselves if it bursts.     This man is looking far ahead.  He sees only two alternatives for Europe -Bolshevism and absorption by the Asiatic, or co-operation to keep out this menace.Without co-operation, Germany will fight it alone, and thereby hopes to keep herlife and independence at best a little longer than the other European countries.     One feels it is a pity the  two menaces to peace cannot be allowed to fight it out between themselves on the other side of Europe.  This is apparently whatGermany  wants.  If Western Europe  tries to interfere,  no sane man can  helpbeing certain that it will mean war quick and strong.     One gets the impression, after six hours spent with this  man,  that his is going to be the responsibility before long of liquidating the Memel and Danzigpositions.  It seems  unlikely  that anything  will  happen during the OlympicGames, but one sentence is significant &quot; Time is getting very short.&quot;     A desire for Anglo-German friendship is to  be found  among all classes of germans.  To what such a friendship would lead is, of course, debatable, but when one sees the organisation of this nation to-day and the  determination to fulfil its so-called destiny, one wonders what the alternative to co-operation is surely war.     Germany is already confident of her strength as well she may be.
