168  j(s)ENT IS THE PROPERTY OP  HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT. )             C A:, B I N E T .           THE KING&apos;S HOLIDAY.     Memorandum by the Home Secretary.     The King is proposing to take a holiday on theContinent for a month frem July 25th.   He would like tohe relieved, as far as possible, of the daily &quot;burden ofsigning his name to large numbers of documents while heis away, and the question arises whether any arrangementsfor this purpose are possible.     The precedents are not in favour of appointingCounsellors of State for this purpose.    Even in 1925,when King George went to the Mediterranean for a holidayon the advice of his  doctors, two boxes were sent dailyto him in the ordinary way, containing documents for hissignature..   The four Counsellors of State who were thonappointed (Prince Henry (now Duke of Gloucester), the archbishop of Canterbury,  the Lord Chancellor, and thePrime Minister) were  created only for the purpose ofdealing with any urgent business that might arise.   Theearlier precedents are, generally speaking, against theappointment of Counsellors of State for any purpose whenthe Sovereign is on a Continental holiday - QueenVictoria, for example, went every year  to the South of france  but had papers sent after her, and King Edwarddefinitely re-fused to delegate his authority in 1901.     There is a further reason which may bo considered as now making undesirable the delegation of the power topjLg R e.J  .COPY NO:
           sign.    It is recognised that  this could not ho done in           the  case  of Dominion documents and I understand that the           Dominions Secretary has arranged with Buckingham Palace           that urgent Dominion documents will Toe sent to The King           while he is abroad and will be dealt with by him           personally.   Any delegation of the signing power would,           therefore, have to be limited  to United Kingdom business           and it is undesirable to provoke the comment which might           arise from this distinction.      (4)       But my Cabinet colleagues will share my strong           desire to secure frv His Majesty during his holiday, as           far as possible, relief from what is a burdensome           though necessary task.    The Home Office-has to submit           for the Sign Manual a considerable stream of documents          but most of them do not necessarily call for instant           signature.   I am accordingly arranging to reserve all           documents which are not urgent, and if the other          Departments which have  documents to submit will take the          same course,  this I think ought to relieve His Majesty          very substantially.                             (Initialled) J.S.Home Office, S.W.I.,     8th July, 1935.
