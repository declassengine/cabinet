 THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY (f HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTIC GO?ERM/IENT. SECRET.                                                      COPY 2X0*^^ t^/ CP. 275 (38V                            CABINET.                     Custody of Children (Scotland)  BUli                Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland, 1.     This Bill, which has been introduced by Mr. ErslcLne-Hill, empowers        the Scottish Courts to make orders as to the custodjr of children        under the age of IS.   At present, the statutory powers of the        Sourts to make custody orders extend only to the period of the child&apos;s        pupillarity, that is, up to age 14- in the case of boys and age 12 in        the case of girls, and there is some doubt as to the common law powers        to deal with the custody of children above those ages. 2.     I understand that in England the powers of the High Court to make        orders under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1886, extend to children        under age 21.   The powers conferred upon the EngEsh Courts of Sunna^        Jurisdiction by Section 7 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1925,        relate,with certain exceptions, only to children under age 16. 3*     The proposals of this Bill appear to constitute a desirable reform and        should, I think, be non-controversial.   I should, therefore, be glad        to have the authority of my colleagues to indicate that the Bill has        the Government fs sympathy and to facilitate its progress as far as        possible.   The Seoond Reading of the Bill is to be taken on the -        9th December.                                             J.C.Scottish Office,        2nd December, 1938.
