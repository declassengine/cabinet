My colleagues will  remember that at their Meetingon the 18th May,  1938,  they agreed to refer certainpapers on the Export of German armaments (CP.  117 (38))to the Committee  of Imperial Defence for examination indetail from the point of view of the possible applicationor adaptation of  German practice mutatis mutandis to thiscountry, and that I was made responsible for preparing the various groups of questions raised in these papersfor the consideration of the Committee of Imperial Defence.These Papers were taken by the Committee of ImperialDefence at their  330th  Meeting held on 21st July, 1938,when it was agreed that there were certain specific points in the German arrangements, the adoption oradaptation of which, possibly in a modified form, would
be likely to help in reaching a greater measure of warpreparedness in this country, and also possibly in strengthening the position of the export trade.   Iwas invited by the Committee of Imperial Defence toexamine these points in consultation with theDepartments concerned and to report to the Committeeof Imperial Defence.     Some of these points havebeen separately considered and decisions have beentaken either by the Cabinet or the Committee ofImperial Defence.    The present enquiry arises outof the export trade, of which no special examinationhad taken place.-2.       Discussion of this matter was resumed at the340th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence heldon 1st December, 1938, when the Committee had underconsideration a Memorandum by the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee on the relative strategic importance of countries requiring arms-from. the JJniied Kingdom(C.I.D. Paper Ho, 1488-B)oThe Committee of Imperial Defence agreed:-    (a) To approve the Memorandum by the          Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee          on the relative strategic          importance of countries requiring          arms from the United Kingdom          (C.I.D. Paper Ho. 1488-B).    (b) To invite the Minister for          Co-ordination of Defence, in          consultation with the three          Service Ministers and their          Advisers, ^o prepare a Paper  for          submission to the Cabinet, dealing          with the practicability of          increasing our manufacturing
4 VOJL  V &amp;        capacity for certain armaments,        with a view not only to building        up a greater war potential for        ourselves, but also to placing        us in a position to supply        foreign countries..(c)  That the ?aper* referred to in        Conclusion (b) above, together        with the Memorandum by the       -Chiefs of Staff (C.I.D. Paper Ho.        1483-B) and the Minutes* of the .        discussion thereon, should be        referred to the Cabinet by the        Minister for Co-ordination-of        Defenceo3*     In connection with this question of foreign&apos;rearmament orders I reminded the Committee of ImperialDefence that, at the meeting of the Cabinet held on17th February, 1933, when the question of Belgian war requirements was under consideration, BSgr  colleagues had agreed that-no- -o-xpend.!tu^e^Xaxi-^lhe provisioruof-shadowfactories or other forms of war potential should beundertaken by His Majesty1s Government on behalf of Belgiumover and above what was necessary for our own needs.Whi-l^tr--ti]Lis. conclusion applied spe-cifAeally to- Belgium,it had been taken as being of general applicability toall foreign orders-for armaments, including those ofthe Portuguese Government, whose demands were on a considerably larger scale than those of other foreigncountries.* Sec Annexes I and II to this Paper.
40      In accordance witli Conclusion -(c). above, Iconvened a Meeting of the three Service Ministers andtheir Advisers on Thursday, 8th December, 1958o   our examination of the problem of export of armamentsshowed that the principal items requiring considerationare        (a) Aircraft;        (b) Guns and Ancillary Equipment;        (c) Armour. &quot;&quot;&quot;Other items of armanent supply are, of course, requiredby foreign countries.   These, however, are of comparatively minor importance, and can usually bemet with little difficulty.   I propose, therefore, to confine myself to the three principal items set outab ove 0AIRCRAFT.5.      During the period 1st April, 1957, to 5thDecember, 193S, the Air Ministry have been able to release for export 600 aircraft out of a total production of approximately 4,600 and are planning to deliver a further 500 aircraft to complete existingforeign orders.6.      Generally speaking, the position in regard tothe export of aircraft may be summed up as follows.The Air Ministry are, with difficulty, just aboutkeeping pace with export demands by giving tokendeliveries early, thereby obtaining a firm order andcompleting it at a later date more convenient tothem.   If more money were nor to be spent on creatings  No difficulty is experienced in meeting such demands   from foreign countries for hulls and machinery of war   ships as have been placed in this country, except in   regard to those warships which require considerable   quantities of armour..
additional manufacturing capacity it would not bein production for a period of from twelve to eighteen months, by which time the situation based on existing      &quot;capacity would be much easier.  If this country remains at peace the  Air Ministry would, on their present plans, be able to produce about 16,000 aircraft duringthe years 1940 and 1941, and their peace requirementsduring this period, provided the situation did notchange, might not be more than 12,000.7.     On the other hand, it must be noted that theAir Ministry have not yet organised sufficient manufactur-ing capacity to meet their own estimated requirements in time of war.  The Air Ministry regard it as -feasible to extend still further the capacity in this countryfor the manufacture of aircraft;  but this can only bedone if reasonably big orders are placed.  This wouldinvolve substantial additional expenditure.8,     My conclusion in regard to the export of aircraft is that by giving a small proportion of our output, foreignrequirements can be met and with the increase in ourproductive capacity which is taking place the situationis likely to improve in course of time.  I do not, therefore recommend  that any steps should be taken to developadditional capacity solely for the purpose of meetingforeign orders for aircraft.  The question of developingfurther capacity to meet the needs of the war potentialis a large question needing separate consideration.
 GUNS  AND ANCII&amp;A3Y EQUIPMENT. 9.-     The demands, actual  and prospective,  for munitions received from foreign countries have to a  * large extent consisted of demands  for  gun equipments,, Por example, there is  the demand from  Portugal for anti-aircraft guns, and a proposal that her  Field Array should &quot;be re-equipped  with  modern  field guns.        As an approach  to this  matter I propose,  in the first instance,  to review the  extent of our  existing capacity in  relation to (a)  the  needs  of our existing Defence Programmes,  and (b)  the  capacity which we should require in  time of war,  i0e0, war potential. 10.-  Existing Naval Programme.   Broadly speaking, the capacity to  meet requirements  under the present Naval Programmes,  both in regard  to  guns and to gun mountings,  is fairly satisfactory; subject to the points referred to below. The Admiralty, however,  express  some anxiety in regard to the  position on the  following grounds. 11.     First, that a considerable  proportion of the heavy gun capacity (amounting to 30 per  cent, of heavy guns over 6-inch,  and  33 per cent0 for 6-inch guns) is located at woolwich,  and that the  capacity  for heavy guns generally is less  than in 1914 owing  to  firms having gone out ofbusiness. 12.-     Secondly, the Admiralty-, point  out that in regard to heavy gun mountings,  the Programme  absorbs the whole of the existing capacity  and leaves no margin, end that it is therefore  now necessary to  fix  the dates of ordering ships
GO suit the available gun mounting plants and pits.The consequence is that some ships have to he orderedlate in the financial year in &quot;which they are approved.There is no reserve capacity at present for any largerprogrammes.15,     Should Germany and/or Japan increase their navalprogrammes this country would not he in a position toincrease her programme, if this should he found desirable,all capacity for heavy guns and mountings being fullyengaged.   Thus, Germany has recently notified us ofan alteration of two of her Cruisers already under construction from 6&quot; to 8&quot; guns, but we are not in aposition to make any corresponding change in our pro-gramme.14o     It is also pointed out that the present capacity is insufficient to compete with both Naval and Military(coast defence) requirements in heavy gun mountings atthe present time.   If there should be any increase in therequirements of gun mountings for 6-inch guns for the Army,the present available capacity would be insufficient tomeet the demand of both Services.15.     War Potential.   Generally it may be said that the&quot;war potential&quot; required under the naval hypothesisfurnished to the Principal Supply Officers Committee inJuly 1956, will be available.16.     As regards gun mountings, production in thesmaller types can generally meet the naval hypothesis.
 As regards 6-inch gun mountings,  thero is sufficient   capacity to meet the existing programmes; &quot;hut in the event of war the programme could only be  expanded to the extent of laying down three additional  6-inch (12-gun)  cruisers,, 17.    At the meeting held on the 8th December, however, it was stated that  the Admiralty wished to be  in a position to continue the laying down of a number  of heavy ships  or  of ships armed with large calibre guns  after the outbreak of War.   The proposal to  lay down heavy ships  after the outbreak of war (as contrasted with the rapid  completion of ships  already under construction,) represents an addition to the existing naval hypothesis, and would involve an increase in  gun and gun mounting and armour requirements which could not be met from  existing capacity.                       Army. 18.     Air Defence of Great Britain.    The gun  capacity at  Nottingham and that available  for this purpose at woolwich amounts  to a  yearly output of approximately 450 guns  of medium  calibre.   At their  Meeting  on the                  as 7th November,  1938  the Cabinet  agreed  inter alia that  thenumber of  A.A.  equipments at present authorised should be increased  to the  number specified in the  &quot;Ideal Scheme&quot; (1,254) together  with  the additional numbers required for ports  abroad,  and that the.War  Office  should be  authorised to  create  the  capacity required for carrying outthe increased programme,  The War  Office are now making arrangements for the establishment of a further factory Ins  Cabinet 53 (38),
 the Glasgow area.   This  factory will  deal  with gun machining only,  the  forgings  and mountings being  carried out in existing or  additional  industrial capacity.  This factory will be in production fifteen  months from the date on which the project is  approved, and the expected  z*ate is 300  guns  a year, plus spare  liners.   The War  Office have made arrangements forpredictors  to hoop pace  with gun production by placing orders in  the U.SfA, and by bringing  in a new firm in this -country.19.    My  conclusion on  the question of capacity for A.A, gunmanufacture is that tho  existing capacity is clearly insufficient to Jiieot approved requirements within a period which can beaccepted as satisfactorjr, and  that the additional capacityprojected in the Glasgow area should be proceeded with as quickly as possible020.     Field and Medium Artilleryo  As my colleagues are aware, the production of A.A. guns has been given first priority.  Asregards Field Artillery  (25-pdr0) a substantial amount of work:has been done in converting and relining 18-pdrs., but this,of  course,  represents  only a fraction of the programme of modernisation and little has yet been done as  regards the approved programme for new 25-pdr. equipments.  As regardsMedium Artillery the only steps which are now being taken areto  reline  the 60-pdrs, and to prepare for  the production of thenew 5-inch Howitzers,  deliveries of which will  start at theend of 1939.  Broadly speaking, very little has so far beendone to modernise the Field and Medium Artillery for the Army,and no production of modern types can start before June, 1939,when the War Office propose to allot some capacity at Nottinghamand Woolwich now engaged on A  A.:, gun production for work onHodiuv.: and Field Artillery..,    1* is clearly desirable to take steps to remedy this position  as early as possible,
21.  War Potential.   It must be remembered thatno effective war potential for munitions can be created unless Departments are authorised to incurexpenditure in peace and to place educationalorders.22.    Under present conditions, the War office are only authorised to incur expenditure on building up v/ar potential for A.D.G.B. , certain ports abroad and a field force of one contingent of the regulararmy.s  Broadly speaking, the war potential whichhas been created is adequate for this purpose, with one important exception, namely, that there is a grave deficiency in the capacity to meet warwastage in liners, mainly on account of the high rates of wastage expected in anti-aircraft guns.Further, no authority has been given, and no action has been taken, to build up war potential for certaincommitments outside the scope of the field force,which cannot be ignored.  Examples are the middle east garrison, reinforcements from India and colonial Office troops,  These and similar commitments in the aggregate produce a formidable deficiency.23.    The Dominions have on several occasionsintimated the possibility of an early contribution of trained reinforcements, but have stressed the*Under the hypothesis issued to the Principal supply officers Committee, provision is made for a secondcontingent of the field force, but whilst paperplanning may proceed on this basis, no expenditure to develop war potential for a second contingent orfor other existing Commitments has been authorised.
1 d u fact that  they must  rely  on the United Kingdom for the necessary war  equipment,  reserves and war potential for  such contributions.  Again? our political  and  military obligations  with&apos;certain countries  such as Iraq, Egypt  and Portugal will produce certain immediate demands  on our war capacity in the  event  of war;s 24.     Some of my colleagues will also  be aware that  the Secretary of  State for I!/ar has  submitted to  the  Committee  of  Imperial Defence a  paper7^ in  which he urges that  authority  should now be  given to provide  the necessary equipment and warreseiwes for a  second contingent  (Territorial Army) of-the field force..   I  do not, of course suggest that the Cabinet should now be  asked to  sanctionwar capacity in respect of proposals which are under consideration but have not  been authorised,but it  is,  of  course, obvious  that  any  additional capacity now created would facilitate the speedy provision of equipment  for any expansionof our field force which might  later be  authorised,whether before or after the outbreak of war. &apos; The principle in regard to orders from theDominions, as agreed at the Imperial Conferenceof 1936, is in effect, that Dominion requirements should rank equally with Foreign countries towhom we have Treaty obligations.  The presentposition is that all Dominion and Foreign orders have to be met from within the capacity beingcreated under our present Deficiency programmes and in most cases their demands cannot be met in a reasonable time unless they are given priority over our own needs.^C. I.D. Paper No. 1498-3.
                 ARMOUR.25.       A considerable amount of additional capacity for armour has been laid down since the Defence programmes were started.  The Admiralty, however, represent thatthe capacity for armour,  like the capacity for heavygun mountings, unless further increased  would prevent any increase in our existing  shipbuilding programme So     The armour firms are now working to full capacity, and no additional armoured vessels couldbe laid down in war until some of the present orders havebeen completed, v/        OBSERVATIONS ON THE GENERAL CAPACITY OF            THE COUNTRY FOR GUN EQUIPMENTS.26.       As I see the matter, the main points in regardto the capacity of this country for the manufacture of guns and ancillary equipments may be stated as follows:-          Our consideration of this problem started fromthe question whether it was practicable to increasemanufacturing capacity in this country, in order to put ourselves in a position to supply munitions to foreigncountries.   An examination of the problem, however, showsthat before we shall be in a position to make any effectivesupply of guns, etc. to meet foreign orders, we have still to make arrangements to.create manufacturing capacityadequate to our own heedso   Thus:-     (i)  Some additional gun capacity for medium calibreshas, of course, been created to cope with  the authorisedprogrammes.   Consideration was given to proposals tocreate further now capacity,-,   It was, however, decidedthat this would not accelerate the completion of thoprogrammes, owing tc the time which it would take tocreate additional capacity, and to the difficulty inobtaining skilled.labouro       Tho decision to increasethe number of AoAo equipments at present authorised                          -12-
to the number specified in the &quot;Ideal Scheme&quot; (1,264),alters the position.      If additional capacity isnow created, it would come into operation soon enough toprevent further delay in completion of the authorisedprogramme of field guns.  Work on that has been deferred,as a result of the priority given to the A.A. programme.     (ii) The position in regard to war potential is setout in paragraphs 15-17 and 21-24.   AS a result of^a.number of factors, of which the chief is the high rate of wastage in A.A.liners, we require additional capacity to meet existing needs.     (iii) The heavy gun industry is in a poor positionas compared with 1914, and the Admiralty suggest that the capacity for heavy guns, heavy gun mountings and armour should beincreased in order to put us in a position to meet, by acorresponding increase in our building programme, anysudden increase in the building programmes of Germany orJapan.  In particular the Admiralty regard an increase inour capacity for heavy guns as necessary in order that weshould be. in a position to lay down heavy ships onthe outbreak of war.     (iv) A measure of risk is involved in the fact that alarge proportion of gun manufacturing capacity, especially for 6&quot; calibres and over, is located at Woolwich Arsenal.                  STEPS CONSIDERED NECESSARY.27*       As indicated in paragraph 8, I do not recommendthat any steps should be taken to develop additional capacity for foreign requirements for aircraft, but  theproblem of creating adequate war potential for  the AirForce needs separate considerationo
28*       I recommend that immediate action should be taken  -to establish the new factory proposed by the WarOffice in the Glasgow area for the primary purpose of themanufacture of additional anti-aircraft guns.  As explained in paragraph 18,- this factory would be for gun machiningonly, the forging and gun mounting work being carriedout in industrial establishments.   I understand from theWar-Of f i-ce- -that- -the type- of...machine-tools.. suitable^for-anti-aircraft guns is also suitable for all types of medium-calibre guns below 6&quot;, and that the new factory,together with Nottingham, would therefore constitute an alternative source of supply to Woolwich for thesecalibres.  The cost of the new factory proposed by theWar Office for this purpose is estimated  to be in theneighbourhood of  1,200,000.29*       If it should be decided to expand the new factory near Glasgow so as to secure sufficient capacity to provide coneurr-ently field -and medium^caldbr-e^a-rtill.eryfor the second contingent of the Field Force, theestimated additional cost would be in the neighbourhood of 170,000. .I suggest that this matter should be considered in conjunction with the Secretary of State for War&apos;sproposals in his Memorandum on the State  of Preparedness ofthe Army in Relation to its Role (C.I.D. Paper No.1498-B.30.       The proposals to create additional capacity for heavy naval guns and gap. mountings turn largely on thesuggestion made at the Meeting on the .8th December,that  the Admiralty should be in  a position to lay  down

Paper No.1498-B.30e       The proposals to create additional capacity for heavy naval guns and gun mountings  turn largely on thesuggestion made  at the Meeting on the 8th December,that the Admiralty should be in a position to lay down
 he avy... ships- on the outbreak of war.    This represents a departure from previously accepted policy,  and I reco-mnend that this proposal should be the subject of further examination. 31.     If however the proposal in the preceding paragraph is accepted, it will be necessary to create additional capacity for finished gun forgingSo    Broadly speaking, the capacity of the country for gun forgings is believed to be adequate except as stated above.   Further, if it is decided to create additional capacity for heavy guns and gun mountings, on account of capital ship construction, it would also be necessary to provide corresponding additional plant for armour construction. This matter should be taken into consideration when the matter  dealt with in paragraph 30 is examinedo 32.     The War Office have emphasised that if a war should  occur within the next,  say,  two years the Field Force would be compelled to take the field with obsolete medium  artillery which would be totally outranged by modern  German artillery.    They have therefore pressed that  the previous decision to  give  absolute priori tjr to gun manufacture  for A. D. G.-B- requirements should bere-ccnsideredc-    I  invite my colleagues&apos;  attention to this  matter.   My own opinion,  however,  is that we cannot afford  to take any action to retard  the production of anti-aircraft guns  until  the sir defences of this country have  reached  a far greater  state  of readiness.
33.     I am fully aware that these proposals make no specific provision to deal with foreign orders.It is obvious, however, that our present capacity is insufficient to meet our own authorised programmes as recently enlarged, and that it will take periodsvarying from one and..a half to two years before any new capacity now laid down can be brought into.production^It must also.be remembered that our existing manufacturingresources are now working to full capacity, and that ina period approaching two years, a proportion of our resources will be released on completion of our presentprogrammes.   It follows, therefore, that capacity willbe released for foreign orders so soon, or almost assoon, as any new capacity specially created for thispurpose only, could come into production.   I, therefore,reach the conclusion that the provision of the new capacity recommended in this paper to meet our own needsis likely to prove to be the most effective means whichcan be devised for meeting f ore-ign.. orders consistently with our own requirements,.

Mefydrandum by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.    WITH reference to the 334th Meeting*pf the Committee of Imperial Defence,we have been asked by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence to review therelative strategic importance of certain countries in accordance with the following terms of reference V-        &quot; That, in view of  the difficulty of.reaching a decision on applications    from  particular countries for financial  assistance in regard to armaments,    the Chiefs of Staff should review the  relative strategic importance to us of    the following countries  :              Portugal,   Greece,  Turkey,   Egypt,  Iraq,  Belgium,   Holland,             Yugoslavia,  Roumania,  Hungary,  Bulgaria,  Saudi  Arabia and             Afghanistan.&quot;    2.  We have placed  the countries mentioned in our terms  of reference in asequence which, in  our judgment, indicates their relative strategic importanceto us, but we wish to emphasise that it is difficult to make a rigid order of prioritywhich can serve  as an absolute guide for all possible contingencies.   In thisassessment we have ignored other considerations whijch may themselves vary fromtime to time.    3.  The  strategic  importance  of the countries concerned has been assessednot only from the point of view of the value of the military facilities which a country can afford to us in war, but also in relation to the need for denying such facilities to an enemy.    4.  Although the strategic importance of a  country  is to  some  extentconditioned by its economic, financial and political strength, we have not thoughtit necessary in a paper of this scope to introduce economic or other factors.    5.  We have left out of account any consideration that Portugal, Egypt orIraq,  by virtue of their treaties of alliance with the United Kingdom, might have special claim to financial assistance or special priority  in regard to armaments.               *  C.I.D. 334th  Meeting, Minute 1, Conclusions (/) and (g).

Belgium and Holland (i).     6.  In the reviewt of Imperial Defence of 1937, it was stated :   ; 1  -         &apos;&apos; A German victory over France, or to a lesser extent the permanent     occupation of the Low Countries,  would lead to a  situation from which a     most serious threat to the United  Kingdom could develop.....&quot;     The strategic importance of Holland cannot be dissociated  from that ofthe Netherlands  East Indies, regarding  which, in a report dated July 19364it was stated :          &quot; . . . . We are of the opinion that the integrity of the Dutch  East     Indies is vital to our security in &quot;the Far East.....&quot;     These statements still hold  good and we,  therefore,  place  Belgium  and holland in the first priority of importance, to us from the strategic point of view.Egypt (ii).     7.  As  fully explained in our Mediterranean, Middle East and  North-EastAfrica Appreciation^ the security of Egypt and with it the control of the suez canal and of the communications in the  Middle East, is of very high strategic importance  to us, even  should we find ourselves at war with Germany, Italyand Japan with no British fleet in the Mediterranean.Portugal and Turkey (iii)     8.  If Gibraltar were denied to us. by hostile action from Spain, we should require to use Lisbon as a naval base;  furthermore, it is at all times important to US; that the use of Portuguese harbours and air bases  on the mainland and inthe Atlantic islands should be denied to a potential enemy.           - ,     :!-     It is, therefore, of high strategic importance to us that Portugal should bein a position to defend Lisbon from land invasion and her harbours from seaborneattack, followed by enemy occupation.     9.  Turkey controls the Dardanelles ;and  if she were our ally in, a  war with italy, she could sever  the vital Italian Black Sea trade, notably oil and wheat supplies,  and with  our assistance  could  threaten  the  Italian position, in the dodecanese.  On the other hand,  were she our enemy, not only would Italy bein a position to exercise a high degree of control of the ^aegean, but  Turkey alliedwith  Germany would reproduce  the conditions in Palestine and Iraq whichconfronted us in  the last war.     10.  For the reasons stated in paragraphs 8 and 9 above, we regard portugal and  Turkey as being of equal strategic importance to us.Iraq (iv).                                                                 ., *     11.  Iraq has a position of considerable influence in the Arab world.   It isimportant that she should be our  ally and should be strong  enough to  defendherself  and thus to give protection  to our air communications with the East,to her section of the overland route  from Basra to Egypt, and to the oil fieldsat Kirkuk.     A hostile Iraq  would not only threaten these interests, but might  causeinterruptions of our oil supplies from Iran.Greece., (v)..          ,.   ^  .     , lMM&apos;     ,       /    ,     12.  Greece could give us valuable  naval  and air facilities in a war against italy which would assist us in controlling the JEgean, in isolating the Dodecanese,and  in increasing the extent of our control of the Central Mediterranean.,     It is most important that  these facilities should not become available toGermany  and Italy and consequently  that Greece should  not  fall under theinfluence of these Powers.   - *                           f C.I.D.

Saudi Arabia (vi).    13.  In a report  dated November  1937,* it was stated          &apos;&apos; On strategical grounds the maintenance of the existing ties of friend-    ship between His Majesty&apos;s Government and King  Ibn  Saud  is of great    importance.&quot;    14.  Saudi Arabia, if unfriendly to us, would be able to foment Arab unrestthroughout  the  Middle East.   Her territory flanks our sea  communicationsthrough the Red Sea  and in the Persian Gulf  and the overland route via Iraq.By her own action she could  threaten the  overland  route, and, by  affordingfacilities to our enemies in time of war, could add to our difficulties in protectingour sea communications.Afghanistan (vii).    15.  Afghanistan is of strategic value to  us  as a buffer State between theU.S.S.R. and India.   In this connection it was stated in the review!  of ImperialDefence for 1937-    &quot;   . .  . The defence of India against Soviet  aggression remains a liability    to be taken into account on a long  view of defence policy, though it need not    be envisaged in the near future.&quot;    16.  Moreover, if Afghanistan were  hostile, we might find considerabledifficulty in withdrawing forces from India, which would be urgently required to implement our plans for reinforcing  garrisons in the Middle and Far East.Yugoslavia  (viii).    17.  Yugoslavia  has  an Adriatic seaboard containing numerous harbours and anchorages and their development and exploitation by a naval Power mightbe of considerble importance to us.   Equally,  in  some circumstances, their use by us might be advantageous as a means of attacking Italian ships and interfering.with seaborne trade in the Adriatic.    18.  The attitude of Yugoslavia in war would have repercussions on Greece,Roumania  and possibly Turkey, and  for  this reason her alliance. with us, orbenevolent  neutrality, would be to our advantage.Roumania (ix).    19.  The  strategical significance  of Roumania to  us lies  largely in herreadiness and ability  to supply or deny oil and wheat supplies  to our potentialenemies,  Germany and Italy, and  it  is therefore in  British interest that herpolicy  in the disposal of these supplies should have a bias in our favour.  Further,it is of importance that Roumania  should not pass under German  domination,since this would give  Germany access  to the East and to the  Black Sea via the danube.Bulgaria (as).    20.  Bulgaria,  like Roumania,  has a seaboard on the Black Sea, but has noequivalent river communication from the seaboard with Centra] Europe.  More-over, Bulgaria bars the route to the  Bosphorus.Hungary (xi).    21.  This country is of little or  no direct strategic concern to us.                                    (Signed)       C. L. N.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.  December 1938.SECRET.TO EE.stock AND  KEY.It is requested that special case may be taken to    ensure the  secrecy  of this document COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL&quot; DEFENCE.Copy  No.Extract from the Minutes of the 34:0th Meeting, held on December 1, 1938-        ******    (5) RELATIVE  STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE  OF COUNTRIES         REQUIRING ARMS  FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM.                         (C.I.D. Paper No. 1488-B.)    (Previous reference :  C.I.D. Minutes of the 334th Meeting, Minute 1.)    THE COMMITTEE  had under consideration a Memorandum by the Chiefsof Staff Sub-Committee on  the  Relative  Strategic  Importance of  Countriesrequiring arms from the United Kingdom (C.I.D. Paper No. 1488-B).    SIR CYRIL NEWALL, introducing the Memorandum, recalled that it hadoriginated from a discussion on the supply of arms to Portugal, and the Chiefsof Staff had been asked  to review the relative strategic  importance of  othercountries, in addition  to Portugal, requiring arms from the United  Kingdom.The task was not an easy one, and, as explained in paragraphs 2-5, the assessmenthad been drawn up purely from the strategic point of view, and had not  takeninto account other contributory factors, such as economic, financial and political considerations.    LORD ZETLAND enquired whether China had been intentionally omitted from the list of countries to be considered.    SIR LANCELOT OLIPHANT said that as the Chiefs  of Staff list wascompiled in accordance with their terms of reference to regard  the question of priority only from the strategic point of view, the Foreign Office  did not wishto offer any criticism.  But the Foreign Office, in making their previous list, hadbeen guided by financial, political and economic considerations as well thus some countries, e.g., China, just mentioned by the Secretary of State for India, hadfigured in it.  Any eventual and final list would need possibly these to be dove-tailed in.    SIR CYRIL NEWALL pointed out that the Chiefs of Staff had  dealt only with those countries which had been set out in the terms of reference remitted to them.   &apos; LORD STANHOPE  remarked that  King Carol, during his recent visit tothis country, had talked about the construction of a naval base in Roumania.King  Carol had asked for commercial credits, and had hinted that if he  couldnot obtain them  from us, he would get them from elsewhere, most probably fromGermany.  It would be deplorable if, having sunk a large sum  of money in thebuilding of the base, we then had to see it destroyed to prevent it falling into germany&apos;s hands.  If any money was available,  he would prefer to see it  spent.in other directions.    SIR SAMUEL  HOARE enquired as  to the next step with regard to thequestion of supplies  of arms to foreign countries.  The Committee were now inpossession of the views of the Chiefs of Staff on the relative  strategic importance       [18294-4
of countries chiefly concerned, and the question arose as to whether we shouldtake some steps to increase our manufacturing capacity in order to help them.He would like to see something done in this direction.     SIR KINGSLEY WOOD said that our existing potential was insufficient to meet the demands of foreign countries.  As  far as the  Air  Forces  were concerned, it had been the practice to dole out small contributions of aircraft, &amp;c,to countries whom we particularly wished to keep within  our  orbit.  This,however, did not strike at the root of the matter.     MR. HORE-BELISHA agreed. He suggested that  our potential should beincreased so as to provide  a pool  from which foreign armament orders couldbe met.     SIR SAMUEL HOARE suggested that we were in danger of losing  armsorders from one country after another.  After our own re-armament programme had been completed, it would be most important that we should receive orders from foreign countries.     SIR KINGSLEY WOOD agreed.  In his opinion we were not  taking a sufficiently long view of the  need  for exploiting  our productive and financialcapacity.    SIR WARREN  FISHER said that the Treasury view was that we should concentrate primarily on  our own  programme  as regards  the employment bothof our material and of our financial resources.  The Treasury were opposed to apolicy  of dissipating  our strength which would result from an attempt to cater for the full requirements of foreign countries.    SIR SAMUEL HOARE  suggested that this was too rigid a policy. could we not do something  to meet the requirements of foreign countries  with regardto naval forces ?    SIR ROGER  BACKHOUSE explained that without disturbing our existingnaval building programme we could allot new  construction potential for about four or five submarines, eight destroyers and two cruisers a year to foreign orders.Whilst there was  no  difficulty in regard to the hulls and machinery the greatdifficulty  at the present  time was the provision of gun mountings, e.g., SouthAfrica were anxious  to obtain 15-inch  guns for the  protection of  Cape Town,and it would take  four years to construct the mountings for these guns.  It was unfortunate that only one firm, Messrs. Vickers Limited,  were able to do this type of work, and  unless we could create a new potential, it would be impossibleto accelerate the programme both for our own country in time of war, and to meetthe requirements of foreigners.   The fact to be faced was that our productivecapacity for armaments as a  whole was too low, and we should not be able tomeet war expansion even for our  own needs.  As far as the Navy was concernedwe had been better off in this respect in 1914 than we were at present.    LORD STANHOPE said that he was anxious  about the position of ourgun  and gun-mounting potential.  In  his  view, additional capacity  ought tobe built up outside Messrs. Vickers.  If Germany were to break the Anglo-german naval  Treaty, we  should start a year behind in any  subsequent naval buildingrace.    SIR ROGER BACKHOUSE added that a considerable number of the 15-inch guns mounted in our battle fleet needed re-lining, but it was  quite out of thequestion for more of this work to be taken in hand at the present time as the wholeof the  available capacity for guns of these large calibres was.fully occupied.    MR. BRIDGES agreed that additional productive capacity was desirable.It might, however, take from eighteen months to two years before  any newsource  of supply came into production; moreover, the  additional labour requiredfor  this purpose would probably  be found  to comprise the types of labour forwhich  a  shortage already existed to meet our existing programmes.   It wouldbe unsound to concentrate on  building up new  armament potential  if,  by doing so, we threw out of gear our existing re-armament programme.   The two factors,namely, the desirability of increased sources of production and the importance of doing nothing to dislocate our present programme, would have to  be  balancedone against the other.
     SIR KINGSLEY WOOD said that the observations by the Secretary to theCabinet were not entirely applicable to the air programme.  It had seemed wellworth while, for example, to give a few aircraft to Turkey.  Moreover, the AirMinistry could probably increase the number of firms devoted to aircraft manufac-ture provided the necessary money could be made available.  He agreed with theHome Secretary that too rigid or too narrow a view should not be taken of this-question.     LORD ZETLAND suggested that  the  problem  of  increased  armamentpotential, with a view to meeting the demands of foreign countries for arms, wasa matter for Cabinet decision.  It was not clear to him why other countries suchas China and Siam, should not be included in any such investigation.     SIR WARREN FISHER said that  the present Cabinet decision was thatwe should not supply arms to China, but it was understood that this question was likely to be raised again in the near future by the  Foreign Office.  He was inagreement with the policy of doling out armaments to foreign countries in smallpackets, in order to keep them sweet.     SIR SAMUEL HOARE remarked that he had been impressed  by the state-ment made by the Chief of  Naval Staff.   It was not only  for foreign countries that increased capacity was required,  but also on our own behalf.     MR. HORE-BELISHA observed that the War Office had  received urgentrequests from the Dominions for guns.  The latest example was during  the visit of Mr. Pirow to this country, the result of which had been  that in order to meet mr.  Pirow&apos;s demands, Bren guns,  sufficient for  fourteen British battalions, hadbeen promised to South Africa.     SIR THOMAS INSKIP said that the question of  providing new  capacitywas  a matter which would  call for careful examination in all  its aspects.   if additional potential  could be made available, even within the next two  years, itmight be of considerable value in accelerating  and augmenting our own re-arma-ment requirements.   He undertook to initiate the necessary enquiry  which wouldbe without prejudice to the policy involved.  The question could then be referredto the Cabinet.                               CONCLUSIONS.     THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL  DEFENCE agreed      (a)  To approve  the Memorandum by  the  Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on           the relative strategic importance of countries requiring arms from the           United Kingdom (C.I.D. Paper No. 1488-B).     (6)  To invite the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, in consultation with           the  three Service Ministers and their Advisers, to prepare  a Paper           for  submission  to the  Cabinet,  dealing  with the practicability of           increasing our manufacturing capacity for certain armaments,  with           a view not only to building up a greater  war potential for ourselves,           but also to  placing us in a position to supply foreign countries.     (c)  That the Paper referred to in Conclusion (5) above,  together with the           Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff (C.I.D. Paper No. 1488-B) and the           Minutes of the discussion  thereon,  should be referred to the Cabinet           by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,    December 1, 1938.
