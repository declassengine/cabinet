THIS DOCUMENT . IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.                                                          &apos;   COPY NO.  5Tfi                               CABINET. &apos;                      INTERNATIONAL  LABOUR  CONVENTIONS                              AND  &quot;RECJOi-aivtENDATIONS.                    Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.1.   The International Labour Conference at its 23rd Session in June,  1937,adopted four draft Conventions and seven Reccsnmendations, the French and english texts of which were published in Cmd. 5584.   It is now desirable,in accordance with the ordinary practice, to issue a White Paper indicating the Government&apos;s proposals in regard to these Conventions and Recommendations.My Department has accordingly been in consultation with the other Departmentsconcerned and I attach a draft White Paper which represents the result ofthese consultations.2.   The Conventions and Recommendations in question can be divided into fourcategories according to the subjects dealt with, as follows:     (a) Two Recommendations dealing with Public Works;     (b) Two Conventions and a Recommendation dealing with the Minimum Age         for Admission to Employment.     (c) A Convention dealing with the Reduction of Hours of Work in the         Textile Industry.     (d) One Convention and four Recommendations dealing with Safety in         Building.3.   The suggestion made in regard to the two Recommendations on Public works is that the White Paper should say that the Government reserves its decision.Acceptance of the first Recommendation would involve an undertaking to submit to the International Labour Office information regarding pur public works inaccordance with a Uniform Plan and also to co-operate in the work of theInternational Public Works Committee which has recently been set up. : It isnot thought desirable at this stage to commit the Government definitely to aceptance of membership of the Committee or to the obligation to submitinformation, although the draft White Paper indicates that the government propose at present to submit information as far as possible in accordancewith the Uniform Plan and to send a representative to assist at the meetingsof the Committee.   The adoption of this policy will enable, the Government towithdraw at any time from participation in the work of the Committee if itsSECRET.CP. 282 (38).
 activities  take  a course which makes  this  desirable.    The  second Reccmmenda- tion contains  various  suggestions  regarding  the national planning of public works which are  in the main  clearly unacceptable.  It is thought, however, that it  is  preferable  at this  stage,  pending knowledge  of the results of our partial  co-operation in  the  work of the International Public Works Committee, to  say regarding this  Recommendation  likewise that the  Government&apos;s decision is  reserved. 4.    As  regards  the two  Conventions regarding the Minimum Age of Entry into Employment,  neither can be ratified as they  lay down a  minimum age of 15 and do  not allow of  exceptions in  the  case of beneficial employment.   The acceptance  of  the  Recommendation without ratification of the two Conventions would be meaningless and is  not proposed.  Both the Conventions represent revisions of earlier Conventions fixing the minimum age at  14 years, one of which we had ratified, that  relating  to the Minimum Age for Admission of Children to Industrial Employment.  The Government did  not  ratify the other Convention  concerning  the age &quot;for  admission  of children to  non-industrial employment because, although the age  limit fixed was 14 years, the Convention in  certain material points went beyond the lav/ in this  country relating to the employment of  school children. 5.   The Convention concerning  the Reduction of Hours of Work in the Textile Industry is  unacceptable for reasons with which my colleagues are familiar. It  is unnecessary  to reiterate  the arguments which have throughout been used to oppose our ratification of the  various Conventions which have been adopted for the reduction  of hours of work to forty  a week.6.    The question  of ratification  of the Convention concerning safety provisions in  the building  industry cannot be finally considered until certain Regulations on  the subject have been made under the Factories Act,  1937.  Whether these regulations  will be in a form which will enable the Convention to be ratified cannot at present be known as it is necessary to consult the appropriate representative organisations of employers and workers who have certain legal rights of objection before the  Regulations. can be finally made.  In these circumstances a  statement on the lines in the draft White Paper is all that canbe said for  the  moment regarding the Convention and it  seems desirable to announce that  the  Government1s  decision on the four Recommendations is likewise reserved.7.    I accordingly ask for authority  to issue a Y/hite Paper as in the attached draft. r.j.1  T-S   -i                                          (intd.)

                   INTERNATIONAL  LABOUR  COMMENCE.     There are set out below the decisions of His Majesty&apos;s Government on certain Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the International LabourConference which it is proposed to communicate to the Secretary-General ofthe League of Nations and also the present position in respect of certain other Conventions and Recommendations regarding which a final decisioncannot yet be reached.  These Conventions and Recommendations were adoptedby the International Labour Conference at its Twenty-third Session in 1937&quot;and the French and English texts were presented to Parliament in Cmd. 5584.Recommendation (No.50) concerning international co-operation in respect of    public works.Recommendation (No. 51) concerning the national planning of public works.     Recommendation No. 50 provides for the annual communication to theInternational Labour Office of statistical and other information concerningpublic works undertaken or planned by Members of the Organisation, such information to be set out as far as possible in accordance with a uniformplan.   The Recommendation also provides for the co-operation of Members inthe work of the International Public Works Committee which has recently been set up with the primary object of studying the information received.     A draft of the Uniform Plan referred to above, which was prepared at apreparatory first meeting of the International Public Y/orks Committee, was recently approved by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office andis set out in the Annex.     His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to submit information to the InternationalLabour Office as far as possible in accordance with this Plan and to send arepresentative to attend the meetings of the Committee.   Meanwhile thequestion of acceptance of both Recommendation No. 50 and Recommendation No. 51will be kept under consideration.

His Majesty&apos;s  Government do not propose  to ratify these Conventions nor consequently to accept  the Recommendation, because they do not provide for the issue of Certificates permitting the admission of children of not less than 14 years of age to  beneficial employment and are therefore not in agreement with  the educational policy  of  His Majesty&apos;s  Government as embodied in the Education Acts, 1936. Convention  (No.61)  concerning the  Reduction  of Hours of Work in the      Textile Industry.                                                      - -      This Convention was adopted in confirmation of the principle laid down in the Convention (No.47) concerning the Reduction of Hours of &quot;Work to Forty a Wreek and for the reasons given in  Cmd. 5745 in regard to that Convention His Majesty&apos; s Government do not propose to ratify this Convention. Convention (No.62)  concerning safety provisions in the building industry.Recommendation (No.  55)  concerning  safety provisions in the building industry.

Recommendation (No.  55)  concerning  co-operation in accident prevention in the     building industry.Recommendation (No.  56)  concerning  vocational  education for the building      industry.     Pending the making of Regulations under  the Factories Act, 1937, regarding safety provisions in the building  industry, His Majesty&apos;s Government reserves its decision as to  ratification of this Convention and acceptance of these recommendations.
