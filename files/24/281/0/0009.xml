Copy Fq,____ C^f_________                           C A B ,1   E T.                       National Fitness^G-rants,         Memorandum by the President of the Board of Educatlon,              1.    My colleagues will remember that when the  details of         the government s scheme for promoting national fitness were         published in January., 1957, an estimate of  2,000,000 spread         over a period of about 3 years was given (Command No.5364) in         respect of the necessary capital grants.   That this estimate         was purely conjectural is made clear by the following quotation         from the White Paper:-  &quot;Any reliable forecast of the expenditure         involved in the  proposals outlined above is impossible, if only         because the scope of the problem cannot be accurately determined         until the National Advisory Councils have surveyed the field and         advised as to the best methods for meeting the needs of         development.   Any estimate must  therefore be provisional and         subject to correction in the light of experience.&quot;              2.    This provisional estimate was eventually increased to         the sum of approximately  2,400,000 (to include the  provision of         a National College of Physical Training) up to the end of 1940,         of which  2,150,000 would be for  capital grants:,  1,890,000  for         England  and Wales and  260,000 for Scotland.    After allocating         a block  sum of  200,000 to the University Grants Committee for         Physical Training in the Universities,  the Board of  Education         were  left with a net total sura of  1,690,000  to be expended in         capital  grants in England and Wales by  March  31st, 1940.              3.    At  first the demand for grants was  slow, as it  took         nearly a year after the passage of the  Act in July 1937 for the                                   1.
movement  to become fully known  end. appreciated, and for theArea Committees  to stimulate  interest in their localities.But now the survey which the  area Committees are making hasprogressed sufficiently far to  show that the need for providing the facilities for physical training contemplated in the Act isvery greet indeed, and the demands for grants are reaching theArea Committees  in an ever increasing stream.     4,   The present position, as reported by the. GrantsCommittee, is as follows:--                              Grants provisionally offered  . .  . .  .. 1,050,000     Grants on other cases in Grants      Committee  Office (Estimated) . .  . .  . .   750,000     Grants on cases in Area  Committee      Offices (Estimated)          O0      .. 1,000,000                                              2,800,000.          To meet these commitments actual and probable allthat I,, have available is the   1,690,000 mentioned in thesecond paragraph^of this memorandum, together with a further sum/of  45,000/which I understand may possibly not be needed for the Universities, making  a  total of  1,735,000.     5.   I accordingly found it necessary to ask the Chancellor/                                                    .Of the Exchequer for a further  gross sum of  3,000,000, as itwas obvious that in the absence of such further resources theMovement  would have to come to.an abrupt end.   The chancellor has suggested to me that the  situation might be met by afurther allocation of  1,200,000, to include any additional  - cost that might be required  for the National College and alsothe normal proportion for Scotland.   The cost of the NationalCollege has undoubtedly been  under-estimated and a further sum of the order of  200,000  will need to be allocated to it,leaving the Chancellor&apos;s net  offer at  1,000,000.   Afterthe Scottish portion is taken off I shall be left with anet figure of  880,000 for England and Wales,
                                                    I. u aan addition which still leaves me  short  of my  foreseeablecommitments.     6.   Unless, therefore,  some  further additional capital sum.is made available it will be necessary to issue an immediate announcement that no further applications canbe entertained.   I have no hesitation in saying that thiswould be nothing short of a disaster, both to the physicalwell being of the country and to the prestige of theGovernment.   The movement was launched by the Prime Ministerpersonally in October, 1936,  in a way which marked it out as one of the major contributions by the Government towardsthe national well being.   It has been In the forefront ofGovernment pxxblicity,  and to close it down just at . the timewhen we ought to be in a position to give full effect to itwould  discourage all the hopes which have been raised.  Wewould, moreover, be rendering nugatory the call for supportof the National  Fitness Movement  contained in the NationalService Handbook, and  it would, of course, be necessary to omit this  reference from the handbook.    Public opinion onthe matter  is well reflected  in the recent leading article  in&quot;The Times&quot; which stated that  whilst there was no  call atpresent ftr new  educational legislation,  there was  &quot;ampleroom for the  energetic development of the National FitnessMovement as an  important factor  in preparedness,  -whether  for peace  or for  war&quot;.     7.    If  the movement  is  to be  continued, and continuedeffectively,  it  needs  a further sum  of   3,000,000 to  be madeavailable  over a further  three years.ending  at March,  1943,for  capital grants  for physical  training and  recreation  andfor  the  extra cost  of the  National  College.   Deducting 200,000  for  this  last item  we are  left with   2,800,000  for
capital grants,  of which the Scottish share  is   340,000.The net sura therefore left for capital grants for England andWales is  2,460,000, of which over  1,000,000 is required tomeet the commitments indicated in paragraph 4.    This  means that rather less than  1,500,000 will he available for new schemes maturing for grant by 1943.     8.   The need for securing that this sum is spent tothe best advantage and economically administered is  a  matter to which I am very much alive, and I propose to reiterate tothe Grants Committee the importance of securing the fullest use of existing facilities before assisting the promotion ofnew ones, and of directing their attention to the possibilityof using alternative building methods, making for lighter andcheaper construction, where new buildings for any purposesconnected with physical fitness are concerned.  On theadministrative side I am examining the question of reducingthe cost of the staff of the Grants Committee and theexpenditure on publicity.   The possibility of similarsavings in local administration will not be lost sight of.But such administrative savings will not, of course, affectthe capital sum for which I am asking.     9.   The precise basis of allocation as between Englandand Wales and Scotland  in regard both to the sum at present available and any further sum that may become available  is thesubject of discussion between the  Secretary of State forScotland and myself.    The figures quoted in this memorandum are on the basis proposed by the Board  of Education;   theSecretary of State  for  Scotland suggests a slightly different basis which would have  the effect  of reducing the sumavailable for England and Wales.9th December, 1938.
