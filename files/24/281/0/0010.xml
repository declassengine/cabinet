Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.     FOR some time past  the  Foreign Office have been giving close attention to the problem of getting the  British point of view known to the German public, and I am now in a position to  bring before the Cabinet a number of proposals which appear to me not only legitimate in peace-time, but also likely to produce results. For  the sake of clearness  I am dividing this paper under three heads:  (1) The Nature of the Problem,  (2) A Short-term Policy, (3) A Long-term Policy.                         (1)  Nature of the Problem.     It  was  recognised by  the  Germans at the end of the last war that British propaganda had played a large part in breaking down German resistance.  Hence the enormous importance  attached by the present German Government to their own propaganda.  It would probably be no exaggeration to say that Germany spends  5 million a year on propaganda and that a large part of this propaganda is very skilfully done.     That is one side of the picture. The other side is the German fear of counter- propaganda.  That  means  that  any propaganda  done  from here  should be unobtrusive and unprovocative, as the German  Government will  do their best to counteract it or even to stop it, but it also means that our propaganda, if wisely done, may produce a big  effect.  Our propaganda therefore should base  itself on letting the German public  know about our own affairs and our own outlook and  should  refrain. from  criticism of German  affairs.  A totalitarian  system, imposed and maintained by force, has its weakness as well as its strength, however much its weakness be concealed, whereas a democracy  such  as our own has its strength as well as its weakness, however much its weakness be exposed.  In spiteof all the efforts of totalitarian propaganda, British prestige still stands high in the world.  The only point of view that  can be put against the  German in the world with  any chance of success is the British, and I am inclined  to thinkthat the only point of view  that can be put against the Nazi in Germany is equallythe British.  If Europe may  have to  choose between  a  Pax  Germanica or aPax  Britannica, the  issue may to some extent and perhaps to a considerable extent be determined  by  the  success of British propaganda  not only in thecountries surrounding Germany, but in Germany itself. If, therefore, we are to tackle the problem at all we must do so in no niggardly fashion, but on ah adequate scale.  My present proposals assume that the funds required&quot; to give  them effect could be made available.      10160  [18325]
                            (2) Short-term Policy.     With events moving so rapidly in Germany and elsewhere we should  give our first  attention  to those measures likely to produce quick results.   I divide these measures under four heads :           (a)  Broadcasting.         (b)  Personal Contacts.         (c) A British Organisation in Germany.         id)  Literature. (a) Broadcasting.     (i) The  B.B.C. news bulletins  in German now given out on the short and medium waves are being widely listened to in Germany.   They are carefully prepared by the B.B.C. in daily consultation with the Foreign Office and are not being jammed.  They may shortly be increased from 10 to 15 minutes.     (ii) Mr.  Ogilvie, the Director-General of the B.B.C., has recently put to me a proposal for reciprocal  talks with  France and Germany and perhaps with other countries  too.  Briefly stated the proposal is that the B.B.C.  should arrange for  talks  on  their programme, perhaps once a week  for  a  quarter  of an hour, from France and Germany in English  and to France and  Germany in French and German respectively on the French and German programmes.   These talks would be an extension of the reciprocal talks with America which have been conducted by the B.B.C. for some  time past.  The proposal is that the series should be experimental and  for a limited period in the first instance.     I  can see great advantage and no objection to  having reciprocal talks with countries such as France, Portugal,  Scandinavia, Roumania, &amp;c, but in the case of  Germany  and Italy  I feel that I should  call the  attention of the Cabinet to objections which may  be raised and which will require careful consideration. A  section of the  public may well object  to a German,  chosen  carefully by Dr.  Goebbels, being allowed  to present the German  case  to British listeners. There  might be questions in Parliament and an  outcry  in part  of the press. The B.B.C. might  require  the  support of the Government in Parliament in meeting these criticisms.     It  is clear  to  me that  such objections would have  some validity if, for example, Dr. Goebbels were free to  launch his anti-Jewish propaganda on to the B.B.C. or if he were free  to exploit this occasion for  provocative remarks in other directions. Obviously, there would  have to be a preliminary agreement to meet this point. It should be  clearly understood by both  parties that the talks shouldbe something in the nature of  a  running  commentary on  matters which  hadinterested the public  in  either country and should omit  comments on foreignaffairs.  There is quite enough to say about the life  and activities of the british public  which would interest  foreign listeners without embarking on the stormysea of international controversy, and the same thing is true of Germany.   If theGerman Government see any advantage to themselves in having these talks, theywill accept such conditions as will make it possible to conduct them.  If they donot, the proposal falls to the ground. If, on the other hand,  an agreement can besecured, I believe we shall have found the most direct method of reaching the widest possible German public.  Should Germany refuse,  I see no  harm  in thegesture having been made, and I see no reason why the proposal should not bemade to other countries which might be only too glad to accept it.     (iii) It is  also possible to  reach the  German  public by buying  time for english  programmes in  German  issued  from  the  stations  at  Luxemburg,Strasbourg and Liechtenstein.   The possibilities have been carefully examined by the Foreign Office, and I am assured that  it can be done.  The  programmes would  be  sponsored in the normal  way by  a  commercial  firm such  as a  travelagency and would contain a general news review amongst other items.  A specimencopy of such a review has been prepared., The cost of six programmes a week forthree months put out by one or other/of  these three stations which  normally.broadcast in German is estimated at   6,000.   The programmes would be submittedto the Foreign Office in advance and  careful watch would be kept over them.  Anyparticipation by the British Government in  these programmes could be effectivelyconcealed.
 (b) Personal Contacts.     Personal contacts between  British and Germans  are  continuous, especially between business men.  I suggest that we should make them  as fruitful as possible. The Foreign Office, after reviewing the possibilities,  attach special importance to business contacts, and I suggest, therefore, for the consideration of the Cabinet that an effort should be made through the Associated Chambers of Commerce and the Federation of British Industries to impress on firms dealing with Germany the national importance for their representatives, when travelling  in Germany, to speak  on the right lines, and perhaps also  to  be furnished with suitable literature about this country (I refer to this point later in this paper).  I suggest that  the  Prime Minister or  I myself should,  in the first  instance, consult Sir Charles  Granville Gibson,  of the Associated Chambers of  Commerce,  and Mr.  Peter Bennett, of the Federation of British  Industries.  I do not wish to burden this paper with too many details, but I may say that this  matter has been gone into with some care by my department, and I should  be glad to know whether the suggestion is approved in principle.     Other forms of personal contacts, such as exchange visits of students, school- children, professional  men,  &amp;c, might well be pursued  by the British Council, but in  my opinion the most useful  contacts are those which  already exist for normal commercial purposes between business men in  the  two  countries. (c) A British Organisation  in Germany.     His Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Berlin  have urged the establishment in Berlin of something like the British Library of Information in New  York,  which would be an official body under the aegis of the Embassy.  A British Library of Information in Berlin would be mainly a reference library supplied with official publications and   under  a  manager able  to  answer  enquiries  either   verbally  or  by correspondence.     The idea is attractive,  but  I believe that equally  satisfactory results  might be obtained  in  a  less sensational way by establishing  an office of the  Travel Association first in Berlin,  and later at other provincial centres on the lines of the Paris office.  This office would naturally be supplied with tourist literature and  with general information  about this  country useful  to tourists.  It could easily be made  into a centre of information about  this country.  The German Government have  a similar office in London.  An extra  grant  would have to be made to the Travel  Association to enable them to extend their  activities to Germany in this way.  I trust that this suggestion will  meet with  the approval of the Cabinet. (d)  Literature.     The British Council are already preparing a series  of pamphlets on British activities in different spheres.   These pamphlets are to be  issued separately  and in book form as so many chapters of a book.  They will be translated as necessary into  foreign languages.  But I suggest that in addition  to this work the British Council should be asked  to produce a monthly publication  under some such title as a &quot; Digest of British Achievement &quot; of pocket size to contain suitable extracts from any publications with photographs and with short articles.  Such a publica- tion, which would be issued here in the normal way, might be taken by commercial representatives to Germany (and indeed to other countries)  and  shown to businessmen  in  Germany with whom they had contacts.                            (3) Long-term Policy.    The British Council should be asked  to pursue actively in Germany their normal  work of cultural and educational propaganda.  This  could be done byexchange visits on  a small scale, by giving scholarships to German students inBritish Universities, by sending lecturers, especially  scientists,  to Germany, both to the  Deutsch-Englische  Gesellschaft and to German  Universities,  and  bysupporting the existing British theatre in Berlin.  There  are many other culturalactivities which need not be mentioned here.    I have  put  these activities  last  on this list,  as  it would take some time torealise any striking results.
                              (4)  Conclusion.                              ,    I submit these proposals for urgent consideration by  the  Cabinet, and in doing so I wish to emphasise the importance which I attach to them and my hopethat funds will in each case be made available for their execution.  I am satisfiedthat money so spent may rightly be regarded as an important item in our generaldefence programme.  If the Cabinet approve I shall instruct my department towork  out the details under each head, and to submit in due course an estimateof the expense involved.   I hope my  colleagues will be disposed to agree with my view as to both the importance and  the urgency of the matters  I have raised.   . Foreign Office, December 8, 1938.
