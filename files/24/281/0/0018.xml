IS DOCUMENT, IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.jRETo                                                   COPY NO._44_p. 292(38)                                  C A B. I N E T.                               Cotton Industry Bill.                Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.               In May last I was authorised (Cabinet 26/38 Conclusion 7)          to  inform the Joint Committee of Cotton Trade Organisations that          the Government had decided to proceed to the drafting of a Bill          on  the general lines of the Committee&apos;s proposals, modified          wherever necessary in order to get the maximum of agreements  At          the same time I made a further appeal to the different sections          in Lancashire as well as the ether industries concerned to sit          down  together and try to reach some greater measure  of agreement.               During the intervening months both these operations have          proceeded concurrently.   The Joint Committee have been in          negotiation both with the Lancashire opposition and  with the          other textile interests and progress has been made in drafting.               The negotiations have led to the introduction of a number          of  substantial modifications into the scheme.   The  effect of          these has been first to simplify the proposals, which now          contemplate only two kinds of sectional schemes dealing          respectively with redundancy and minimum prices,  secondly to          introduce certain safeguards of which the most important is  the          addition of an independent element to the Cotton  Industry Board          and thirdly to eliminate two of the most controversial features,         .namely &apos;pool and quota&apos; schemes and legalisation  of  wage          agreements.               It is difficult to estimate with any certainty  the          attitude of the various interests that have voiced their          opposition to the proposals but I should judge that  it  is more          or  less as follows:-               (l) Opposition within the industry.   So far as this                    was directed to particular aspects of  the proposals                    it has probably been to a large extent conciliated
        by  the modifications that have &quot;been introduced,        I am  given  to understand that the apprehensions        of  the merchants, in so far as various chambers        of  commerce are  able to speak for them, have        also  &quot;been,-  to a  substantial extent, allayed.              There  will  inevitably remain a residue of        those who will remain  strongly opposed to any form        of  statutory control. (ii)  Wool-  and Rayon.    Discussions between these industries        and the  cotton industry have been conducted under        the independent  Chairmanship of Mr. Peter Bennett,        President of the Federation of British Industries.        The opposition^of &quot;both industries has &quot;been        considerably abated by the disappearance of the        provision for  the legalisation of wage agreements        and for  &quot;pool and quota11  schemes and  in both        cases the issues dividing the parties have been        brought  within fairly  narrow limits.  Mr. Bennett&apos;s        report has  not yet  reached me but I am hopeful        that with its help  I shall be able  to find        solutions of the outstanding difficulties that will        not arouse  too much opposition in any of the three        industries.(iii)   Other textile interests.   These consist mainly of        those who use  some  proportion of cotton  in  their        own industry or  who consume products  of  the        Lancashire  industry in the manufacture of goods        outside  the scope of the  present proposals, such        as  hosiery, sewing  cotton, motor tyres,  etc.  Their        objections  are largely met by the present        proposals and  it does  not seem likely  that  serious        opposition  will  be  forthcoming from those quarters.
     In order that my colleagues may have an idea ofthe scope of the Bill,  I attach a copy of the latestdraft.  This will require considerable amendment in detail,not only to bring it more closely into line with the latest.proposals of. the industry, but also to take account of any decision reached on Mr. Bennett&apos;s report of the discussions with the wool and rayon interests.  In addition, I am advised that the financial clauses will require amendment, but theChancellor of the Exchequer has agreed in principle to ameasure of assistance towards market research and publicity,and to some guarantee of loans &quot;raised to finance redundancyschemes,  I do not, of course, ask for any approval of theterms of this draft,     My colleagues will be aware, however, that there is a growing feeling of dissatisfaction in Lancashire at the lengthof time that has elapsed without tangible result since theproposals.for.an Enabling. Bill were first put forward.Criticism on this score has naturally been directed in parttowards the Government although  it is, I think, clear fromthe preceding paragraphs that we could not have done moreuntil the Joint Committee had finished their negotiations.The final form of the proposals will probably be approved bythe Joint Committee today.  I think it is important from  every point of view that we should produce  our own proposals as soon as possible in order that we may be able to judge how far they command  the  support of those  affected bythem.   If the Bill is  to be passed during this  Session - andthere will be a great  outcry  in Lancashire  if  it  is not - it-must  be introduced as  soon  as possible after Parliament reassembles in February.   It has always been the  declaredintention of the Government to  give  the  interests  affected
by the scheme an opportunity of expressing their views inregard, to it before a Bill to give effect to it is introduced.in Parliament.  This makes it imperative that the substance of the Bill should be published as early as possible inJanuary, subject to any alterations on the lines indicated above 0     I therefore ask for authority to publish a White paper containing a memorandum&apos;explaining briefly what the proposals are and the clauses of a draft Bill, which will in effectbe a translation of the Joint Committee&apos;s proposals intolegal form, subject to the amendments indicated above.    If evidence is obtained of a sufficient measure of support for the proposals, the Bill would, I hope, be ready for introduction in February.  It would, of course, then besubmitted in final form to the Home Affairs Committee.                                    OoPoGc 8.Board of Trade,  16th December, 1958.
