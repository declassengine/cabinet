THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT^ 0 ,p-:---1--&apos;-:  &quot;            fo,ol                  Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1938.SECRET.CP. 294 (38).CABINET.MANUFACTURE  OF  AIRCRAFT  IN  AUSTRALIA.               Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.    ARISING out of the proposal made in CP. 224  (38) and approved by theCabinet for the creation of a war potential for the production of aircraft inCanada, the possibility has been considered, on the initiative  of the AustralianHigh Commissioner in London, of setting  up  a  scheme on similar  lines inAustralia.  At Mr. Bruce&apos;s request the Air Ministry has drafted, without commit-ment and on a purely informal  basis,  general proposals from which a detailed scheme could be worked out later,  and these have been discussed with the  HighCommissioner&apos;s Office. The High  Commissioner has been in consultation in thismatter with the Australian Prime  Minister, whose attitude will be seen from the telegram attached as  an appendix to this memorandum.     The line of approach to the  problem differs from that adopted in the case ofCanada in that  the suggested scheme  contemplates the co-operation of the twoGovernments in the creation of aircraft capacity  for the joint use  of the UnitedKingdom and Australian air forces. It  derives its motive from the desirability,on the one  hand,  of creating further potential for the  supply  of aircraft in war from a source remote  from the  scene of a European conflict, and on the  other of strengthening  the defence position of Australia and the Far East.  Its aim isthe production of aircraft capable of meeting the needs of the Commonwealth,and  of reinforcing Royal Air Force commands overseas,  and where necessary of delivery by air to this country.     The consideration so far given, from the standpoint of practicability in theimmediate  future, leads to the conclusion that an existing type of aircraft, theBeaufort, now coming into production by the Bristol Aeroplane Company, wouldbe well suited to  satisfy the needs  both of Australia and the Home Government.This type will before long come into use by the R.A.F. at Singapore as a general reconnaissance aircraft and the Commonwealth Government have placed ordersfor its manufacture in this country.  It is  also regarded as a reserve  type of medium bomber for emergency purposes and is further in process of being  fitted with guns in order to undertake the role of fighter.  It is clear,  therefore, that any possible output of this type that  Australia could give during an emergency wouldbe valuable, while its availability would relieve to  some  extent the present anxietyof supplying in war the R.A.F. stations in the Far and Middle East.     The manufacture of aircraft  in Australia is yet in  its infancy, there  being at the moment one factory only  in the Commonwealth, which is engaged on theproduction of training aircraft under licence from the United  States of America.The existence of this aircraft factory in Melbourne suggests that a scheme mightbe built up  round that organisation, although, owing to the  great distancesbetween the principal cities and the distribution  of the main industrial areas, itis probable that  the  solution  of the problem would involve duplication of theMelbourne factory at Sydney, thus providing two central establishments.   Fromthese two central organisations  it  would, it is thought, be necessary to spread  asystem of sub-contracting over groups of general  engineering  firms in the neigh-bourhoods  of the two cities on  the lines now being adopted  in England.   The       [18367]Copy No.  44
existing aircraft  company, expanded so as to provide  this second factory atSydney,  could  then act  as  the  contracting authority with  the Australian  and united Kingdom Governments and a proportion of the aeroplanes could be madeby the Melbourne Group, the remainder being constructed by the Sydney Group.     It  will  be appreciated that,  pending  examination  in the  light  of  localconditions, any plans must be tentative.  The ultimate  intention contemplated would, however, be to develop, over a period of years, a potential which might reach a total of perhaps 1,000 aircraft, on three  shifts,  of  the Beaufort type ayear, and to this end it would be necessary to plan from the outset on the basis ofan order for 450 aircraft and to jig and tool accordingly, though it is not contem-plated that the initial order would need to exceed a figm-e  of between 100 and150  machines.   It could be expected that delivery of aircraft would commencea little over a year after the signature of the contract.     On the financial  side,  it is not possible at this  stage  to do more than toindicate the  lines on which the problem would be approached.  It is  reasonable to anticipate that, given a satisfactory order, the existing  Australian aircraftcompany could be induced to finance any extensions necessary to their plant atMelbourne, and also the erection of the second plant at  Sydney, subject only tosome form of compensation  if the full orders contemplated should not ultimately be given.  The sub-contractors should be prepared  to finance their own under-takings, though it might be necessary to  agree to  some measure of compensation in the absence of orders,  in so far as additional capital expenditure on their parthad  been necessitated by  the scheme.     Pending full investigation on the spot, it would be still more difficult to give any  reliable  idea of  the total cost  involved, but it  is thought  that, excludingengines and equipment,  the expenditure on the production of 100 Beaufort air-frames  would be of the  order  of  2,500,000, rising to  3,500,000 for 150.  Inaddition, there would be the costs of spare parts and of such royalty payments as were involved.  The whole of such cost would not, of course, fall on the ImperialGovernment,  and  it is proposed to  approach the question  of the division of cost  on the line that the Commonwealth Government should be prepared to accept and  pay for at least half of the initial order of 100 to 150 aircraft.     In  regard  to engine manufacture, it would  be  impracticable to formulateeven a tentative  scheme at  the  present stage.   It is  understood, however, thatarrangements for the manufacture of engines of American type in Australia  arealready in train, and  this might facilitate development  of  an engine potential.The  development of engine potential involves a very special  technique which canonly be achieved  in close co-operation with  an engine-designing firm and, inorder to secure this co-operation, it would probably be  necessary that the localmanufacturers  should work in conjunction with an engine firm in this country.The  manufacture of airscrews and  other equipment, and  the supply of materials to aircraft specification,  would also involve difficulties in greater or lesser degree.The  most practical course at present would be to  arrange to supply engines andsuch other accessories  as were unobtainable in Australia  from this country untilAustralia was  in a position to manufacture them herself.     The practical development of a scheme on the lines tentatively sketched abovedepends on  detailed local  investigation of the available  resources, and to thisend I seek the approval of my colleagues to the despatch of a Mission to collaborate with the  representatives of the Australian Government.   The Mission wouldnot,  of course, be empowered to enter into commitments, but would be instructedto prepare a scheme,  in consultation with their  Australian colleagues,  for  theconsideration of the two Governments.  But it must, of course, be recognised thatthe despatch of a Mission would be tantamount to a moral commitment, and any subsequent withdrawal, save for important reasons, would be impracticable.     The  discussions that have so  far  taken place have not  extended to  thepossibility of creating capacity in New Zealand, and it may be anticipated thatthe question  will arise if steps are taken in  regard  to Australia.   It is unlikelythat  anything   except on  the  most  moderate  scale could be  undertaken in new Zealand,  and the most that would  seem feasible would be  the placing ofa small order  for, say, a training  type,  on  the lines of the order  given to  the fort William factory, in Canada, subsidiary to the main scheme  for productionin that Dominion.  I should propose in this regard to keep in touch with  theSecretary of State for the Dominions and, if it should appear desirable, to arrange with him for the Mission to visit New Zealand also.
    It is  therefore submitted,  for the approval of the Cabinet, that  a mission should be despatched to Australia to examine, in consultation with representa-tives of the &quot;Australian Government,  the possibility of the creation of capacity for the production of aircraft in the Commonwealth, and  to prepare a schemefor the consideration of the two Governments.   If, after  consultation with theSecretary of State for the Dominions, it should appear desirable for the mission to visit New Zealand also for  a  similar purpose, arrangements  would be madeaccordingly.                                                                    K. W.    Air Ministry, December 15, 1938.APPENDIX.Cablegram received from the Prime Minister, Canberra, addressed to the High                           Commissioner,  London.(Most Secret.)                                             \                                                      v   December 9, 1938.    Government has considered suggestion for establishment in Australia of a potential capacity aircraft  manufacture for Australian and  Empire needs.  Itwelcomes your initiative in this matter and is of the opinion that it would be animportant practical step to  give effect to principle munitions supply adopted atImperial Conference, 1937.    Delay in replying earlier has been due to desire to examine proposal in some detail in the hope that indications might be given of  certain Australian aspects.After  consultation with Air  Force  and  Munitions  supply Authorities  andChairman of Advisory Panel on industrial organisation it is apparent that thiswould be too lengthy a process  in view of your early departure, and reply at thisstage is being confined to advice that scheme is endorsed in broad outline subjectto reservations as to manner of  giving effect to it.    Best course would be for experts  to come to Australia to discuss a scheme,and a preliminary survey of  Australian position could be prepared for their studyin advance.  This would cover supply of skilled labour, industry organisationand capacity of industries which would be called upon to co-operate, and other aspects.    Government feels that in view of  extensive Defence programme adopted by australia, including its outstanding efforts in comparison with other dominions in connection with Naval defence and provision Munitions  supply resources in eastern Hemisphere,  that some scheme of this nature  is a  vital gesture at this juncture,  particularly  in  view  of  prominence given  in  press  to favourable conditions under which factories are apparently being established  in Canada.
