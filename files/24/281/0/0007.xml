At their Meeting on the 15th June, 1938,  theCabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP.  141 (38)) in which their attention was drawn to an action which had beenbrought by a Mrs. Borders against the Bradford ThirdEquitable Building Society, and to the results which might follow in the event of the decision on a point as to theSociety *s powers  going against the Society.  One result was expected to be the discredit of the Building Societiesmovement,, in which some  700 millions of the public&apos;s savingswere invested. This might involve a serious disorganisation of business.   In addition, a severe check would be givento the Minister of Health&apos;s policy of securing thebuilding of small house property by private enterprise.APPOINTMENTOF CABINETCOMMITTEE.2..     The Cabinet agreed:-       &quot;That a Cabinet Committee composed as follows:             The Lord Chancellor ( in the Chair),             The Chancellor of the Exchequer,             The Secretary of State for Scotland,             The Minister of Health,             The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,             The Attorney-General,        should be appointed to examine the question        raised in CP. 141 (38), and more particularly        to enquire into the facts on which the policy        of the Government would have to be based.&quot;        (Cabinet 28 (38) Conclusion 9).
THE PRACTICE OPMAKING HIGHERADVANCES ONCOLLATERALSECURITY.3.     The important question in-a^spute-.jjx Jhe^ordejrscase is briefly as follows   The existing lawauthorises  Building Societies to advance money onlyon.the&apos;security of real and leasehold property.They may take collateral security to reinforce thisprimary security- but it may be decided thaithey have no legal power to make any higher advance in consideration of the collateralsecurity than they would have made on the primarysecurity alone.    For many years, however, when makingadvances for the purchase of new houses, the Societieshave in fact been accustomed not only to takeadditional security, usually in the form of a &quot;builders&apos;pool&quot; guarantee, and sometimes in other specific forms,but also to increase their advances in consequence upto as much as 95% of the purchase price.  It isanticipated that the judgment  in the Borders  casewill lay it down that this practice is ultra vires.Our information is that between 40 and 60 per cent,of the current business of the Building Societies isconducted on the basis just described,,&quot;BUILDERS&apos; POOLS&quot;. &quot;4.     Setting aside their illegality,  &quot;builders&apos;pool&quot; arrangements are an essential factor in thelarge scale provision of houses by private enterprise,and they have for the most part proved  in practice veryreasonably sound businesso  Their essential featuresin most cases are that the builder must notmerely guarantee at least the amount cf the excessadvance but must also deposit not lessthan  a  third  of  the  excess  advance  in
          *                                                            in                cash.  The builder cannot withdraw his deposits until fflm                a third of the capital advance has been paid off &quot;by thePti                borrower^  The usual arrangement is that, in the event  y                of default by the borrower, the builder must purchase                the house from the Society on terms which will freo                the Society from losses     ,NECESSITY Off    5.     It is our unanimous -view that  the Government cannotVALIDATINGTHE &quot;BUjlLDERS &apos;  allow the &quot;builders&apos; pool&quot; system to be destroyed byPOOLS&quot; SYSTEM.                a  judgment of the Courts.  It follows that legislation                will be required at short notice, if the result of the                Borders case is what we anticipateo  The object of the                legislation will be to validate for the past, and to                authorise for the future, the practice of taking                -additional security in the manner above described..  It                remains, however, to be decided whether                       (a)  the Government  Bill is to be in general terms,                              authorising Building Societies to make                              advances higher than normal against                              additional security, &quot;without attempting                              to define the types of additional                              security which may be taken, or                       (b)  the Bill is merely to aim at maintaining                              current practice, eeg* to aim at permitting                              Societies to make higher advances against                              additional security onl3T to the extent                              and with the safeguards that the most                              prudent  societies now insist oiio
NECESSITY      6*       We ^a7e no hesitation in recommending course (b).SAFEGUARDS     Slxe BiuilainS Societies have, it may be, contravened the law                and have involved themselves in a position which                necessitates the intervention of the Government and of                Parliament for their protection.  Moreover, the case out                of which the trouble arises is one in which the borrower                involved may well be held by the Court to have a real                grievance which Parliament will expect the Government to                take into serious accounto  Finally, there is a real                risk that,as house-building activity falls off? the less                well managed Building Societies may be driven by-                intensified competition into undesirable and risky forms                of business.   In the interests, therefore, both of                investors and of borrowers it is necessary to attach                conditions to the greater freedom which it is proposed                to give them.RECOIvQ BNDATIONS 7.      It will accordingly be necessary for the government as TO PROVISIONSOF THE BILL.    Bill to deal with a wide variety of matters, some of                which are of a complicated and technical nature,.  To name                only a few of the provisions which we regard as necessary,                we consider that the Bill should be drafted:-                       (a)  To require Building Societies, where                              additional security is taken, to give                              the borrower notice in writing, stating                              the amount by which the advance will                              exceed the amount which the Society would                              normally lend without additional security,                       (b)  To ensure so far as may be possible that                              the valuations or reports relating to&quot; the                              properties on which advances are to be made                              are competently carried out;  and                       (c)  To prescribe in some detail the categories                              of additional security which are to be                              allowed.   &quot;Builders1 pools&quot; are the most
  important of these categories.3  but there  are a good many others which are recognised  by the existing practice of the best  Societies,   The other categories to  which we contemplate giving legislative  authority are:-  (i)  Analogous guarantees by employees         in respect of houses for their         workers, etce (ii)  A guarantee by a Local Authority.(iii)  A guarantee by an Insurance Company, (iv)  The surrender value of a life         policy  (v)  Trustee Securities and deposits         of money. (vi)  Freehold and leasehold property         other than that on which the         advance is being madeoCONSULTATIONSWITH BUILDINGSOCIETYREPRESENTATIVES.AUTHORITYREQUESTED FORTHE PREPARA-TION OF ABILL.8.     The technical aspects of  the problem have beer-examined on our behalf by a Committee of Officials, whohave, with our approval, been in confidential consultationwith representatives of some of  the Building Societies. TheBuilding Society representatives have shorn themselves moreready than we expected to fall in with our proposals3 andhave themselves indicated some suggestions for strengthening the Bill.   This is satisfactory so far as it goes, but itmust not be inferred from this that the Bill will be non-contentious.   The position in this respect is examined inthe last two paragraphs of Annex I to the present Reporto9,     We attach for the information of the Cabinet thethird of a series of Reports which we have received fromthe Official Committee (Annex l)o -  This Report deals more fully with the technical matters to which we have verybriefly referred  in paragraph 7, together with a number ofother matters.   We are in general agreement with theOfficial Committee^ Report, and we recommend tha; it should
             be followed in the preparation of the forthcoming legislation,,             On the suggestion, however, contained in paragraph 25 of the             Official Committee&apos;s Report that in a &quot;builder&apos;s pool&quot; case             repayment should be completed within 21 years,  we are             provisionally of opinion that the Bill should not prescribe             any period for the purpose0   If the point .is pressed in             Parliament it could be reconsidered,,   If the Cabinet are             prepared to authorise the preparation of such legislation,  we             suggest that it should be left to us to convey the detailed             instructions to the draftsman0INTERIM      10o    In considering the Parliamentary procedure to beLEGISLATIONj^QrjT          followed we have examined the possibility of introducing aRECOMMENDED,  preliminary Bill, which would give the Societies temporary             relief from the forthcoming judgment, and then hoLding an             inquiry before the further provisions to be enacted are decided.             It seems to us, however, that in a matter of this kind an             inquiry may not be helpful in providing a solutiorio  There             would be a danger of inconvenient recommendations being made             and of public alarm being aroused, while the inquiry was             proceeding, as to the general position of Building Societies.                    We do not therefore recommend proceeding by means of             interim legislation, to be followed by an inquirys with a view             to the introduction of fuller legislation at a later stage&apos;/,AN EARLY     11.    The Borders case has been hanging fire for a long tine .JUDGMENT now expected IN  At the time when our Committee was appointed it was generally the BORDERSCASE.        expected that a decision would be reached before the long             vacation,,   By the middle of July, however, it had become clear             that this would not be the case o   At a Cabinet Meeting held on             the 13th July consideration was given to the line of action to             be followed in the event of the judgment being delivered in             the early autumn, before the Cabinet resumed its regular             meetings.   It was agreed that in this event the Prime Minister             should have authority to issue a statement to the effect that             the subject would be dealt with as soon as Parliament met             (Cabinet 32 (38) Conclusion 14),
                       The hearing  of  the  case was not -in-fac-t.- returned                until the late autumn.  The trial has now been completed                fend It is expected  that judgment will be delivered before                Christmas..  It is still expected that the decision will                go in favour of Mrs. Borders.INTRODUCTION    12.&apos;    Immediately  on  a judgment of this nature being of BILL.                delivered it will be essential to introduce legislation^,                in order to allay public anxietyc   Only a very few days                may remain before the  Christmas Recess0   We suggest                accordingly that, if the Cabinet approve our recommendations,                we should be authorised to arrange for the introduction of                the Bill as soon as it has been approved by the Home                Affairs Committee,  without further reference to the Cabinet,,                It is important that the measure should be printed and                published before the House rises for the Recessd   This will                be the most effective  method, not only of preventing the                possible adverse consequences to which we have referred, but                also of providing informed public opinion with an opportunity                Of examining the Government1 s proposals..   On the &quot;resumption I                of Parliament it will  be necessary to press on with the                passage of the Bill, with  a view to its becoming law, if                possible, in February, 19390STATBtOSNT OF    13.     An additional  precautionary step appears to us to beGOVERNMENTPOLICY9         necessary, namely,  the issue of an authoritative Statement                of Government Policy.   There will inevitably be some                interval between the delivery of the judgment and the                introduction of the Bill,  and a still longer interval before                the meaning of the Bill is digested,,   On the other hand,                the judgment may well  give rise to immediate apprehension                and to questions in Parliament,,   In order to prevent                disorganisation of  business it will be essential to make                an Immediate Statement outlining the Governments general                intentions.   We have  drafted a Statement of this kind                which we attach as  Annex IIo   If judgment is delivered     1
                  when Parliament is not sitting it will &quot;be doubly                  important that such a Statement should be made.    If                  possible, the Statement should, we think, be made by                  the Chancellor of the Exchequer.SUMMARY OF        14.    Our recommendations,  in the event of a judgmentRE COMME NDAT10 NS.                  unfavourable to the existing practice of the Building                  Societies being delivered in the Borders case, may be                  summarised as follows:-                         (I)  A Statement of Government Policy should be                                issued at once, on the lines of the draft                                contained in Annex II to the present                                Report.                        (ii)  A Bill should be introduced, with the least                                possible delay thereafter, to validate                                and regulate Building Societies practice.                                The Bill should follow the general lines                                of Annex I to the present Report.                                Parliamentary Counsel have been present at                                our meetings;   we understand that the                                drafting of the Bill is in an advanced                                stage, and that, as soon as a Cabinet                                decision has been taken, It will be                                possible to circulate a draft for the                                consideration of the Home Affairs                                Committee.    We suggest that we should be                                authorised to arrange for the introduction                                of the Bill, after Its approval by the                                Home Affairs Committee, without further                                reference to the Cabinet.Signed on behalfof the Committee.

(58)  9,COPY NO,CABINET.COMMITTEE ON BUILDING SOCIETIES,THIRD REPORT OP THE OFFICIAL COMMITTEE                      Io1.     At the third meeting of the Cabinet Committee heldon the 7th November the Official Committee were authorisedto enter forthwith into discussions with representativesof the Building Societies in the light of the discussions in the Cabinet Committee35.2.     We have had two long discussions accordingly and no?/report the result.   Throughout, the representatives of theBuilding Societies showed themselves appreciative of thedifficulty of their position,  ready to accept the necessityfor reform3,,and anxious to avoid unnecessary criticism ofthe proposals put before them.          JTI^NOTICE TO BE GIVEN TO BORROWER.3.     The Cabinet Committee were agreed that it was righton merits that the Bill should require Societies, whereadditional security was taken, to give the borrower notice in writing stating the  amount  by v/hich the advance will        3   The Official Committee were also  authorised           to show the  representatives of the Building           Societies in confidence  the draft statement           of Government policy.   This has  &quot;been done v-xxd th           matter dealt with in a separate report.
exceed the amount which the Society would normally  lendwithout additional security.    They were averse frommodifying this decision unless the Societies could saythat the proposal was unworkable *4.     V/e put this to the representatives as a provision which the Government were certain to require and they accepted it.       IIIc_  ADEQUACY op SECURITY;   P^npOWSIBILTTv-       of DIRECTOR;-&quot;.&quot;     &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;----------^ ^5.     The Cabinet Committee felt that  it would be premature at the time of their last meeting to agree uponthe terms of the draft clause dealing-with- -the-responsibilityof Directors- to ensure the &quot;adequacy of the security to betaken in respect of advances and they directed thatthe Official Committee should interview the representativesof the Euilding Societies and ascertain their reactions,in particular on the following points;-       (a)  adequacy of  security, and their duty            to ensure it.       (b)  the persons by whom  valuations were            undertakeno   The tentative view of            the Cabinet  Committee was that            valuations should be required to be            undertaken by persons who were in            practice as  surveyors or valuers,            even though  specific qualifications            could not be prescribed.       (c)  the obligation on directors.   The            tentative view of the Cabinet Committee            was that the eventual wording in&quot; the            Bill should be such as to be            applicable to a Board of Directors or            to a Committee of Management,            collectively rather than individually.
6.     We understand that after the meeting of theCabinet Committee the Lord Chancellor in discussionwith Sir Claud Schuster and Parliamentary Counselsuggested that the same object could probably be attained by a slightly different procedure broadly onthe following lines.    There would be a rule wherebyall Valuers should be appointed annually, and not for more than one year without review, at a Directors&apos;meeting at which all Directors should be presentunless they could show reasonable cause for absence.It would b,e provided also that the Valuers shouldbe competent and prudent persons, experienced in thematters relevant to the determination of the valueof the security.7.     We had a long discussion with the representativeupon this matter as a whole introducing into it thepossibility both of the procedure indicated in theMinutes of the Cabinet Committee meeting and also ofthe alternative understood to have been suggested bythe Lord Chancellor.    At the first meeting therepresentatives,  while showing themselves anxious to fall in with the wishes of the Government, were agood deal puzzled to know how those wishes couldbe framed in a form to which practical effect couldbe given in the day to day functioning of theirbusinesses. At a second meeting, after considering thelines of the previous discussion, we asked therepresentatives whether the three followingpropositions if accepted by the Government
would bo ace opt able :. to then.        (a)   It shall be the  duty  of  the  directors               or committee of management of  a               society to take all reasonable steps               to ensure that any  security to be  taken               by the society in respect  of an  advance               to be  made by  the society  shall  be               valued by a competent  and  prudent  person               experienced in matters relevant  to the               determination  of  the value of  that               security,        (b)   For the  purpose  of  discharging the               duty aforesaid a  meeting of the  directors               or members of  the committee of               management of  every society shall  be               held at least  once  in  every year at               which  the appointment  of the persons               to make such valuation as  aforesaid               shall  be decided  upon, and if  any               director or member  of  the  committee               fails  without  reasonable cause to               attend that meeting he shall be  under the               like liability in respect  of the               appointments decided upon as if  he had               assented thereto.        (c)   It shall be a term  of every contract made               after  the commencement of  this Act               for the employment  by  the  society  of  a               person to make stich valuations as               aforesaid that his  continued employ ent               for that purpose  shall be  subject  to               annual review  at  the meeting held  in               accordance with  the requirements of               the last foregoing  subjection. 8.    The representatives said  that they  accepted the first of these proposals, nor did they dissent from the view that each individual director or member of  the committee of management should  be equalise responsible for  ensuring the object In view if the Government so decided.     But they found great  practical difficulty in the second and third proposals.    Sir Harold  BelinAn, who appears to  have a wide knowledge  of  the  business arrangements in force in.different types  of  societies,  took a leading part in the discussion,,   Apart from the fact  that  the work of assessing different types of security,  e.g. house property on the one  hand and a  guarantee on  the  other, needs to be performed by people with  different types of
experience, he emphasised the very wide differences ofprocedure which are adopted in assessing the security of house property itself0   There are Societies the directors of which are in the main, professionally qualified valuers,who are chosen on this account.)   ?xany large societies have?it appears, a considerable staff of qualified professionalvaluers employed on a permanent basis with pension right s/oOn precarious terms of employment satisfactory men willprobably be hard to get0   The directors have differingsystems of controlling the selection of suitable candidatesand keeping the competence of the staff under reviewo   but owing to the immense importance in the valuing professionof local knowledge these valuers are usually employed inparticular localities in which the business of the societiesespecially arises0   Taking the movement as a -whole,including societies which do, and which do not, employprofessional staffs, a very large number of surveys - (one representative said 50.  of the -/hole) - are made by outsidepractising firms who hold no appointment with any societyas such but are asked to advise a societj- in a particular case.   We were told that one Society employs about 1,000valuers in any one year, most of them outside practitioners.In the better managed societies, Sir . arold said, panelsof suitable firms are compiled and the regular practice isto keep a careful look out for any cases which in theirsubsequent history show that the valuation report was notcompetently made, and thereupon to note that that firm shouldnot be again employed.   It was agreed of course that amongill-managed societies the arrangements are more haphazardand less satisfactory, but the representatives urged strongly that over the main part of the field existing arrangements
for review were more satisfactory than those set out inproposals (b) and (c), and that the latter proposals would heextremely difficult to work in any really effective way.-9. .  We could not help feeling that there was much force in what the representatives said and we found towards the end ofthe discussion that while objecting to proposals (b) and (c)they were prepared to accept an amendment of proposal (a)designed to introduce into it a general obligation for alldir-ectore tc^--accept, aru--equal responsibility in this.-important matter on a formula of the following kind:-          It shall be the duts^ of every director or           member of a committee of management&apos; of a           society to take all reasonable steps to           ensure that the adequacy of any security           to be taken by the society in respect of           an advance to be made by the society is           to be assessed by, a competent and prudent           person experienced in matters relevant to           the determination of the adequacy of that           security,,10.   Short as that clause is, we are disposed to think thatit attains two primary objectives, namely, that the right kindof people should be employed &quot;for assessing the adequacy ofdifferent securities and that the directors should beindividually responsible for ensuring that that is so.   In allthe circumstances we recommend the adoption of this formula in preference to laying down any more particularized procedure,,11. -  Tt has come out in the course of our proceedings that large numbers of building societies have a provision in theirrules which indemnifies their directors against the con-sequences of negligence, breach of trust, etc., in the courseof their ordinary duties as directors.  Such a rule is obvious-ly objectionable and it would become doubly objectionable if itwere applied to vitiate tho intentions of the provision whichhas just boon.discussed above. . In the case of companies,rules of this character have been invalidated by tho Companies&apos; ^ct1928.  We informed tho representatives that in our judgmentthey must expect a corresponding provision to bo inserted intho forthcoming Bill.   Thoy readily agreed that it would bea  good thing, and wc recommend accordingly-                     -6-
  IV. CATEGORIES Off ADDITIONAL SECURITY                TO KB ADMITTED.12.     The Cabinet Committee also reached a provisional view in regard to the kinds ofadditional security -which should be authorised.We discussed this with the representatives under two heads - firstly the general categories ofadditional securities to be authorised, secondly,the qualifications or  safeguards to be attachedto each.13.     After securing agreement to the proposition that all advances must primarilybe in respect of real or leasehold property and the primary security must be that real orleasehold property, we put before therepresentatives in the first instance thefollowing list of categories of additionalsecurity to be allowed:-          (a) A Builders Fool Agreement.          (b) Analogous guarantees by employees                in respect of houses for their                workers etc.          (c) A guarantee by a Local Authority.          (d) A guarantee by an Insurance                G ompany.          (e) The surrender value of a life                policy.          (f) Trustee Securities.14.     As regards the last named category theCabinet Committee reached a provisional view thatin addition to trustee securities public utility
                                                   9,                                                   osecurities should, be allowed.   Yfe thought itwiser not to put this in the first instance tothe representatives lest they should be tempted to ask for some much wider extension.   V/easked them generally whether &quot;trustee securities&quot;was wide enough.   They answered definitely inthe affirmative, but there would  of course beno difficulty in including public utilitysecurities if the Cabinet Committee so decided.15.     The representatives asked for tic other types of additional securities to-be admitted,viz. (a) money, and (b) freehold  or leaseholdproperty other  than that for the  purchase ofwhich the advance is made.   The  reason  forthe first named request is this.   It  is  foundfrequently in practice that a relative of anintending purchaser is prepared to deposit cashas security for repayment of an advance  by the purchaser, though not prepared to take thealternative course  of lending the money  to the purchaser and running the risk whether he will see it back again.   Both of these additions tothe list seem to us to be reasonable and  we re-c ommend t ha t t hey s h would  be admi 11 ed.V. CONDITIONS TO BID ATTACHED AS RESPECTS      CERTAIN CATEGORIES Off ADDITIONAL            SECURITY, ESPECIALLY              BUILDERS&apos; POOLS.16.     Y/e then passed to the conditions  andqualifications  to be attached to  certain  of theforegoing categories.
17.     The Official Committee had previously recommendedcertain conditions for the admissibility of a Builders&apos;Pool guarantee and it is understood that the CabinetCommittee were in general agreement.   They were asfollows:-     (a) The Society may.net advance more than 80% of           the purchase price on the house alone or           more than 15c/o of that price against the           guarantee:     (b) The Builder must make a deposit in cash           providing full cover for the excess advance           on the first five houses in any scheme and           and for one-third of the excess advance on           each house thereafter;     (c) Bach individual deposit may be released  only           when the  outstanding advance has been reduced           by repayments to two-thirds of its original           amount with a further qualification that           one-third of the total  of excess advances           outstanding must always remain in the pool.18.     In regard to these conditions the representativesbrought up a number  of matters which are points ofimportant detail rather than of principle.19.     In (a) the figures 80% and 15% had been taken  bythe Official Committee as being figures which have beenvery commonly adopted in recent practice and apparentlyfound to involve no  serious risk.20.     The representatives at once said that they would much prefer the rule to be that the normal advance on  thesecurity of the property should not exceed 75% of thepurchase price, and  the additional advance by reference tothe pool guarantee should not exceed 20%.   v/hile agreeing that many Societies were prepared  to advance up to 80% onthe property alone,  the representatives said that in their judgment it was not  sound practice and that 75% was the rightfigure.   They said also that if 80% were specified in the
Act even as a maximum, competition would compel manySocieties which now follow a sounder practice to advance80/o on the security of the house in future.   The proposedmodification of the condition will, of course, have theresult that some builders will have to give a rather largerguarantee and to find rather more cash in support of it than would otherwise be the case.   We do not believe, however,that the alteration is likely to cause any embarrassment to builders such as would impede the progress of building.We recommend that this modification should be adopted,21.    The representatives also asked that in calculatingthese percentages (i. e. the 75% and 20fo) account shouldnot be taken of any sum advanced to tne purchaser to enable him to take out a single premium life insurance policy inconnection with the purchase.   Policies of  this kind, arefrequently taken and provide that in tne event of tho death of the purchaser before the advance has been repaid, suchsum shall be paid to his estate as will enable it to  discharge the balance of the advance..     Such a policy designed as itis to enable a widow or other relative to come into owner-ship of the house without further payment in the event of the death  of the purchaser, seems to us a valuable form ofcover.    It is also an important additional security tothe Building Society.    We recommend that this, suggestionshould be adopted in principle;  subject to  investigation ofcertain possible practical difficulties.     We are discussing with the representatives how to define and delimit it ina Bill.22.    The representatives suggested also that no regard-should be paid in the calculation of the percentages  to any sum advanced to the purchaser to provide th.e premium for apolicy of guarantee or indemnity from an Insurance Companyagainst his default and the failure of the security to
 satisfy the advance-    This seems  to  us  a much more question- able suggestion and we do  not favour  it* - 23*     As  regards (b) (paragraph 17 above) the representatives said that  in the case  of builders-  pools which cover a very large number of houses it is  usual  to  arrange that  the builder shotild deposit rather less cash per house when the pool has reached a substantial sum because  the law of averages begins  to  apply and the risk to  be covered  is really less. It is,  however,  impossible  to define  a large estate or a large pool except by purely  arbitrary  limits and  any sliding scale for  the proportion OJ?  cash  to be deposited  as the pool grows is apt  to  involve arithmetical complications In regard to the provisions  fox1  the release  of the  pool moneyG   Vvre told the representatives  that we could not  for .our part recommend any altered provision in this regard and  they did not appear to raise objection, 24,     Discussion showed that the  formula set out in (c) (paragraph  17  above) for the  release of deposits is atpresent ambigtious and may require  some amendment in detailr, This question  is  being further examined with the representa- tiveso 25*     The  representatives  suggested that an additional condition should be attached  to builders&apos; pool cases,  vis,, that  the advance  should be  repayable over a period not longer than 21  years0    They said  that  in  recent times as a result of competition  a  number of  Societies had been allowing the repayment of the  advance to be spread over  25 years or even in extreme  cases  a longer periods   Apart from a general feeling that all  advances by  Building Societies (onwhatever security) should preferably be for a short rather than a  long period, they pointed out that in builders&apos;  pool
 cases  the  advance was nearly  always  high,  the  security  on  the whole  rather  less satisfactory  than  in  other types  of case and the  houses always new and  therefore  more liable  quickly to lose some of  their value.  In these  cases, therefore,  they thought that unless the period for repayment of the advance  was limited. to 21  years at most  the annual  capital  repayment  was not sufficiently  large to render  the advance safe  over  the  whole of the  initial years of the repayment period,.  The length  of  the period for repayment makes a  very considerable difference  to the  weekly payment representing interest and capitals   For instance on a 90-  advance upon a  750 house the weeklypsgrnjersb&amp;s  about 17 So-6d. a week if the  period  be  25  years,  and is increased by nearly two shillings a  week if the period  be reduced to 21 years.  Builders who &quot;at present  have arrangements with Building Societies enabling them to sell  their  houses  for payments over say a 25 years&apos; term will probably  experiencemore difficulty in selling them for  payments over a  shorter termNevertheless  the point seems  to us to be a sound  one and one that should be adopted.   We ought perhaps to add  that LocalAuthorities have statutory power in  certain cases to give  aguarantee for Building Society advances for working  class  houses to be let at  a rental and in  that case  the National  Associationof Building Societies agreed  to extend  the period for repaymentby the&apos;purchaser of the block to 50  years.  We think, however- that this is  scarcely relevant as a Local Authority&apos;s guarantee is worth much more than that  of a builder.x&apos;. The representatives also said that if a maximum term for repayment of advances was specified in an Act. there should bea subsidiary provision authorising them to extend the term incases of hardship after the contract had been entered into.This, however, can be done as a matter of grace and wa do notthink that any legal provision is necessary.
26.    If the foregoing recommendations are accepted theconditions of admissibility of a builders&apos;  pool guarantee  as additional security would be as follows:-     (a)  The Society may not advance more than 75% of the          purchase price on the security of the house alone          or more than 20% of that price against the guarantee;     (b)  The builder must make a deposit in cash providing          full cover for the excess advance on the first  five          houses in any scheme and for one-third of the          excess advance on each house thereafter.     (c)  Provisions for ultimate release of the deposit  as          in (c) in paragraph 17 subject to some technical          modifications the nature of which is now being          examined,     (d) . The period for repayment of the advance may not          exceed 21 years.27.    As regards analogous guarantees by employers inrespect of houses for their workers etc., the official committee recommend&amp;d that the provisions (a), (b) and (c)should apply as in the case of builders&apos; guarantees with  the qualification that there should be a discretion to the registrar of Building Societies, with the consent of theTreasury, to waive the requirement for a deposit of cash  ifthe guarantor was a Government Department or a Public UtilityUndertaking, municipal or other.   While accepting&apos; this in other respects the representatives drew attention to thecase of certain Associations (believed to be very few in number)formed for the special purpose of facilitating the acquisitionof houses by people engaged in a particular occupation or employment,   The only two instances actually quoted to uswere the Civil Service Housing Association - (a Societyassociated with the Staff Side of the National VhitleyCouncil) - and an Association with similar objects connectedwith the teaching profession,.   We think that the sameprovision as is contemplated for a Government Department  or
a public Utility Undertaking might reasonably be conceded                                                          8 0to existing Associations of this character and their ^ - .successors but not to new Associations with similar objectsformed after the passing of the&quot; Act.    Some of the societies&apos;  representatives thought that,  if the concessionwere extended to new Associations, there  might be a danger that such bodies would be promoted with the connivance ofsome Building Societies with a view to the evasion of theAct.                 VI.   MISCELLANEOUS POINTS&apos;.28.    Certain more general points also require mention.The representatives said that it would be convenient if a discretion were given to the Registrar of Building Societieswith the consent of the Treasury, to admit any other kinds of additional security beyond those which have beenspecified where in any individual case it appeared desirableto do so.   The matter was not pressed and it appears to us that the exercise of a discretion of this kind might be a difficult and invidious task.   We do not recommend thesuggestion.29.    A somewhat difficult question arose in the course ofour discussions as to the proper.treatment of poolarrangements which are in.operation at the time when theBill is passed. .,  We understand that the normal practice is this.   When a builder is about to develop an estate he goesto a Building Society, explains his general plans andspecifications to them and tells them what purchase price heis proposing to charge for the houses when they are erected.The Building Society, if satisfied as regards the status ofthe builder and the character of his plans, reaches a general
understanding with him to the effect that provided the houseswhen erected satisfy the claims he makes about them and provided he fulfills the arranged terms of his guarantee theywill be ready, subject to survey and to unforeseencircumstances, to advance a definite proportion of the purchase price for each house ,when it is erected and a purchaser comesforward/&apos;   It may be that in most cases there is no definitecontract at this stage but merely an understanding.   Theactual contracts arise subsequently between the building society, the builder, and the purchaser as regards each individual house.    It will be clear that there will be many instances in which advances have been made upon this basis by a building Society in respect of a number of houses upon adeveloping estate at the date when the Bill passes, but that further houses as they are subsequently completed and sold willalso need advances as part of the scheme included in the general understanding between the Society and the builder.   &quot; Thequestion is whether in this class of case the rigid conditionsattached to advances under the Builders&apos; Pool as laid down inthe Bill are to apply immediately upon its enactment asregards every advance made from that date onwards.30.    The representatives of the Building Societies did not seek to claim that all houses covered by an understandingreached before the enactment of the Bill should be immune fromits provisions however long after the enactment the houses were completed.    They did, however, say that some interval of timeought to be allowed to enable builders and Building Societiesto look round and adjust their arrangements.   Accordingly they suggested that advances under Builders&apos; Pool arrangements made within six months after the passing of the Act- should be exempt from the conditions which the Bill would attach to Builders&apos; poolcases.    On pressure they seemed ready reluctantly to agree thata period of three months, rather than six months, could be madeto do.    We ourselves favour a limit of thyee months appearing in the Bill, though this is a matter on which a concessionmight be made in Committee.
                                                         p o                                                         0 031.    Our attention was drawn to the fact that in a numberof cases a builder has assigned his rights in an existingpool of caslij which he has deposited as security,  to a company or society formed for the purpose of acquiringthose rights, and that these societies obtain the purchase price for the. acquisition- by making attractive-looking offersto the. public..    It was suggested that there were possibili-ties of abuse in business of this character.   We suggest,however, that it would be extremely difficult to deprive abuilder of the right to as?sign such an asset and indeedbuilders might in some instances be forced into bankruptcyif this were done.   We think that the Share-pushing Billshould be looked to to prevent any abuses of this kind.32.    A curious question remains to be decided about asmall group of Societies, 27 in number, which are notincorporated under the Building Societies Acts, 1874-1894,Of these the Norwich Benefit Building Society has assets of 4 million;  the Ipswich, the Cambridgeshire, the Colchesterand the Holmesdale (Reigate) Benefit Building Societies havebetween them assets of about  3 million;  and the remaining22 muster only  Ig- million between them.   At the time ofthe passing of the Building Scoieties Act 1894 these 27Societies were left \inincorporated for reasons connectedwith the banking business of a then existing but now defunctsimilar institution, the Birkbeck Building Society;  these reasons no longer have any validitjr.   The 27 Societiesare &quot;certified&quot; under an Act of 1836 and they have certain powers and certain limitations largely derived from friendly societies Acts prior to 1836.   Some at any &quot;rate of the societies conduct builders&apos; pool business and we are
advised that in^allj)^                           builders-&apos;-.....pool business- to be ultra vires in the case of incorporated-Societies they would take the same view on a case concerningunincorporated Societies.S3,    It appears clear to us in these circumstances thatthese unincorporated Societies should have their past pooltransactions validated but it does not seem appropriate thatthey should be given cover for an indefinite future unless they incorj)orate themselves (as they can easily do) and render the prescribed returns, etc. to the Registrar of building societies.   We suggest, therefore, that the Bill in its relation to these Societies should validate their past trans-actions and also future transactions for a period of a fewmonths to give them time to incorporate themselves, but should not apply to them generally in the future, unless they become incorporated.54.    One of the Building Society representatives whom we saw must prima facie be regarded as speaking for unincor-porated Societies amongst others and he did not dissent fromthe view of the other representatives who agreed with thesuggestion we have made above.   We doubt, however, whetherthis representative was really in a position to speakauthoritatively for these bodies.   We further suggesttherefore, that, if there is time between the Governmentannouncement of policy and the introduction of the Bill, weshould send for officials of the chief unincorporatedSocieties and ascertain whether they can adduce anysubstantial reasons against the course we have suggested.
35.    At the end of our discussions the representatives ofthe Building Societies enquired whether in due course theymight see the forthcoming Bill prior to its introduction into the House of Commons.    We informed them that thatwould he contrary to well-established practice.                       VII.36.    In general, the representatives of the building societies showed themselves more ready than we expected to fall in with our proposals and, as we have already indicated, made some suggestions themselves for strengthening the Bill.   This is satisfactory so far as it goes,  but itis to be remembered that our negotiations have been conducted with persons who, in &quot;the main, represent thelarger Societies, and that there has already been a movementamongst these Societies to secure a voluntary adherence onthe part of all Societies to a code of practice which includes, for example, a rule limiting loans supported byBuilders&apos; pools to a term of 21 years.    This movement has met with considerable success, but it is at least possiblethat at the instance of some of the smaller Societies theopinion will be voiced in Parliament that some of theproposed conditions of the Builders&apos; pool will involve an unnecessary and vexatious interference with existing practice and will lead to a curtailment of building.57.    It is right to recall also that Building Societiesare by no means the only people interested in this legislation.   They are, in fact suppliants, and scattered over the country there must be a great number of potentialcomplainants in the guise of people who have purchasedthrough the medium of Building Society advances, bad housesput up by bad builders.   It appears indeed that Mrs. Borders                     -IS-
and those associated with her have been trying to raise a kind of &quot;rent strike&quot; in several newly developed districts.It is to he anticipated, that when the Bill is introduced,members may try at the instance of these complainants to frame new clauses - and possibly many of them - to deal withother aspects of the Borders case which are really onlyillustrations of bad building or bad management in an individual case such as cannot be set right by an Act ofParliament.    We still anticipate therefore that any Billon this subject is likely to raise a good deal of controversy.85th November,  1958.
               ANNEX He          BUILDING SOCIETIES.           Draft Statement..        The attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government has been drawn to a judgment given in the Chancery Division on the .......  instants    It appears from this judgment that it is unlawful to pursue a practice commonly followed by Building Societies, namely to increase the amount of their advances beyond what they would be prepared to lend on the property alone even though additional security is given in respect of the increase.   In recent years a large proportion of the business of the Societies has been conducted on this basis and the building of small houses and the making of them available to persons of small means has been greatly facilitated thereby.   That the practice in itself is not undesirable from the point of view of public policy is indicated by the fact  that local authorities have under a series of Acts passed since 1923 been expressly authorised by Parliament to give additional security to Building Societies in consideration of their making advances exceeding the sums they would normally advance without  any such guarantee.        In these circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to remove the apprehensions which might be felt by the very numerous persons interested in* Building Societies and  their business by submitting to Parliament as a matter of urgency a Bill validating
the practice above described so far as regardsadvances made before its enactmento    His Majes.ty1sGovernment propose also to give powers to theBuilding Societies in the future to continue theirpresent practice as regards loans on additionalsecurity beyond the advances permissible on theproperties which are being purchased with their assistance, subject however to certain conditionswhich it is anticipated will not interfere with the carrying on of the business of the Societies in a proper and prudent manner, or with the facilities which they provide for the purchase of houses by persons with small capital -resources.
