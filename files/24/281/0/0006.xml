SECRET.                     I.-IN TROD U GTION.                   Progress of Provincial Autonomy.    The period under review has been one of exceptional calm.   There hasbeen occasion to mention in every previous Survey some &quot;crisis&quot; or otherwhich contained the  possibility of  the Constitution breaking down in theCongress  Provinces.  In the  quarter now surveyed no  distractions  haveinterrupted the duties of administration in  the provincial field.  Had the threat of war been fulfilled, all the Governments would have had to turn their attention  to the problems and  labours which  war would have begotten; andthe Ministries subject to Congress control might not have been permitted toundertake a  task  so  compromising  to their  spiritual- independence.   Thatdanger merely ruffled for a moment the surface of  a  country  fortunatelydistant from any  probable field of hostilities.    2. Of the eleven Ministries, seven may be said to have suffered no severeinternal strains in the quarter.....    As regards the others. in the Central Provinces  a reconstituted Minis-try has still to prove  its  worth:  the  Assam legislature has not yet learnt toplace i\ government firmly in power and-give it  steady support, and the newaffiliation with the Congress may not secure stability : conditions equallyuncertain prevail  in Sind :  and in Bengal a  Ministry which has lasted fornineteen months shows signs of needing  an accession  of strength if it is to stand.  But these  instances do not substantially detract from the  record ofthe successful&apos; launching  of provincial autonomy.    3. It may  not be incautious to refer to a fear which was genuinely felt.and widely expressed when the new Constitution was  in the making the fear that law and  order could not be safely entrusted  in India to Ministriesresponsible to the Legislatures.   The opinion was held in some quarters that,though any other branch  of the administration might be transferred withoutgreat  danger,  public order would   be gravely imperilled if entrusted to ministerial hands.  Any forecast now made may be falsified by events : anda structure may fall  through insidious sapping as  well as by assault : butthe short  history of provincial autonomy gives good  ground for optimism.It cannot be argued that the Ministries have not been tested :  the Shahidganjagitation at Lahore, the  Bombay riots of April last, and the industrial con-conflict in Cawnpore  may be quoted as situations  which would have tried theresolution and resource of any  administrations.   The Ministries  have shewnthat,  though in some ways, for instance in conditions of communal strife,theymay be peculiarly susceptible to strain, they enjoy at the same time someadvantages which a bureaucratic government lacked : and where new methodshave come into use they  have not been unsuccessful.               II.-CONGRESS PROVINCES.                (a) Ministries: stability and reputation.    4. Bihar. The comments previously made still  apply.   The Premiershows little administrative competence and a. tendency  to jobbery has arousedcriticism.  There  is dissension  in the Ministry : it has still not  been  re-constructed or enlarged.   The controversy over  the employment of  Bengalis,which was referred to Bajendra Prasad for arbitration, has not been settled.Agrarian agitation is still conducted on lines violently hostile to the Ministry.Labour trouble in  important industries shows signs of recrudescence.  these difficulties, and communal dissension which  for a while  was  alarminglybitter, have proved a strain on &quot;the competency of the Ministry.   251(S) HD
    5. Bombay. The Ministry  maintains its sound reputation :  and the&apos;Premier has shown signs of asserting himself more definitely as its leader.    6. Central Provinces. The empty places in the Shukla Ministry which came  into being at the end of July have not yet been filled.  No Muslim ormember of the scheduled castes has yet been found to fill the vacancies.   The&quot;Harijans&quot; in August expressed their impatience by descending on Gandhi&apos;sresidence near Wardha and fasting in successive batches a use against the master of his own methods by his own special proteges which, though ineffective-tual, is symptomatic of the weakening of his influence over this class.    It might have been- expected that a Ministry brought into existence by methods which were so severely criticised even by the ortnodox, and personal-ly entitled to  little- respect,  would have found its position insecure.   It hashad some uncomfortable moments : but the rebels  have played their cardsbadly and Congress discipline  has proved  its power.    Dr.  Khare in opposition has shewn no foreefulness.  For  a while hismeetings were well-attended and enthusiastic :  but  to achieve any results hehad to show a strong following  in the  Assembly  and  in this he failed.  State-ments made in the Assembly by him  and his  ^-colleague Deshmukh causedonly temporary inconvenience  to the Mahakosal Ministers.  In the middleof September Khare announced the formation of-a  new &quot;Congress Democra-tic&quot;  party, but its  membership was  paltry.   At the end of September theAll-India, Congress Committee at its Delhi session endorsed,the verdict ofthe Working  Committee on both Khare and the Governor (see paragraph  8of the last Survey)  and called  for disciplinary action against Khare.  TheWorking  Committee then disqualified  him from Congress membership for two years, and called on him to resign his seat in the Assembly.   This he hasrefused to do.   His health is now stated to have failed, and it is likely thatthe force of his revolt is spent.  It is known that he has  been in touch withdraw.  Raghavendra Rao, but that stalwart opponent of modern  Congressmethods evidently felt  that an open  alliance would   serve no  purpose.Nevertheless,  though  Khare has been suppressed and the dominance of theCongress High Command has  been reaffirmed,  the  incident has  damaged itsclaims both to  omnipotence and infallibilitv, and  it could ill-afford to meetanother such challenge : and the rift in the local Congress party will not easily be repaired.    :In the course of the controversy which  produced a verbose, pamphletfrom Khare and  an equally tedious  reply from Subhas Bose-a vernacularnewspaper in the Central Provinces  attacked Khare&apos;s opponents, includingGandhi, with  the most offensive scurrility.  The Governments reply wasto demand an impossibly large  sum as security under the Indian Press (Emer-gency Powers) Act, and the newspaper then ceased to exist.   This use  ofthe bureaucratic  weapon of repression was widely  criticised.     The  Ministry&apos;s  administration  has  no  doubt been hampered  by thedifficulties created by the controversy.  But even  so the neglect of currentduties by the  Ministers warrants  little  hope of efficient performance  oftheir duties.   It is becoming daily  clearer that  Misra  (morally the blacksheep of the Ministry) is  its most important member.  The Premier  issubservient to him : and Misra and Mehta  are known to be on bad terms.  Ofthe new Ministers,  Gokhale has distinguished himself by preaching indepen-dence from the British connection, and during the European crisis announc-ed that war would be India&apos;s opportunity to reach that  goal.  Bharuka,a Marwari, was once in the  Income-Tax Department, from which he wasremoved on grounds  of inefficiency : he carries little weight.   The divisionof portfolios  leaves the&apos;most  important with  Shukla.     The Maharashtra revolt  has recent!v been balancedjby an accession  of strength to the Ministerial party from, the non-Brahmans of the Province. This group has decided to  ioin the Congress, and thereby half a dozen voteswill be gained by the Ministry in the Assembly.
 solvency3 financial Position of the Province is such as to cause alarm for its     7. Madras.-RajagopalacharPs  competent  dictatorship,  continues, Jll,D&apos;,&quot;ous threat irom the anti-Hindi malcontents or-any other quarter. ine Handling, of the Burma riots produced from him a hint, that he might resign, m protest against his inability  to  ensure, the protection of ,Indian interests,  but no more has been heard of that.     Rivalry between  Brahmans and non-Brahmans in this Province  is as strong as ever: the Congress is predominantly Brahman, and anti-Brahman feeling explains not only the persistence of. the agitation against Hindi but also the  recent Congress  failures  in elections to the Madras  Corporation which have resulted in the Congress majority being lost.  The jealousy felt by Telugus is also an influence working against, the Ministry.  The Ministry have formally endorsed the demand for an Andhra Province.by submitting the proposal to the Secretary of State :  but there can be no doubt  that the refusal of the Secretary of State to consider the partition, on  the ground thar, its advantages would not justify the resulting discontent, the unsettle- ment,  political and economic, and the set-back to the successful development of self-government in the Province, fully accords with the Premier&apos;s wishes.     If the Ministry&apos;s position is to be seriously weakened, the challenge must come from forces still unorganised.     8. North-West  Frontier Province. There  have been no  important developments in this Province&apos;.   Gandhi,  who visited it in May, is again there : and though his  professed object is a study of the &quot;Red Shirt&quot;  organi- sation in furtherance  of his desire to establish a non-violent army, it may be surmised that he is not unconcerned with criticisms of Dr. Khan  Sahib&apos;s administration  as lacking in strict  Congress orthodoxy.  It is,  however, unlikely that the visit will have any material effect on Ministerial policy. The Premier relies implicitly on  G/andhi&apos;s  support, particularly  as this Ministry,  being the only Congress Ministry predominant.lv, Muslim, is one which  the Congress cannot afford to lose.  The loss of the North-West Pron- tier  Province would ruin hopes of Congress domination in. Assam.  Bengal and  Sind : and would  shatter the  Congress claim to represent. Muslims as fully as Hindus.     The Ministry&apos;s handling of agrarian conflict in a part of the Province has shewn resolution :  and a recent decision to check the deterioration in the collection of  land revenue by coercive measures, including arrest and detention- tion of defaulters, is as courageous as it is  necessary.     9. Orissa.-The Ministry&apos;s unwillingness  to assist in the, control  of agitation organised in the Province against neighbouring Indian States and the possibility of  the  Governor being forced to  intervene on that account, suggest that  a &quot;crisis&quot; might be manufactured out of this issue (see para- graph  91). .     10  United Provinces. With the  settlement of the Cawnpore labour dispute early in July,  an absence of major communal trouble, and the long gestation of  the Tenancy  Bill,  the Province has given the appearance of quiescence   But in all these respects  there is the possibility  of  further threats to  public order.   The Ministry is genuinely  desirous of  peace  : but the elements of disorder are not easily to be  brought under control after long encouragement in licence: and in particular the delay m the settlement of the agrarian  problem may provoke the intransigent forces among the tenants. Of all  the Congress Ministries this has to surmount the greatest difficulties : and it  is still far from  an assurance of success.                (b) Legislatures: events of the  Sessions.    11 Bihar -The Legislature,  which was sitting at the beginning  of August-&apos; broke up on August 25th.  The onlv important business transactedwas&quot; agrarian legislation, which is described  in  paragraph 66,
    12. Bombay. The  Assembly  began a long  session on  August  17th,which  had not concluded by the end  of  October.   The important  TradeDisputes Bill (mentioned in paragraph 96 of  Survey No. 3) was introduced on September 2nd.   Desiring to get it passed into  law during the session,the Government refused to agree to its  reference to a Select Committee; theopposition have taken their revenge by dilatory tactics.  After two months&apos;discussion the  Bill has still passed only the first  reading.  The Bill isobnoxious to Communists and other labour extremists on account  of  itsrestriction on strikes : and an attempt  is being made to work up  a one-daygeneral strike on November 7th by way of protest.  The Bill catering forthe restoration  of the forfeited lands in Gujarat,  of which further mentionis made in paragraph 106,  passed  without difficulty through both Houses.The Tenancy Bill which  was to have  been  introduced seems to  have beenshelved, as it satisfied neither the landowners nor the tenants in the congress party,    A Bill  seeking to  establish compulsory  panchayats (local bodies) inall large villages, and to  democratise these bodies by abolishing nominatedseats, was referred to Select Committee.    The Council had a  brief session in the middle of September which was resumed in October.  Both Houses  discussed  their rules of procedure.  TheCouncil rejected a resolution urging the separation of judicial and executive functions.   -  13. Central Provinces.-The Assembly  held a   short  session   from september 15th to October 1st.   Mention has already  been made of Dr.Khare&apos;s efforts in opposition (para. 6).  The Relief of Indebtedness bill was referred to Select  Committee on September  20th; this is  described in para.  68.     14. Madras.- The Legislature sat for only five days, from august 15thto 19th.  The  events connected with the private Bill to repeal the criminal law Amendment Act,  with the Harijan  Temple Entry Bill, and with the speakers ruling on the question of the language to be used in the  House,are described  in their  appropriate places.   The Government^ position inthe Legislature is  still beyond any effective  challenge.     15. North-West Frontier Province. There  has been no session  of theLegislature.     16. Orissa.-The Assembly met on August  29th.  The  Orissa Money-lenders Bill which requires the registration of moneylenders was referred to Select Committee.   Government accepted a non-official resolution  recom- mending that the &quot;partially excluded&quot; areas, for  the peace and good govern- ment of which the Governor has a special responsibility, should  be brought under the normal system of administration.     17. United Provinces. The Assembly commenced a session on  August 1st, and  the Council sat from August 29th  to  September  3rd.   In the Assembly  a Gambling Bill was  referred  to Select  Committee  and later&apos; passed.  All the amendments  made by the Upper  House to  the  Court Fees and Stamp Bills were  rejected by the  Lower  House;  the  Council again expressed its disagreement, and stalemate has been reached.  It seems that only a joint session of both Chambers can slove the problem.   It is the view of the Ministry that the Assembly should have the dominant voice in matters concerning taxation and that the Council should play merely the part of a revising Chamber.     The most important business was to  have been  consideration  of the Tenancy Bill.   On August 10th,  the House adjourned till  September 5th, because the Select Committee had not produced its report on the Bill, but  again had to adjourn for the same reason.  The  report was at last published early in October, but the House adjourned once again till November  10th as  negotiations were in progress between Congress &quot;and the Zamindars about  certain provisions of the Bill.
    -(c) Relations of Ministries with the Central Congress Command.     18. On the whole  the  interference  of the Congress High Commandwith Ministries, which reached its climax in the Central Provinces affair ofJuly, has not;been greatly in evidence in the quarter.  When the WorkingComnnttee.met in Delhi in September, a number of Premiers;are said tohave claimed.a freer hand : Khan Sahib, not for :the first time, professedreadiness to resign if  not  permitted more independence : Gobind BallabhPant made a similar protest: and Raj agopalachari vigorously defended themethods employed by him in repression of the anti-Hindi agitation.   Kherof Bombay has said that he now  refers as little as possible to the working committee and his Home Minister, Munshi,  is known to be impatient ofthe Central control.     The resolution of  the Working Committee  about &quot;civil  liberties&quot; (see:Appendix  I) will give Provincial Governments freedom to use  rigorous.methods against  trouble from the left-wing.   It pledged the  Congress tosupport all measures taken by Congress Governments for-the defence of life and property, and warned the public.that-.civil liberty does not cover acts,of violence or incitements to violence or promulgation  of palpable falsehood.(In the course of the discussion a Madras Congressman expressed a contemptfor democratic shibboleths which would do credit to a dictator).  armed with this authority, Rajagopalachari has instituted^a fresh prosecution forsedition against a political opponent.  The autocracy of the High Com-mand,  however irksome at times to Ministries, is a strong support to themin dealing with  their  own malcontents.   For instance   in   the   united provinces the -local Congress sub-committee  on the  Tenancy Bill commu-riicated to the Working Committee a resolution which questioned the autho-rity  of the Parliamentary  Sub-Committee  to  interfere  in   the matter oftenancy legislation and expressed the hope that they would leave the matter in the  hands of the local committee  and  the  Legislature.   The working committee replied with a  sharp rebuke, claiming for the  ParliamentarySub-Committee full authority to intervene,  and regretting the objectionableresolution passed by the local committee.  In this Province . it  is  nowproposed that the High Command shall arbitrate as to  the terms  of  the-Bill.   The Agra section of the Zamindars has agreed to this course, thoughthe more conservative Zamindars of Oudh oppose it.  The left-wing of the tenancy reformers are alarmed at the prospect, fearing that a settlement so arranged would  fall far short of their hopes.     In Bihar, as was  mentioned in the last Survey, Rajendra Prasad&apos;smediation was obtained to settle the terms  of tenancy legislation: and thishas now been sought in Orissa also where an attempt  is being made toarrange a compromise over the Tenancy Bill  reserved for the considerationof the  Governor-General.     The Congress attitude  towards the  threat  of war in Europe is dealtwith elsewhere.   The  decision was  left  to the Working Committee-: andthere can be little doubt that  its orders would have been  obeyed by  the.Congress Ministries, even if they required  the surrender of office.     The slight regard  shown by Vallabhai Patel,  who is  the dominantpersonality in the Parliamentary Sub-Committee, towards minor Premiersappears not.only from his  actions ,in the Khare episode but also from hisrelations with the Grissa Ministry: he sent to the  president  of the localCon gress  Committee for investigation and report a letter  making  graveallegations figainst the ability and integrity of the Premier!     19. The &quot;Vidya Mandir&quot; scheme. Little progress has yet been madeNext January 100 schools are to be opened in the Central Provinces.  Thefirst  centre for training teachers has been opened in Bihar, where 60 candi-dates are said to be in  training.
    20.  Use of Hindi. By the middle of October  349 arrests  had  beenmade in Madras of agitators against the compulsory introduction of Hindiin schools, and 330 persons had been convicted.  The agitation is now inirresponsible hands and  may soon subside, though strong resentment willremain  both against  the imposition  on the Province  of  this exotic and against the high-handedness of the measures employed to repress opposition.This resentment has been exploited to rouse feeling  against the Brahmancomplexion of the Ministry and of Congress in  the  Province :  and thePremier has now directed the prosecution of the editor and publisher of ajournal  for sedition and stirring up communal hatred.    An  offshoot of the agitation was an attempt in the Madras Assembly to repeal (in its application to the Province) the Criminal Law amendment act, a provision of which has been freely used to penalise  the picketing ofthe&apos;Premiers house (see para. 27  of  the  last Survey).  The.Bill wasthrown out; but the spectacle of a Congress Ministry so depending on legisla-tion which has always been considered totally repugnant to sound Congressdoctrine was unedifying and caused  some discomfort  to   the  Premier&apos;scolleagues and  supporters.  The Premier&apos;.s defence was   that  while.theMinistry were not opposed to the repeal  of the Act  as such, the  Bill waspremature because they did not wish  to throw, away the only weapons attheir disposal until they had replaced them by something better.  This some-what specious argument has been endorsed by Gandhi,  whose close connec-tion with  Rajagopalachari is sometimes  thought to affect  his judgment ofthe latter&apos;s actions.  &quot;                          - .(d) Relations  of  Ministers with  Governors:  social  contacts:  special                            responsibilities.    21. - There is no change in  the attitude of the Congress party to socialcontacts.  The Bombay Ministry were unable to  accept   the  Governor&apos;invitation to dinner to celebrate the anniversary of their acceptance of office on July 19th.   &quot;When the Premier of Madras wanted  to give a tea-party inhonour of a retiring officer his colleagues  said they were afraid of incurringthe displeasure of the Working Committee, a,nd he abandoned  the  idea.WThen the officiating Governor assumed office in Orissa, neither the Premiernor the Revenue Minister were present, and only one of the parliamentary secretaries turned up; the other two Ministers arid the other parliamentary secretaries were absent from the station.   The new Premier of the central provinces did not avoid  social  relations with officials when he paid a visit to Jubbulpore; he dined  with&apos; the Commissioner and  got on very well withall the army and civil officers present.    22.  Special Responsibilities. No Governor has  had  occasion to make use of his  special powers to override his Ministry in the period under review.The problem of reductions in pay and allowances has not come to a head; atthe end of the quarter the Secretary of State was still considering whether he should employ his rule-making powers to prevent any further reductions of travelling allowance for the Services under his control.   This subject is discussed  more fully in para.  42.  (e)  Relations  of Ministers with their Secretariats:  methods of business.    23. Instances of unfortunate methods of business are  this time confined to Bihar and the Central Provinces.    The Bihar Ministry are alleged to have relations of doubtful  proprietywith business firms: for instance an understanding,  in return  for favoursreceived,  that firms should employ only Biharis : Messrs. Tata &amp; Co. are understood to have contributed some  Rs. 10,000 to  the  &quot;mass literacy&quot;campaign for reasons which may not be wholly philanthropic; and anothercompany  was led to believe  that a handsome subscription to Congress fundsmight ensure contracts for the supply of material for an electricity scheme.
     In the Central Provinces the  new  Ministers  have  not  been  able to get ori with  their current duties; unwilling to accept   the  advice  of their departmental Secretaries they place the files on one side and business stands  still.  Shukla, the Premier, had even as a Minister been difficult about postings   and  transfers;  as  Premier  he  has  more   scope for favouritism and prejudice.   For two vacancies recently arising in the Secre- tariat he proposed two Indian officers; one of them had been scheming with the Ministers to get the post, but as the British officers senior to  him were scarcely of the standard required the selection could not well be opposed; the Other was an officer oja  the  executive side proposed  for  the  post of Legal Secretary, to the exclusion of all the Sessions Judges who had a better right: he had been a Judge but was transferred to the executive for Unsatisfactory handling of cases arising from the civil disobedience movement of 1931, and Shukla suggested that it was only right to undo the wrong done in the past : the Governor objected to this appointment, and a senior Judge was selected for the post.   Shukla&apos;s conduct showed both a desire to  exclude British officers from the Secretariat and grounds for selection other than genuine merit.     The Ministers proposals for  appointments to  District posts also are based on favouritism towards some officers and victimisation of others.     24.  The Central Provinces  administration has produced instances of improper treatment of official records.  The  publication in a newspaper of the &quot;judgment&quot; of the ex-Judge of the Calcutta High Court who had been deputed by the Congress High  Command to examine the conduct of the Minister Sharif, showed that official documents had been improperly commu- communicated to him for the purpose of the enquiry.     In connection  with  an order of remission of sentence  recently passed, and discussed below (see para. 61), the Law  Minister, even before the file had reached the Governor for his final orders, released the information to the Press, including a statement that the prisoner was immediately being set free : the very language  of the official files, including phrases from the Governors own notes,  appeared in print.     The oath of secrecy taken by Ministers should prevent such disclosures.            III.-NON-CONGRESS PROVINCES.    .                 (a) Ministries:  stability and reputation.    25. Assam. It appears likely that in future this Ministry will have to&quot;be counted among those  under the control of  the Congress; the number of &quot;non-Congress&quot;  Provinces will  then be  reduced to  three.  The  SaadullaMinistry has never been secure, and the purge  of last February (see para.  41of Survey No. 3) failed  to preserve it from disintegration.   Party loyaltyhas been weak,  and the efforts of Congress to form  a  coalition against theGovernment have been persistent.   Nevertheless,  the fall of the Ministry inSeptember was unexpected.   After surviving the first week of the Assemblysession, the  Premier, faced with four motions  of no-confidence, tendered the resignation  of the  Ministry  on  September 13th.  No particular  principle was in  issue: the two Muslim Ministers recruited  in February were un-popular; and though the Premier might perhaps have kept his position by afresh reconstruction, he  preferred to make no further attempt to woo thedisaffected &quot;United Muslim&quot; party.  On the advice of the retiring Premierthe Governor invited Gopinath Bardoloi, leader  of the Congress party,  toform a  Ministry.  After a few days Bardoloi submitted  the names of fiveHindu Ministers, leaving three places vacant for Muslims.  The swearing-in ceremony was fixed for September 19th.  -  Meanwhile,  the deserters, dismayed  by   the  consequences  of  theirfickleness, returned to the support of Saadulla; 56 members in a House of107 joine.1 to form an &quot;Assam  United Party&quot; under  his  leadership; the
party included  the. European group.  In the circumstances  it  could  berepresented that the new (and incomplete) Ministry could npt command amajority in the Assembly :  but the sitting had meanwhile been adjourned bythe Speaker to  the 19th, and on that date, before the oaths  were adminis-tered, the Speaker,  at  Bardolors instance,  adjourned sine die and soprevented discussion of the no-confidence motions which had been  tabled.    The Governor could not regard this arrangement as acceptable: hepostponed the  administration of the oaths until the next day,  when  the speaker gave an undertaking that  the Assembly would be recalled in thesecond week of  October.    Helving on this assurance,  the Governor had the oaths administeredto his five Ministers on September 20th.  Meanwhile each of  the 56 mem-bers of  the newly-formed opposition party put in a motion of no-confidtence,and demanded that  the session  should be resumed not later than October12th.  Already it was  suspected that the Speaker  would  devise reasonsfor postponing the session further.   Religious   and   civil  court holidays-could be used as an excuse for not recalling the House during  the period from October  20th till the new year, by which time the  Cabinet  wouldhave had a free hand with the administration for three  months althoughit would not.be known whether they had the  confidence of the House.     Suspicion  turned out to be justified.  Bardoloi demanded  that the sessions should not be resumed till January  : the Speaker went back on his promisesand announced the  recall  of the House for December 1st.  In  the  courseof  a long and  argumentative explanation of this decision, he put forward a number of reasons for the delay  which do not suffice to clear  him of the suspicion of using his  position in furtherance of party  advantage.  Thedifficulty in the way of a Governor over-ruling his Premier and the Speakerto  obtain an early&quot; verdict  of the Legislature  on its attitude towards hisMinistry was  felt to be the greater where that Ministry has been formedunder the aegis of Congress.  (The Congress President himself had  visitedAssam to superintend the  construction of the Ministry).   Congress could with some reason point to  the failure to  summon the legislatures between April  and July 1937 in  the Provinces where minority Ministries were appointed on the refusal of Congress to take  office  : and capital -could be made by comparison with Sind, where the non-Congress Ministry might have been defeated if the Legislature had been summoned during the past few months.   The prominent part taken by the European group in  Assam in opposition  to  the new Ministry would have given further  ground for complaint if a meeting of  the Assembly had been forced.     Bardoloi&apos;s coalition Cabinet was completed in the third week of Gcto- ber by the addition&apos;of three Muslim Ministers.  The Cabinet consists  of the following  : &apos;&apos;        Gopinath Bardoloi-Congress.        Akshoy Kumar Das Scheduled Caste.        Ramnath Dass Scheduled  Caste. &apos;       Kamini Kumar Sen-Independent.        Rupnath Brahma &quot;Tribal&quot;.        Fakhr-ud-Din Ali Ahmed Congress Muslim.        K. B.  Maulvi Mahmud Ali-        Ali Haider Khan-       Fakhr-ud Din  is  the  only  Congress  Muslim in the Legislature..  Mahmud  Ali  was won  over   from   the  new opposition  Assam  United  Party.  Ali  Haider  was   one  of   the   members  dropped  from  Saadulla&apos;s Cabinet  in  February;  he  was  the first  of the three  Muslims to be offered a  post  in  the new  Cabinet  but the last to  accept.  A.. K.  Das was a member (recruited in  February)  of the  fallen Ministry.  That the prospects of  the new Ministry are dubious  may be deduced from  the tactics employed.in its creation: both caprice and venality can be laid&apos;Muslim.
 to the charge of the members of the Assam legislature : though the power &apos; derived from  the administration of  Government  is now in  the Ministry&apos;s favour, past history warrants doubt as to its security.     26. Bengal. The last Survey mentioned  the ejection of Nausher Ali from the Ministry.  He took with him to the opposition only two Assembly votes,  and a more serious defection was that of a number of  Scheduled Caste members.  When the Assembly met, motions of no-confidence  were tabled by the opposition,  one against each individual Minister; with the assistance of the European group the Government defeated  the first three, and the remainder were not movedi.   The Ministry now depends upon tho European group for  its existence :-  and that  is  scarcely  a position  with which it  can remain content.   The Premier is understood! to  have been con- si dering  its reconstruction, but so far no changes  have been  made.     The  passing of the Tenancy Bill (to which the Governors assent was given) has brought some prestige to tho Ministry :  and labour, communal and agrarian troubles have been happily negligible.  Moreover the chronic discussions of the  Congress party in Bengal weaken its power  of attack. But the  Ministry  is rather precariously based, and the discovery of any popular cry  against it (e.g.,  if a hunger-strike were started  among  the terrorist  convicts) would threaten its existence.    27. Punjab.- -This is  the only Province where a non-Congress Govern- ment is securely established.   The  subsidence  of  communal trouble has enabled the  Ministry to proceed with  its&quot; agrarian programme.  Of the Bills mentioned in the last Survey all except  one (reserved for  the consi- deration  of the Governor-General on a technical ground) have received the Governors assent,  and the  fulfilment  of election promises has  greatly; enhanced the Ministry&apos;s prestige in  the Province.  The policy is frankly designed  to benefit the agriculturist classes at the expense  of  the classes which have exploited the farmer in the past.  It  appears- likely to cost the Government the loss  of a few votes  in the Legislature; but the en- thusiasm of the country-side has been, demonstrated in remarkable fashion and appears to have given the Ministry increased confidence in itself and to  have depressed  the organisations  that have been  working against it. Of the latter, the Congress is still weakened by bitter dissensions.    &apos;2S;Sind. The Ministry, unable to claim any party of its own, has been harassed by pressure  which, though coming from two opposite  politi-*cal angles, is equally directed towards upsetting the decision on the revision-of  the Lloyd  Barrage assessment.   The Congress party demanded  as the price of their continued friendship the postponement of the  orders for one vear.   A Muslim group under the leadership  of  Sir  Ghulam Husain the previous  Premier,  seized  the opportunity to  embarrass the Ministry by making similar demands.    At the end of August Vallabhai Patel visited Karachi to determine the attitude to be adopted by Congress.  It is believed that he  was convinced of  the justice  of the assessment orders  and&apos; held, that the local Congress party  had blundered in opposing them.   But after he had reported to the Working Committee it  was  decided; that unless  the Ministry agreed to postpone  the  entire settlement proposals  for a year,  Congress  would resume freedom of  action  and would remain neutral in the event of  a motion of no-confidence.   Without Congress support the Ministry  wouldbe unlikely to survive,  ;      -    There were rumours  of Cabinet reconstruction  and expansion, but-nothing has been done.  At the end  of September Sir Ghulam Husain re- quested the Governor  to summon the Legislature on the ground, that the Ministry  obviously did not command) the  confidence  of  the  House; therequest was refused.  (The Governor&apos;s  refusal has  been  condemned by Muslim League speakers).    The next  development was  a determined effort  on  the part of the muslim League to form a League Ministry,  Jinnah, the President, visited   2(5,l(S) ED
10 Karachi  early in October to preside over the  Sind Muslim League con- ference.  He is understood to have banded together 27 out of the 35 Muslim members in the  Assembly under  the Muslim League flag and persuaded them to sign the pledge; but his negotiations  with  the  Premier, Allan Baksh, broke down.  Jinnah proposed a League Ministry of  six; Allah Baksh  disapproved  of the Ministers suggested  and  had  scruples  about throwing over his Hindfu colleagues.  Jinnah&apos;s revenge for this rebuff was a statement to the press accusing the Premier of treachery.     It  was expected that Congress  might take  advantage of this position to  renew negotiations with the Ministry,  but  on  October 17th they re- afhrmed their previous decision.   The Ministry&apos;s  position is therefore un- certain and its chances of surviving  a meeting of the Assembly seem small.                 (b) Legislatures.: events of the sessions1,     29. The Legislatures of the Punjab and Sind have not met during the period  under survey.     30, Assam.- The Assembly session  began on September 5th  and was adjourned sine die on the 19th in the circumstances already described (para. 25).  No  business of importance was transacted.     31. Bengal. The Assembly session lasted from July 29th to August 25th.  The  Council  also sat  until August 23rd.   Both Houses  passed the amendments to the Tenancy Bill which had been suggested by the Governor, and he gave his assent %q the Bill on August 16th.     Ten motions of no-confidence  were  tabled  against  the  individual Ministers.  As August 8th. the day fixed for discussing the motions, drew near, the excitement in Calcutta was tense.  Assaults were made on opposi- t,ion leaders by  Ministerial supporters outside the House,  and on the night of the 7th a number of opposition members slept in the Assembly Chamber - for fear of being  attacked if they  were seen in the streets.  A  procession of Muslims  marched to the Chamber on the 8th to show their support for the.Government.   The first motion,  against the Minister for Communica- tions, was rejected by 130 votes to  111, the European group of about 25 voting for Government.   Two more  motions were rejected without a divi-. sion and the rest  were then dropped.     A fevv days later another trial of strength, over an opposition demand for a reduction in a supplementary  demand, resulted: in  a victory for the Government by a margin of  20 votes with the assistance of the European, group.  This group&apos;s support of the Ministry has not stood in the way of strong criticism by it of some of the Ministry&apos;s defects.     In view of the communal jealousies in Bengal,  the passing of one non- official resolution is  of importance :  it recommended a definite proportion for recruitment to the services by which Muslims.should get 60 per cent., Scheduled Castes 20 per cent., and caste Hindus  and other  communities would have  to divide the remaining  20 per cent..     The Council accepted a resolution moved by a Congress member urging that no appointment to  the  Governorship of a  Province should be made. from members of  the Services under the Secretary of State.  A resolutionurging that the system of conferring titles and distinctions should be dis- continued was rejected.   The Government alarmed journalistic circles by giving notice of a Bill, to be moved at  the next session, designed to prevent the dissemination of  the contents of unpublished Government records except after due authorisation.  The Bill is alleged to be required to meet a grow- ing  tendency to  give unauthorised  currency  to unpublished State docu-ments.     After the session ended,  the need arose  to  exercise the  legislative. powers  of the Governor by ordinance under section 88 of the Governmentof India Act, 1935, on account of the deterioration in the jute industry in Bengal.   The number of looms in  the jute mills is far in excess of the re- quirements of the industry, and if  the mills work their full complement of
 hours,  production  must be  far in excess  of  demand.   This has  been the  position  for  some  years  and   although  temporary  relief   has been afforded  by  agreements  between  the mills  to  curtail  working hours, a   recent  attempt  to  promote  such an agreement  for all  the jute Mills in Indiafailed.   The Indian Jute Mills Association endeavoured by altering therr Articles of Association to  bring within  its fold  all the existing mills in Bengal, but three per cent, of the mills resisted all efforts to secure  their adherence and  the negotiations  broke down.   Some mills have closed down, but a number have continued to work and to meet the losses incurred.     The Bengal Ministry decided that the time.had come to make an effort to stabilise the industry in order to secure for the agriculturists a higher price for raw  jute before most of the year&apos;s  crop had passed out of their hands.   They  also felt that such  stabilization would affect the mills them- selves favourably and stop the inevitable dislocation, of work which would follow unrestrained- over-production. As the matter could not  wait for a session of the Legislature they decided to advise the Governor to issue an Ordinance.     The  Ordinance  was  issued on September the  9th;  it permits the Provincial Government to fix the times during which every jute mill  may be worked and to fix different times  for different jute mills,  if  it is desirable; and it also makes it compulsory  for the occupier of each mill to give in- f or mat ion as to the number of looms existing  in the mill and prohibits him from increasing the number of looms or replacing any existing loom in any&apos; mill.     The terms of the Ordinance do not greatly differ from proposals which were made to,  and rejected by, the Government of India in 1935, while the matter lay within its legislative  authority.   But the Bengal Government were impressed: with the need for urgent action to prevent a disastrous crash in the industry. .     The Ordinance had a mixed reception.  The Nationalist press asserted - that it was the price which the Ministry had  to  pay  for the support of the Europeans in the Assembly and that it would c&apos;b no good  in any  case to the producer of raw jute: but the bulk of opinion in the jute trade seems to have welcomed the Ordinance, as the best  way out of a situation which was rapidly deteriorating.     The proposal to issue the  Ordinance  leaked   out,   and one of  the Ministry&apos;s political supporters used the information  to buy  largely  with  a view to making a profit when the market went up.  (c) Relations  with Governors: social  contacts: special responsibilities.     32, The events in Assam have not in fact led  to the Governor&apos;s interven-tion for the purpose of summoning a  meeting of the Assembly (see para. 25).The Speaker suggested that the Governor might prorogue  and resummonthe Legislature, but the Governor declined to adopt this  method of savinghim from the dilemma which he had made for himself.    As  regards social contacts  in these  four  Provinces, there  is nothingnew to be reported.  (d) Relations  of Ministers with  their Secretariats: methods of business.    33:  In Assam a proposal was made in August by the Minister  for LocalSelf-Government which revealed dissatisfaction  among the Ministers withthe relations between them and  administrative  officers.    Certain  officersexercise delegated powers in   respect of appointments  and  transfers  of subordinate officers, and the Minister proposed that all these powers shouldbe resumed as  they were inconvenient to  the Ministry.  The proposal was supported by all the Cabinet except   the  Premier;  it was  disclosed that ministers were convinced that administrative officers  paid no attention to
their wishes, and Ministers alleged that in some cases officers had  &quot;acted in a manner which tends to stultify the Government policy&quot;.   The Governorexplained the dangers of the proposal and no more has been heard of it.    In Bengal there have  been  instances of  interference by Ministers indepartmental  administration.    Commissioners&apos;  orders   transferring sub-ordinate  officers have been set aside : members of the Legislature are believed to- have been responsible for  the transfer of officers whom  they  personallydisliked.  Officers are thus encouraged to approach Ministers  and politLcians.  Ministers have occasionally requested district  officers  to alter  theirnominations to local boards in  favour of Ministerial supporters.   while some officers keenly resent this interference others treat it as a petty annoy-ance such as must be expected. *    No incidents have been reported from the Punjab  or Bind.  ,  It may be surmised that in Bengal and  Assam  the difficulties arise, atany rate in part, from the insecurity of the Ministries, which causes unduecompliance with the demands of supporters and weakness in executive action.      IV.-CHIEF  COMMISSIONERS&apos;  PROVINCES.     34.  Ajmer-Merwara. Agitation by Congress in the istimrari areas (see para. 42 of the last Survey)  appears  to   have  subsided,  and Congressactivities in other  directions have  been  hampered by dissension.    In thisProvince the Palestine  agitation  has  been conducted  with vigour : andspeakers have  asserted that the allegations against  the British  government must be  true as otherwise they would have been contradicted.     35.  Coorg. Some interest  centres round the future administration of this little Province, and local opinion appears to vary widely. . Some leading- politicians wrote to the Congress President in September urging the amal- gamation of Coorg with Mysore,  and asking him not to intervene  in their local politics.  On the  other hand the local   Congress  Committee sent a deputation to Delhi  about the  same time to  urge  an  amendment  of the Haripura  resolution  (which favoured  amalgamation with the Karnatak, i.e.,  Canarese-speaking, area of the Bombay Province)  so that Coorg * may remain  separate and independent.    The  Coorg Landholders&apos;  Association passed  a resolution to the same effect.  The financial condition of  the Pre- vince has recently  been scrutinised by an officer of the Government of  India, whose report is under consideration.      36. Delhi. Communal tension has been chronic throughout the  quarter :  the disturbances are described in  para.  87.   The Provincial Congress con-  tinued  their  outcry against the repressive policy of the administration,  but  an appeal to the Working Committee  to  give its  blessing to a civil dis-  obedience movement  only drew a, reply to  the effect that the local  leaders  must shoulder their own responsibility; if they decided that civil disobedience  was essential after trying all  other methods, then the Working Committee  would  give  its moral  support.   The All-India Congress  Committee  and  Working  Committee members  who assembled at Delhi in September  showed  no inclination to meddle in the politics of the Province.   .      Delhi is the  centre of propaganda of  a virulent kind, disseminated in  the adjoining Provinces of the Punjab and the IT.  P., on  Palestine affairs.       The  monsoon throughout  the Province has been a  failure and  distress  in the rural areas is inevitable.  The local Congress organisation is in no  position to give any help bv way of relief, but shows a disposition to make  all possible capital out of the situation by..encouraging exorbitant demands  for  relief from Government  and  the  use  of the  Congress  channel  for the  presentation of such demands.       There is nothing of interest to report about the Andaman  Islands or   Panth Pifloda.
                                    is                  V.-GEN ERAL  SUBJECTS. (a)  Treatment of the Services: Service feeling: Services&apos; pay and allowances.     37.  Something has been said in Chapter III  above about the inter- ference of the Bengal Ministry in  appointments  and  postings.    Hindu officers in particular are said to be  apprehensive of, unfair treatment, and the  Assembly resolution which recommended a proportion of only 20 per cent, recruitment of caste Hindus to the services is symptomatic of  a com- munal spirit which may prove detrimental to the contentment and efficiency of the Services.     Possible methods of checking corruption in the . public  services were discussed at a conference in the Punjab in August.   The Governor presided, and the Ministers, heads of departments and   Secretaries to  Government were present.  It was agreed that nothing was to be gained by the appoint- ment of any committee of the legislature or of  officials to consider the subject: that the establishment of an &quot;anti-corruption&quot; staff on the United Provinces  model would be a mistake as  weakening the   responsibility  of departmental officers : that a central staff for the investigation of  aliega- tions of corruption would be useful, but this should be purely an investi- gating agency  to which local officers  and heads of departments  cculd apply for assistance: that the power of the Government (at present applying only to non-gazetted staff) to retire  certain classes of officials on the completion of 25 years&apos; service without assigning reasons should be extended : and that the periodical confidential reports on officials should be prepared with more care, and with particular reference to^reputation for integrity.     In  Sind an  incident, trivial in itself, derived  importance from the offence taken by  the Ministers  and the publicity given to it in local news- papers.   Ministers  arrived late  to  attend  the annual   Police sports  at Karachi,  and by a mistake were shewn  into seats other  than those  in the front row  which had been reserved  for  them.  Two of the Ministers left in great indignation,  and on this and other counts made a severe attack on the Inspector General of Police.  Fortunately a complete reconciliation was effected on the Inspector General writing to express regret for the occurrence : the officer responsible for the error was reprimanded.     38. In the Congress Provinces conditions call for rather more remarks. In Bombay a recent estimate of feeling in the I.C.S. shows that among senior members there is no serious  concern as  to  their  own   treatment  by the present Ministry, but much concern and speculation as to  the future  of the Secretary of State&apos;s  Services.   Some express the view that recruitment on an. all-India basis  is no longer  suitable :  it imposes on the officer a divided loyalty and gives Ministers a  grievance  in  that they  have not complete control over their  officers  and  cannot command  their complete allegiance. The  new British recruits are content and unperturbed.  British officers of the middle stage of service are concerned about the cuts in allowances.   Sub- ordinate revenue and police officials are nervous of victimisation  by the baser sort of Congress leaders, and  are  losing their initiative.  . In this Province, as elsewhere, there is  a tendency  for Ministers to assert their authority by issuing themselves orders of a disciplinary nature instead of bringing complaints to the notice of the head of the department for enquiry.    In the Central Provinces  Shukla, the new Premier,  has shewn signsof increasing suspicion of  the police.  He gave instructions that he should be consulted about  all transfers to  or  from the C.I.D.    Difficulties are threatened  in  obtaining for the Central  Intelligence  Officer subordinates (to be deputed from the provincial  police service) who arejikely to be suitablefor the work :  the  organisation^ is distrusted by the Ministry for reasons indicated in para.  50(c) of the  last Survey.  Subordinate  police ranks are said to feel that their officers, have lost power and are disinclined to protect them: the  particular grievance which&apos;,has encouraged this feeling,  is the. reduction of the &quot;dear districts&quot; allowance mentioned in para. 66 of SurveyNo. 3.   The Premier mooted; but has not.pursued, a proposal to clothe the  ..JS1(S)HD                     -  - &apos;  &apos; &quot;..                      &apos;  .7&apos;&quot;  &apos;
 traffic police in one city in white khadi and caps similar in design to the &quot;Gandhi&quot; caps worn by Congressmen.      Nothing more has been heard about the Eilaspur Election Enquiry.  It is due to be revived shortly unless it is abandoned.      Relations between Ministers and  the  Services in Madras  are  satis- factory.    The Premier retains his regard  for  the special uses of British- officials: he insisted that a British official  should be posted to  a district where demoralization  had been  caused by   the  murder  of a subordinate magistrate, because &quot;a British officer will not be afraid&quot;.   When presiding over a police function in October, he  expressed a very high opinion of the. work being done by the police force as a whole.   He is said to have rejected a suggestion made at a meeting of the  Congress party of the legislature that committees composed of members of the legislature and others should enquire into allegations of corruption  among   Government  servants :  the Premier preferred to rely on departmental enquiries.      In  the United Provinces the Ministry appreciated the work of district officers during the floods  in  the  monsoon.   They decided that  all  relief operations should be placed under  the control  of district officers (instead of Congress  workers),  and  the  Minister   for Public  Works wrote an enthusiastic note about the services rendered by officials.      Among the lower  ranks of the police  there are signs of discontent. In September these in  Cawnpore decided  to observe a day  of fasting and prayer to express sympathy with &quot;policemen who were being oppressed&quot;   apparently a reference to some policemen in trouble on charges of commit- ting excesses in a village.   A few men fasted on September 8th, and another fast was  advertised for the 17th,  when about  half the men did  not  take their food.  Early in October  some police constables at Jhansi also fasted, as a protest against the behaviour of an Inspector.  These incidents are. trivial in themselves, and have not affected the performance of pulice duties : but  they  cannot  be ignored where  there  undoubtedly exist circumstances favourable to disaffection.   The Governor has  recently  taken the oppor- tunity to discuss fully with the Premier and the Inspector-General of Police the state of feeling in  the service and  the remedies for any defects and dis- contents.   The Inspector-General while not  seriously disturbed at present, felt  that there were possibilities of deterioration if the men came to look elsewhere than to their own officers  for the protection of their  interests and  for rewards and punishments : he mentioned as unsettling circumstances the large  volume  of complaints made direct  to Government; the number of questions  asked in the Assembly about promotions and the cases of indi- yidual officers; transfers ordered from headquarters  over the heads,  or. against the advice, of local officers; and the activities of the Anti-Corrup- tion officer working directly under Government.  The  Premiers attitude was on  the whole.less  suspicious than it was a year ago:  he quoted to the Governor   the  decision  of  the  Congress Working  Committee  con- demning  interference  with  the  administration,  and  professed  a genuine desire to  win the confidence and support of the police, without which he. could not succeed  in his general task:  he was confident  of the co-operation of the Inspector-General and could trust many of the subordinate officers  : the volume of complaints reaching the Government was much less than in earlier days: the  interference of Government was necessitated by the con- duct of those officers who still were inclined to oppose and obstruct the policy of Government, and on the whole he  found the attitude of police officers towards the administration less  satisfactory than that of I. C.  S. officers. As regards, the functions of the Anti-Corruption officer, he claimed that when directed to  make a confidential investigation the  officer always kept in touch with the head of the department:  but  he admitted that  the  head of the department was not consulted before it was decided that an investiga- tion should be held.  The Premier has undertaken to consider whether this should not be done in  future.- The conversion of the Premier to a greater
 trust in the police may take time: but there are signs that he appreciates the importance of securing the confidence and contentment of the force and the ill effect of.some of the  action taken  by the Government in the past.     39. Separation of judicial and  executive functions. The   officer  in- structed see  para. 53 (ii) of  the last Survey to examine the proposals in the United Provinces produced his report early in September.  He pointed out that conditions are abnormal owing  to various circumstances including the dislocation of work caused by the removal of the old honorary magistrates and new appointments, and that  it was impossible to estimate requirements until the position returned to normal.  He raised other important questions which will require careful consideration, and it is hoped that ultimately the Cabinet will agree to try the scheme as an experiment in  certain districts only.   In Bihar also a  committee has  recommended that  an experimental scheme for the separation of functions should be tried in a few localities.     40. Abolition of posts. The Bihar Retrenchment  Committee  which produced its recommendations in August suggested among other things that all recruitment to the  Secretary of State&apos;s  services should be  stopped. Among the proposals of the Central Provinces Economy Committee is the abolition  of  one post of Deputy Inspector-General  of Police out of three and the abolition of Divisional Commissioners.  The Bombay Government have submitted a memorandum similar  to  that sent from Madras, asking for the abolition of the civil branch of the Indian Medical Service.     41. Honours  and Titles. Mention  has been made in previous Surveys of resolutions passed by Legislatures in Congress Provinces recommending that awards of  honours  and titles should cease, and  in particular of the re-. solution which  was to be moved in the  Bombay Council (para. 48 of  the last Survey).   This went a  good deal further than the rest: it amounted to a threat to Government servants who accept titles and thus  sought to compel servants of the Crown not to respect or recognise a prerogative of the Crown. In September the member concerned withdrew the resolution for the session and intimated that he proposed to move  it at the next session.     42. Pay and allowances. The Bihar  Retrenchment Committee&apos;s re- commendations, made in August,  were sweeping;  some  of them are  not within the power of the Provincial  Government to implement and have pro- paganda value only.  They suggested  the  reduction of the salaries of the Governor and High Court Judges, the stoppage of recruitment to the Secre- tary of State&apos;s services, the creation of a new and  cheaper  Public Services Commission to be appointed by the Provincial Government, new  scales of pay for the services, and the abolition of special pay with a few exceptions. It was also suggested that the new rates of pay should not be applied to any but new entrants, unless Government are unable to balance their budget, in which case the pay of all Government servants should  be subjected to a graduated percentage  cut.  The abolition of special pay  of  members of the  services  appointed before April  1st  1937, requires the acceptance of the  Governor in his individual  judgment.  Consideration of the  recom- mendations does not appear to have advanced.      The Bombay Government decided to reduce the compensatory allowance paid to cover the high cost of living in  Bombay city; the Governor accepted the proposal, which in  fact has  a precedent in orders issued by the Central  Government as regards its officers in the city.  The  reduction ranges  from nothing  in the case of  officers earning less than Rs. 150 up to 40 per  cent. for those earning Rs. 1,500  or more.   The total saving will be Rs.  35,000 per annum.      The Central Provinces Economy Committee submitted their final report early in August.   The immediate  savings proposed amount to 14 lakhs of.  rupees, and if the recommendations are implemented in full  in course of  time the savings are expected to be about 44 lakhs.    The  Committee recommended-  mended considerable reductions in rates of travelling allowance of all offi-  cers, including Ministers and High Court Judges, and a reduction of special
                                  1(5pay; they urged that Government should take up  the question of revising the pay-scales of the I. C S. and the Police.   Tney propose a reduction inthe pay of police constables and the abolition of police  sergeants; also theabolition of the posts mentioned in para. 40 above:  The discontent caused in the lower ranks of the police by the abolition of the &quot;dear district&quot; (allow-ance was mentioned in para. 66 of Survey  No. .3-rsee also para. 38 above.On a representation of the I. G. of Police a mitigation of these orders is nowunder consideration.    The Orissa Government have accepted  most  of the Retrenchment Com-mittee&apos;s proposals for reducing pay.   The lower  ranks have  been treatedfairly well,  but the maximum  pay has  been put  low, e.g., Sub-Judges and deputy Collectors cannot rise above Rs. 600 a month.    The spread of the attack  on  travelling allowance was  mentioned&apos;  in para. 55 of the last  Survey, with particular reference  to the proposal toreduce to the second grade the travelling allowance of junior officers of theImperial Services.  This proposal is still under  discussion with the Secre-tary of State, whose inclination, after considering the views of all governors and the Governor-General, is to make  a rule under section 247  (1) (b)  ofthe Government of  India Act,  1935, to the effect that after a certain dateno.rule which  alters  to an officer&apos;s disadvantage  the travelling  allowancerules in force on that date shall, without the consent  of  the  Secretary  ofState, apply to persons appointed  by him or by the Secretary of State  inCouncil.   Any question as to whether an alteration of the rules is or is notto an officer&apos;s disadvantage would, in  the  case  of officers serving in  Pro-vinces, be determined by  the Governor  exercising his individual judgment.    In  addition to the  various proposals described in  para.  55 of  thelast Survey, the Madras  Government in August  put forward a scheme for reducing travelling and  other allowances, whereby all officers  now entitledto travel by 1st class on railways should be  allowed 2nd   class fare only;and if they insist on travelling by 1st  class they may claim  from Govern-ment half the difference between the fares.  At the same time departments were asked to remark on the proposal  that only officers drawing a pay ofRs. 750 or over should be entitled  to 1st class fare.    In no Province has there  yet  appeared  any tendency to press for  anearly decision on these proposals.    The Madras Ministry have decided to deprive medical  officers under their control of the privilege of engaging in  private practice; at the Gov-ernor&apos;s instance they agreed to  give these doctors  a  year&apos;s notice to accustomthemselves to the new conditions,  and also  to make an exception in favourof consulting practice.(b) Interference with the administration: signs  of parallel administration                            in the districts.    43. During the quarter under survey there have been very few recordedinstances of direct interference with the administration, and no fresh signsof attempts to set up parallel administrations.  The Premier of the united provinces told  the  Governor that the high Congress authorities  were con-vinced of the undesirability of individual Congressmen or committees trying to interfere with official administration.   Proof of this  is afforded by aresolution framed by the Working Committee  at Delhi in September; unfor-unfortunately the All-India, Committee were  too preoccupied to consider it.  Theresolution ran as follows: :     . &quot;It has come, to the notice of the Congress that Congress Committees             interfere with the  ordinary  administration  .....   ..   by             seeking to influence officers and other  members of the services.             The Congress advises Congressmen not to interfere with the             new course of administration.  This however does  not  mean             that they  are not to render assistance to members of the ser-             vices if  they are requested thereto by the latter.&quot;
    Although this resolution never obtained the endorsement of the mainCongress Committee, it was given publicity in the press as a pronouncementof the Working Committee.    44. Rural Development Schemes. There is nothing further to  report about the United Provinces or Bihar schemes.    45. Local Self-Government Reform. A Committee   (apparently  thethird of its kind) appointed to examine the system in the United Provincescompleted its interim report in the middle of September.   The report dealsonly with the smaller local bodies and does not contain any recommendations for Municipalities or District Boards:  these are to come later.  The recom-mendatiens appear to contain  no objectionable features.    46. The Volunteer Movement. The vague ideas behind this movement,and sporadic attempts  to develop it, were mentioned in para. .6.6 of the lastSurvey.  An endeavour is  being ma.de to collect all information available of definite  activities in the various Provinces, aud this will  be summarised in a subsequent Survey.    Among the bodies  which aim at recruitment of volunteers must now be reckoned the Muslim League,  which at the end of July appointed a sub-committee to report on a scheme for the formation of a &quot;National Guard&quot;.The &quot;Guard&quot; would consist of an active  corps  and a reservist corps withJinnah as the Field Marshal, and a Chief Commandant and Provinical Com-commandants responsible to him.   The &quot;Guard&quot; would have its own flag and special uniform.  A meeting of Muslims  in Meerut in August urged theformation of the &quot;Guard&quot; in order to oppose  Congress and Hindus gen-era lly; -it was indicated that the &quot;Guard&quot;  -would  not necessarily be non-violent if circumstances demanded otherwise.    Meanwhile Gandhi pursues his cult of non-violence: and the intensivestudy of the  &quot;Red Shirts&quot; in the Frontier  Province, on which he is -now engaged, has its motive in -the hope  of  organising  what  has been disr-respectfully called a  &quot;Salvation. Army&quot;.  Gandhi sorrowfully admits thatthe &quot;Red Shirts&quot; do not satisfy the ideal; but his research continues.                     (c) Parliamentary Secretaries.    47. The Premier of the North-West Frontier Province  appointed fourParliamentary Secretaries  in September,  one  for each Minister.   He is however determined to  keep them in the background and has re-affirmed theprinciples stated in para. 61 of the last  Survey-that they shall have no executive duties nor responsibilities, nor be allowed to see official files.    Elsewhere it seems that Parliamentary  Secretaries  are  being allowedwider scope.   It is understood that-the United Provinces Government madea decision  on the lines of  the draft order described in  the last Survey-(para. 61).   When acting in  a sphere entrusted to  them by a Minister,Parliamentary  Secretaries  will pass orders  in  the  name of the  minister himself  &quot;thereby fulfilling the technical requirements of  the  law which require that a Minister shall tender advice  to the  Governor.&quot;-   There areno recorded instances of any abuse of these powers so far.    In Bihar the Premier was so overwhelmed  with other  preoccupationsthat he left much of his administrative work to his Parliamentary Secre-tary,  a somewhat forward person who went well  beyond  his legitimatefunctions.  Among other things he tried to interfere  in the postings ofI.C.S. and Police officers.   The Premier did little  more than initial his recommendations.(d) Attitude of  Ministries  to law and  order: reporting of speeches: repres-                  sive legislation and restrictions,  etc.    48. There is nothing fresh to -report about the policy of the non-CongressGovernments of the  Punjab and  Sind.   The  new Congress   Premier ofAssam has announced his intention of releasing the few &quot;political&quot; prisonersstill in jail in that Province.   2B1(S) HI*
    49. The Bengal Government&apos;s  policy regarding the release of detenusand terrorist prisoners  is discussed in para. 63.   This Ministry has made an  important decision to abandon  one  of  its weapons  against unconstitu-tional agitation.   The Bengal Public Security Act  was passed in 1932 togive powers to deal effectively with civil disobedience, including organisedrefusal to pay  taxes and rent.   Unless renewed it is due to expire at theend of 1938.   The Ministry were  at first in favour of extending it, but their confidence was shaken by the events of August in the Legislature, andthey then decided to let it lapse rather than incur the odium of introducing legislation to continue it.  (In Bombay a similar  Act has been repealed see  para. 77 of Survey No. 3).   The expiry of the Act will not in fact leave a serious hiatus: Bengal has ample  powers in other enactments to deal  withterrorist  and violent  movements, and certain powers  still remain to  dealwith movements professing to be non-violent.  It is doubtful whether theGovernment would be willing to use the provisions of the  Act to suppressa &quot;no-rent&quot; campaign.   Bengal will be left no worse off than most of theother Provinces after  the Act expires.    50. Congress  Ministers have shown themselves increasingly  ready to employ the methods   of the  bureaucracy  for  suppressing  violence and disorder : and the  resolution on &quot;civil liberties&quot; passed at the Delhi session(see para. 18) has  strengthened their hands.    51. Bihar. The  details of the Ministry&apos;s suggestions for controlling the communal situation are given in para. 83. - They represent an advance on anything that this Ministry have agreed to before in the sphere of lawand order.   It should,  however, be remembered that these measures  wereto be directed against  Muslims chiefly.   In the agrarian sphere the Premiershowed reluctance  to shoulder the responsibility for any active measures.    52. Bombay. The  Home Minister has again made use of  the Press(Emergency Powers) Act to demand security  from   the  editor  of a  localvernacular  paper  which was publishing  scurrilous statements  about  pro-minent personages including the Minister himself.    53. Central Provinces. The tone of the press so deteriorated after the dismissal of Dr. Khare by the Working Committee that the  Governmentissued  a  communique  to the effect that while they  were anxious fully touphold the liberty of  the press they would not tolerate  license which fell within the mischief of the law.  Shortly afterwards  they passed ordersdemanding,  under the Press (Emergency Powers) Act, security of Us. 2,000each from the publisher and the press  of  a  local  newspaper which hadpublished particularly scurrilous abuse of Gandhi.    54. Madras. The Premier&apos;s attitude to the Criminal Law amendment act has  been described-(para.  20).  It will be remembered that his useof the section of the law punishing sedition not long after Congress acceptedoffice in  1937 produced a heated   controversy.    During October 1938  heordered the  arrest of  the editor and publisher of  a Tamil  newspaper forthe offence  of sedition and  stirring up  communal  hatred (see &apos;para. 20).This action  has attracted little public criticism.  He also intends to prose-cute an  extremist agitator  who  publicly  advocated  the murder of theViceroy and the Governor.   He has made  use of  the Press (emergency powers)  Act also  on  two occasions.   The attitude of the Ministry to  com-communism is described in  para. 72.    55. North-West Frontier Province. The Governors refusal  of assent to a non-official Bill repealing section 124A of the Indian  Penal Code andother provisions of law  was  mentioned in para. 69 of the last Survey.  ThePremier  privately took the  mover of the Bill to task for  proceeding  withthe Bill  after  promising to withdraw it.    The mover then severed hisconnection with the Congress party, and published astatement accusing thePremier  of  being  an  accessory to the machinery of  Government instead ofa wrecker of the  Constitution.  There has been no other excitement  overthe Governors refusal of assent.
     This is yet another Ministry that has  used  the  Press  (emergency powers) Act.   Security was demanded  from  two  vernacular papers  forpublishing objectionable articles,  one accusing Government of apathy inregard to a case in which Hindu girls were kidnapped, and another speakingof the oppression practised by British Imperialism.     The tone of public speeches has not improved;  Congress and muslim league speakers compete in  satisfying the public appetite for anti-Britishutterances.   Abdul  Ghaffar,  the Premiers brother, made an objectionablespeech in August accusing the British   of  engineering  the  Bannu raid(mentioned in para.  84); the Premier was naturally reluctant to prosecute.     Agrarian  agitation caused  considerable  trouble  during August and september (see para. 64); The Premier took firm measures to suppress itand vigorously defended himself against his critics.     56. Orissa. The Ministry after long hesitation agreed to give policeassistance to a leading landowner for making distraints for arrears of rent.On the  other hand,  they have shewn great reluctance to take effective stepsto prevent agitation within  the Province designed to cause trouble  in  the adjoining States: and the serious disturbances that have occurred  in  theStates are attributed in  part to the freedom enjoyed  by agitators withinthe borders of  Orissa.     57. United Provinces. In para. 70 of the last Survey it was men-tioned that  this  Government contemplated issuing instructions to District&quot;Magistrates to cancel arms licenses if they considered this step necessary tocontrol  agrarian disorder.   Agrarian  disturbances, have not been  many,and the orders were never issued:  but the Premier stated in the assembly that the Government entirely approved of the action taken in this directionby  district officers.   A warning notice  was  served on  the  manager of avernacular newspaper which had been publishing objectionable Communistarticles.        -i     Communal strife, not only  between  Hindus and  Muslims  but alsobetween the two sects of Muslims at Lucknow, continues to cause the Premieranxiety, and he has often considered  taking   vigorous  steps to suppressagitation.  He is deterred by  fear of provoking still more violent attacksfrom the Muslim League : and, if he once took such steps against Muslims,he could hardly refuse to prosecute the left-wing Congressmen who  makeconstant attacks on the police or on the British connection.   To such  action he still shows great reluctance.                                       1 &apos;\.     58. Reporting of speeches. The Bombay  Government in October had.instructions issued that police reporters  should not without specific permis-sioh attend meetings at which a Minister is present.   The United ProvincesGovernment in August  issued  orders to the effect that speeches likely toincite people to violence or  to  promote  communal  animosity should be reported,  and speeches made  in  connection with  the  agrarian  situationwhether at meetings organised by zamindars or by kisans  should also be reported whenever the District Magistrate considered it necessary.     59. Honorary Magistrates.-The new system of  appointing  HonoraryMagistrates in the United Provinces is said to be working satisfactorily.Attempts  have been made to  secure retired officers for some of the posts and senior lawyers have in many cases been selected.     60. Tear Gas. The course of  training for  police  officers from  theProvinces in the use of tear  gas is to be held in the  Punjab in the spring of 1939.  It is not yet known  how many of the Provinces propose to sendofficers for training; Bengal  will take advantage of the course but Assam,the Central Provinces, Madras, the North-West Frontier Province, and  theUnited Provinces will not. The Madras Government  previously refused  theoffer (see. para. 83 of Survey No. 3), but it was thought that the enquiry into the Chirala riots had caused them  to change their mind.  There is apossibility that a party  from this Province will attend  any future coursesthat may be held.                           i
                                  20    61. Remission of Sentences.-^Apart from the  powers enjoyed by theGovernor-General in his discretion  in  regard to  death  sentences  undersection 295 of the Government of  India  Act,  1935,  statutory power to suspend, remit or commute sentences imposed by   criminal courts is nowvested solely in Provincial  Governments under section 401 Cr.  Pro. Code.The exercise of this power bas provided instances not only provocative ofpublic criticism but also liable fo engender conflict  with High  Courts.  Itwill be remembered that a  Minister in  the Central Provinces (Sharif) fellfrom office on account of a flagrant abuse of this power, and that in anotherinstance the Bombay Ministry incurred criticism.   The Press has recentlyventilated another case of remission in the Central Provinces: a Hindu wassentenced to death for poisoning a Muhammadan girl, and the sentence was confirmed by the High Court.  The Law Minister (Mehta) decided to remitthe sentence unconditionally on the ground that the evidence was inconclu-sive.  The Government,  including the  Governor,   were of opinion thatthere  had been a miscarriage of justice, but the legal advice given to theGovernment suggested .(in order to avoid the appearance of differing fromthe High Court on the merits of the evidence) that the Governor-general should be  moved to grant a free pardon.  Mehta deliberately  released tothe Press  an announcement that the  prisoner  was  being immediately re-leased and as mentioned above (para. 24)  allowed matter from the officialfiles to be  published.   He  received  the support of his colleagues,  and as no  special responsibility of the Governor  was affected--a formal orderof remission was recorded  and issued.   The case had attracted the more attention from its communal circumstances :  and  it  is possible  that theexercise of clemency will for that reason  be  exploited  for  purposes of controversy.    In Madras it appears that a storm  is brewing between the Governmentand the High Court through exercise by  the former of clemency in a manner which the Chief Justice considers reprehensible: but  details are at present.lacking.    One order passed by the Madras Government has however come to notice and deserves detailed mention as it has raised a constitutional point of some importance.   In November 1936 two well-to-do Brahmans were arrestednear  the Karikal (French) frontier in   possession of 96 watches and 25yards of silk which they had smuggled from Karikal: they were prosecutedand sentenced to imprisonment for three months and two months respectively.The appellate court set aside the conviction on a technical ground : the HighCourt on appeal against the acquittal restored the  original sentence.  TheMadras Government in an order passed under section 401  Cr. Pro. Codein Ap3f.il 1938 suspended the execution of the sentence.  The  Governmentof India,  without contesting the.legality of  the order, pointed out to theMadras Government that, unless the Central Government is consulted before a Provincial  Government exercises its powers where  the  offence is against an  enactment  in the Central field, there is a  danger that the point of viewof the Centre  may be overlooked, with consequent serious injury to Centralinterests.   The letter asked the Madras Government  to agree to a conven-tion whereby the Central  Government  would be  consulted in such casesbefore the exercise of  powers under section 401.  Meanwhile,  the MadrasGovernment issued another  order remitting the  sentence of   3 months7imprisonment on one  of  the accused as he had paid Rs.  2,000 as requiredby the Madras Government: since the other accused would not agree to paythe amount of Rs. &quot;1,000  demanded by the Government the order suspending the sentence  of imprisonment was  cancelled.  The Madras Government&apos;reply to the Government of India explained  the action taken as due to thefeeling that the sentence^of imprisonment was too light; the  government considered the money penalties to be a  more effective deterrent:  thus their action had really been in the interest of the Central  Government: they saw no necessity for the establishment  of the suggested convention, as  theMadras Government should be trusted both to maintain law and order andto  protect the interests  of the Central  Government.
...............,........      The arguments used by the Madras Government as to the circumstances  of the particular case appeared untenable:  for well-tg-do Erahmans  im-  prisonment is a severer penalty than fine, and  a request of these persons  to be allowed to compound the case had in fact been refused by the Customs  Department.   Also consultation with the Customs Department (the prose-  cutmg&apos;authority) before the exercise of powers under section 401  appears  to be  a course which might reasonably be expected to be  followed as  the  normal procedure.  However it was felt that no further discussion of  the  matter with the Provincial Government would be profitable,      By way of contrast it may be mentioned that  in the North-West Frontier  Province the Governor recently had occasion to scrutinise the Ministry&apos;;? exer-  cise of its power in  death sentences :  he found  that it had been exercised  in only two cases out of 54, and then only with  good justification.      62.  Police Conferences-It has been the practice  to hold at  the head-  quarters of the  Central Government biennial  conferences of  Inspectors-  General of Police.  The first such conference  after the  introduction of pro-  vincial autonomy was due this cold weather: and the consent of all Provin-  cial  Governments had  been  obtained  to their officers  attending it.  The  Madras Premier became aware of the fact only when he was&apos; about to attend  the. Congress meetings in Delhi in September, and for re&amp;SpiiS which have  not been clearly defined expressed his disapproval.  At Delhi he  discussed  the matter with the Premiers of other Congress  Provinces,  arid as&apos; a. result  most of the Congress  Provinces have withdrawn their agreement to paVtioi--  pate in the conference.   It has therefore been decided to abandon it.  The  objections of the Congress Ministers may be surmised to be due to distrust  of the  consequences of the. heads of police of all Provinces conferring out of  hearing of their  own Governments,  and of a comparison of  conditions  in  Congress and  non-Congress Provinces : the participation of  the   Central Intelligence Bureau in such discussions may also have been considered un- desirable as also the appearance of contact, between the Central Govern- ment itself and officers of the Provinces.  However, it so happened that the Bombay Home Minister had in the meanwhile approached the Home Member of the Government of India with the suggestion that the latter should sum- mon  a  conference of  Home Ministers :  the suggestion  was cautiously en- couraged, and the letters from some Provinces intimating withdrawal; from the Police Conference indicate approval of a conference of Home Ministers as an alternative,   If, as appears likely,, this proposal matures, it  should prove of great value both to the Centre and to Provinces : the more so if, as has also been suggested, Inspectors-General  of  Police  come in attendance on their Ministers and  are  available&apos; to&apos; discuss  among- themselves details of insufficient importance to engage the attention of&apos; the members of govern - ments.                  (e) &quot;Political&apos;&apos; prisoners and deteimsi                 j    63.  The only Province in which  attention has been  drawn to this pro- blem is Bengal,  In accordance with the policy, of accelerated  release men- tioned in paragraph 75 of the last Survey,  the Home Minister&apos;was^ able  to announce on August 25th that all State prisoners and  detenu^ had. been set free.  His  statement was received without enthusiasm by the&apos; Congress party, who regard the release of the terrorist convicts as the vital  question.    The course of the&apos; discussions between  Nazimuddin- and1  Guridhr and; Subhas  Bose on that question was described in  paragraph  75- of the last Survey   Further discussions and correspondence  led  nowhere:   (irttndhi stuck to the position that some final date should be fixed for- the rfele&apos;ase^of all the prisoners, and-this the Bengal Government would not&apos;accept-.  The Government were not prepared to go beyond early release of prisoners who are in ill-health or, having been sentenced for crimes not involving.murderor serious violence, have only short terms still to serve, and the reference of the remaining cases to an advisory committee.   Towards the end of Sep-tember  the negotiations  finally  broke down.   The  Government  published   251(S)  HD]
 a communique setting forth, the details of their scheme,  and at the end of September,  a number of  sick  prisoners were released.   On October  5th Gandhi published his comments.  He maintained that &quot;however reprehen- sive the crimes committed by the prisoners were, there can be no doubt that the crimes were not the result of personal or selfish motive; the motive behind them was purely political&quot;.  His second argument was that the transfer of power to a popular legislature cuts the ground from under the feet of advocates- cates of terrorism, and  what Congress Provinces have done Bengal  could also do; and his third, that the terrorist parties no longer function for their original  purpose, and the prisoners have given, assurances of non-violence. He therefore appealed on these grounds to the Bengal Government to release all prisoners by April 13th, 1939 this date being one year after that of his original proposal.  He advised the prisoners &quot;to  treat April 13th or thereabouts  as still the last date of their discharge,&quot; and repeated that he could not rest until they were released.  In the meantime he appealed to the press and the public to refrain from criticising the Government, and acknowl- edged that credit was due to the Government for treating the problem as a non-party one.;     Gandhi&apos;s mention of April 13th next may or may not have special signi- significance.   It might be regarded as a veiled threat that he  will force a  crisis of some sort if he  does not get his way.   &quot;Political&quot;  prisoners,  especially those repatriated from the Andamans, have been his particular care : and his attitude on other subjects has given some ground for a surmise that he would seek an occasion before long to upset the political placidity of India.                       (f) The Agrarian Situation.     64. Bihar and the  United Provinces have been the  Provinces  where agrarian  discontent is most noticeable.  In Bihar  the situation has been eased by the passing of the legislation mentioned below.  The kisan  leader Swami Sahajanand is however  not  satisfied.   He  continued to tour  the Province, organising meetings and demonstrations; most of these were a failure.   He and his lieutenants habitually use language full of references to violence and bloodshed.  There were  several  riots in August.  Sahajanand appealed  for the observance throughout India of September 1st as &quot;Kisan Day&quot;, to  propagate the aim of establishing kisans in power  and abolishing landlordism by &quot;direct action&quot;.   But the Day was not  a success: and it is clear that there is no all-India movement among the peasants.     At the  end of October Sahajanand moved into the United Provinces, where conditions are already inflammable enough for his presence to be a danger.   Violence has ,been used in  that Province  by  both  parties to  the agrarian  dispute,  and many instances  of forcible dispossession of tenants were reported in August.  No  great improvement  can be looked for  till tenancy legislation is  passed.  Nevertheless, the collection of Government dues is satisfactory.     In the zamindari areas of Madras there have been attempts to organise action by  the tenants against the landowners, but this has been discouraged by the Ministry.     In the North-West Frontier Province there was serious trouble in one village (Galladher) where a Nawab has been attempting to evict his tenants.He obtained decrees  from  civil  courts for their ejectment,  but  whenever tenants were ejected  they  in their turn expelled the new occupants.   On August 30th about 200 tenants resisted the transfer of possession of a number of fields;  they refused to obey a magistrates  order to disperse,  and were arrested.  Women took a hand  in the disturbance,  and some were injured in a stampede of cattle.   This  incident was distorted  by agitators into abrutal lathi  charge by the police.   A  &quot;war council&quot;  was appointed to or?a- nise  agitation.  Security proceedings were taken against them and  thop^who  refused to give security were sent to jail.    Meetings of protest convened
on the Nawab&apos;s  land were  declared  unlawful assemblies.   The Govern-menfs vigorous suppressive action  aroused widespread criticism.   At  aconference of a Political Prisoners&apos; Release Society held in Delhi in Septem-ber a resolution was put forward to condemn it : Khan Sahib gave a spiriteddefence of his action and emphatically denied allegations of excesses by thepolice.  Eleven of the ring-leaders in the  agitation were sentenced  to twoyears&apos; imprisonment,  and 150 or so got 6  months each; the agitation was over  by the beginning of October.     The agitation at Amritsar in the Punjab, described in paragraph  85 ofthe last Survey, came to an end on  August  10th after the  Premier  had:visited the district.     65. Legislation. (See  paragraphs  87 to 95  of  the last Survey). Bengal. Both Houses of the Legislature accepted the two modifications ofthe Tenancy Amendment Bill suggested by the Governor, and the Bill  re-ceived the Governor&apos;s assent on August 16th.     66. Bihar. The Assembly  passed the Tenancy Amendment  Bill withslight  alterations on  August 3rd.  Both  Houses  passed the Restorationof Bakasht  Lands Bill early in  August.     The  main points of the Bihar  tenancy legislation  passed  under theCongress regime have been summarised by Rajendra  Prasad in  a lengthystatement issued on October 27th.   He claims that  it amounts to a substan-tial  fulfilment of the Congress Election Manifesto  of 1937.   The principaldetails of that programme were :        (1) Rents should be re-adjusted and reduced.       (2) Arrears of rent of previous years  should be abolished.I       (3) Arrears of rent should be recovered like civil debts and not by             ejectment.       (4) Debts should be reduced or liquidated.&apos;       (5) Agricultural income should be taxed.       (6) Tenants should be given  fixed tenure with  heritable rights.       (7) A living wage should be assured to agricultural labourers.     As regards the first  four items, the Bihar legislation provides for the following arrangements.   All enhancements in  rent  made  since 1911  are cancelled; the consequent reduction is believed to be  about 25  per  cent. Formerly damages up to 25 per cent, or interest at 12^ per cent, were realis- able on arrears of rent: damages have been abolished and the rate of interest has  been reduced by half.   The system of fixing  rent by appraisement of the  standing crop is abolished and a tenant who pays rent in kind is enabled to claim commutation into cash-rent as a matter of right.  Existing arrears of rent  have been reduced,  and land which had been sold  (&quot;bakasht&quot;) in execution of decrees  for arrears between 1929 1937 will be restored  to the original tenants if they pay half the amount for which the land was put up for  sale.   The power of the land-owners to  realise rents has been consider- ably curtailed : in fact he has now less rights than any other creditor for realising his dues : he can no longer get a  tenant arrested or imprisoned for default,  nor can he  have his moveable property sold  without his consent : the  entire holding of the tenant is not liable to be sold in execution of a decree unless he is declared by a competent court to be an habitual defaulter. In addition a Money-lenders&apos; Act has been passed which prevents an agri- culturisfs entire holding being  sold in execution of a money-lender&apos;s decree, and fixes a maximum rate of interest at 9 per cent, for secured and 12 per cent, for unsecured debts.     With regard to the fifth item an Act has been  passed by  which the income of  Zamindars is liable to taxation; it is  calculated to impose  an additional burden on land-owners of thirty or forty lakhs a year.     With regard to the sixth item, in Bihar any tenant who has cultivated land for 12 years becomes a settled tenant with a right of occupancy, and an
occupancy holding is heritable and transferable without payment of fee tothe landlord.   JJnder the  new legislation an occupancy tenant cannot beejected from his holding for non-payment of rent or  for any  other reasonexcept that he has rendered his land unfit for cultivation.  He  is also givenother rights in  connection with this land; the only right that the land-ownerretains is to get his rent from his occupancy tenant.     The seventh item has  not yet been tackled; enquiry is being made to,ascertain the prevailing rate of wages for different districts before prescrib-ing a minimum wage.     There are  other points in the Congress Election Manifesto of compara-tiyely small  importance but it appears that the Ministry&apos;s claim to have ful-filled most of their promises is justifiable. It should not be forgotten that thelegislation was the result of an agreement between the Government and thezamindars.     67. Bombay.--No progress.     6.8. Central  Provinces. The  Revision of Land  Revenues, of  EstatesBill  has not yet received  the assent  of the Governor-General.  A  brief account of the purpose of the Bill was given, in paragraph 93 of Survey No.3.  The land revenue payable on  certain estates has been enhanced on nofixed principles, the  legislation has an arbitrary character and the measureis a  departure  from the fixed principles of settlement.  It does not,  how-ever, appear to offend definitely against the purposes of section 299 of theAct.   It is  still  under the consideration of the Governor-General and theSecretary of State.   A Relief of Indebtedness Bill was referred to SelectCommittee late in September; it reduces both principal and interest accord-ing to a fixed scale.     69. Orissa. The Governor gave his assent to the Tenancy amendment bill  at the end of August.  A Bill to require  the registration  of  money-lenders was referred to Select Committee about the same time.   The MadrasEstates Land (Orissa Amendment) Bill has not yet received the Governor-General&apos;s assent : more threats have been  uttered  of  the likelihood  of a crisis if it is, not accepted,  but there is some hope of a compromise since itis believed that the Congress  High Command has doubts about  a Bill whichwould; so drastically  reduce the income of  Zamindars: it is possible  thatRajendra Prasad, whose arbitration procured the agreement in Bihar, willintervene-.     70. Punjab-Three of the Bills passed by  the Assembly,  described inparagraph 94 of the last Survey, have received the Governors assent.  One,which  is designed to empower revenue Officers to annul benami transactions and:  so prevent evasion of the law  which permits transfers of land only be-tween  members of the agriculturist classes, has been reserved  for the con-sideration of the Governor-General on the technical ground of repugnancyto existing Indian law, and is still under discussion with the  Secretary ofState.     The Punjab Provincial Congress decided to carry on a campaign against those clauses of&apos; the Bills which the Congress members opposed in the Legis-lature; an association of non-agriculturists was formed to work  up agitation against the Bills, but has achieved nothing.  Among agriculturists thelegislation is extremely popular, and  the Ministers have  in the  course oftheir, tours been  greeted with enthusiastic demonstrations.  The  leader ofthe National Progressive party in the Assembly has resigned his seat  as. a protest against the discriminatory nature  of  the  legislation and  there arelikely to be a few more defections from the Ministerial strength in the Legis-lature  :. but  these losses will  be mqre than balanced by the hold which theMinistry has now established on the electors.     71.  United Provinces-The Tenancy  Bill as amended in  Select  Com-mittee has still not, come  before the Legislature.   The  Select Committeesubmitted its reoort early, in October.   The Assembly was adjourned twicebecause the  Bill  had not emerged, and again till November 10th,  because
 negotiations were in progress with the zamindars.  A section of the zamin- dars, led by the Nawab ol Chhatari who was Chief Minister in the &quot;interim&apos;&apos; Ministry, approached the Congress Working Committee to obtain its good offices in  securing a compromise.   The response depends on  this  request being endorsed by all  the zamindars, and at the end of  October the Taluk- dars of Oudh had still not accepted the arrangement.                            (g) Communism.     72. The efforts, mentioned  in  previous Surveys, to combine the left- wing forces of the Communists and Congress   Socialists  have  continued. The Communists hoped to present a &quot;united front&quot; of extremists at the All- India Congress Committee meetings in Delhi  in September and to offer a formidable challenge to the moderate High Command.  In this they failed -partly  through the  tactics of  the latter,  which administered a crushing blow to the  left-wing by the resolution on  &quot;civil  liberties&quot; already  men- tioned and prevented discussion of resolutions sponsored by extremists, and partly; through the incurable dissensions among the left-wing  forces.  The- Congress Socialists under Masani suspect, with good reason, the Communists of attempting to capture their party:  arid M. N. Roy and his  followers are not likely to  be assimilated in ^any larger  group.  After  the Delhi meetings the left-wing, sections  are  as far  away as ever from union among. themselves, and. further away from attaining  influence  in the  Congress organisation.   Their only successes are in fomenting  local  movements. Among Cawnpore labour the  Communists  have for the  time being secured control.  . They, won about two-thirds of the seats  on the  General Council of the Mazdur Sabha (Labour Union)  during the August elections,- and were even more successful in the election of office-bearersCommunists now occupy the posts of President, General Secretary, three out of four of the&apos; Joint Secretaries, and Treasurer.   Previously the most important positions were held by Congress  Socialists.  Cawnpore  is  in  fact  becoming the centre of Communist activity in India, and prominent workers from other Provinces are being imported.     The agrarian unrest in the Punjab, which  has been described in para. 70,  may be traced largely to Communist  influence.  Forty   Sikh  Com- munists from the notorious Ghadr party have returned to the Punjab after &quot;training in Moscow, and many   of  them   are  dangerous  propagandists. Socialists are said to have been responsible for the Galladher  agitation in the  North-West Frontier Province.   &apos;     The Madras Government in August pilloried literature disseminated among members of the  Communist Party of India.  After quoting con- temptuous references to the Congress as &quot;the national bourgeoise&quot;, aiming a&apos;t alliance with the &quot;imperial bourgeoise&quot;  for the joint  exploitation of the Indian people, and passages inculcating a  revolutionary strike among all classes including the Army as a prelude to a violent revolution,  the Govern- ment warned the people against the irretrievable harm  that would attend encouragement of such a programme.    !                       (h) The Labour Situation.     73. In contrast to the situation described in the last  Survey, labour hasbeen comparatively undisturbed  throughout  India during the last threemonths.   There have been numerous small or shortlived strikes in various parts of  the  country, but there has been nothing in the  way of large-scaleindustrial disturbances.     74. Socialist workers,  with a certain amount  of  Congress assistance,have made more or less unsuccessful attempts to work up agitation amongthe tea-garden coolies in Assam.  There have been threats of trouble in theAssam Oil Company at Digboi; for some time there has been general dis-oontent among  the workers, and the conditions under  which the Europeanemployees live have been contrasted with   those of  the   labourers.  In   251(S) HD
August drastic action was threatened if the demands of the Labour union were not conceded, and if the Union were   not recognised.   A court  ofenquiry was set up but had not reported by the end of October.   A strikewas called among the skilled labour of the contractors in order to enforcepayment of the same rates as were given to the Company&apos;s hands, and effortswere made to provoke a strike among  the  Company&apos;s  own labour, without success.   The contractors&apos; labour strike came  to  an  end  in  October,largely owing to the Congress Premiers efforts.   The demand that skilledlabourers should get the same wages as the Company&apos;s was conceded.     75. In Bengal there has  been  no trouble  beyond  a number   of shortstrikes of little importance.     76. There has been unrest in Bihar; the strike at the Cable Company,mentioned in para. 99 of the last Survey, still continued at the end of Octo-ber.  Some. 1,200 men struck work  at the Tatanagar Foundry in Jamshed-pur on August 14th, as a protest against  the appointment of an outsiderin place of an old hand, and the works closed down; the strike was calledoff  on .September 19th.    The  strike at the Jealgora  coalfield  ended onAugust 2nd, when three employees who had been dismissed were reinstated.But serious trouble occurred at the Jharia coalfields at the end of September.There was a sudden strike on the 26th; no notice was given and no griev-ances were stated : the  workers said that  they had been told  to strike byAbdul Bari, about whom something was said in the last Survey (para. 99).Some eighty men had to be discharged when work was curtailed and others were dismissed for gross neglect of duty.   An attempt was made to tarn-per  with  the pumps, but serious trouble was averted  on the  27th by  thedespatch of a  large force of police,  who had to make a lathi charge.  * Thestrike started  in two collieries and spread to two more in October.  Barithreatened to bring out  seven collieries if the Company did not yield.   TheMinistry agree that order  should be maintained : the  use  of  prohibitoryorders would be permitted, as well  as special arrangements for the report-ing of speeches : extra police would be  despatched, and the Military shouldbe called out in aid of the civil power if necessary.  Further trouble broke out  early in October at  the Rohtas Industries at Dehri-on-Sone, when localagitation  instigated some 2,400 men to strike in the  cement,  sugar  and paper mills.   Socialist volunteers were imported and civil  disobediencecommenced : rows of strikers lay on the road and blocked the entrances tothe factory, and picketers were active.  Many  arrests were made.  On one occasion  a mob attacked the police, and injured the  District  Magistrate,the Superintendent of  Police and 13 police officers.   The  chief instigatorwas one Basawan Singh, a Socialist labour leader, who was arrested.   OnOctober 21st the strike was called off and work was resumed.   Most of the prisoners  were released, but the question of  action  to be taken against those who  were involved  in the attack on the police  was reserved.  Thedispute will be referred to arbitration.     77. In the Bombay  Presidency  the strike at the Gokak Mills continuedpeacefully throughout the quarter.  There  was another strike at the Brad-bury Mills which is of interest  because the workers ultimately resumedwork against the advice of their leaders.     78. The situation in the Central Provinces has been quiet; one strikelasted from the beginning of July  till the 1st October, when  the Premiersucceeded in persuading the men to return.   No more has been heard ofthe general strike that  was expected to take place at the end of June, andit is not known whether Jamnalal Bajaj has  taken any further part in thenegotiations (see  para.  101 of the last Survey.)     79. In the Madras Presidency the  strike  at the Chittivalsa   Millswhich began early in May came to  an end  on August 8th, the men return-&apos;.ing  to work pending examination  of the  dispute by  a court  of  enquiry.The court found  that there had been no deliberate victimisation  by themanagement, though their subordinates  may  have   been  guilty  of it.Amongst the recommendations made was  one that ten days  casual  leavewith pay should be granted to  workers.   The unrest in Coimbatore stopped
                             (i) Terrorism.     81. During the past few months there.has been increasing evidence ofterrorist penetration of &quot;Youth Leagues&apos; &apos;^ particularly in the United Pro-vinces.    There have been occasional manifestations  of  terrorist  propa-ganda in the shape of objectionable leaflets.  In May   a  &quot;Mutiny Day&quot;leaflet seeking to justify  the need of an organisation to  effect armed, revo-.lution to  attain Socialism  was distributed at a  Youth  Conference  inFyzabad : it was  almost  certainly drafted by the group believed to havebeen concerned in the Pipridih train dacoity.  The leaflet had a small dis-tribution, because its publication was considered inopportune by the moreexperienced terrorists, including e^-Kakori   convicts. In   July  anotherpamphlet called the &quot;War Bugle&quot;  came to notice in several  districts of.the United Provinces.  It advocated armed revolution and attacked Gandhi,Nehru and the Congress  party generally.  A second  issue of this pamphletappeared  in  September,  and was widely distributed in schools in Gorakb-pur, copies being inserted in the pockets and under the pillows of students.In August a leaflet entitled &quot;Echo of Revolution&quot; came to notice in severaldistricts of this Province, advocating much the same methods.     Though  the influence of these leaflets may not at present be great,  therecrudescence of  this form of terrorist  propaganda  deserves attention, asthe past history of. terrorism proves its danger.  Certain dangerous terror-ist ea;-convicts have been moving about the Provinces trying to re-build  oldorganisations and revive interest in  violent revolution.    Ferment   andinsubordination among students have been on the increase in various partsof India.    The problem  of  the release of terrorist prisoners  in  Bengalhas been  discussed in para. 63  : it  is not difficult  to imagine the resultsthat might follow the early and  simultaneous  . release  of two  or three hundred terrorists in that Province.    Of the persons who have been sent up for trial in the Pipridih dacoity(see para. 106 of the last Survey) some are ordinary criminals, and others are well-educated men of  the student type who are known to have been im-bued with terrorist and revolutionary ideas; but it is not possible to judge whether the dacoity was  what may be called a terrorist crime or committedpurely for personal gain.     !                        (j) Communal Troubles.    82. The  communal situation in  the northern parts of India has againdeteriorated,  and the tension in Bihar and Delhi has been severe during theearly in August after the Premier had visited the  district.  The Govern-ment published the results of the enquiry made by the Commissioner ofLabour  into  the  standardization   of   wages: -  they  concluded  thatthis  was  not   possible   for  all    workers,    but  they   published a schedule of rates covering  most categories of workers  which satisfiedneither the managements  nor the workers.   On September 22nd,  1,800men in the Government Press resorted to  a &quot;stay-in&quot; strike to bring aboutthe removal of an Anglo-Indian supervisor; they returned to work on the30th, after being  threatened with immediate dismissal.    80. In the United Provinces there has been unrest in Cawnpore but noopen  disturbances there  or elsewhere.   The  increasing influence of Com-munists in the Mazdur  Sabha  has already been mentioned  in para. 72.The Government  do not  view this development with alarm. . Towards theend of October, however,  the Communist Joint Secretary published  anarticle stating that the function of the Sabha is to fight the millowners,co-operation with whom cannot exist.   So the omens for peace in the indus-trial areas of Cawnpore cannot be called propitious.
whole of the period under survey.   There have also been disturbances  inthe North-West Frontier Province, the Punjab  and the United Provinces.    83. Bihar. On the last day of July a Hindu-Muslim riot occurred inBhagalpur; five persons were killed and about sixty injured.   On August9th., a Hindu armed with a stolen gun ran amok in the same town, andkilled  two Muslims  and wounded  others.   Forces of armed police wereposted in the area.   Mounted military police had to be sent to the neigh-bouring district of Monghyr where there was apprehension of a riot.  OneMuslim was killed and seven Hindus  wounded  in  another riot on August16.th,  Elaborate measures   were taken  to prevent trouble during a  bigHindu festival in August, including the  impounding of all arms in Bihartown..         !    An alarming  situation arose in an area where orders had been issuedprohibiting cow-slaughter; Muslims threatened to disobey the order, andthe Ministry for a time contemplated the total prohibition of cow-slaughter,the effects of which  might have been disastrous.   They  thought better ofit.   Several  arrests had to be made and armed and mounted police werepresent.   Proceedings under  the  preventive sections of  the  criminal lawwere started against a number of Muslims, who  eventually promised to obeythe order until the conference of the Muslim League in December was over,and the proceedings were then dropped.  The  great festival of Dussehrapassed off peacefully in the Province.    The Ministry have shown increasing willingness to  adopt repressivemethods to ensure the keeping of the peace, though they  are likely to havebeen influenced by the fact that the agitation was inspired by the muslim league.    When  the Governor  discussed  the  situation  with them,  theyshowed no hesitation  in  endorsing the policy  laid down, by  their predecessors-successors for dealing with communal trouble, and agreed that this  decision should be  formally conveyed  to district  officers so  that  they  might know where  they stood.  The Premier had  previously withdrawn from  DistrictMagistrates the right of issuing orders under the Police Act for the regula-tion of processions and so. on,  but he agreed to restore  this power.  he also volunteered the suggestion.that it  should be made known tactfully thatif any locality became too troublesome Government would not hesitate toimpose punitive police.    84. North-West Frontier Province. Oh July 23rd a band of tribes-men instigated  by the notorious  Faqir of Ipi, made a  daring raid intoBannu city, set,fire to-a large area and killed, eight people as well as wound-ing many  more.   A- disturbing feature of the raid was that although thegang of raiders must have traversed four or five miles, of British territory in daylight,  no information was. sent in by any village through which theypassed.  Many bad  characters of the villages   surrounding   Bannu took part in the raid.  Sympathy, for the  Faqir of  Ipi still exists  in  the dis-trict, and a contributory cause was no doubt,the impression of the weaken-ino- of  authority under the  new. constitution.   The outrage showed  com-munal features :  the  attack was made chiefly on Hindus and Hindu pro-perty,  and bitter communal recriminations burst out immediately after the raid.  Hindus openly accused Muslims of Banniv of having, assisted thegang,  and tried to take forcible- reprisals.   Muslim  speakers  combinedabuse  of  Hindus  with diatribes against Congress; not  omitting  to men-tion that they were unable to give the same help to Government since Con-gress had  deliberately worked towards reducing the position of the Khans_a tendency mentioned in previous Surveys.   Local officials  came in- for much  criticism  from Hindus, though the  charges directed against them could not be proved and were probably  made  in order  to  substantiate a claim  for  compensation.   The Muslim League lost no time in using the raid for purposes of propaganda against the Ministry  and showed  them-selves  even more irresponsible than Congress.    Tension  was dangerouslyacute for some days,                      ,
      The Premier spent some time in Bannu city and agreed to the fining of  a number of small Wazir villages between the city and the border.  He  took a  courageous  line,  publicly condemning the  activities of the  gang-  leader and his supporters, to such an extent that he aroused a good deal of  resentment.  A Congress conference  held on  August 13th  at Abbottabad  passed  a resolution alleging that the Bannu  raid  was &quot;the outcome of a  conspiracy to bring the Congress Ministry into disrepute, of promoting dis-  unity between Hindus and Muslims and of justifying Governments policy  in Waziristan&quot;, and  demanded compensation for sufferers and the appoint-  ment of an enquiry committee.     At the end of  August the Government  announced the appointment of  a senior official and one non-official to enquire into the circumstances of  the raid.    It had previously been suggested that the  Governors refusal  to permit a non-official enquiry was going  to cause a Ministerial crisis :  actually the Ministry left the decision to the Governor and no question of  a crisis arose.    The  Governor himself selected the non-official  member. The enquiry was to be private and none  of the evidence was to  be  made  public.  At the end of October, Asaf Ali, a Congress member of the Cen-  tral Assembly, was deputed by the Working Committee to enquire into the circumstances of the raid.   Gandhi has very  recently  visited  Bannu to study conditions there, and has prescribed his panacea of non-violence.     85. Punjab. The communal situation  has been marred by  one riot which took place in Multan on August 13th.    The cause  was trivial:  a Muslim woman was accused of stealing cloth  from a Hindu shop, and in the ensuing riot a  mob set fire to  several buildings  including the local Congress office.    Two  persons were  killed  and  86  injured.   British troops were called out, and the usual steps were taken to restore order. There has been no further trouble in the Shahidgunj dispute.    86.  United Provinces. On August 21st  some 3,000 Muslims surround- ed a party of Hindu processionists at a town in Fyzabad district,  and the police had to open fire: one or two Muslims were killed.  A judge of the Chief Court of Oudh has been appointed to make an enquiry.   On August 28th three persons were killed and fifteen injured in a disturbance at Allaha- bad,  when a Hindu procession passed a Muslim mosque at the  hour  of prayer.  Prohibitory  orders were  issued and a curfew  imposed.  The Madh-e-Sahaba dispute in Lucknow is again threatening  trouble, and it is said that the Sunnis have decided to renew civil disobedience.    87.  Delhi. The communal situation has given  continual  cause for -anxiety.  Trouble arose in connection with a dispute between the Municipal Committee and a Hindu Sadhu or priest.  Some time in 1937 the Sadhu squatted in a corner of a Government garden  in the centre  of Delhi  city. Criminal proceedings brought  by the Committee failed on technical  grounds and civil proceedings were then instituted. &quot; The Sadhu  then attempted  to extend his encroachment.   The materials he had collected were removed by the municipal officers on the 30th July.   On the 2nd August a crowd collect- ed with  building material  with the  intention of constructing a  temple on the spot.  The police who attempted to disperse the  crowd were stoned but succeeded in removing the material.  On the following morning a crowd of over 1,000 again stoned the police and had to be dispersed by a lathi charge. Two or three more clashes occurred on the next day.   It appears that influ- ential Hindus were behind the agitation, which was likely at any moment to take a communal turn.   On the 6th August there was an almost complete hartal among the Hindus of the city.   The  situation was quiet until the 21st August when Hindus decided to start civil disobedience m support of the claim that they had a right of public worship at the disputed spot.  On the 23rd parties of volunteers started  attempting to assert the right, and Muslim uneasiness began to increase; they made allegations that the  Hinduswere disturbing  their own worship and  that the land in dispute was the   ?51(S) HD
VI.-POLITICAL MOVEMENTS.                        (a) The  Congress Party.    88. The resolutions passed by the All-India Congress  Committee andby the Congress Working Committee, meeting at Delhi at the end of Sep-tember, will be  found in Appendix I.    89, Congress  and Federation.-The resolution on Federation  passedby the Ali-lndia  Congress Committee  repeated  the liaripura resolution,which was analysed m paragraph 105 of  burvey JNo. 3.  It went on to warn.the British Government that Congress will never &quot;submit to the impositionof Federation on  the country against its declared, will to the contrary&quot;.This means no more than that part of. the original resolution which warrantsthe interpretation  that the Congress would accept a Federal scheme subjectto the omission of the obnoxious features of the statutory scheme and subjectto popular endorsement  by some such device as a Constituent Assembly. Butthe concluding  portion  is new declaring  &quot;that the continuance of  theirresponsible Government at the Centre is becoming intolerable and furtherprolongation may  precipitate a crisis  which  all  desire to  postpone, if  atall possible&apos;&apos;.  In  other words, there must be  no further delay in  introduc-ing the sort of Federal  scheme which the Congress  wants.   This resolution was carried almost unanimously; a few left-wing amendments, moved withthe object of removing the appearance of acceptance of the principle of theFederal scheme  were heavily defeated.   Writing immediately afterwards,Gandhi affirmed that there is no hope of peace till a constitution is framedbv a Constituent Assembly, and that on this  subiect there  had never been any difference of  Opinion  between himself and Jawaharlal Nehru, site ox an old Muslim mosque.  With the assistance of the Chief Commis- sioner a settlement was reached on September 3rd and civil  disobedience was stopped the same day.  In pursuance of the settlement the persons who had been.arrested were released.  Although it is doubtful whether the terms of the&apos;settlement were strictly adhered to by the Hindus,  the situation was much quieter until on the morning of September 9th a Muslim disguised as a Hindu, approached the Sadhu and stabbed him.  The Sadhu was removed to hospital  and the  Muslim was arrested on the  spot.  A large crowd of Hindus seized the disputed  site and another crowd stoned  the police.  A number of  Hindus attempted to enter  a Muslim mosque.  During these clashes several police and a  few rioters  were injured.  Troops were called in to support the police, and a prohibitory order was issued to prevent the presence of any persons on  the disputed site.  A crowd assembled in the main thoroughfare of Delhi  and had to be dispersed by a lathi charge.  It was thus clear that  the agreement of September  3rd  could no longer be enforced.  Shortly afterwards a committee  set up to carry on the Hindu agitation started defying the prohibitory order and sending volunteers to enter the disputed site.  A number of arrests had to be made.   The Sadhu himself on emerging  from hospital  was  served with an order  not to enter the municipal limits; he defied this  order on September 28th, was arrested and sentenced to 9 months&apos; imprisonment.     On October 13th,  a Hindu procession held in  connection with the same dispute came  into conflict with some  Muslims in  the streets of Delhi city and in the subsequent street fighting three Hindus were killed and a large number of persons were injured.  Civil disobedience was  continuing at the end of October.  The incident is disquieting as showing the bitterness of feeling between Hindus and  Muslims, the ease with which a dispute  can arise from claims unsupported by evidence or  reason,  the  disregard shewn-by bigots for public order and the conduct of business, and  the ineffective- ness of ordinary public opinion to control fanaticism.
  .    Meanwhile,  Subhas  Bose continues  to  fulminate against Federation,  wicn an empnasis tnac shows ins suspicions of his colleagues in tlie High  Command;  and His constant threat is of  civil  disobedience if the scheme is  persisted m.   THe left-wing looks to him  for  leadership :  and  he alone  among the  first-rank  leaders of  Congress,  in the absence of Jawaharlal  JNehru m Europe, preaches the doctrine of pure intransigence.   Meanwhile  the moderates in Congress show more interest  in the date when Federation  may be expected  than  in the requirement that  it shall pass through the fire  of a Constituent Assembly before it can be  accepted  as of the true metal.  His^ Excellency Lord Linlithgow&apos;s return to  India  is popularly regarded as  likely  to produce both an acceleration in progress  towards an arrangement  with the Princes and some understanding which will permit the co-operation  of Congress in the scheme without too great a sacrifice of principle.      90. Congress and the States. The Haripura resolution affirmed  that  Congress  stands for full  responsible government and civil liberties  in the  States,  but  in  present circumstances could  not work within the States : therefore, the struggle for. freedom in the  States  should be conducted by organisations independent of Congress and not under the auspices of Cong- ress. The  fruits of this policy were seen in Mysore in April and May (para- graph 108 of Survey No. 3 and paragraph 115  of Survey No. -4).  Its advan- tages for the Congress are clear : whatever the label, agitation in States owes allegiance to Congress  and can be calmed when and on what terms Congress leaders  desire,  but Congress  disclaim  responsibility and leave  conditions to worsen  till supplication is made by or on behalf of the administration for the intervention of some high Congress authority :  thus the Rulers or their Diwans bear the  odium of  discontent and repression, and a Gandhi or a Vallabhai Patel gains the credit for pacification.   Travancore, Hyderabad, Kashmir,  and a number of small States bordering Bombay Presidency  and the Province of Orissa, have all had to face more or  less violent disturbances -in protest against the  alleged autocracy of the administrations.   Congress leaders have applauded revolt  and  condemned repression.   Gandhi, writing in September,  acclaimed the &quot;partial success&quot;  of the  people  of  Mysore as inspiring  &quot;a new vision of liberty&quot; in other States:  the.ste.ps taken in those States to deal with the effects  of this  vision are described in terms varying from &quot;reactionary declarations&quot; (Hyderabad) to &quot;frightfulness&quot; (Travan- core) and  &quot;wholly uncalled for displav of force&quot;  (Rajkot, where Vallabhai Patel had  preached &quot;direct action&quot;).  &quot;The Delhi resolution of  the All-India Congress Committee is  in similar terms, throwing doubt on the versions put out by  the Durbars, and representing the  local movements  as  strictly con- stitutional : and reaffirming the Congress &quot;policy  of non-interference&quot;,  and as the goal conversion  of the Princes to a surrender of their  power to the people.    91.  Affairs in the  States bordering Orissa have a special importance for the  purpose of this  Survey, because there the agitation has been assisted by action  taken in the Orissa Province under  the  aegis of the Provincial Congress Committee.   It is beyond the scope  of this Survey to estimate the validity of the grievances of  the States subjects, in these as in other States : but the difficulties are  becoming increasingly clear of dealing with them pureLy as an affair between. Ruler  and subjects.  The tendency is growing to link-redress of specific grievances with the demand for responsible govern- ment.   The smaller States have not under  their control the forces necessary to deal, with widespread disturbance  of the  peace : Provinces  of  British India, whatever their political sympathies,  cannot be expected to lend their own  forces for the purpose; the Governments  of Bengal,  Orissa and  the Central Provinces have in fact declined suggestions that they should doso.  But what can be legitimately expected is that Provincial Governmentsshall do  everything in their  power to prevent disaffection being  organisedwithin their borders against the neighbouring  States.  Machinery  is provid-ed bv certain sections  of the Indian  States  (Protection)  Act,  1934.  TheOrissa Ministry, when  approached for the application  of these provisions,
 refused.  While expressing willingness to assist in other ways to curb activities organised in the Province against Dhenkanal  State, they would not empower their District Magistrates to prohibit meetings  and control individuals.   Troops had  to be used on two occasions to  deal with the dis- orders in this State:  and  it is still uncertain whether the effect of their operations,  together with  such influence as the Orissa Ministry  is willing to exert in the Province,  is sufficient to re-establish order.  If it  proves necessary,  the Governor-General will in the exercise of his powers under Section 126  (5) of the Government of India Act issue a direction  to  the Governor to apply the provisions of the States  (Protection) Act.  If this were  done, the Ministry would probably resign; and the danger  cannot be ignored of the other Congress Ministries being  called out if  that were to happen.    By contrast,  the action taken  in  a non-Congress  Province may  be quoted :  in  order  to prevent the organisation of agitation  in  the Punjab against the neighbouring  Kalsia State,  the  Punjab   Government  have brought into force the sections of the States (Protection) Act which the Orissa Government will not apply.    92. Congress and Violence. Gandhi&apos;s preoccupation with the doctrine and practice of non-violence is nothing new, but his recent insistence on its cardinal importance is interesting for various reasons.  He is capable with- out insincerity of ignoring an element of violence where,  as in the States, it causes  Congress no  inconvenience, while detecting  and  reprobating it with exaggerated severity  where it is unwelcome to Congress Ministries or the High Command.   Writing  in  the  &quot;Harijan&quot;  early  in August,  he condemned as pure violence the methods of picketers who join hands  to prevent workers entering a mill.  (This  device had been used  to  interfere with the labour employed by Gandhi&apos;s capitalist friend G. D.  Birla).  &apos;Tf violence is not checked in  time,  the  Congress will go to pieces,&quot; he said. This indictment of methods which had been freely and with a good cons- cience followed in the civil disobedience movement excited some  criticism. In September he  developed his attack,  complaining of violence used  in Congress elections; and pleaded that the ranks of Congress should be purged of all who do not believe  in the unalloyed  doctrine  of non-violence.  His next article under the caption of &quot;Congressmen Beware&quot; applied  the lesson to the anti-Hindi agitation in Madras, and justified the use by Rajagopala- charities  of the  Criminal Law Amendment  Act to quell the &quot;picketing nuis- ance&quot; : it is the Premier, and not the picketers, who is more truly practising satyagraha.    Then came an attack  on the incitement by a  local Congress Committee in Madras of lawless acts by the tenants of a zamindar with  the naive parenthesis that the zamindar &quot;is reputed to be a docile man with pro- Congress tendencies&quot; : and on even worse incitement to violence in the name of Congress  in the United Provinces,  Central  Provinces,  and Bombay. The campaign culminated  in an article published  on September 2-lth which roundly declared that &quot;violence, untruth and corruption have made inroads enough to warrant drastic measures in  order to prevent decay overtaking the great organisation&quot;.   Gandhi  added  a hope that  the  Working Com- mittee and the All-India Congress Committee would deal with these abuses. The resolution passed at Delhi a few days later on &quot;Civil  Librety&quot; may therefore be  directly attributed  to  Gandhi&apos;s influence.  Its intention,   as not merely a  pious expression of moral  sentiments,  was fully understood by the left-wing against which it was aimed.  Subhas Bose&apos;s private pro- tests against its  being  moved,  and  the opposition  of the left-wing in the meeting, were of no avail :  and as a result of publicity carefully directed by Gandhi to this end the Congress Ministries have been armed with a strong weapon against attack under the cloak of Congress.    It would not be fair to suggest that the object of Gandhi&apos;s recent insist-ence on the doctrine is purely to aid Congress Ministries in facing particular difficulties.  His more distant aim-and one which he himself perhaps doesnot hope to see completely achieved is such a conversion of the whole people
 to non-violence as will solve all problems of administration, win the attain- ment of national freedom, and even provide India with an effective shield and  buckler in international relations. -This ideal is regarded by the prac- tical politicians of the party as beyond  attainment.                 1      93. Attitude to Indians Overseas.-The only resolution passed  at  the Delhi session on Indians Overseas expressed deep sympathy with the Indian sufferers in the Burma riots,  and suggested that an enquiry should be held, compensation awarded to innocent sufferers, and safety assured to them. It advised the Indian settlers to rely more upon themselves than upon aid from India and to cultivate good relations with the Burmans, and appealed to the Burmese Government not to disturb  the happy relations  existing between the two countries.     94. The Rupee Ratio. Apart from a number of questions asked in the Central Assembly by Congress members,  little further interest has been dis- played in this subject.     95. The Buqti arm-(See paragraph 117 of the last Survey). A resolu- tion  passed  at Delhi again criticised &quot;the British authorities&quot; for failing to discharge their responsibility for the welfare of the people of the area and  demanded  that, the present autocratic and irresponsible  system of  ad- ministration should be stopped.     96. Attitude to &quot;untouchables&quot;. A-private Bill brought forward in Madras to permit &quot;Harijans&quot; to enter  temples got the Ministry  into diffi- culties.  Rajagopalachari himself had drafted  the Bill before he took office, but the Ministry decided to oppose  the Bill  and it was   rejected.   The Premier announced that the Government would introduce an official  Bill On the same lines, to apply to Malabar district only in the first place.   This Bill was published on August 30th : it is permissive  in character, allowing temples to be opened to &quot;Harijans&quot; if the majority of the Hindu voters in local areas are in favour of this course.   The Bill will be introduced  in  the next  session Of the  Legislature.     M. C. Rajah, the mover of the private Bill, has been  in correspondence with  Gandhi about the matter.   He  taxed Rajagopalachari with commit- ting  a &quot;gross  betrayal&quot; of the depressed  classes  in  Madras.   Gandhi&apos;s replies show little sympathy for Rajah  (perhaps because he was a member of the &quot;interim&quot; Ministry in Madras), and merely advise him to place impli- cit trust in the Premier.    Another non-official Bill moved by Rajah was passed  in August :  it provides for the removal of &quot;Harijans&apos; &quot;  disabilities  in regard to appoint- ments to public offices, access to wells, and  other secular rights.    Iri Bombay  it is claimed  that a considerable number  of temples have been thrown open to &quot;Harijans&quot; in pursuance of the Act mentioned in para- graph 107 of Survey No, 3.  An order passed by the  Ministry in  this Pro- vince requiring hotels to be opened to &quot;Harijans&quot; caused some heart-burn- ing :  in one  town street-scavengers entered the hotels in bodies  carrying their  broomsmany hotel-keepers returned  their  licences  in  protest. Another order permitting &quot;Harijan&quot; children  to enter schools caused the higher classes to withdraw their children from the schools affected.    The depressed class leader in Bombay, Dr.  Ambedkar,  has recently an- noiinced that he has  no faith in Gandhi or the Congress: both are negligentof the interests of the depressed classes.    In the Central  Provinces an official  Bill has been referred to Select Committee which seeks to remove &quot;Harijans&apos; &quot;  civil disabilities.    97, General. There Is good reason to believe that the  enrolment  of congress members during the current year has not come up to expectations.    The Congress party in the Punjab has been torn by internal dissensions. A member of the Working Committee decided that &quot;the Presidents electionhad been secured by unfair means,  so the President, Satyapal, resigned.   251(S) HD
  The party then split into two and at one time there were two parallel Con-  gress offices  m Lahore.  Satyapal was persuaded to withdraw his resigna-  tion and a sort of peace exists;  but the party&apos;s chances of winning any suc-  cesses in the Province are remote.      98.  Gandhi&apos;s continued  domination of Congress  makes  it-necessary  in any review of the present position of the party and estimate of its future  behaviour,  to take into account  the state of mind and body of its unofficial  leader.   As regards his physical condition there is no ground for apprehen-  sion: his seventieth birthday,, celebrated  at. the-  beginning  of  October  throughout the  country, found  him apparently  in  good  health.  But the  working of his mind seems for some time past to have puzzled his associates :  and  there is  evidence in his recent writings that he feels the approach of  a climax of  some sort.  Somewhat in  the  same way  as he once promised  swaraj within a year, he has now  fixed  April 1939 one year from the date  when he stated  his  demands  to the Bengal Government-as the term for  the release of all the terrorist convicts in Bengal, though he must be aware that  only the replacement of the  present Ministry by an  administration dominated by Congress could procure that result.&quot;  Other utterances have expressed a mood of disillusion, and the view that,  if those who now serve the Congress cannot follow the  pure doctrine of non-violence, it would be better to leave the field  to them.   Writing in the  &quot;Hariian&quot;  on October 15th on the defiant  attitude of  the left-wing at the Delhi session of the Congress,  he said &quot;My opinion, based on  experience,  is that  if, after  a&quot; friendly discussion  with the obstructionists, it  is found that they believe it to be their duty to continue  their obstruction,  it would conduce to the good of the country to hand over the reins to the minority and to follow the existing Congress  programme without  using the Congress name&quot; :  this, if done &quot;without bitterness and merely to meet a situation that is becoming impossible&quot; would &quot;succeed beyond expectations&quot;.: &quot;if chaos is  to be pre- vented, proper measures  must be taken in time&quot;.   Another article in the same paper on the same  date discussed the &quot;Red Shirts&quot; of the Frontier Province : their  leader, Abdul  Ghaffar  Khan, has  imbibed the lesson of non-violence but he is not sure of his people : and these in fact &quot;know very little of  non-violence&apos;&apos; : if Gandhi could not reach their hearts,  they must &quot;give up their non-violence and resume their arms&quot;.   Later in his tour of the Province he is reported as  saying  that,  after a close study of the frontier problems of kidnapping and raids, he had formed the impression that the situation had  grown worse since  the inauguration of  the Congress Ministry in the Province :  &quot;it  would be better for the Congress to resign from office if it  could not cope with the question of raids or else the Congress would lose all its prestige&quot;.  But he Was still  preaching the doctrine  of   non- violence to the &quot;Red Shirts&quot; and,fjif his  plan bore fruit, that might provide a permanent solution of the problem&quot;.   This final note  of  hope  is  less characteristic  than the note of something akin to despair :  and it is known that in the middle of October he sent messages to trusted persons that his experiences in the Frontier Province were leading him to the conclusion that there and in other Provinces  the only remedy  might be the resignation of the Ministries.    No clue can with any certainty be offered at present  as to the real cause of these  reflections or as  to their probable outcome.   The mood  may pass and nothing may  happen.   It does  at any rate appear unlikely that Gandhi should intend, without  deliberation with the leaders of the Congress, and without further pretext,  to call out -the Congress Ministries: but  there may be a danger that in  the approach to-Federation or in the day-to-diay administration of a Province some occasion will be sought  for a  quarrelwith the constitution.    Gandhi&apos;s  tour in the Frontier  Province began on October 5th..  Littleinterest in him has been shewn bv  the peonle of  the Province, in marked,  &apos;contrast to his reception during his last  visit in May.
(b) The Muslim League.     99. Although it has long  been  evident  that the  Congress-Leaguenegotiations can lead nowhere, the  correspondence has  been continued,perhaps because each party is reluctant  to  take  the  responsibility forshutting the door.  Jinnah&apos;s letter of July 30th, was described in para. 123of the last Survey,  Subhas Bose placed it before the Working Committeein Delhi in September; the reply,  sent early in October, made the suggestionthat Jinn ah had abandoned his claim that the League must  be treated asthe sole representative of the Muslims in India a suspicion which Jinnahhastened to dispel in his answer  of October 9th,  approved by the  working committee of the League, which reaffirmed the position he  had stated andasserted the League&apos;s willingness to  continue  negotiations on the basis ofthe three conditions mentioned in para. 121 of the last Survey.  Stalemateappears to have been reached.     100. Jinnah&apos;s presence at the  Sind  Muslim  League Conference inKarachi early in October gave it a more than Provincial significance,  andmany prominent Muslims from  various  parts  of India,   including thePremiers of the Punjab and  Bengal,   were  present  during the session.Jinnah&apos;s opening speech was yet one  more stinging  attack on Congress; hestigmatised the  &quot;high  command&quot; as  &quot;the greatest  enemy of India&apos;s pro-gress&quot;, fiercely criticised its attitude  to the Muslim League, and generallycondemned all Congress activities.  The three important resolutions passedby the conference will be found in Appendix II.  That on Palestine is men-tioned elsewhere.  In addition to the resolution on  League Ministries, theWorking Committee dealt with the situation in Assam, urging the governor to summon the Assembly at  once in  order  to  upset  the new &quot;minority&quot;Ministry : the resolution went on to  condemn -the tactics employed  by the speaker and new Premier to prevent  the Assembly meeting.   Other  resolu-tions of the Provincial conference dealt with Sind affairs : the Ministry wascondemned for its acceptance of the revised Barrage rates of assessment.     101. The resolution on Federation once more states the  Muslim refusal to agree to the statutory scheme : the All-India Muslim League is to consider what might be a suitable constitution for India, securing the status due toMuslims and providing for the attainment of their full independence.   this demand  cannot  be  dismissed  as  mere   &quot;window-dressing&quot;: the muslim league leaders have convinced themselves, both that the Congress means toaccept the Federal scheme  if  certain undertakings are  given,  and thatMuslims under that scheme would be  permanently at the mercy of a Hindumajority, which besides taking advantage of  its  position  in  other wayswould seek to interfere with  the Provinces  now  under  Muslim LeaguePremiers.  A sequel to the Karachi conference is seen in a statement very recently issued by Sir Abdulla Haroon,  a prominent Muslim Leaguer whois also a member of the Central Assembly: in this he openly  states the muslim ideal  in terms which are known to have been  agreed on in privatesession at Karachi: in place of the statutory scheme two separate Federationsare to be devised, &quot;each reflecting the   strength of one of the two  majorcommunities,  and including  the  Indian  States  as. would join them withperfect freedom in the internal affairs guaranteed to them&quot;&apos;..   This idea ofa Muslim Federation,  to be set over  against a.Hindu Federation, appearsto owe something to the &quot;Pakistan&quot;  scheme which achieved some publicitya few years ago.   It is known that  the intention is  to  work out further details, to popularise the idea throughout the north of India, and to considerit further at an all-India session of the League in the  near  future.     102. The League  has  undoubtedly gained ground in the North-west frontier Province and  Sind though iri  the latter Province the attempt to capture, the Ministry has for the time being  failed.    In  Bihar and theUnited Provinces it is  a growing power,, ready to use any. opportunity forexciting communal bitterness.  At a bye-election at Budaun in the united provinces the League candidate secured  a convincing victory  over his Comgress opponent.  Events in Assam have been a set-back, but that may-not be
                 VIF.-SPECIAL PROBLEMS.                             (a) Palestine.    10&apos;4. It is fortunate that affairs in Palestine have not hitherto beenmade the occasion; for organised agitation in India on any formidable scale.For different reasons neither the Musliih League nor the Congress is yetdisposed to give the matter prominence.  There are eleinents in the Leaguewhich with any encouragement would be ready to make serious trouble, butJinnah&apos;s influence has been firmly used to damp down excitement.  It maybe presumed that he is disinclined to involve  the League in conflict simul-taneousiy with Congress and with the British Government:  for the timebeing his energies are concentrated on the former.   But if  the pressure inthe party  became too strong  to be resisted, or if it suited  the  President&apos;spurpose to appear as the champion of the Arabs,  circumstances would.be favourable for an agitation which might be very embarrassing to the CentralGovernment and to His Majesty&apos;s Government.    The last Survey (para. 127) mentioned the deliberations of the Leagueon this subject in Delhi at  the  end of  July.    &quot;Palestine Day&quot; was inaccordance with a resolution then adopted observed  throughout India onAugust  26th,  but it  attracted no great  interest.    The  Sind ProvincialMuslim  League, meeting at Karachi in October, passed a resolution urging the British Government to cancel  the  Balfour  declaration,   abandon the partition scheme, arid &quot;confer full independence upon Palestine&quot;.  britain was warned that a continuance&apos; of her pro-Jewish policy would mean enmitywith Islam, and it was decided to  adopt any measures decided by the Cairoconference for  the protection and freedom  of  the  Holy Land of Islam.This meeting had more than. provincial importance, since  Jinnah presidedand it was held in con junction with meetings of all-India  representatives.But it is also significant that the  all-India body has left, the subject alonesince  the July rheetirig.    The Congress party also has  shown no lively interest in the problem.A resolution, passed by the All-India Committee  in Delhi iri Septemberstated that it  regretted that  the policy  which the Congress had condemnedat Haripura was still being  pursued, protested  against the British  reignof terror in Palestine, and advised Britain to leave the Jews and Arabs tosettle the  issues amicably (sic) between themselves, otherwise  nothing has1been done by  Congress&quot;&apos;  It  *s however reported that nationalist Muslimshave prepared  a draft memorandum to be .serit  to  the  Congsess working committee and Provincial Governments: it demands that, as the  problem.of freedom iri Palestine is connected with the  problem of freedom in India,the Natiorial Congress should  render all possible assistance when an agitationis launched.    A threat is&quot;offered that if  Congress  fail   to  co-operate,Congress Muslim will dissociate  themselves from the party arid carry out their  policy with the help of  the extremist element in the Congress  who are alleged to have pfoinised them their support.for long.  In the Central Assembly the new League party has asserted its power in unmistakable fashion.                    (c) Other opposition to Congress.    103. The Ahrars, of the  Punjab, have  dissociated   themselves from congress by an  edict prohibiting  their members from  joining  any other political party.  The &quot;Red Shirts&quot; in the North-West Frontier Provincedecided in August that their  members could  become members of Congressbut could riot accept any office in  Congress  Committees without resigningtheir &quot;Red Shirt&quot; membership.   G-aridhi&apos;s attempts  to   tempt them intothe Congress fold are not expected  to be fruitful.    The activities of other organisations deserve no special mention.
                                   3*7     In minor Muslim circles there has been more pronounced activity.  A &quot;Palestine Defence Committee&quot;,  composed of  Ahrars  and a number of disaffected Muslims who for reasons of jealousy have displayed hostility to Jinnah and the League, passed a resolution  in August, as a sort of counter- blast to the Leagued resolution of July, adopting a proposal to launch civil disobedience in order to bring pressure on the British Government to  alter its policy in  Palestine.   It was decided to start the movement soon after the Cairo Conference.  No effect has yet been given.to the resolution.   This body has disseminated in Northern India a certain amount of inflammatory propaganda.     The  only Provincial Government which has taken formal notice of the Palestine problem is that of Bengal.  A memorandum  on the subject was adopted by the Ministry in July last  for  submission  to His  Majesty&apos;s Government.   This by  an oversight  was not forwarded at the time; but a further memorandum was agreed to at a Cabinet meeting on  October 20th : this expresses the serious apprehensions of the Ministry about the deterioration- tion of the situation in Palestine, the steps  taken to suppress the agitation by military force, and the pressure of Jewish organisations on  His Majesty&apos;s Government and  the Government of the  United States.    It stresses the growing sympathy of Indian Muslims for the Arabs and the probable effect of any decision unfavourable to the  Arabs: and urges  that in taking any decision His  Majesty&apos;s  Government should give weight  to  &quot;the political situation in India brought about by  the establishment of Congress government- ments in eight  Indian  Provinces  and their possible  attitude of non-co- operation by refusing to assist His Majesty&apos;s Government in case of Great Britain going into a war&quot; : Britain in these circumstances  cannot afford to alienate the loyalty of the Muslim population in India and of the Indian States.     It is  known  that the Premier of  the Punjab would welcome any act of His Majesty&apos;s  Government which would indicate  an  appreciation of the importance of Indian opinion  on  this  question : the Punjab is the more affected since the Palestine agitation is used with effect to reinforce anti- recruiting propaganda and opposition  to aid being  given- to Britain in the event of  war : and the Premier  has found it necessary to qualify his whole- hearted  pledge of military assistance  from the  Punjab  (mentioned else-- where), by a reservation as to the use of Indian troops against the interests of Muslims in Palestine.    The Bihar Governor has very recently commented that, though Muslims are too busy with their controversies with Hindus to  pay much attention to events  in Palestine, Government  officers regard it as a grave confession of weakness and inefficiency that in so small a country peace can  only  be maintained with the aid of a very large military force and by the introduc- tion of martial law.    In these  circumstances the publication  of the report of  the  Partition Commission and of the conclusions  of His Majesty&apos;s  Goverment  thereon wili have a special importance for India.    Mention was  made in the  last Survey of the flow of  Palestine propa- ganda into India from abroad.   As  heretofore, with the assistance of Pro- vincial Governments, particularly the  Bombay Government,  much of this is intercepted : but much also is bound to reach the addressees.  The  pro- paganda is mainly of two types circumstantial accounts of the excesses  of the British forces in Palestine, and a detailed record  of  the  achievements of the Arab &quot;crusaders&quot;.   Both  types are highly  damaging to British prestige,  and it has not hitherto been  found possible to take any effective steps  to counter the propaganda.                           (b) &quot;Prohibition&quot;.    105.  No further progress has been, made with the introduction of  pro- hibition in the non-Congress Provinces.   25i(S) HD
    In Madras the provisions of the Prohibition Act were extended to twodistricts, Cuddapah and Chittoor, on October 1st;   The Legislature has passed a Bill to amend the Act in order to prohibit the  advertisement ofmedicated wines, except in medical journals.    The Central Provinces Government are said to have agreed provisionallythat the whole  of   three districts  shall  go  completely   &quot;dry&quot; from thebeginning of the next financial year.    In Orissa prohibition of opium  was inaugurated in  Balasore districtin October.   Persons proved by medical  examination to be addicts may still obtain supplies from medical officers.    An experiment was made in Bombay city in August:  it was announcedthat for two days all liquor shops were to close down, the days selected  beingworkmen&apos;s  pay days: it was hoped  that  this would  prevent them fromspending their wages on drink.   According to the Press the experiment wasnot altogether a success :&quot; some of the workers got in  supplies of  liquorbeforehand and others had to spend more than usual in travelling to suburbsto get their drink.  The Minister has proposed a  special tax,- probably a house tax,  in urban areas where prohibition has   been imposed; the sumraised would be devoted to the promotion of prohibition in new areas.    Such scanty reports on the working of &quot;prohibition&quot;  as have appearedduring the quarter indicate  that Ministries are satisfied with the resultsso far.                     (c) Gujarat Lands (Bombay).    106. The terms of the Bill drafted by the Home and Law Minister  toexpropriate the present owners were  described in  para.  129 of the lastSurvey.  The Governors efforts to obtain an advance on them were rendereddifficult by  the Ministry&apos;s subservience  to the  Congress  High Command :Gandhi&apos;s great interest in the  subject has been manifest throughout, andhis influence and  that of Vallabhai Patel have been exercised to preventmoderation creeping.in.  Nevertheless something was achieved: the provi-sions  as to compensation were amended so as  to modify the objectionableclause which deducted from the amount the profit derived by the owner fromthe land.   As finally  framed the method of compensation would be,  at the option of the owner, either :-      (1) (a)  the sum originally paid, plus (b) the value of improvements,            (plus  (c) 4 per cent, per annum on the total, pftus (d) 15 per cent.            on the total: or      (2) subject to the minimum being as calculated above an arrange-             ment by which the land revenue  paid on the land would  be             credited to the  owner, and the profits of  cultivation deducted             from the compensation.   Thus even if an owner takes the risk             of this method he will still be ensured  a minimum amount.    As this was the  furthest the Ministry would  go  in  the direction  ofconcession, the Governor gave the previous sanction which is required  bysection  299 of  the Government of India  Act,  1935, for  introduction of aBill which makes provision for the transference of land to public ownershipor for the extinguishment or modification of rights therein.     On October 13th, the first reading in the Assembly was passed  by  74votes to 34; the opposition was weaker than  had  been expected, and theBill passed through the House in three days with no material amendments.It was immediately brought- before the Council:, there too it met with  no effective opposition and was passed without further amendment.     Negotiations  with the principal owners had been in progress before thepassing of the Bill: and it appears  that most of  the   land will now be surrendered without further proceedings on the terms of the minimum com-pensation  provided in the  Bill.   The  Governor is now  considering what action should be  taken whether his assent should be accorded  forthwith,
 whether it should be refused, whether the Bill should be  returned to  the Legislature for modification, or whether it should be  reserved for the con- sideration of the Governor-General.   The Legislature, where the opposition was both feeble in volume and divided on the grounds of objection  to the Bill,  is not likely to accede to. a message suggesting amendment.  Refusal of assent would certainly bring out the Ministry and probably, in view of Gandhi&apos;s personal interest in the matter, which he has declared in a recent article in the &quot;Harijan&quot;, all other Congress Ministries also.             (d) The  Congress Flag and Bande  Mataram.    107.  There have been no important developments in this controversy.              (e) Anti-war and anti-recruiting propaganda.    108.  An increase  in propaganda, mostly  conducted on the lines laiddown by the Haripura &quot;war danger&quot; resolution, caused some alarm  to the punjab Government, and at their suggestion the Central Government under-took the legislation to penalise disloyal propaganda which is described in para. 112 below.   The publication of that Bill and the discussion on it inthe Central Assembly in  their turn stimulated agitation: and other circum-stances which have temporarily contributed to the same effect are the  threat of war in Europe and Muslim feeling about the unrest in Palestine.  Thelatter could be easily excited by suggestions that Indian  troops  would beused to deal with the Arab revolt; and the opportunity was taken also,  byelements ill-disposed towards the Muslim League, to represent the League&apos;ssupport of the Bill  above mentioned  as deplorable subservience to BritishImperialism.    Punjab and the United Provinces are the main field for anti-recruitingactivity; but in the latter the people in the areas which contribute mostrecruits are said to be well aware of the advantages of the Army  as a prof es-sion :  the agitators are discouraged in those areas, with the result that theirpropaganda is  conducted mostly  where few  recruits would in any case be forthcoming.    109. India and the threat of war. What would have been  the feelingsand actions of various classes in India if war in Europe had not been avert-edl   Pirst, many people throughout India,  judging by experience of theGreat War, could expect gain from war. Prices would rise, industry  wouldmake increased profits, unemployment would diminish,  and the  classes con-nected with the Army would particularly  benefit.  Secondly, there was inIndia little consciousness of liability  to loss through   war.  The fightingwould be far away and  Britain, not  India, would bear the brunt.  As aCongress  member of the Central Assembly said to an official acquaintance &quot;We in India are like children who do not know  the troubles of their parents&quot;.    The classes whose incomes would not be likely to rise to meet the  risein prices would suffer: and in some business  circles there was apprehensionabout the inevitable dislocation of trade-e.gr., in Bombay, whereas it is saidthat in Calcutta  the gains were expected to outweigh the losses.  -    Thus among ordinary people there was on the whole little fear of war,and among many a lively expectation of material advantage from it.    As regards the political aspect,  there existed,  along with the materialbias towards war, the natural feeling that a fight for Czechoslovakia anddemocracy, and against  the dictatorships, was a fight which India couldapplaud.    Of the Ministries, those in the non-Congress Provinces made no reserva-tions  about support  in the  prosecution of the war.  The  Bengal Cabinet,meeting on September 29th, on the motion of the Premier agreed  unanimous-ly to give the fullest possible support to the Central Government.  This wasalso the attitude  of the Sind Ministry&apos;.  In the Punjab- the Ministers&apos; were
conscious that the security of India would in a great measure depend on the loyalty of the Province, and were confident that the response of the martialclasses would be as notable in the Great War.  The support of the Punjab.was pledged in a speech made by the Premier at a dinner in Simla on Sep-tember 26th,  m terms which were the more  impressive from  the  darknessof the cloud then impending over the world.    Before an attempt is made to estimate what would have happened inthe Congress Provinces, and elsewhere in quarters under the influence of congress, it  is necessary to  examine the attitude of the High Command.It so happened that  the All-India Congress Committee was  assembled inDelhi during the period of greatest  tension in Europe.  The draft resolu-tion laid before the open session by  the Working Committee merely statedthat &quot;in the event of war breaking out in Europe, the All-India  CongressCommittee delegates its powers to the Working Committee to  deal with thesituation as it arises from time to time&quot;.  This was moved on September25th, by Vallabhai Patel.  Masani (the Congress Socialist, leader) wanted to move amendments : in order to avoid discussion,  consideration of the re-solution  was at once postponed :  negotiations were started with the left;wing, and as a result the words &quot;in the light of the Haripura resolution onforeign policy and war danger&quot; were added, and the resolution as  so ampli-fied was moved by the Congress President on September 26th. and at oncecarried unanimously without speeches or comments.  Thus a concession wasmade to the  left wing  (since the neutral terms of  the original draft weregiven a bias by reference to the strongly anti-Imperialist resolution of Feb-ruary last); but an earnest desire was shewn that  the Congress should n;it.be  more definitely committed.     The passing of the danger relieved the Working Committee of  the neces-sity of forming a  plan of  action, and  in  the interval it made no other pro-pronouncement than the resolution (which will be found in Appendix  I): expres-:sing  sympathy for  Czechoslovakia  in  her stand against  the  &quot;unabashedattempt&quot; of Germany to deprive her of independence.   As however this re-solution went on to mention India&apos;s similar plight &quot;engaged in a  war, non-violent but nonetheless exacting, against the greatest  Imperialistic power on earth&quot;-it cannot be read as connoting any support for Great Britain inwar even if undertaken solely in consequence of German aggression against Czechoslovakia.     Surmise  as to  what  would have happened,  while the recollection ofevents  and tendencies is  still fresh, may have some  value  for  a futureoccasion.     There is in the first place Gandhi&apos;s own statement, published on Octo- ber 7th,  in  the &quot;Harijan&quot;.   It is possible to deduce  from this that the Working Committee debated two alternatives (1)  to take advantage of the crisis to bargain  with Great Britain for ccnstitutional  concessions as the price of India&apos;s support in the war, and  (2) to affirm the principle of non- violence as requiring India to dissociate herself  entirely from  war, even in support of Czechoslovakia: that the  Working Committee was strongly tempted towards the former course : that it was urged by Gandhi towards the latter, and at the moment when the crisis  passed was almost  persuaded to it.  This statement may now be  checked by what is known from reliable sources, particularly some of the Congress Premiers who had been in Delhi. The versions given by two  of  them to their Governors  may be  thus sum- marised :       Pandit G. B. Pant (U. P.) on September 28th, said  that the Working Committee had come to no definite conclusions but had left  it to Premiers to comply with the normal necessities of the situation and to refer for in- structions if any vital matter arose.   He seemed  to see no difficulty about complying with requesjts  of the Central Government to carry out essential measures, such as the internment of enemy subiects and censorship :  but if Provincial Governments  were to  take any initiative,  this  might  require
reference to the Working Committee.  He stressed the profound differencebetween India  entering on a war because Great Britain so ordained andentering on it by a voluntary act, as in the case of the Dominions.    Kher (Bombay)  on or  about  September 29th,  said the Working  Com-mittee was  waiting  for guidance from Gandhi-:  in :the meanwhile minor.measures (e.g., the rounding up  of .enemy aliens)  could he taken by  the ministries : for approval of ,more important: measures they would have toapply to the Working  Committee for guidance.  Gandhi would probably not attempt to strike a bargain with the British Government as he held thatto be an unworthy course, but was more likely to adhere rigidly to the prin-ciple of non-violence, and  so Congress would not  be  prepared to assist inthe prosecution of a war.   (This  however was qualified by his opinion thatif Gandhi  made this decision  the Working Committee might take a differ -ent line and be prepared to give full support to Britain on terms).    These  statements,  supplemented from other sources,  make  it probablethat up to the time the Premiers left Delhi no idefmite ^decision had beenmade: that Gandhi strongly discouraged the bargaining  attitude and. alsoactive opposition : that for the time  being Ministries would be permitted tocarry out minor measures but could not take any moreco-operativedine with-out further orders from the High Command : and  that the;fmal  attitude of congress would in some degree depend on whether an approach were made tothe High Command  by the official authorities.  The.opinion of the BombayPremier that Gandhi might not have carried the Working Committee withhim is entitled to respect,  but on the whole seems an  unlikely forecast.Rajagopalachari, speaking on October 1st,  said that he would soon be out of office if a war broke out.  War  would in fact have immediately imposed on Provincial Governments active duties of various kinds which  would havebeen incompatible with neutrality,  and the Congress Premiers would havehad to take orders from the High Command: the balance  of probability in-clines to the orders being such that the Ministries could not have remained in office.  Presumably  there  would  have  been  no  &quot;crisis&quot;   but  theywould have quietly demitted office, and ^Governors would have had to assume the administration under section 93 of the Act.  There is.no reason to sup-pose that the occasion  would-have been seized for  the inauguration of civildisobedience.    The circumstances, it must be remembered, were such as to  bring Con-gressmen closely into sympathy with Britain:  added to the detestation ofGermany&apos;s aggression was a warm admiration for  Czechoslovakia : were thecircumstances on another occasion such as not to rouse the same warmth of feeling, the likelihood  of co-operation, or even of passive neutrality, on thepart of the Congress would be less.    In  no  circumstances could Congress support  be expected unless someapproach were made to the High Command, and unless the appearance couldbe,given of a voluntary decision by the Indian people.    Indian opinion on the Munich  settlement, .so  far as it can be judged from the Press and  the utterances of politicians,  follows the line taken inEngland rby the opposition and even in India by  some British  journalists.Czechoslovakia has been betrayed, democracies have.submitted,to the threat of force, the prestige of Britain has been lowered,  and hostilities have beenmerely postponed.  In some quarters this attitude can be attributed to dis-appointment:  those  who expected material .gain from war (including somewho speculated, and lost, on the chance) would naturally not welcome peace :Jawaharlal Nehru has  for years been hoping for war as India!s opportunityto achieve  independence, and  his better comments on the settlement  are ameasure of  his chagrin: more moderate politicians had  hopes trending inthe same direction.  In general, though appreciation has  been shewn  ofthe unprecedented efforts Of the British Prime Minister which averted war,Indian comment has shewn an irresponsibility which denotes a feeling ofremoteness  both from  the  probable  fields of hostilities and from a  share in the decision Of events.    Comments  applying the settlement to  Indian  conditions deserve parti-cular mention.   It is argued that there are lessons for India in the  stresslaid on  the Sudeten&apos;  right to self-determination.  Nationalists ask how  261(S) HD
can Britain reconcile acquiescence  in  that claim with  their denial of in-dependence to India&apos;? Muslims, on the other hand, have been quick to point to themselves  as the Sudeten of India :  and this  may  have   influencedNationalist Hindus to belittle the genuineness of the Sudeten claim.  Again,the British avoidance of war is explained as due in part to anxiety about thepoysibility of maintaining domination in India (and in Palestine) if all theresources of the Empire were concentrated on a struggle for existence.  the moral drawn,  on this aspect, from the settlement varies: in some quarters itis expected that the attitude of Britain,  no longer hampered by the fear ofwar, towards  Indian (and Arab) demands will stiffen: in other quarters itis considered  that  Britain&apos;s  difficulties  are still so formidable that everyeffort will be made to avoid conflict.                     (f) Language in Legislatures.    110. The  Speaker of the Madras Assembly,  following the line given inother Provinces, has ruled that members may speak in any language theylike, even though they are familiar with English, provided that they feelthey can express themselves better in another language.  Telugu  members ofthe Assembly hoped to strengthen their propaganda for the formation of anAndhra province by addressing the House in  Telugu instead of English:the consequence was that other speakers chose to use Tamil, Malayalam ardeven Hindustani.    The result was a babel in which no one could understandanyone else, and the normal practice was by general consent resumed.        VIIL-THE  CENTRAL  LEGISLATURES.                       (a) The Central Assembly.    111. General. The Simla session, lasting from August 8th, to Septem-ber 20th, was mainly taken up with  a highly technical subject, the motor vehicles Bill, but  provided interest in various ways, particularly in partyrelations.   The Congress party strength &quot;remained at 47.  The new muslim league party, under Jinnah&apos;s   leadership, started with  15   members andnumbered 2&apos;6 by the end of the session: it absorbed the old &quot;Independent&apos;&apos;l^arty and most of  the &quot;Democrats&quot;.   Thus in point of numbers taking thesecond place among the non-Government parties, it had several opportunities -ties of asserting itself as the decisive element in matters of keen controversy.This position tested, and  found wanting, the  temper and  tactics of theCongress party.  Most  of  the  serious and steady  legislative  work on thenon-official benches  is done by  the Congress  and European  groups.  TheCongress party was reinforced by the return of the Deputy Leader, Satya-murti, after a period of illness : but the leadership of the  party showed lackof adroitness on several occasions,  and is still distrusted among the back-benchers.   The  sole woman member  of the Assembly made an impressivespeech in the debate on the Indian Military Academy : this,  however, was too fair in tone to  please the party leaders.     112. Legislation.-The Motor Vehicles Bill after a debate extending over three  weeks was passed in a form with which Government need not bedissatisfied.  For  the most part the Bill consolidates and amends the exist-ing law on such details as the licensing of drivers, the registration of motor vehicles, and the control of &quot;transport&quot; vehicles (e.g., motor-buses and lor-ries) and other road traffic.  The provisions for insurance of motor vehicles against third-party risks are not to have effect till July&apos; 1st, 1943.   The Bill naturally attracted the close attention of  interests connected with the motor industry, commercial transport, and insurance:  and received jealous scru- tiny of its effects on the rivalry between roads and railways the former the concern  of  Provincial Governments and  the latter the  concern of the Central Government.
     The Criminal Law Amendment Bill creates two new offences        (a) wilful dissuasion from enlistment in His Majesty&apos;s Forces, and       (b) instigation of mutiny or  insubordination after enlistment. As introduced it was to come into force at once in the Punjab, and elsewhere on notification by the Central Government:  as passed it is left to each Pro- vincial Government to bring it into force.   Other amendments reduced the maximum term  of imprisonment from two years to one year,  arid required the previous sanction  of a Provincial Government to prosecution.   These amendments were moved by members of the Muslim League party and the support of that party was given at the instance of the Premier of the Punjab, whose desire for the Bill  is explained by  the  prevalence in that Province of Congress and Communist propaganda against recruitment.   Apart from the inconvenience of propaganda subversive of public order, the Punjab Ministry is  legitimately interested in the Army as an avenue of employment for the young men of the Province : and modern political developments have increased the determination of the  Punjab to retain its  position as the main recruiting ground.  The  Congress and Ccagress-minded sections of the Assembly bitterly,  and sometimes in seditious terms, attacked a measure directed against the increasing propaganda  conducted in pursuance of the Haripnra resolution which refused to allow the  man-power  of  India &quot;to be exploited in  the interests  of British Imperialism&quot; :  and their rancour grew when  the alliance of the Muslim League  party with Government was declared.   With the support of the European group the motion for con- sideration was passed by 65 votes to 55, and later divisions showed appro- ximately the same  figures.     Other official Bills passed in the session were designed to strengthen the law against cruelty to animals; to  obtain emergency powers to prevent the spread  of epidemics by air; to check &quot;unassisted&quot; emigration, particularly to Malaya and Ceylon; and to prohibit the employment of children under a certain age  in specified forms of labour.     Private Bills tend to aim at reform of social customs :  in  particular improvement in the law of divorce is sought by Bills applying  to Hindus and to  Muslims.  The Muslim  Bill has  raised some communal controversy on account of a clause  providing that the  conversion of a married Muslim woman to another faith shall not by itself operate to dissolve the  marriage: and the House had the unusual experience of hearing opposite views on the Bill stated  (in their personal capacity)  by a Muhammadaii and a Hindu Member of Council.  A private Bill designed, in the interests of the growth and development of the &quot;Indian Mercantile Marine&quot;, to give the Central Government power  to  check  unfair competition  by  prescribing  minimum rates of fare or freight, was referred to Select Committee.  The sponsors disclaim any desire to discriminate between British and Indian  shipping.     113. Resolutions and Adjov,rnment Motions. The  Governor-General and the President again exercised freely their respective powers to disallow resolutions and  motions.   Several adjournment motions on  military affairs, particularly those relating to the Frontier administration,  were  disallowed by the  Governor-General,  whose action called forth the usual protest from the Congress party.  A resolution  asking  that a committee  be appointed to examine the rupee ratio was also disallowed.  The President refused per- mission to some eight or nine motions.     Government started the session well by winning a victory by one vote (with the somewhat unexpected aid of the Muslim League party) on a motion to discuss the appointment of a European expert  as Superintendent  of In-. surance.  A motion about the increased defence expenditure resulting from the new British proposals was  passed against Government: also a motion censuring Government for taking  inadequate  measures to &quot;protect Indians in the Burmese  riots.     A. resolution recommending the appointment of a committee to enquire into  the working of the Broadcasting Department. was  rejected after an animated debate.   The railway administration was severely attacked during a debate on the report  about the train disaster  at  Bihta.   Government accepted in principle  a demand for a committee  to review and  if possible
accelerate the progress in training Indians for the Army  at  the  indian military Academy, Dehra Dun; and lost the division on a resolution asking for a committee to examine the system of financial control of military expen-diture.   During this last debate a statement was made by Government onthe offer of the British Government to increase its Army grant and  to pro-vide a large capital grant; but  this announcement failed to   satisfy theopposition&apos;.     114. Other Business. -From the foregoing paragraphs it will be clearhow great an interest was shewn in military matters : this was reflected alsoin the time taken in  the question-hours :  nearly  150  questions ^coveredground reaching from  Indianisation of the Army to the most trivial details.The Congress  party almost monopolised the  time devoted to questions.:and their concentration on defence affairs must be  regarded as  intended tpunderline the reservation of this subject under the Federal scheme. .     Two incidents deserve mention :-      (a) The Deputy President was in the chair when a division  (expectedto be close) was called during the  debate  on  the   Motor  Vehicles  Bill.Mr. Satyamurti, having recorded his vote, occupied the chair as one of the panel of chairmen in order to enable the Deputy President to vote;  the latterthen rebccupied the chair.  Before the result of the division was announced,the  propriety of  this  device was questioned on  a  point of  order.  A few.days later the President gave  his ruling, for future  guidance, to the effectthat the rule? do not permit the Deputy  President to place a member of the panel of chairmen in  the chair in order that he may record his own vote.The leaders of the Congress and Nationalist parties thought fit to  publish a statement rebuking the President for the expression of an abstract opinion.This impertinence was by implication  condemned  in a statement, agreed between the party leaders and  made by the Leader -of the House,  that itshould not be open to any member to criticise in. any way  outside the Houseany ruling, opinion, or statement pronounced by the President.     (b)  Mr  Satyamurti distinguished  himself on- another-occasion  also.When in the  chair, he pronounced an elaborate ruling to the effect that a-particular clause  of the Motor Vehicles Bill was beyond  the power of theCentral -Legislature.   He brushed aside the plea of the Leader of the house that the decision  on such a point-was not one to be made by the  ^presidingofneerhut to be left, either to the House or to the courts.of law. whatever the;merits ;af the question as regards that particular .clause,  it is a  dangerous precedent  that .a -presiding officer  should  assume the power, open to  no-appeal,-to decide  questions of vires (likely to--,arise, and to be of importance,in interpretation  of the Seventh Schedule of the Government-of India Act, 1935):  and it may he expected that the first opportunity will  ibe taken ;of inviting either President to dissociate himself from the  view-expressed byMr.: Satyamurti.                        (b) The Council of State.    115. A great deal of business was disposed of during the session whichproceeded intermittently from  September 5th to the 22nd.    The Criminal Law  Amendment  Bill was passed, with the,support.ofthe Muslim members, unamended after a single day&apos;s debate.  Here,.as inthe Assembly,  military  affairs attracted much interest.  A resolution to associate the Legislature more closely with the direction of defence policy was defeated;  another,  recommending that  the scheme for improving theconditions  of service of the British Army in India should be opposed,  was withdrawn when it was explained that the matter was still under,discussion;a third, which recommended increased recruitment to the Army from Madrasand other areas not adequatelv represented at present, was defeated.    Many  questions were asked&quot; about  military  affairs.   The Presidentruled out of order an adjournment motion to consider the statement made regarding  an increase in the defence grant by His Majesty&apos;s Government.     The official Bills (except the Motor Vehicles Bill) passed by the Assern-bly came before the Council of State and were  duly passed.
                           APPENDIX I.Resolutions passed  by  the  All-India  Congress Committee,  and by the        Congress Working Committee, at Delhi,  September, 1938.                                   A.                  The All-India Congress Committee.    1. The Central Provinces Ministerial Crisis.-The All-India CongressCommittee approves of the prompt and decisive action taken bv the working committee m the handling of the Central Provinces Ministerial crisis andtully endorses the views expressed by the Working Committee regarding theconduct of Dr. Khare and that of His Excellency the Governor of the central provinces.iri this unfortunate episode.    The All-India Congress  Committee is further clearly of opinion  thatthe conduct of Dr. N. B. Khare since his resignation from the central provinces Ministry  deserves  the  severest condemnation  and  requests theWorking  Committee to take the necessary disciplinary action against Dr.Khare.    2. Federation. As  doubt has been expressed in certain quarters as  tothe attitude of the Congress  on the question of  Federation,  the All-india congress Committee considers it necessary to reiterate the following resolu-tion passed at the Haripura session  of the Congress.      &quot;The Congress has rejected the new Constitution and declared  that             a Constitution for India which can be accepted by the people             must be based on independence and can only be framed by the             people themselves by means of Constituent Assembly, without             interference by  any  foreign authority.   Adhering   to   this             policy of rejection, the Congress has, however, permitted the             formation in  provinces of Congress  Ministries with a view  to             strengthening the nation in  its struggle for independence. In             regard  to the proposed  Federation,  no  such  considerations             apply even provisionally or for a period, and the imposition  of             this Federation will do grave injury to India and tighten the             bonds which hold her in subjection to Imperialist domination.      &quot;This  scheme of Federation excludes from  the sphere of responsibility-             lity vital functions of  Government.      &quot;The Congress is  not opposed to the idea  of Federation; but a  real             Federation  must, even  apart  from the question of responsibility-             lity,  consist of  free units enjoying  more or  less the same             measure of  freedom  and civil  liberty and representation by             the democratic process  of election.  The Indian States parti-            cipating in  the Federation should approximate to the provin-             ces  in the  establishment of representative institutions  and             responsible  government, civil liberties and method of election             to the Federal House.   Otherwise,  the Federation, as it  is            now contemplated,  will, instead of building up Indian unity,            encourage separatist tendencies  and  involve the States  in             internal and external conflicts.      &quot;The Congress, therefore, reiterates its condemnation  of the propos-            ed Federal  scheme and calls  upon provincial and local Con-            gress Committees and  the  people generally, as well  as  the            Provincial Governments and Ministries, to prevent its inaugu-            ration.      &quot;In the event  of an attempt  being made to  impose  it, despite  the            declared will of the people, such an attempt must be combated           &apos;in every way, and the Provincial Governments and Ministries   ?51(S)Hr-.
             must refuse to co-operate with it.  In case such a contingency             arises,  the All-India  Congress Committee is authorised  and             directed to determine  the line of action to be pursued in  this             regard.&quot;    The All-India Congress  Committee  is of  opinion that developments have justified the wisdom of the Congress resolution and warns the BritishGovernment against entertaining the hope that the Congress will ever submit to the  imposition of Federation on the country  against its declared will tothe contrary.    The All-India Congress Committee further declares that the continu-ance of the irresponsible Government  at the centre is becoming intolerableand further prolongation  may precipitate a crisis which all desire to post-pone,  if at all possible.    3. Indian States.-The All-India Congress Committee notes with sor-row and dismay the repression that has been going  on in Travancore forsome days.  The evidence that has come to the  Congress office if it is to bebelieved, goes to  show that the movement led by the State Congress in Travan-core is strictly constitutional and for a constitutional purpose, viz., attain-ment  of responsible Government under the aegis of His  Highness  the maharaja.  The repudiation published on behalf of the State is categorical -ly contradicted by the spokesmen of the State Congress.    In the circumstances  the All-India Congress Committee recommendsto the Travancore Government for adoption  the following  policy,   viz.,assurance on the one hand  that the State  Congress is free to carry on themovement for responsible Government in a constitutional manner; appoint-ment of a committee containing, among others,  representatives of the StateCongress to explore the possibility of granting responsible  Government, andan inquiry conducted  by  a jurist outside the State  of unimpeachable im-partiality  into the recent  happenings including the charges made by theState of provocations justifying  the  State measures  including firing onunarmed people resulting  in  deaths and injuries, and an amnesty  to the prisoners.  .  The All-India Congress Committee regrets that the  Hyderabad  state has issued  ordinances which appear to give to the State power altogether inexcess of requirements.    The All-India Congress  Committee has  also received complaints of severe repression in  the States like Dhenkanal, Talchar and Kashmir.  Inall these cases the people of the  States have  appealed to  the Congress for advice, guidance and help.    The All-India  Congress Committee  can but reiterate its  policy ofnon-interference,  and&apos;,  consistently  with its  resources to help  the people in every way open to the  Congress.   The policy of non-interference  is an admission of the limitations of the Congress.  The Congress policy has been one of friendliness to the States,   In spite of  the declarations of some  Con-gressmen to the. contrary, the  corporate policy of the  Congress so long  as itholds by truth and non-violence must  be one  of continuous attempt to con-vert the Princes to the view that their-true welfare consists in a voluntarysurrender of power to the people so as to brine them in a line with the peopleof the so-called British India,  consistently with the existence of the constitu-tional heads of the respective  States.    4. Palestine. Since  the  Haripura Congress  condemned the decisionof Great Britain  as a mandatory newer to  bring  about the partition ofPalestine in the teeth of opposition of  Arabs and the  appointment of a  corn-mission to carry out this project, the All-India Congress Committee regretsto find that the&quot;same policy is,still being pushed with vigour and relentless-ness.   The All-India Congress  Committee protests against the  reign ofterror that has  now almost assumed the form  of war between the Britishand Arabs of Palestine.    The All-India Congress Committee  trusts  that
Britain would be well-advised in revoking its present policy and leave jews and Arabs to amicably settle the issues between them, and appeals to Jewsnot to take shelter behind British Imperialism.     5.  War Danger.-In the  event  of war breaking out  in  Europe,  theAll-India  Congress Committee  delegates its powers  to the Working Com-mittee to deal with the situation as it arises from time to time in the lightof the Haripura Congress resolution on foreign policy and war danger.&apos;     6. Burma  Riots. The  All-India Congress  Committee  expresses  itsdeep sympathy with the  Indian sufferers during the recent  deplorable riotsthat broke out in Burma resulting in heavy loss of life and  serious injuriesand destruction and burning of property.  The All-India Congress Com-mittee trusts that there  will be thorough  and  impartial inquiry into  the causes of the riots and the amount of damage done to life and property.   Inthe opinion of the All-India Congress  Committee the demolished places ofworship  should  be  restored  and adequate compensation awarded  to  thesufferers unless they are  found  guilty of having participated in the riots.The All-India  Congress  Committee is also of opinion that safety  of  life and property should be assured to the large Indian colony  many of whom have settled in Burma for generations without let or hindrance.    The All-India Congress Committee reminds the great people of Burmathat there  is a long tradition of friendship between  the two countries  andthat the relations  between Burmans  and Indian settlers  have hitherto beeiicordial and  happy.  The All-India Congress  Committee  appeals  to  theGovernment and the people of Burma  to see to it that nothing  is done to disturb the happy relations subsisting between the two countries.    The All-India Congress Committee advises the Indian settlers  to  relymore  upon their ability,  by strictly just dealings, to cultivate  friendship with the Burmans than upon any aid that might be rendered by the  mother country or the Government of India.    7. Bugti Administration. The All-India  Congress  Committee  con-demns the oppressive and tyrannical administration under which  the peopleof Bugti territory  in Baluchistan have since long been suffering at the handsof their tribal head Mehrab Khan.    The Committee is of the view that the British authorities who have assumed responsibility for the welfare of the people of the area have failedto discharge that responsibility.    The Committee calls upon the authorities  to take immediate measuresto stop the present  autocratic  and irresponsible system of administration under which the Bugti tribesmen had to live and suffer all these years.    8. Civil Liberty. Inasmuch as  people including a few Congressmenhave been  found in the  name of civil liberty  to advocate  murder,  arson,looting, and class war by  violent means, and several newspapers are carryingon a campaign of falsehood  and violence  calculated to  incite the readersto violence  and to lead to communal conflicts, the Congress warns  the public that civil liberty does not cover acts of or  incitements to violence or pro-muieation  of palpable falsehoods.   In spite, .therefore, of the  Congresspolicy  on civil liberty remaining unchanged the Congress will, consistently with its tradition,  support measures that may be undertaken by the CongressGovernments for the defence of life and property.                       The Working Committee.    1. Czechoslovakia. The Working Committee has been following withgreat interest the events as they have been developing in Europe.  It views with grave concern the unabashed attempt that is being made by Germanyto deprive Czechoslovakia of its independence or reduce it to impotence.
     The Working  Committee  sends  its profound  sympathy  to  the  bravepeople of Czechoslovakia in their struggle to preserveatheir freedom. Beingthemselves  engaged in a war non-violent but nonetheless grim and exact-ing against the greatest Imperialist, power on earth, India cannot be butdeepely interested. in the protection of Czechoslovak freedom.  The Com-mittee hopes that the better part of humanity will still assert itself and savehumanity from the  impending catastrophe.    2. Dr. Khare. In pursuance of the resolution  passed by the All-india congress Committee  to take  disciplinary action against  Dr.  Khare theWorking Committee before taking any action gave him an opportunity toexplain his conduct but he  declined to avail himself of it.   The  working committee  disqualifies Dr.  Khare from.being a  Congress  member for thenext two years from today; that is, until October the 1st, 1940.  This neces-sarily  involves his immediate  resignation from all Congress organisations and  also from  the  Central  Provinces Legislative Assembly.   accordingly the Working Committee calls  upon Dr. Khare to resign from the central provinces Legislative Assembly.                          APPENDIX II. Resolutions of the Sind Provincial Muslim League  Conference, Karachi,                             October,  1938.     (1) Federation. This Conference, in  the  interests  of  abiding peace Of the vast Indian  continent and of unhampered cultural   development, economic  and social betterment and political  self-determination  of  the Hindus, and Muslims, recommends to the All-India Muslim League to review the entire question  of  what should be a  suitable constitution for India, which will secure an honourable and legitimate status due to the Muslims and further devise a scheme of constitution under which the Muslims may attain full  independence.     This  Conference records its emphatic disapproval of  the scheme of the all-India  Federation as embodied  in the Government of India Act of 1935 and  is opposed to its introduction, and urges upon the British Government to refrain from its enforcement as it considers the scheme to be detrimental to the interests of the people of India generally and those of the Muslims in particular.     That this Conference further  declares that no constitution, by whomso- ever framed, will be acceptable to the Muslims of India unless it conforms to the principle enunciated above and is prepared in  consultation with and accepted by the All-India Muslim  League.     (2) League Ministries. This  Conference offers congratulations to the Muslims of Bengal and the Punjab for their wholehearted support to the present Ministries and condemns  the machinations of the Congress and  a section of other  Hindus and strongly resents their nefarious propaganda against the present Ministries.    This  Conference notes with satisfaction the measures of economic relief, rural uplift  and educational expansion adopted by the Bengal and the Punjab Governments and sincerely prays to God for  their continuance andbless their efforts for improving the condition of the two provinces.    This  Conference makes an appeal to the Muslim members of the AssamLegislative Assembly to maintain  the solidarity of the Muslim communityby remaining together and restore the former Ministry to power with  such changes in the personnel of  the Ministry as may be deemed necessary bythe majority of Muslim members  and other non-Muslim members of their part.
     This Conference makes an earnest appeal to the Pathan Muslim votersof the North-West Frontier Province  to throw out the present GandhianMinistry, to call  upon their representatives to resign  from the congress party and join the Muslim League Party and esatblish  the Muslim LeagueMinistry  in their province.     (3) Palestine. This  Conference,  while praying for the success of the muslim Conference, which is being held at Cairo for a satisfactory solutionof the Palestine problem; is definitely of the opinion that,  to achieve a lastingsettlement, it is highly essential that the British Government should cancel the Balfour Declaration, withdraw the scheme of  partition of Palestine as recommended by the First Royal Commission and confer full independenceupon Palestine.     This Conference warns the British Government that if it fails to abandonits present pro-Jewish policy in Palestine, the Muslims  of India, in conso-nance with the rest of the Islamic world, will look upon Britain as the enemy of Islam and shall willingly adopt all measures  that may be devised by the cairo Conference for the protection and freedom of the Holy Land of Islam.261(B) HD-SI-18*11* J8-91.
