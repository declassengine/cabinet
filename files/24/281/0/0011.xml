i u 9PHIS DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY  OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT)SECRET.                                         COPY NO.CP. 285  (58).                           0 A B I N E T.                   LAW REFORM.           Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor.          In his Memorandum to the Cabinet (CP.  146 (37)),my predecessor, Lord Hailsham, asked, amongst  other things,for authority for the drafting of a Bill to carry out the fifth and Sixth Interim Reports of the Law RevisionCommittee, and authority was given by the Cabinet on the2nd June, 1937.   The Fifth Report (Cmd. 5334  of 1936)dealt with statutes of limitation, and the Sixth Report(Cmd. 5449 of 1937) dealt with the common law  doctrine of&quot;Consideration&quot; and the statutory requirements that certaincontracts should be in writing (e.g. the Statute of Frauds).          It was subsequently decided that the statutes of limitation should form the subject of a separate Bill to becalled the Limitation Bill, and a Limitation Bill was dulydrafted and introduced, and, as there was not  time for itto pass during that session, it has been re-introduced this session.   Lord Hailsham did not proceed with the drafting of a Bill to carry out the Sixth Report.          I have now considered the Sixth Report myself,and in my opinion it would be desirable to carry out withsome modification those recommendations contained in Part Cof the Report  (proposals for changes in the law relating to consideration) and in part D (jus quaesitum tertio).          I therefore desire authority for the drafting of a Bill for  this purpose.                             (Intld.)    M.ouse of Lords,  SuW.l.    9th December,  19380
