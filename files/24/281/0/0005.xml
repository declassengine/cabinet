CABINET.THE BARLEY SITUATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State         for Scotland.1.     I have been considering the Memorandum (C.P.273(38))circulated by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries onthe subject of the Barley Situation, and while I do not wish to comment on it in detail I feel bound to bring tothe notice of my colleagues the present situation in thecase of oats and the effect which his subsidy proposals wouldhave.   On his long-term proposals I have at present noobservations to offer.2.     As the Memoranda attached to the Minister&apos;s paperexplain, the assistance at present available for growers of oats and barley is provided for in the Agriculture Act of1937.  Briefly, that Act provides that growers of oats and barley who elect to receive assistance in respect of thesecrops, instead of in respect of wheat, shall be entitled toa subsidy calculated by reference to the price of oats.  Ifthe average price of home-grown oats falls below a standard price of 8/- an acre, the subsidy per acre is at the rate of six times the difference between the two prices.   This is subject to two safeguards in the interests of the Exchequer.The subsidy must not exceed  1 per acre;  and if the qualifying acreage either of oats or of barley exceeds thestandard acreage fixed by reference to the year 1937, thesubsidy for oats or for barley as the case may be isproportionately diminished.
.3.      It is  estimated that  the  application, of  these pro-visions to the circumstances of  this year1 s crops would., mean a payment for oats  at  the  rate of  about  13/- an acre,  and  fa?barley at the rate&apos;  of  about  10/- an acre,    The Ministerproposes,  in  the  case  of barley  only,  (a) that  the  rate should be increased to  1  an acre, and (b)  that growerswho have  already  decide.ed not to  apply  for barley sribsidy(in preference to wheat) should  be given an opportunity to change  their  mind.   The additional cost of the first  pro-posal  alone would be about . 100,000 and of  both proposalsabotit   300,000.4.      I  fully appreciate  the seriousness of  the barleysituation and the desirability of doing something to meetit.   At  the  same time there are serious difficulties  in-volved  in a modification of  a form of  assistance which isat present available, under-  a single Act, to  two crops infavour  of one  only  of  these  crops0   Such a modificationwould,  I think, only be possible if it could  be shownconclusively  that the  circumstances of the  one  had  changed to a substantially  greater extent than the  circumstancesof the  other  since  the legislation dealing  with them on acommon basis,  was passed last year.    This  I  do  not think  isthe case.   The difference in the import situation as affecting oats and barley is not new.    The increase of thebarley acreage, which has resulted in a &quot;prospective subsidy for bax^ley at  the rate of 10/- an acre as compared with 13/-an acre for oats, y/ould not  in itself   justify on increase  inthe barley subsidy  to   1 an  acre leaving the  oats subsidy  at13/-.  The fall in  price, which is stressed in  the Minister&apos;sMemorandum, has been felt in the case  of oats as well  as inthe case of barley.    As the Minister  indicates, the presentprice of oats  is 5/11d per cwt.  in England  and Wales comparedwith 3/5d per  cwt,  last year.   The price in Scotland  is slightly lower.
5.     I must also call the attention of my colleagues tothe fact that I.have for some time been subjected to verygreat pressure from the National Farmers&apos; Union andChamber of Agriculture of Scotland, from Scottish Membersof Parliament and from other quarters, to introduceamending legislation improving the rate of assistance tooat growers in view of the deterioration in the market for their crop.   The proposals which have been submittedto me are directed to the amendment of the agriculture act in two- main respects, namely, a revision of thestandard price of oats and an increase in the weightof oats per acre on which the subsidy is calculated.While I think it might be possible to resist the formerof these suggestions unless and until the wheat standard price is raised, the second proposition is one which on merits has considerable force.  It is, moreover, thissuggestion which has--attracted the attention of Membersof Parliament and I expect the pressure for its adoptionboth in the House and outside of it to increase.6.     If, in these circumstances, the Minister&apos;s pro-posals for dealing with barley are adopted and nothing is done for oats I feel that a situation will be createdwhich it will be very difficult to hold.  It must beremembered that the importance of the oat crop in Scot-land is far greater than in the case of England andWales.  This is shown by the fact that in the presentyear about 27?t of the whole arable acreage of Scotland was under oats.   And in wide areas particularly in  theNorth East it is the main cash crop.
                                                    9 v)7.     I appreciate that the cost of improving the rateof assistance to growers of oats en the lines proposedby the Minister for barley, or otherwise, would involvethe Exchequer in increased expenditure.  A subsidy foroats at the rate of  1 an acre, for example, would,taking the present qualifying acreage and assuming thatthe payment for this year&apos;s crop under existing legisla-tion will be at the rate of 13/- an acre, cost an addition-al sum of about  445,000;  and if the proposal to givegrowers a right to reconsider their decision on the choice between oats and wheat subsidies were added some additional expenditure would be entailed.  I must, however,for the reasons I have mentioned, urge that the positionof these two crops should be considered at the same time.
