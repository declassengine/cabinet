NOTE  BY CHAIRMAN.    In transmitting this Report to  the Committee of Imperial Defence I wishto state that my Committee has been greatly impressed by the realization of thevast amount of damage to domestic, as well as  to commercial  and industrialproperty, which would be caused in a major air war and the consequent enormousdemands on labour and material necessary to keep even the minimum  essentialcivilian shelter in being,  quite apart from  the operation of essential  services.These needs of the civil population will be vital to the sioccessful prosecution ofa war.  Much replacement ivill be indispensable.  I am not sure  that this pointhas been adequately allowed for in existing estimates of  requirements of  menand material in time of war.                                                      WALTER E. ELLIOT.    December 16, 1938.                                 REPORT.     1.  WE were  set up by the Prime Minister in pursuance of a  cabinet decision* of the 19th October, 1938, with the terms of reference set out on the opposite page.     2.  We have held four meetings, to one of which we invited the attendance of Mr.  S. L. Besso, Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Labour.Emergency reconstruction of and repairs to working-class houses.     3.  This is the first of three items in our terms of reference all relating tothe reconstruction or repair of property essential to the conduct of the war, andmany of the questions to be dealt with  under this head are common to the threeitems.     Two questions  arise on the wording of this particular item.  The first is that only working-class houses are mentioned. We understand that there is no existinglegal definition of a working-class house, although suitable definitions could be devised for England and Scotland respectively on the basis of  rateable value.  Itappears to us that the action to be taken cannot be limited exclusively to working-class houses whatever their definition.  The scheme must in our  opinion clearlyextend to cover repairs to houses of whatever size in  areas in which wholesalebilleting is taking  place,  when those houses are actually in use or are intendedshortly  to be used  for billeting  purposes.     4.  The second point is that the terms of reference include both reconstruction of and repairs to houses.  In order to form any satisfactory conclusions as to theamount of work which it is possible to envisage during a major war it is necessaryto make some sort of estimate as to  the number of houses  likely  to be damaged.Any such estimate will necessarily  be  conjectural.     On the assumption that the enemy may make his  maximum effort at thebeginning of the war the estimate accepted by the Committee of Imperial defence is that the weight  of bombs dropped might be 6,000 tons  during the first weekand  7,000 during the next fortnight.   It has in this connection  been estimatedthat a 500-lb. bomb dropped on a built-up area like London would on the  averagedestroy 8  and damage 92 houses.  If, therefore, every bomb found a previouslyundamaged  target  in  a  closely  built-up area, then in the  first three weeks465,000 houses  would  be totally destroyed and 5,375,000  damaged  out  ofsome 14 million houses in the  country.  But the assumption at the beginning ofthe last sentence is, of  course, extravagant.     In paragraph 4 of their Report the Aircraft and Bombardment committee made an estimate of the value of damage to property.   No estimate by  the AirStaff of the weight of bombs to be dropped after the  first three weeks being available, the Committee assumed that this would be greatly reduced, say 600 tons[18363]* Cabinet 49 (38), Conclusion 13.
         a week against 6,000 tons in the first week.  On that basis the Committee thoughtrJ^A^   the damage to property in the first year might be as high as  15/nillion,  or say         15 per cent, of the total value of the property threatened.   This estimate is based         on the experience of the last war, and it takes account, therefore, of the proportion         of bombs which fall on open spaces or are otherwise harmless.  The estimate does         not allow for the  fact that with more intensive bombing the proportion of  bombs         falling on  areas  already devastated will increase;  against this  may be set the         possibility  that in proportion to  their weight bombs may be more effective than         those used  at the end of the last war, and that some repairs will probably have         been undertaken  in most areas.             If we  apply  the  same percentage,  15 per cent., to houses we should reach         the conclusion  that the  damage  to house property in the first year would be         represented by about 2 million houses totally destroyed, or, of course, by a smaller         number totally destroyed and a larger number partially destroyed.  But this  would         be to assume that there is no selective bombing at all.  The value  of the property         on an acre  of  ground is vastly greater in an  area closely packed  with business         premises, stores and factories than in a suburban area with nothing but dwelling-         houses.  The enemy, however, will be constantly endeavouring  to bomb the most         important areas,  and  it is a reasonable conclusion from the last war  that  bombs         will be more numerous on the City of London and the London Docks than on the         remainder of the County of London, and more numerous on the County of London         than on the outlying parts of the Metropolitan Police district.  Por  these reasons,         if the general  estimate of value made by the Aircraft and Bombardment  Risks         Committee is correct, a figure equivalent to 2 million houses totally destroyed will         in  all  probability  greatly overestimate the damage to house property.             5.  Nevertheless, we think it must be assumed that, during the first 12 months         of a major air war, at least 500,000 houses would be totally destroyed,  or so  badly         damaged  as to call for demolition, and, say, at least another 1,000,000 to 2,000,000         houses would be substantially damaged (i.e., not merely have windows broken).             When we compare these figures with  the peak output of  houses, namely         350,000 houses in one year,* it is clear that even if all the  present  labour and         materials were available in war time, houses of the ordinary type could not be         erected as fast  as  they were being destroyed. There will be demands on building         labour and materials for new munition works,  aerodrome buildings, &amp;c, and for         repairs to property other  than  housing.   In these  circumstances we have come         to the conclusion that it will be necessary  to concentrate the labour available for         housing practically exclusively  on repairs rather than  on reconstruction which         is in the nature of complete rebuilding, in order to keep in continuous use  the         maximum number.of houses. If the number completely destroyed  in a particular         area is so large that more new accommodation is essential, it will almost inevitably        have  to be  in  some  alternative method  of construction  to brick,  e.g.,   wood,         corrugated iron, asbestos cement sheeting, &amp;c.   (Incidentally, in such a case  the        problem of finding accommodation for the persons displaced from destroyed houses         will be serious  and may involve billeting.)            6.  The scheme which we outline later accordingly contemplates only repairs        to houses, and  not reconstruction, and presupposes that any instructions which        may be issued to the persons responsible for controlling the activities of the local        authorities will emphasise that preference in the selection of houses to be repaired        should have due regard to relative cost in labour and materials of the  work to be        done and the value of the repaired property.  A proposal to spend  50 in essential        repairs to a   400 house should obviously be considered before a proposal to spend         100 on a  300 house.            7.   The duty  of supervising and carrying out necessary emergency repairs        should be  imposed on local authorities, subject to such  measures of Government        control as are referred to later.            One of the chief difficulties facing the authorities is likely to be the necessity        of speed.  The  number, of houses damaged sufficiently to let in  the weather may        be very substantial, and in the  interests of the health of their occupants, and to        prevent further deterioration  of the property,  it  will  be  desirable to  effect        temporary repairs  within a few hours.  Roofs, for example, may be damaged in        large numbers.  A tarpaulin or some ruberoid which can be put in place at once            * It is convenient to remember that, on the basis of present output and prices, 100,000 houses        per annum involve expenditure of  40,000,000 and the employment of  65,000 building operatives.
without skilled labour will afford protection to the house and its occupants until more permanent  repairs can be effected.   We considered that  this &quot; first-aid &quot;work for  damaged houses would be so important during a war that we asked asub-committee of technical officers  from the Air Raid Precautions Department,the Office of Works and the Ministry of Health to examine the question and reporton the cheapest and most expeditious arrangements.  Their Report is reproduced in Appendix 1.   It sets out the material and labour  likely to be required  on theaverage for completing &quot; first-aid &quot; work on 100 houses in one week.  The average cost per  house is  put at  8 for materials and  3 for  labour.  These first aidmeasures will be followed up by more permanent repairs as convenient opportunity offers.     8.  As already mentioned, the duty of seeing that  the necessary amount of housing accommodation is kept going should belong to the local authority underthe supervision of the Minister of Health.*  As regards housing for the workingclasses, this duty  is already substantially imposed by  the Housing Act, 1936, and legislation will be necessary to extend it,  as proposed, to larger houses.    Thelegislation might take the following form :       (1) If a local authority are satisfied            (a) that a house has been rendered  unfit for human habitation by                 enemy action but is reasonably capable of repair;           (b) that it is necessary for the  purpose of finding accommodation for                 the population that the.  house  should  be made fit;           (c) that the owner is unable or unwilling to carry out the necessary                 works they shall, subject to the consent of the Minister, carry                 out the  works necessary  to  make the  house  fit for  human                 habitation.     (2) The provision of Section 10 of the Housing Act, 1936, shall apply to the           works as if they were works carried out by a. local authority under           that section, and as if  the house was a house to which that section           applied, but the authority shall have power to postpone the payment           of  any instalments payable under Sub-section (5) of  that Section.     9.  In order to enable the local authority to obtain the necessary money tocarry out the repairs it is suggested that they should be given special borrowingfacilities from Government sources.  There will be no  repayment of capital duringhostilities, and interest, whatever rate may be settled, will be added to capital forthat period.  It may fairly safely be anticipated that a great proportion of theexpenditure, forming as it will a. specific and prior charge on valuable properties,will ultimately be recovered.    The question whether  Local Authorities  should themselves bear any ultimate loss will have to be left to be settled after the war.     10.  The  general scheme will  be that,  in the event of damage  to housing accommodation resulting from air bombardment or other enemy action, the localauthority should,  as  soon  as  possible,  compile  records  of the  damage showingaccommodation which is      (a) totally destroyed;     (6) so badly  damaged that demolition is necessary;     (c) seriously  damaged but capable of repair; and     (d) damaged but capable of repair  at  comparatively small expense.A copy of this record should be sent to the Minister of Health or his local repre-sentative.  (We are clear that  the arrangements made should be  such as to permit of decentralisation, possibly by attaching Housing Inspectors to the offices of the regional  Commissioners  or  other organisations.    But  this  is  a  detail of administrative machinery and need  not be elaborated here.)     The local authority will consider, in consultation with the representatives ofthe Ministry of Health, whether or not  it is essential, having regard to the needsof the population in the area,  that any of the damaged accommodation should be repaired.   In  deciding this question it will be necessary to take into account the accommodation available in undamaged property in the area at any given moment;    * Such  references, in this  Report,  to the  Ministry  of Health,  include  correspondingreferences to the Department of Health for Scotland.
 the liability of the property to further damage if repaired and possible effect of evacuation schemes.  If it is decided that it is essential that certain houses which can reasonably be repaired ought to be repaired, the local authority should,  with the approval of the Minister, arrange for this to be done as soon as possible.   For this purpose it would, of course, not be necessary in every case to refer particulars to the headquarters of the  Ministry, as the Minister could delegate, as circum- stances required, the necessary  authority to his local officers, who would be able to give immediate decisions in  the great majority of cases.   In some eases the owner may be able to effect the necessary repairs with or without a loan from the local  authority.  In other cases it will be necessary for the local authority them- selves to carry out the work.  In either case,  the loan or the cost of carrying out the work would form a registered first charge on the property.  In view of pro- bable difficulties  associated  with the supply of  labour and materials,  the repairs effected should be confined to those necessary  to make the  property fit for human habitation.    To meet  the cost of any works carried out by a local  authority, all  local authorities  will,  with the sanction of the Minister of Health, be empowered to borrow from the  Public Works Loan Board.  Any such loans will be kept distinct from  other loans  so that the total expenditure of any local authority on this work may  be ascertained,  and at a later date  the question of the treatment of  any residual liability remaining with the local authority, after taking into account the charges  remaining on property and the operation of any possible compensation scheme, will be considered.  It is contemplated  that such loans,  though  made through the machinery  of  the Public Works  Loan  Board,  would,  in fact, be financed direct from the Treasury and not from the Local Loans Fund.    11.   The carrying out of this scheme raises certain questions : -    (1) The supply  of  building  labour  and materials. The requirements for &apos;&apos; first-aid &apos;&apos; work have already been mentioned.  We asked another sub-committee to examine  the question of the supply of building materials and the availability of labour for  the carrying  out of  the  more permanent  repairs which will be required, and their Report is  given in Appendix 2.  The general conclusion is that  as regards some of the ordinary  building materials, such as bricks, tiles, slates, plaster and cement, there will be no shortage since there will be a cessation of normal building activities.  There will, however, be heavy demands on timber (for  strutting) and  wood  boards, and  for substitute  repair  materials  like corrugated iron.    As regards  labour,  the great majority of the skilled men in the building industry will have to be kept out of the Forces, and wall be available for emergency work  of one kind or another.   It is clear from the figures given previously for the possible extent of damage to houses alone that there will be more work  than the industry will be able to cope  with, and the order of priority of the various calls on the  industry will have to be settled in particular areas and at particular times by some overriding authority.    (2) The amount of money to be available to local authorities. ^This depends on the amount of  work  which it is possible to do with the  labour available. Figures  must  necessarily be conjectural,  but,  assuming  that normally a  local authority would  not repair houses which were hardly worth it, and  that the average cost per house repaired would be about  50,  a sum of  50 million would allow for the  repair of a million houses.   (Repair work requires  relatively more labour than new  building, and the repair  of 1 million houses at an average cost of  50 each would,  it is estimated, involve the employment of  about  140,000 building operatives for a year.)    (3) We have referred so far to houses answering broadly the description of working class houses on the one hand, and to houses of any size used for billeting the civil population on the other.  The question  remains whether local authorities should be given power to assist by loans or otherwise the owner of a house who satisfied neither  of these categories to carry  out  &apos;&apos; first-aid &apos;&apos; works  or  more permanent repairs of war damage.  There seems no reason at least why a local authority should  not have power to obtain for its citizens permits which they may require for  obtaining building material,  labour, &amp;c.   Small  repairs  properly undertaken  may  result in avoidance of very heavy  damage  to  a property and should therefore be encouraged.  We are not, however, on the  whole satisfied that there  is sufficient necessity  to empower local  authorities  to lend money for thisparticular purpose.
728? Emergency reconstruction of and repairs to essential property by or under the          instructions of the interested Government Departments.      12.  The property included  under this heading is property,  other  than housing accommodation, whose maintenance is essential for war purposes and for which accordingly some Government Department is responsible.  It includes       (1) Government-owned property or requisitioned property and undertakings            (e.g., railways).      (2) Undertakings  not requisitioned or under complete control, such as             (a) Property  belonging to  local  authorities,  e,g.,  public  utilities,                  hospitals;            (b) Public utilities not belonging to local authorities; and            (c) Private property, e.g., voluntary hospitals, bakeries. In  the  case  of  Government-owned  or requisitioned  properties,  the  Office  of Works or the Government Department involved would be directly responsible for the carrying out of repairs of war damage which they  found to be  necessary.  In the case of the other properties, it will be a question of the Department involved ascertaining and approving the repairs to  be executed and  finding the capital where necessary.  As in the case of housing, the general principle  should be that any money advanced for rebuilding or extending a  particular property would remain as a charge on that property.      13.  The possible demands on labour and materials for the execution of the necessary repairs are even more difficult to estimate in  respect of this class  of property than in respect of houses.  In-the case of buildings, such as hospitals, factory buildings, bakeries, railway stations, &amp;c, the same sort of problems arise as with housing.  There will be the same sort of demands for temporary repairs and at a later stage,  when possible, more permanent repairs.  Over 90  per cent. of the properties in  the country  consist of houses, shops or offices,  so that the number  of  houses damaged will greatly exceed the number  of factories, dock- buildings, aerodromes,  &amp;c.   On the other hand,  these  buildings are  larger than houses, and there will probably have to be  a considerable amount  of reconstruc- tion as well as repairs.  On the whole, we  think it would not be wise to assume that the demands on labour and materials for these properties would  be  less than 50 per cent,  of  the  demands  in  connection with the maintenance  of housing accommodation.      14.   There will also be demands on labour and materials for the repair and replacement of plant and apparatus,  e.g.,  gas  mains,   railway  lines.  These demands will largely depend on  the  extent of the air raid precautions works carried out by the different undertakings.   For example, the kind of work being- undertaken for the protection of water supplies is as follows :      (1) Provision of extra spares and  special connections for  rapid repair  of           mains.     (2) Special overhead protection of pumping plant.     (3) Provision of standby mobile pumping plant.     (4) Interconnection of the supplies of different water  undertakers.     (5) Special valves for controlling waste due to burst mains.     (6) By-passes  for  particularly important vulnerable points,  e.g., service           reservoirs.In so. far as these precautions are carried out efficiently, their purpose of  enabling the  service to be carried  on in war  time should be achieved, and demands onmaterial not already  stored  should be  reduced.  It is, however, obviously mostimportant that the trained persons having knowledge of  the situation and useof the special valves, &amp;c. should not be recruited for other purposes.     15.  But here we must draw attention of the Committee of Imperial defence to the point that if great confusion is to be avoided the necessary  arrangements must be made now.  The choice before the government is whether to have somesingb organisation to deal with this work or to rely on the machinery of existingDepartments.   We favour  the latter course because it  seems to us  that  a singleorganisation would be overweighted and lack sufficient expert knowledge.
    The first step is to decide what are the kinds of undertakings which will needhelp.   It must then be decided what Government Departments can best  deal withthem.  As, for example, the Board of Trade with gas works, the Ministry ofTransport with electricity undertakings and so on.  It will be necessary for theDepartment concerned to be responsible (1) for seeing that the damage done isproperly assessed with a view to condensation after the war, (2) to decide  whatrepairs are necessary during the war, (3) for obtaining the necessary priorities formaterial and labour, (4) for obtaining approval for the necessary financial assist-ance, as in many cases it will be quite impossible for the concern to raise  the fundsnecessary from their own credit.  The Department will also, of course, have tokeep in touch with the Regional Commissioners.   It is highly  desirable that theDepartments concerned should be thinking out now the problems which  will arise in their  sphere and will indeed constitute an important part  of their  duties intime of  war.   To  maintain liaison between Departments a  Committee repre-senting each of them will be desirable and might we think be appointed now.  Itappears  to us, moreover, that some legislation will be found necessary  to enablethe Government to obtain the  first charge on the repaired property  and thismatter will also need consideration by some competent body.Emergency reconstruction in other essential  cases.    16.  What is contemplated here is the repair of factories,  shops, offices, &amp;c,which are not directly engaged in business connected with the conduct of the war,but which, nevertheless, serve a useful ancillary purpose and should be  keptfunctioning as far as possible.  We have particularly in mind factories concernedwith the export trades.   The  Aircraft and Bombardment  Risks Committeesuggest that cases of this kind which are not the direct concern of any Govern-ment Department  should be considered by  a special body constituted for thepurpose and that a sum of, say,  20 million might be put at the disposal of this body for  the purpose of making advances to carry out the necessary repairs.   Thisproposal is in line with what is suggested for other emergency reconstruction.Any advance made by  the new body should  be a first charge on the undertaking and there seems to be no reason why interest  should not be charged and be payablefrom the commencement.    In some cases the  assistance required might only be the obtaining  of labourand materials, and for this purpose the new body should have the right of decidingor at least  recommending on the priority of claims.  In so far as the  body willrequire local reports on applications for assistance it seems desirable  that theyshould work through the organisation of the Regional Commissioners.  It may, infact, be found convenient for all concerned that applications should be made tothe Regional Commissioners in the  first instance, who will forward them withobservations to the new body.    We shall be prepared to suggest a suitable constitution for  the new body.    17.  Questions may arise as to whether  it is worth while reconstructing, say.a damaged factory where there  are factories, either in the same locality or else-where, of a similar character which could more easily be- extended or to which the plant and staff from damaged buildings could be transferred.   The possibilitiesof mergers of  this kind should be borne in mind in view of the  shortage of recon-struction labour which will almost certainly occur.The possibility of special provisions to meet the case of Building Societies.    18.  As pointed out in paragraph 10 of  the  Aircraft  and BombardmentRisks Committee Report, Building Societies will experience difficulty from     (a) actual  damage to the property affecting their  security;    (b) loss of  income through falling off of repayments owing to casualties, war           service, damage, &amp;o, and    (c) a rush  of depositors to withdraw their money.    The immediate problem arises under (c) as evidenced during the recent crisis.The problem under (&amp;).can probably  only be met by legislation providing for ascheme modifying the rights  of shareholders of a  particular Building  society in the  light of  the resources of that Society.   The ultimate position of a  Society
will largely depend on how much of its property is damaged and the scale ofcompensation payable.  Their  position will be ameliorated if, as suggested by theAircraft and Bombardment Bisks Committee, the smaller properties receive com-pensation on the highest scale.  War  would almost certainly entail  some losswhich would fall on the shareholders,  but on the average  a shareholder wouldprobably be rather  better off in the long run than if he had invested his moneydirectly in a mortgage because he has  spread his  risks by  operating through a building Society.  It is understood that the  Treasury have these  problems underconsideration at the moment,  and that their proposals to deal with them  may,at some stage,  involve legislation.     19.  The next  two items  in our terms of reference relate largely to actionto be taken at the end of a  major War, and  it  is, therefore,  hardly possibleto indicate, except  in broad outline, the nature of the problems and the likelysolutions.Special assistance to local authorities and public utility undertakings in respect        of damage to their property.     20.  The scheme of compensation envisaged by the Aircraft and Bombard-ment Risks Committee is only applicable to private property.  In  the  case ofproperty belonging to local authorities, public  Corporations and  public utility undertakings some  other scheme is  necessary which will not be based so much on the value of the property  destroyed, as on the cost  of the work necessary toget essential services  properly  functioning  once  more.  A  local authority, forexample, might suffer damage  to or destruction of  public offices, schools, working-class housing  estates, electricity undertakings,  museums,  baths, sewers, &amp;c.Certain essential services may have been patched up during the war,  but muchof the damage  will remain. The local  authority will find themselves faced witha large outstanding debt for  property destroyed, with the necessity  for  freshexpenditure and with a greatly diminished rate  income.   It may  be clear insome cases that the local authority  will no  longer be capable of  functioning asa separate unit, and there will have to be amalgamations and readjustments of areas. Subject to this, the rate of grant  for grant-aided services such as education and Housing will need review in the  light of the demands for reconstructionfalling on  the  authorities,  and the formula  for distribution of the Block Grantmust be examined to see how  it fits in  with altered conditions.  It may be that part of that Grant should be distributed with some relation to the amount of outstanding debt on property destroyed.     In the case of Public Utility undertakings,  the assistance  in lieu of com-pensation might take  the form of a loan  at low  interest (or a grant)  to enablenecessary  works to be effected, coupled with any  necessary conditions as to thelimit of statutory charges  which may be made.The  relation   between compensation  payments  and  post-war  reconstruction        planning schemes.     21.  There are  still only  a few planning schemes  in full operation.  Manyof these cover built land, but  mostly suburbs developed in a fairly open mannerrather than the central areas of towns.   The schemes for the central areas of towns are generally regarded as the most difficult part of a local authority&apos;s area to plan,  and are those generally left  till the  last.  The number of  operativeschemes for central urban  areas is not  therefore likely to increase very  rapidly in the next few years. It should also  be noted that experience of schemes forcentral areas up till the present does not  indicate that they necessarily providefor radical reconstruction of the area.   They are often largely aimed at securinggradual redevelopment on better lines.     The present Model Clauses include a clause, No. 57, which is inserted in alloperative schemes.  The Clause is designed to comply with the statutory require -ments of Section 19 (2) (ii) (c) of the  Town and Country  Planning Act, 1932.The principal part of this is as follows  :         &apos;&apos; Where an existing  building  or a building which  was standing within     two years before the material date is destroyed or demolished, a new building     having no greater cubic   content  above the  level of  the ground and.  in
     addition, in the case of premises used for business or industry, no greater     superficial area on the ground floor may be erected on the same site,  if the     building is commenced within two years after the  destruction or demolition     of  the previous building or  within such longer period as  the Council may     permit.&quot;     It  will be seen, therefore, that where  an existing building is destroyed, theowner,  if he rebuilds within two years of the destruction, is not bound to complywith the planning scheme, though  the local  authority can  require him so tocomply if they are willing to pay compensation.     If, however, the owner wishes to redevelop in accordance with a fresh plan,he must comply with the scheme and there would then be no compensation payable on account of  control of the following matters           Purposes for which buildings may be erected and used;         purposes for which land may be used;         density of dwelling houses;         proportion of site which may be occupied by building;         height of buildings;         external appearance of buildings;         provision of loading accommodation for vehicles.     If, however,  the scheme contained provisions for new  streets, for  streetwidenings or for building lines, compensation would be payable for compliance with such provisions.     22.  The  Aircraft and Bombardment Risks Committee indicate  in  para-graph 25 of their Report that it is necessary to envisage  large-scale redevelopmentof devastated areas after a war.   Such a redevelopment  (different from, and more positive in character than,  ordinary town planning) ought not to be ruined byyielding to the claims of individual owners seeking redevelopment more profitableto themselves,  and it appears desirable therefore that the provisions already citedgiving the owner the right to re-erect buildings should be inapplicable.  Withoutgood reason no buildings should be allowed  to  be erected  or extended in  adevastated area until a redevelopment scheme for that area had been made by theLocal Authority.   Further, it would  probably be necessary  to give the  LocalAuthority the power to acquire compulsorily all or any of the land, the price inrespect  of land,  on which  no buildings still remain being  site value, i.e.,  themarket  value of the site six months before the war.  Individual owners who didnot wish to redevelop themselves  according to  the new plan should be entitledto call upon the Local Authority  to purchase their land at site value.  When an area was dealt with in this way, the compensation for damage to property wouldbe paid just  as  in the case  of  an isolated  property.  How far this will be practicable will depend on circumstances which it is impossible to foresee.     With regard to smaller  areas of damage  where future developments will naturally be on much the same lines as before, the present position is that theowner of an existing building which has been demolished is not compelled tocomply  with planning provisions unless he is compensated  for any injuriousaffection resulting from the infringement or  curtailment of his legal rights inrespect  of the property.   It  may well be, however, that compliance with  therequirements of the planning scheme should be made a condition of qualifying for compensation for damage resulting from warfare, since in the natural courseof things the  redevelopment in the  case envisaged would not impose  any veryonerous conditions on owners.The possibility of imposing an  obligation on property  owners  to carry  out         Air RoAd Precautions measures  as a condition to their enjoying  the         benefits of the Government Compensation Scheme.     23.  The  Committee believe that, generally speaking, it would be very difficultto incorporate precautions to minimise structural damage to existing buildings(particularly those in the  largest class,  viz., ordinary dwelling houses),  and theydoubt whether in such  cases  the benefits of the compensation scheme would besufficient to induce owners to take special measures.  The position in regard to new buildings is different, and the Committee understand that the Governmentare contemplating legislation requiring the incorporation of air raid precaution
measures in certain classes of new buildings.  This seems to the Committee to bethe more satisfactory method of approach because in their view it would be more effective  for such measures  as  may  be necessary to  be enforced by  statutorypenalties rather than by  the withholding of compensation at some  future  anduncertain date, but such questions could more appropriately be considered whenthe details and extent of the proposed legislation are under examination.The  Uthwatt Committee Report.    24.  We were asked to take into account the Report of this Committee, andit may be convenient to give here a brief summary of the Committee&apos;s proposals :         Under existing law in England a general obligation to repair premises    includes the repair of damage caused by enemy action, and may, if the damage    is extensive enough, extend to complete rebuilding of  the premises.        Having regard to the fact that, in the next war, insurance facilities will    not be available, the Committee accept the principle that war damage is out-    side the proper ambit of a covenant to  repair, and that, consequently, any    person who originally accepted the  obligation of repairing  covenants  shall    be relieved by statute from that obligation.        In the case of leasehold property this will not be enough; the parties will    still be bound by the other terms of the lease, including the payment of  rent.    This will place a severe handicap on the lessee, who has to find other accom-    modation  whilst remaining responsible for the lease  of  a house he cannot    inhabit.  The Committee, therefore,  come to  the conclusion that it is not    reasonable that the lease of a house which has by reason of war damage been    rendered unfit for habitation  should remain in force unless one of. the parties    is willing to undertake, as a voluntary  act,  to repair the premises to  such    extent as  may render  them fit  for  habitation.  The  question  of fitness is    important; having regard to the state of war, the Committee consider that    the standard of repair should be below the strict standards of the covenant    to repair.        The Committee consequently suggest the following scheme :         In the event of leasehold premises being rendered unfit for habitation by    war damage, the lessee shall be entitled to elect between retaining his lease,    in which case he  must accept  the obligation  to make the premises. fit for    habitation, or  disclaiming his  lease.   In the latter  event,  the  lease  will    terminate, but  the lessor is to be able to avoid the disclaimer by himself    undertaking to make the premises fit.        If either party undertakes to make the premises fit, the  rent will be    suspended until the work has been completed, although if some beneficial use    can be made of the premises while they are unfit, the Court has power to assess    a suitable  rent.        Any dispute as to fitness or unfitness can be brought before  the Court.        In the case of a single lease the position will be  comparatively simple,    but complications will inevitably arise where there is a chain consisting of a    lease  and several  under leases  all containing  covenants  to  repair.  These    interests are  derived out of the head lease, and, therefore, if the  head  lease    disappears by disclaimer, all the interests  derived  out of it  also disappear.    It is necessary, therefore, that a lessee who disclaims must, at the same time,    give particulars of any under leases or charge affecting his interest, and that    there  should be provision for  confirmation  of disclaimers  by the Court    wherever derivative interests may be affected  by  the disclaimer, and the    owners of  those interests do not agree to the disclaimer.  The Court will be    bound to sanction the  disclaimer in all cases where the  premises are unfit,    and it will have power to make vesting orders for the protection of sitting    tenants who do not wish to disclaim their leases.  The  machinery of retainer    or disclaimer will function as between under-lessors and under-lessees in the    chain in the same  way as between the head-lessor  and head-lessee.        The Committee have considered the extent to which their proposals  shall    apply to other specialised leases.  As regards mining leases and  agricultural    holdings, it is  not considered necessary that they should come within the    scheme of disclaimer or retainer, though the relief from obligation to repair    war damage should apply.                .     &apos;
        As regards ground rents, the general relief from liability to repair war    damage shall apply to a ground lessee, but subject to this one exception the    Committee consider that in the normal case the lessee shall continue subject    to all his obligations  under the  lease.   To  meet  special circumstances,    however, the Committee recommend that he shall have the right to apply  to    the Court for leave to disclaim the lease,  and the Court, in deciding on the    application, shall have regard to the value of the site, the length of the term,    and the period unexpired,  and other relative considerations.        As regards mortgages, it is agreed that the mortgagor shall be relieved    of his obligation  to make good war damage, and that failure to do so shall    not make the mortgage enforceable or accelerate the  date  of payment  of    principal.   The  question  of  the personal  obligation of the mortgagor  is    postponed.        The Court referred to is the County Court of the District, with possible    resort to the High Court.   The Judge shall have power  to  appoint  an    Assessor as a charge on public funds.    25.  After  consideration of  the Report  by the  Committee, the Chairmanwrote to the Lord Chancellor  agreeing that there seemed to be no reason whythe Report should not be published immediately, intimating, however, that theCommittee might have some observations which would affect the  drafting of thenecessary  Bill.   The considerations which the  Committee  had in mind were     (a) that the Bill  should contain provisions covering  the case where damage           was so widespread  that the machinery of notices of  disclaimer, &amp;c,           and applications to County Courts could not reasonably function.  In           the case of a &quot; devastated area &quot; which might contain thousands  of           properties, the  owners of which may be unavailable owing  to death,           injury, &amp;c, it  may be necessary  to  take special measures e.g.,  to           provide in such  a  case that notices of disclaimer  shall have  been           presumed  to have been properly served, and    (b) that the Bill  must deal with the case where a property is made fit by the           local  authority  or  by a  Government  Department  as a  necessary           measure for the conduct of the war.    The Committee also note that the Report leaves the question of the positionof mortgages undefined.    In the case of the million  and more people with mortgages  from a building society it proposes to relieve  the mortgagor  of the liability to  make  good war damage, or to have his mortgage called in.  Apparently, however, he is to continuepaying his usual instalments.    In many cases this will be  difficult, for not being able  to  live  in his ownhouse he  will be paying rent  for accommodation elsewhere.    In the case of a  mortgage not repayable by instalments, the interest on  theamount of the mortgage is still payable.    In both these cases he will, of course, be entitled  to the protection of  theCourts (Emergency Powers) Acts.    The question of  the ultimate relations between mortgagee and mortgagor is left to be settled after  the War, in the light of the amount  of compensation payable.  Perhaps it is as well  to leave the question like this, as the announcementof any definite policy at the present moment might have a very disturbing effecton Building Societies and investors  in house property,  to the  detriment of  thegeneral housing situation.   It seems clear, however, that after  a war in whichthere had been vast destruction of property, the rights  of mortgagees  under  thegeneral law would have to be modified and restricted.     26.   The  Uthwatt Committee recommended, in  view  of the absence  ofinsurability, certain  modifications in the respective rights and  liabilities of twoor more persons with an interest in landed property which is damaged in War. They  accept the principle that  war damage  is outside the proper ambit of acovenant to repair, and that cdnsequently any person who originally accepted theobligation of repairing covenants shall be relieved of that obligation in relation to war damage.  It  has been  suggested that a claim to similar relief should be extended to obligations arising on other classes of property subject  to contracts
in which there may be a question of a legal liability to make good war damage.Examples of these classes are :     (a) Buildings, bridges or ships under construction.    (b) Goods temporarily out of the custody of their legal owner, e.g., partially           manufactured goods  undergoing additional processes to order, goods           in a depository or with a pawnbroker,  and goods in transit  by rail           or road.    (c) Goods on hire purchase.    27.  In the case of buildings, bridges or ships under construction the clientmakes advances to the contractor as the work progresses and the contractor maybe regarded as acting as an agent for the performance of work for the client.Incomplete building work  and materials on a site generally  vest in the client;but, as the contractor may have contracted to deliver up a building, bridge orship duly completed, it  is understood that there is nothing which would  protecthim against a demand that he should make good loss or  damage which might be sustained by enemy action  during the progress of the work.  His loss would bedisproportionate to the financial benefit which he might receive from the contract,and unless he were freed from  the liability he would naturally protect himselfby increased prices.   In cases where the contract requires the  performance ofwork  by  a specified  date the  contractor would  be protected by the  Courts(Emergency Powers) Acts, but in the absence of special protection his liabilitymight revive after the war.    We recommend that a contractor should be relieved  of any  liability to make good war damage.    28.  In the case of goods temporarily out of the custody of their legal ownersit is not possible, without  further enquiry into the custom and practice of thetrade concerned, to say what is the precise legal position in regard to the liability to make good war damage, but,  as the service rendered to the legal owner by thetemporary holder is purely of an agency character, we consider that in all thesecases  no liability should be enforceable on the person in whose custody the goodsmay be.    29.  In the class represented by goods on hire purchase the legal  ownershipremains in the person to whom the purchase payments are made, and there is noreplacement  obligation, though  there  may  in  certain  cases be  covenantsguaranteeing efficient service for stated  periods which  may  be held  to  justifydemands for replacement.  In this case also we suggest that no claim for replace-ment  should be enforceable against the supplier.    30.  We suggest that these  recommendations should  be considered by  expertswith  a view to the preparation  of any legislation which may be necessary.  Thelaw of Scotland differs from that of England in some of  the matters to which wehave  referred,  and  the position of contracts  in  that  country  will   requireseparate consideration.    As  mentioned  above,  the  Uthwatt Committee  note that,  under the irrecommendation in regard to landed property,  the mortgagor  will still  remainliable under his personal obligation to repay the principal moneys, and that thequestion whether there should  be any relief  from that liability raises a point which,  in their opinion, can only be usefully considered at the time when thewar damage to mortgaged property generally is known and in the light of thegeneral economic position obtaining after a war has ended.  In our opinion, theallied question of the necessity for the adjustment of financial obligations accruingafter the date of the  war damage, which may still be enforceable by contract or agreement in regard  to the other classes of property which we have mentioned,should also be deferred  for consideration after the war is ended.
                SUMMARY  AND  RECOMMENDATIONS.                                 Summary.     31.  We summarize our report as follows:  (i) (a)  Emergency reconstruction of and repairs  to working-class houses.     Much of what is  said under this head applies  also to items (b) and  (c),, which likewise  relate to the reconstruction or repair of property essential to the conduct of the  war.     We express the view that the scheme should not be limited to &quot; working-class houses,&quot; but should extend to houses of whatever size in areas in which wholesale billeting is taking place, when those houses are used or are intended soon to be used for billeting purposes (paragraph 3).     We hazard an estimate of  the  number of  houses  likely to be damaged, regarding it necessary  to assume that during the first twelve months of a major air war at least 500,000 would be totally destroyed  or so badly damaged as to call for demolition, and  at least  1-2 million  houses  would be substantially damaged.   Comparing these figures with the peak output of houses we conclude that it will be necessary to concentrate on repairs rather than on reconstruction in the nature of complete rebuilding (paragraphs 5  and 5).    We accordingly outline a scheme for repairs to such houses, to be supervised and carried out by local authorities, subject to  certain measures of Government control  through the agency of the  Regional Commissioners&apos; Offices.  Any loan advanced, or the cost of the work  if  carried out by the local authority,  would form a registered prior charge on the property  (paragraphs 7-10).    We deal specially  with the questions of supply both of building labour  and materials,  having regard  particularly to  emergency repairs with substitutematerials, and of the amount of money  to be available to local authorities.  We are not  satisfied that local authorities need to be empowered to lend money for the repair of houses not covered by our definition (paragraph 11). (b) Emergency reconstruction of and repairs to  essential property by or under        the instructions of the interested Government Departments.    In the case of Government-owned or requisitioned properties the Government Department involved would be directly responsible for carrying out repairs whichthey found to be necessary.  In the case  of other properties  it will be for the Department involved to ascertain and approve the repairs  to be executed,  and find the capital where necessary.   As in the case of housing, the general principle should,  we  feel, be  that  any money  advanced  for  rebuilding or extending  a particular property should remain as a charge on that property (paragraph 12).    The possible demands on  labour and  materials for the execution of the necessary  repairs are even more  difficult to estimate than  in  respect of houses, but on the whole we think it would not be wise to assume that the demands on labour and  materials for  this purpose  would be less than  50 per cent,  of the demands for the maintenance of housing accommodation  (paragraph 13).    We point out that there will also be demands for labour  and materials for the repair and replacement of plant and apparatus.  These demands  will largely depend  on the extent of the air raid precautions  works  carried  out  by  the different undertakings  (paragraph 14).    We point out the advisability of setting up a liaison committee  to ensure a proper  co-ordination of the needs of  the various  Civil  Departments  (para- graph 15). (c) Emergency reconstruction in other essential  cases.    We refer to the suggestion  made by the Aircraft and Bombardment Risks Committee that such  reconstruction  should be  considered by  a special body constituted for  the purpose and that a sum of money  might be placed at the disposal of this body for  the purpose of making advances.  Any such advance should be a first charge on the undertaking and there seems no reason why interest should not be charged and be payable from the commencement.  Applications&apos; for assistance might  well  be  made through the Regional Commissioners.  We are prepared  to make suggestions  as  to  the  constitution  of the  new body (paragraph 16).    We refer to the possibility of some degree of pooling of plant to minimise: the amount of reconstruction required (paragraph 17).
(d)  The possibility of special provisions to meet the case of Building Societies.     We understand that the Treasury have this problem under consideration andthat their proposals may at some stage involve legislation (paragraph 18).(e)  Special assistance to  local authorities and  public utility undertakings in         respect of damage to their property.(f) The  relation between compensation  payments and post-war reconstruction         planning schemes.     These two items  relate largely to  action to be taken at the end of a major war, and it is hardly possible to indicate except in  broad outline the nature ofthe problems and the likely solutions  (paragraphs 19-22).(g)  The possibility of imposing an obligation on property  owners to  carry out         air  raid precautions  measures as a  condition to their enjoying the         benefits of the Government Compensation Scheme.    We  believe that  the  incorporation of structural precautions  in existing buildings  would  be very difficult.   We understand that the  Government arecontemplating  legislation requiring the incorporation of  air raid precautionmeasures  in  certain classes of new buildings,  and  this seems to us  the  more satisfactory method of approach (paragraph 23).(ii)  The Uthwatt Committee Report.    We have taken into  account the report of the Uthwatt Committee which webriefly summarise (paragraphs 24  and 25).    We have considered the possibility of extending relief to obligations arisingon classes  of property subject to contracts, in particular, buildings,  bridges orships under construction, goods temporarily out of custody of their legal owner,and goods on hire purchase (paragraphs 26-30).                             Recommendations.    32.  We recommend      (a)  that in regard to housing accommodation the Ministry of Health and           Department of Health for  Scotland should prepare the appropriate           legislation and organisation as outlined in paragraphs 7-10;     (b)  that  all Civil Departments who may  be  concerned with  emergency           repairs and reconstruction  should            (i)  make the best estimate possible of the material and labour they                 are  likely to require to meet the first twelve months of War and                 submit it to the Board of Trade;          (ii) should prepare  any legislation  which may  be  necessary to  give                 them the power to make the cost  of repairs a first charge on                 the  property repaired; and          (iii) should inform the Ministry of Labour if there are certain key men                 connected with public utilities who must be kept in  their  civil                 occupations;         that a liaison Committee should be set up on which the Civil Departments           should be represented;         that  any legislation necessary for the setting  up  of  the  new  body           suggested in paragraph 16 should be prepared.  This legislation must           make  any loan by that body a first charge on the property;         that  a  Committee should be  constituted  to consider  the  questions           referred to in  paragraphs 26-29  and  to advise  on  the  necessary           legislation.                               Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee :                                                  WALTER E. ELLIOT.     (Signed)     W. ELLIOT \   Joint                 H.

 [E.R.C.  9.]           REPORT OF THE SUB-COMMITTEE ON TEMPORARY REPAIRS. To the Chairman,         Emergency Reconstruction Sub-Committee.     WE, the Sub-Committee appointed under Conclusion (iii) of Minute No. 11, to consider materials and appliances for expeditious temporary repairs, beg leave to submit our report.  ...  1.  We have held two meetings, which were attended by Mr. Sheepshanks (in the Chair at the Second MeetingY, Sir Alexander Rouse (Air Raid Precautions Department), Mr. H. Ryle (His Majesty&apos;s Office of Works), Mr. S. Pointon-Taylor (Ministry of Health) and Mr. H. Symon.     2.  In accordance with our terms of reference, we have confined our attention to minor damage to houses  which would not affect the safety of the structure, but which would render the houses temporarily unsuitable for occupation.  We have borne in mind that the repairs should be quickly  effected in order to restore to a reasonable extent the habitability of the dwellings.     3.  We set  out in Note IA the character of  the damage we envisage whicli will be caused (a) by incendiary bombs and by anti-aircraft shell-fire, and (b)  by high-explosive bombs.  We  indicate in  the Note  the type  of materials  and appliances which will be needed to effect temporary repairs.     4.  In Note 1B we give estimates of  the quantities of plant, materials and tools which will be needed  for the repair of 100 houses.     5.  We also give in Note 1B an estimate  of  the labour  required  if the work is to be completed in one week.  The proportion of  skilled men shown is rather high, but, if they are replaced by semi-skilled men (even under  expert direction), either the work  will take longer than one week or the number of men will have to be increased.     6.  Expressed  in terms of money, the cost of the plant, materials and tools will amount to  8 per house and the cost of labour will be  3 per house.     7.  The question arises as to the multiplying factors to be applied to these estimates when considering the probable scale of enemy operations over the whole country.   These  factors must also be associated with the speed at which repairs are to be carried out.     We understand that the  statement has been accepted  that a  500-lb. bomb dropping in an area of houses at a density of about 40 to the acre (i.e., the normal London density) would affect  100 houses, demolishing  8 and more  or  less damaging the remainder.  It is  obvious,  bearing in mind the  total number  of dwellings in the country, that the scale of operations will  be  affected  by (1) the dispersion of the dwellings, (2) the liability to attack, (3) the numbers  and types of bombs, (4) the number and periodicity of the raids, and (5) that the same houses may be affected repeatedly.     For a rough estimate, let us assume (without knowledge) that 30,000 houses are to be repaired per week over the whole country.  The multiplying  factor for plant, tools and  men is then 300.   The multiplying factor for materials per year at the above rate would be 52  x  300, but probably this can be reduced to,  say, 5,000 (that is, 500,000 houses per  year) if, as expected, the scale of attack  will not be maintained at anything like the high initial level of the first month of war.     On this final assumption, the overall estimate of cost per year may be set out as follows :-           Plant, tools.           Materials.              Labour.            90,000             2,600,000              1,500,000                        (Signed)      T. II.  SHEEPSHANKS,                                           On behalf of the Sub-Committee.    Richmond Terrace, Whitehall, S. W. 1,             November 9, 1938.
                                   NOTE 1A.                Character of Damage and Materials for Repair. 1. Damage by incendiary bombs and the effects of anti-aircraft shell fire.     The principal damage in this case would be holes in the roof.     Tor very  temporary repair of holes in the roofs there should be stocks of tarpaulins, spare cordage, weights, pegs, &amp;c.  For slightly more permanent repair, flat  asbestos cement sheets or roofing felt which could be placed  on the battens under the tiles; or  corrugated asbestos cement sheets or corrugated iron which could be placed over the tiles.     For damage to the roof timbers there should be stores of timber for strutting and matchboarding.     Stocks of  ladders, rope and tools will also be required. 2. Damage by high explosive bombs      (a)  Windows. It is considered that most damaged windows  would have to be temporarily repaired with opaque material, such as, wooden boards, wallboard, jute, roofing felt, and that some could be  repaired  with material admitting a certain amount of light such as muslin, cellophane, stout greaseproof paper.  For fixing these materials a stock of laths and nails will be required.     These provisions apply both to windows in which the glass only is damaged and  to windows where the frames also are damaged.     (b) Doors. For  the repair of  damaged  doors  there should be stocks of corrugated iron, matchboard, wallboard, plywood and timber, together  with tee hinges and butt hinges to hang up the temporary doors.  Blankets also would be useful as a temporary measure.     Stocks of ready-made doors should also be  considered.     (c) Walls. There should be stocks of timber for strutting.     Tarpaulins  and  corrugated  iron should  also be stocked for temporarily blocking wall spaces.     (d) Services. For minor repairs to the services there should be stocks of gas- piping and fittings; lead and iron waterpipes and fittings,  electric cables and fittings.     As regards  drainage there should be stocks of emergency  conveniences for use in case the  individual drainage system of the house is damaged, or the sewers are put out of action.     A stock of stout iron hutments of the elephant or mine gallery types shouldbe kept, which  could be erected either in rooms in dangerous houses or in suitableplaces near them.

WE, the Sub-Committee appointed under conclusion (ii) to Minute No. 11 toconsider the question of supply of building materials for reconstruction purposes and  the availability of labour in relation thereto, beg leave to submit our report.     1.  We  have held  one  meeting,*  when we had before us a note by Mr.Fennelly, of the Board of Trade, on the control of building materials (which wereproduce as Note 2A), and heard a statement from Mr. Besso, of the Ministry ofLabour, on the supply of labour (now incorporated in a memorandum approved bythe Control of Man-Power Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence,and  reproduced as Note 2B).     2.  It appears to us unlikely that there will be a lack of supplies of certainordinary building materials (such as bricks, tiles, slates, plaster, cement) for recon-struction purposes, owing to the cessation of normal building activity.  On the otherhand, there will be increased demands, particularly for timber (for strutting) andwood boarding, and for substitute repair materials such as corrugated iron sheets,asbestos  cement,  roofing felts, tarpaulins, and miscellaneous fittings.   Some ofthese materials may be in the raw state (e.g., asbestos cement) and some finishedmanufactured  products  (e.g., tarpaulins).  The consideration of these materialshas been remitted to the Sub-Committee of Technical Officers to be convened byMr.  Sheepshanks, and we suggest that this Sub-Committee be asked to make thebest  estimate they can  of the  materials, raw  and manufactured, that will berequired  for the first 12 months of  war, not merely for  immediate  temporaryrepairs,  but  also for reconstruction  purposes.    This estimate should then becommunicated  to the Board of Trade, so that these important civilian needs maybe included  in the  supply  plans and consideration given  to  the  desirabilityof accumulating in advance  stocks of  materials of which supplies may not be readily available.     3.  As regards labour, we  assume  that the materials for temporary  repairswill  to the greatest possible extent be so selected that the repairs can be effected bysemi-skilled labour under expert direction.  If so, there may be no shortage of personnel. It appears to us that it would be helpful if the emergency organisationprovided  for the employment by local authorities of repair gangs, in addition tothe &quot;demolition squads,&quot; suggested  (we understand) for A.R.P.  arrangements should also be made for mutual assistance to be given by neighbouring localauthorities.  The size of such  local authorities&apos; staff will naturally  depend  oncircumstances.   There may be need to give special consideration  to the provisionof labour that can be moved rapidly to different parts of the country.   * Present :  Mr.  B. H. Hodgson  (CHAIRMAN),  Mr.  H.  H.

    4.  We would emphasise  that an  essential  matter  is  the  settlement of priorities for various services, both as  regards  materials  and  labour.   the priorities may need to be co-ordinated nationally  and applied regionally.  Thescheme for priorities was drawn up in 1927 by the Committee of Imperial Defence(C.I.D.  Paper No. 806-B).  We  would urge that civilian needs  in relation toemergency reconstruction should  be properly represented therein.                                     (Signed)     E.  II. HODGSON,                                           On behalf of the Sub-Committee,                                                  November 7, 1938.    Richmond Terrace,  S.W. 1,         November 9, 1938.                                  NOTE 2A.                      CONTROL OF BUILDING MATERIALS.            Memorandum  by Mr. R. D.  Fennelly, Board of Trade.     1.  THE  &quot;control&quot;  of building  materials  may be considered under the headings  of:          (i) Conservation and maintenance of supplies;        (ii) The control of price.     2.  Conservation and  maintenance  of supplies. The Board of Trade are charged by the Committee of Imperial Defence with the preparation of plans for the conservation and maintenance of supplies of  essential materials in time of war.   In  the  preparation of  these plans,  they  have interpreted &quot;essential materials &quot; as meaning more than raw materials  and as including  the primary products produced from the raw materials, e.g.,  leather, paper, sulphuric acid and cement.   The plans for the supply of finished  articles  are  in  course  of preparation by the various  Supply  Committees of the Supply Board.  Supply Committees naturally look  at this problem mainly from the point of view of the Defence Departments, and  are engaged  in the task of identifying manufacturing capacity and,  where necessary, of allocating it between the Service Departments. The Board of Trade are represented on these Committees, where their function is to ensure that in any allocation which takes place,  essential civilian needs are not overlooked.  It has also been agreed that in cases where some control of a finished article is necessary, this should be undertaken by the Service Department which was the greatest user, but this decision was based on such finished articles as steel wire rope  and non-ferrous tubes, where service requirements were heavy in relation to  total available capacity.   For the general run of ordinary manu- factured  goods as distinct from ad hoc  war stores,  the  Supply  Committee concerned have found no shortage of  manufacturing capacity, and the question of control from that  angle has not arisen.   Looking at  the matter, however, from the angle of raw material supplies, some control of, at any rate, certain classes of manufactured goods may be necessary, but how far down the scale of processing- control should extend can only be decided in the light of the circumstances at the time.  Meanwhile,  the Board have  assumed that  whether any controls of this nature which became necessary would be administered by the Ministry of Supply (which it is proposed to set up to deal with essential materials) or by some other Department, it  is  their duty to prepare the necessary plans  so far as this is possible.    3.  The recent crisis has brought  to  light the heavy demands for certain types  of  materials and manufactured  goods which would  be  made at  thebeginning of an emergency (if  supplies have not  previously been accumulated)by the Departments dealing with the various aspects  of civil defence.   Possiblysufficient account of these demands has not hitherto been taken by the PrincipalSupply Officers Committee,  and the Board of Trade are asking  the  various departments concerned to furnish them with the best estimates possible of theiranticipated requirements.   Building materials would clearly fall under this head.
     4.   In planning for the control of essential materials in  an emergency, it is not  possible to do more than  create a  skeleton organisation out of  trade associations, commercial bodies, &amp;c, which can be expanded fairly rapidly to undertake any degree of control that may be decided upon.   The actual controls which would be put into operation immediately in an emergency would not be many in number and would vary considerably in character; they are  all designed to hold the position until the new control organisations are ready to function, and for the rest it has been  found that it will be possible to rely upon the voluntary co-operation of the trades concerned to hold the position for the time being.     5.   There are, in general, ample supplies of building materials in  the country, and the problem in  an emergency would be (a)  to get them to places where they were wanted, and (b) to ensure that there was no undue rise in price,  (a),  apart from questions of priority as between service and civilian requirements, is largely a transport problem, and involves questions of  priori of carriage,  which must be discussed with the Ministry  of  Transport.   Obviously,  in the early stages of an emergency, when very heavy demands will be made  on  available transport in crowded centres of  population  for evacuation and feeding purposes, it may be that,  if  the working of emergency reconstruction  is to be carried out rapidly, the only solution would  be for local authorities  to accumulate stocks  of essential materials.    6.   Control of price. The  materials which must be considered are probably cement;  timber and  builders&apos; woodwork; bricks, tiles and slates; asbestos cement products;  cast-iron  pipes,  gutterings, &amp;c.;  zinc  sheets,  gutterings,  &amp;c.; lead pipes, &amp;c.;  sanitary earthenware, window glass, roofing felt  and  tarpaulins. Notes on these commodities are annexed.   It will be seen that, either through Government control or by voluntary co-operation of manufacturers, there is  every reason to believe that the manufacturing price can be  held.  The real problem, where local authorities do not obtain their supplies direct from manufacturers or first holders, is to ensure that the builders&apos; merchant does  not take advantage of the position.  It would probably be possible to  lay down prices by Orders  made under the  Defence of the Realm  Regulations,  but, having  regard to  transport conditions, quantities, &amp;o, this  would require considerable working  out, and at the beginning of an emergency perhaps the best  safeguard would  be (on  the assumption that manufacturers were prepared to hold prices) a public announce- ment  that there was  for  the time being no reason why prices should rise.  It may also be  possible  to obtain the assistance of a  body known  as  Distributors  of Builders  Supplies Joint Committee, which covers the following bodies :          Associated  Builders Merchants, Ltd.         Association of London Sanitary Specialists.         British Federation of Plumbers Merchants Association.         Builders Merchants  Alliance.         Builders and Plumbers Merchants Association.         National Federation of Builders Merchants.         National Federation of iron mongers  (Wholesale  section). They  have recently made an offer, arising out  of the crisis, to  co-operate  withthe Government in any way, and  the Air Raid Precautions  Department of  the Home Office and the  Board of Trade have agreed to meet them in the near future to  discuss  the position a meeting to which the Ministry  of Health might also send  representatives.                                                 (Initialled)       R. D.  F.    Board of Trade, S. W. 1,       November  5,  1938.                            ANNEX TO NOTE 2A.             Notes on the Control of Prices of Building Materials.1.  Cement.    All the cement manufacturers apart from one small works are  combinedin the Cement Makers Federation, which, amongst other things, regulates prices.Sales are made to the merchants on the basis of 4-ton lots at regional prices based
 on the locality of works and transport costs, but the price which the merchant charges naturally varies with the quantity  sold.   The Federation have agreed ^voluntarily to  hold;prices in an emergency  and to assist in the diversion of supplies to particular areas.  Most of the big local authorities, it is understood, purchase direct from the manufacturers, although the price is the same as that at which the merchant obtains his supplies.     Capacity is available for the production of 10 million tons a year, of which 25 per cent, is not at present used.  Many of the big works, however, are centred in the  Thames-Medway area,  where  considerable damage  by  air  raid; is  a possibility. 2. Timber and Builders&apos; Woodwork..     The Board of Trade propose to issue Orders under the Defence of  the Realm Regulations at the beginning of an emergency, prohibiting all dealings in timber either  in the United Kingdom or entering the country after the date of the Order, with the proviso that holders are at  liberty to make sales or deliveries of timber up to 10 per cent, of their stocks. A further Order laying down a schedule--of maximum  prices will be issued as soon as possible thereafter, and these prices will apply retrospectively to all dealings which take place under the first Order. As soon as the Control organisation is ready to  function, a further  order  will be issued requiring users to obtain a permit from the controlling authority (with a saving for small purchasers).     It is important for the Board of Trade  to be furnished with an estimate of the probable  consumption of timber  (if possible by kinds) in emergency recon- struction.   They had rather assumed that in war  the consumption of timber for domestic purposes would fall considerably, and from the point of view of saving essential shipping  space, it is very  necessary to  reduce our consumption of imported timber as much as possible and rapidly to develop home-grown supplies. 3. Bricks, Tiles and Slates.     No approaches have yet been made to  the manufacturers,  but there is no reason to suppose that they would not hold prices. 4. Asbestos Cement Products.     From the discussions which the Board  of Trade have had with Turner and Newall, who largely control this trade, on the subject of control of asbestos itself, no difficulty  in arranging  for  prices to be  held at a reasonable level from the manufacturers&apos; end is anticipated. 5. Cast-iron Pipes, Gutterings, &amp;c.     Allied Ironfounders and others have been approached in connection with the general question of the control of iron and  steel, which will, at the outset of an emergency, be carried  out voluntarily by the British Iron and Steel Federation, whose  members already work to  scheduled prices.  Allied Ironfounders have agreed to work with the Federation and no  difficulty over price should arise. 6. Zinc Sheets, Gutterings, Corrugated Sheets, &amp;c.     The Board of Trade  propose to make an  Order controlling the  price of zinc and making deliveries, unless under existing contracts, subject to a permit. The rolling of zinc sheets is  in a few hands, and no difficulty over  the manu- facturers&apos; price should arise.  Equally, the British Iron and Steel Federation will be prepared to hold the price of corrugated sheets. 7. Lead Pipes.     The Board of Trade propose to make an Order at the outset of an emergency controlling the price of lead, and making deliveries, except under existing con- tracts, subject to a permit. On this basis, the lead-pipe and sheet manufacturers, who are highly organised, will no doubt agree to hold the price of their products. &apos;8. Sanitary Earthenware.     This question has not been investigated,  but there is no  reason  to suppose that the sanitary earthenware manufacturers, who are well organised, would not be prepared to give the necessary undertaking.
9.  Window Glass.    This will have to be discussed with, the Glass Manufacturers&apos; Federation, whohave already offered their full co-operation with the departments concerned on&apos;glassware generally.  The manufacture of window glass is in few hands.10. Roofing Felts.    The great bulk of the production is in a few hands  and the trade associationconcerned,  The British Roofing Felt Manufacturers&apos; Association, is  fully repre-sentative of the industry.  If, as is quite probable,  this Association can be persuaded to give the necessary undertaking the position  will be quite satisfactory.11. Tarpaulins.    The Association which covers this industry is the Association of Makers ofMade-up Textiles, but there are a considerable number of makers of tarpaulinsand it is doubtful whether this Association covers all  the  important producers.However, it may be that discussion with the Association  will result in an arrange-ment  which would deal with the position  satisfactorily.                                 NOTE 2B.[N.S. (CM.) 38]           SUPPLY OF BUILDING TRADE LABOUR IN AN EMERGENCY.                      Note by the Ministry of Labour.(As approved by the Sub-Committee on the Control of Man-Power N.S. (CM.)                               12th Meeting.)    THE Ministry of Labour has drawn up a Schedule of Reserved Occupations,which is a list of occupations with ages  attached to each. In effect, no one wouldbe allowed into the Forces who was covered by it and over the specified age for hisoccupation.  The main object of the Schedule is to secure  that there is  as littledislocation as possible in essential industry, while providing for the allocation to the Forces of adequate numbers of skilled tradesmen.  The building  industryis very fully protected by the Schedule,  and will be able to count on the retentionof the great majority of its skilled workmen during the first twelve months of anemergency.    The Employment Exchange service would function in regard to the supplyof building  trade labour, and through  the network of Exchanges would be ableto provide for the movement of men from one district to another as required.    The draft Control of Employment Bill would extend  the normal powers ofthe Employment Exchanges.  It would     (a)  prevent the engagement of labour in specified industries otherwise than          through an Employment Exchange (or approved agency);    (&amp;)  provide for a scheme of war work volunteers to be put  into operation;          these would be  skilled men who  had  pledged themselves  to work          wherever required;    (c)  empower the Ministry of National  Service to require  employers  to          discharge men from less essential  work in order that they might be          offered employment  in more urgent work.    The above plans are designed to enable  the building industry (as well as other industries) to cope as successfully as possible with the tasks that may beplaced upon it in an emergency.    It  is of course impossible to say whether  the  labour available  would be adequate to meet all requirements  until the extent of the requirements is known.There will certainly be considerable demands for  building labour  for the  erection of new war factories and the extension  of existing factories, and  also for repairs to houses and other essential property damaged by air raids.  On the other hand,a great deal of normal building will cease.
    If the Ministry of  Health (and other Departments concerned)  can provide an estimate of the number of (a) houses and (&amp;) other types of buildings erectedduring 1937, and the numbers in course of building at the end of that year, andif they can also provide comparable estimates of the  numbers of houses and ofother  buildings to be erected in the first year of an emergency, together with  anestimate of the amount  of repair work to be done, it should be possible for theMinistry of Labour to  form a judgment as to the adequacy of the  available supplies of building trade labour.
