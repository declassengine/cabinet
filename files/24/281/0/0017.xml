             PART I. GENERAL REVIEW.                      Industrial Policy.  i. In my last Report I stated that the next period of twelvemonths would  probably  be  chiefly concerned  with pushingforward work already started, rather than beginning new organi-sations or developing fresh activities.  This forecast has provedcorrect, and the activities of the Department have been devotedto continuing the work previously  begun and making extendedefforts to induce new industries to come into the Areas.  2. With  this  object in view various methods have been em-ployed since the Special Areas organisation was established, all of which have  proved effective but not all to the same extent.The first method employed was, under the 1934 Act, the provi-sion of the Trading Estates on which the  manufacturers hadnot only the advantage of newly built factories,  but were also provided with such general services and facilities  as are usuallyavailable  on properly equipped Trading Estates.  experience has proved that attractive estates, such as those at Team Valleyand Treforest,  are  capable of securing a  very considerableamount of support.  The progress made is very satisfactory and,given time, there is every reason to  expect that the  estates willprovide a  large amount of work for those living in the neigh-bourhood.  3. It soon became evident  that large districts  such as thoseof South Wales and Durham  could  not be served by only oneestate  and that attempt must be  made to  induce industry  togo  to other places in the Areas.  Under the Act  of  1937  I wasgiven  power to let  factories  outside the Trading Estates andI  have exercised these powers  by  providing  factories  on  anumber olf sites, including several which  can   accommodatemany undertakings  such as the Solway Estate, Maryport, andthe sites at Pallion, St. Helen Auckland and Dowlais.   Somesites were  acquired in the first place for the clearance of indus-trial ruins and I have thus been able not only to improve the amenities and  attractions of districts forsaken by the industry on which they were previously dependent,  but also to providethe means for  new industrial  employment on cleared sites.   Atthe end of September, twenty factories were occupied or in pre-paration  in certain  districts  outside  the  estates,  where  theproblem of unemployment has been most intractable, includingthe Rhondda Valley, Dowlais, South West Durham and Cleator,West Cumberland.   4. This  power to provide factories has been of the gratest value, in  view of the absence  in most parts of the Areas of modern buildings suitable for light industries.  It is, of course,an indirect form  of capital assistance as it frees funds  whichwould otherwise be required  for buildings, and  is therefore of
more lasting benefit than the contributions towards rent, ratesand taxes for  a  short period of years, which  I  was also em-powered to make under the Act of 1937.  This inducement has,however, been of special use in attracting industry to the smallersites.  In this respect West Cumberland is a good illustration ofa place requiring inducements on  account of its  distance fromlarge markets and of other difficulties.  On the other hand, it hasin these days of wars and rumours of war a great advantage by virtue of its geographical position, and the road  and rail services could be  improved if the Government once decided that in  thenational interest changes should be made.  5. In addition to the powers to provide factories and to offerinducements,  the assistance which has  been available towardscapital, either  in the form of a loan or by taking up shares ordebentures, has been of special value in establishing new indus-..tries.  As stated  in my last Report, there are three funds avail-able, the  Nuffield Trust, the Special Areas Reconstruction Asso-ciation and the Treasury Fund.  Funds such as these may haveto lay themselves out to  take bigger risks than those run by theordinary  finance house or investor; if they did not do so therewould be less reason for their existence.  If the  undertakings setup  with  their  assistance prove  successful and  there is good reason to believe that they will it would indicate that there isa need for continuing to provide special facilities for financingnew industry.  Many of the concerns are small and in spite oftheir potential possibilities they would  find it difficult to obtainfinancial  support through ordinaty channels.   The question isimportant,  therefore, not merely for the  future  of the SpecialAreas but also for the full exploitation of new invention and new opportunities  of  employment.   It  is particularly  important forthe Special Areas, and indeed any area which is in need of agreater variety  of employment.  6. Already in certain  quarters  criticism has  at times been directed to the financial S3&apos;stem, pointing out that the facilitiesfor providing capital for small industrial  enterprises are not asreadily available as they should be. It is not the  place of banksto lock up  their  resources by providing money for capital pur-poses such  as these firms require.  They give advances to grow-ing concerns  to  tide them  over a period of industrial growth,but they  anticipate that in a reasonable period  the industry  will find from other sources the new capital required.   7. The weight of taxation is making it much more difficult tobuild  up large private fortunes,  such  as this country witnessedabout fifty years ago. The owners of these fortunes, who wereoften  themselves large employers  of labour, used their savings to develop new  industries.   Now  that the private individual isbeing largely replaced by the joint stock company, it seems asif new organisations are required to make capital more easily
available for the smaller business man, who still plays a usefulpart in many industries  and should be encouraged,  ft is, I amaware, a very easy matter to lend money, as there are so manyanxious to secure advances whose concerns are quite unworthyof support, but it is a loss to the country, if there is a genuinedemand for capital by men able to make good use of it, for that demand not to be supplied.  8. Elsewhere in the Report (paragraphs 97 to 105)  I give a full account of the administration of the provisions made in the SpecialAreas (Amendment) Act, 1937, for the encouragement of newundertakings in the Special Areas.  I have been able to exercisethese  powers for a period  of  sixteen  months, and  I  feel that,especially in view of the conditions which have obtained duringthe year, the time  is too short to enable any final conclusions tobe drawn as to the real value of these provisions.  The period inquestion has seen the continuance and intensification of the traderecession which was already becoming apparent at the time ofmy previous Report as shown, for example, by the increase ofunemployment in September, 1937, and the reduction in the ship-building programme referred to in paragraph 141 of that Report.In view of these conditions the progress which has in fact beenmade in the establishment of new industries in the Special Areasin a comparatively short period is all the more satisfactory.  9. The Royal Commission on the Geographical Distribution ofthe Industrial Population has not yet reported; if it should reportin favour of  definitely restricting the continued growth of citieslike London and Birmingham, this restriction will in itself bringassistance to the less  prosperous parts of the country.  In thisconnection also I  may  refer to  what  was said by Sir MalcolmStewart in his Third Report about the urgent need for control inthe national interest of the growth of London, and the betterdistribution of industrial activity.  It is to be hoped that, even inadvance of the report of the Royal Commission on the Distribu-tion of the  Industrial Population, something may  be done by voluntary means to correct the tendencies for new industries toestablish themselves in the London area.   10. Even if some help to the Special  Areas is  immediatelyforthcoming as a result of restrictions on the growth of London  Ithink it would be a  mistake  to reduce  the  powers at present available for carrying on the important work of encouraging new industrial activity in the Special  Areas.   The  money  in  theNufneld Trust is largely disposed of but the other funds should,in my opinion, be carried on.   The  Special Areas continue topresent a serious problem of a working population in  excess ofthe present employment capacity in the Areas;  one cannot expect that problem to be solved by short term methods.  Industry mustbe induced to go to these places or the people must be removed ;the first is obviously the better solution.
  ii.  I  am glad therefore that the Government has decided toextend the Special Areas Acts for another year.  The results ofthe efforts to induce industries to come to the Special Areas areonly just beginning to show themselves and I intend that thework  should proceed  with unabated energy.                       Employment.  12.  Unemployment in the country generally has shown a sub-stational increase in the course  of the twelve months under re-view, though it is a notable fact that the Special Areas have not shown such a serious proportionate increase as other parts of thecountry, and  on Tyneside there has been a slight  decrease.Detailed figures are  given later in the  Report.    In previous reports reference has been made to the  steadily increasing out-put per man in the heavy industries, which provide so large  apart of the employment in the Special Areas, and to the possibleconsequence of a reduction in the volume  of employment.  Thegeneral subject has now been  examined in detail  in a  memo-randum published recently by  the London  and CambridgeEconomic Service under  the title &quot; Output, Employment and wages in the United Kingdom, 1924, 1930, 1935 &quot;.  The  effectof this development is a matter which, in  my opinion, deservesthe closest attention of the Government  Departments concernedwith  employment and industry.   13. In some quarters  disappointment has been  felt that theintroduction  of light  industries into the Special Areas has notresulted in the employment of a higher proportion of men.   Themain difficulty in solving the unemployment problem in theAreas has been due  to the fact that in the past the Areas havebeen dependent largely on one or two heavy industries, e.g. coal-mining, iron and steel and ship-building.  There has been com-paratively little variety in the types of employment  provided andthe demand has been predominantly for  male labour.  In the South  and  Midlands, however,  there  is  a greater variety  of employment for  both men and women, and a great deal of the new  industrial development has  been in  light industries which employ a higher proportion of female labour than the heavy industries.  This contrast is readily illustrated  by the  figures, given in paragraph  108,  of the proportion  of men and women insured under the Unemployment Insurance Acts in the London, South. Eastern and Midlands Divisions of the Ministry of Labour, as compared with Wales and the Northern  Division.    It is inevitable that the introduction of new light industries  into the Special Areas  should result in a  change of habit in some  of the coal-mining districts where it has not been customary in  the past for women  to take industrial employment.  It is no part  of my deliberate policy to encourage industrial employment for women in the Special Areas to the neglect of employment  more  suitable
for men, but it must be recognised that my powers can be exer-cised only in respect of employers who are willing to  establishnew undertakings in the Special Areas, and that a good deal ofthis new industrial development is of the light industry type.                     Training Facilities.  14.  I am glad to say that the progress made in providing new opportunities for employment  for men has been  sufficient tojustify the Minister of Labour  in making special arrangementsfor new training schemes to meet local needs.   Hitherto, indus-trial training has been largely  bound up  with the  transference of people from depressed areas to the more prosperous parts ofthe country.  With  the development of new industries in theSpecial Areas, however, it has become possible to  consider theprovision of training facilities  to assist unemployed persons toobtain work in their own districts, particularly in new industries in which there has been no previous experience in the locality.I am glad to  know that this need for local training  has  been recognised  by the establishment of local  centres for short pre-liminary training courses on the Treforest Trading Estate and atOakdale (Monmouthshire),  and at Wallsend, at Spennymoorand on the  Team Valley Trading Estate, the last-named beingalso designed to provide  special training  for women factoryworkers.  Discussions have  also been proceeding on the pro-vision of training courses in Cumberland to assist unemployed persons to  take  employment which has been made available inthe district.   15. The powers of the Ministry of Labour to provide training courses are  limited to courses for unemployed persons who haveattained the age of  eighteen years.   In the result unemployedboys  of sixteen and seventeen cannot take  advantage of thespecial training  facilities provided by the Ministry  even thoughsuitable employment is available after training.   In  my viewpowers should be taken at the first convenient opportunity toenable  the Ministry  to arrange suitable courses for unemployedboys  and girls  under eighteen.  Consideration  might also begiven to the desirability of introducing definite courses of voca-tional  training  for  unemployed  juveniles  attending  JuniorInstruction  Centres conducted  by local education authorities.                 Local Government Services.   16.  When Sir Malcolm Stewart took  over the  work  in theSpecial Areas, one of the most important problems facing him was the financial condition of the local authorities.  Under thestress of the shortage of money, many of the public health andsanitary services were hopelessly out of date.  Sewerage schemesthat should have been carried out were being held up, and the
provision  of adequate hospital  accommodation  was withheld from  the people, because the required capital was not forth-coming.  During the years that have elapsed since then, mostof the urgent work either has been carried out, or is at presentin course of being arranged for.  A number of hospital schemes are still to be arranged and approved but, when these outstand-ing schemes have  been completed,  it is the opinion  of theMinistry of  Health that,  taking a  general view, the health ser-vices, whether provided by local authorities or by voluntary organisations, will be substantially up  to  the level of the ser-vices  in other parts of the country.  How far some of the localauthorities can keep up the required standard of the health ser-vices, in view of their high rates, is a matter requiring serious consideration, and in previous Reports attention has been called to the financial burdens upon local authorities in the SpecialAreas.  My  powers do not in any case  allow me to assist localauthorities to undertake works  which are directly grant-aided by Other Government Departments.                      industrial Ruins.   17. As  will be seen later in  the  Report  progress has beenmade, especially in the North Eastern  Area, with the clearingaway of some of the industrial ruins of past days.  I have alsoapproved schemes  for  the  improvement  of  amenities by  theplanting of  trees on old pit heaps  in co-operation with the localauthorities.   18. The  South West  Durham  Improvement  Association,Limited, has submitted proposals for dealing with some of thesmall derelict hamlets and villages in South West Durham andthese proposals are receiving  my urgent consideration.  Theproblem is full of difficulties, the solution of which is not madeeasier by the absence  of effective powers in the Housing Actsand Local Government Acts to deal  with the particular problemof villages which have in the past been almost wholly dependentupon a colliery which has closed down or an industry which has left the district.                      Land Settlement.   rg. I stated in paragraph 553 of my previous Report that Iintended in the autumn of 1938 to hold an  enquiry  into theprogress made with the land settlement schemes for unemployedmen  undertaken in England and Wales by the Land SettlementAssociation, the Welsh Land Settlement Society and the CountyCouncils.   As  explained in paragraphs 284  and 285  of  thisReport a Committee was appointed in July under the Chairman-ship  of Sir William Dampier and I hope that I may receive theirreport  early next year.
7199                       Social Work.  20. During  the  year certain  changes have  taken  place  inregard to the organisations I am empowered to assist.  The newphysical fitness legislation has removed from the  oversight of myDepartment certain  activities which  are now  the immediateresponsibility of the National Fitness Council.  21. But the need in other quarters still remains as great as itwas a year ago.   In Part IX of this Report, dealing with SocialImprovement, will be found the report of the work done.    i feel some concern for the future of the work as it has devolped in certain special directions as the result of money granted  byme to the National Council of Social Service.  The provision of holidays by the sea for about 36,000 children is of great import-ance to their health, as the medical reports show.  I have grave doubts  whether  the financial condition  of the local authorities would  allow them to take over  and maintain this work unlessmost  of the funds were  foruicoming from  the  Government.School camps will still be required and I trust  that in due courseproper provision will be made for the continuance of this servicethrough the normal machinery.  22. In a lesser degree, so far as funds are concerned,  the workof the Settlements would be placed in a very difficult position if no money  were forthcoming to help  them.   They are doinginvaluable work in the midst of very depressing surroundings;they are helping to keep men and women &quot; fit  &quot; in the widestsense of the word.   Last year, out of an expenditure of , 25,000on running expenses, a little more than half was provided by myDepartment.  To withdraw the money without making any otherprovision would be disastrous to their  work,  and would inflictgreat discouragement on a  large body of men and women whoare rendering invaluable service to the community.  23. Another form of assistance the  value of which  has been greatly in excess of the amount of money involved has been  anannual grant of  15,000 for the improvement  of district nursingin the Special Areas.  The grant has been administered through.the National Council of Social Service.   I earnestly hope thatsome arrangement will eventually be  made to ensure  that this service is continued on a permanent basis.                   Welsh National Park.  24. In paragraph 369 of my last Report I referred to the pro-posal for a Welsh National Park.  Up to the  present it has notbeen found  possible to  proceed with this project but I feel thatthe scheme  should receive  further  consideration in the light oftwo new factors which have arisen Holidays with Pay and theproblem of A.R.P. evacuation.  The accommodation envisaged
in the original plans would be available for holiday facilities at reasonable rates and  could  be used in an  emergency  as anevacuation  centre.    I  refer again  to  these  two matters inparagraphs 30 to 32.                   District Commissioners.  25.  I should  like to take  this opportunity of referring to a problem of machinery of Government which will be, in my view,of increasing importance.  The District  Commissioners havebeen  concerned  with a policy of economic and social improve-ment in selected areas.  That policy has involved considerable expenditure from the Exchequer as well as from local funds, andthey have therefore been in an exceptionally favourable positionto assist and co-ordinate developments in their regions.  even so it would be well to consider whether there is not a permanentneed  for the employment of such machinery in matters whichare the joint concern of both  national and local  administrations.With the growth of legislation new duties and responsibilities are put  on local authorities and at the same  time  GovernmentDepartments in Whitehall become more specialised.   experience in the Special Areas has shown both that valuable assistance canbe given by  a District Commissioner who is concerned  with a wide range of national  and local government activities, and alsothat without his services there is  a real  danger  of retardedprogress and lack of co-ordination.               The Problem of  the Older Men.  26. I have continued during the past year to  give close atten-tion to the position of  the older unemployed men, but there is little to be added to what was said  in my last Report, Part IXof which was devoted  to this question.  As I then pointed out,this is a national problem which, however,  appears in  a moreacute form in the Special Areas than elsewhere.  Whenever suchaction has been practicable, I have endeavoured, as hitherto, toensure that as high a proportion  as possible of older men  shouldbe employed on those wage-paid schemes towards the  cost ofwhich financial assistance from the Special Areas Fund is being given.   The provision of   various types of  &quot; sub-economicemployment  &quot; has also  continued,  and Part V of the  present report contains detailed information regarding these activities.             Unemployment  among Young  Men.  27. In previous Reports special  attention has been directed to certain aspects  of  the problem of  unemployment  amongyoung men and  the subject has  been under constant considera-tion.   In spite  of all that  has been done, both to provide employment and to assist social  service activities in the  SpecialAreas, there still  remains a most  serious human  problem of
unemployment among young men.  My predecessor referred inhis Second Report to the low medical standard of boys and young men in the Areas, and I am glad to know that substantial progress has been made in the past twelve months in providingmedical inspection and treatment  for boys  attending  JuniorInstruction Centres, and also that special arrangements havebeen made by the Ministry of Labour for medical treatment for young men in certain types of instructional centres.  It is still necessary, however, to consider whether anything more  can  bedone to prevent demoralisation due to unemployment, and alsoto bring young men in the Special  Areas within range of usefuloccupation and opportunities of ordinary wage-earning employ-ment;  and I  have reached the conclusion  that  the  measureswhich are available to me under the Special Areas Act and the valuable training  and transference  facilities afforded by  theMinistry of Labour are not wholly adequate to meet the need.  28. In the case of unemployed boys up to the age of eighteenJunior Instruction Centres have been provided  by local  educa-tion authorities  in districts where the numbers  unemployedjustify such provision, and  unemployed boys are required toattend whether or not  they are  in receipt of unemploymentbenefit  or  unemployment assistance.  This system of  JuniorInstruction Centres has proved of  very great value, in spite ofthe difficulties  of arranging courses of instruction for a changingpersonnel,  and the compulsory character of attendance  is now generally accepted without protest  from any quarter.  In thecase,  however,  of  young  men   attendance  at  instructionalcentres provided by the Ministry of Labour is entirely voluntary.  The  payments  now made by the  Unemployment assistance board to persons of sixteen  years  of age and over, are  outsidethe insurance scheme and the  cost is borne directly by the Ex-chequer.  It seems to me reasonable to attach to the receipt ofthese payments such conditions as are calculated to  create  orpreserve physical  fitness,  and  to improve the  morale  of thatsmall class of  young applicants who are so lacking in initiativethat they will not take advantage of the opportunities which are open to them.  This problem  is not confined to the Special Areas.In my view it would be reasonable in  selected cases to  requireapplicants for  unemployment assistance, as a condition  for thereceipt  of a cash  payment,  to attend  one of the instructionalcentres  or physical fitness classes organised by the Ministry ofLabour. Some form of appeal tribunal could be provided,  asin the  case of boys and girls who wish to appeal against the requirement to attend a  Junior Instruction Centre.  But  if suchan applicant cannot show that he has good cause for refusing afavourable opportunity of improving his chances of  obtainingemployment he should not be eligible  for continued cash pay-ments on existing terms.  He would not be compelled to  attend,
ioas in the case of unemployed boys and girls under eighteen, buthe would be confronted with a choice between compliance with areasonable  condition if he  is to  continue to receive cash pay-ments, and some form of  assistance which would contain an element of deterrence.  Before  the Unemployment assistance board was appointed many local  authorities had  establishedoccupation centres  for  selected  applicants for outdoor relief,but with the transfer of the able-bodied unemployed from localto national funds many of these centres were discontinued.  Theneed for different forms of treatment for different classes mightbe met by providing a few  occupation centres of a different typefrom the instruction centres now  administered by the Ministry ofLabour.  29.  Apart from this question of improvement of employabilitythere is. the further problem of employment  after a  course of instruction.  At present many of those who  enter instructionalcentres return home voluntarily  at the end  of the course to their former condition of unemployment  and feel that the effort madehas been wasted.  Men from the centres should, if possible, find their way into employment under ordinary industrial condi-tions, but such opportunities  are limited  and consideration should be given to the possibility  of utilising their  services.in other ways, particularly at the present time.   I do not advocate a return to a  policy of relief works, but  certain developments may perhaps be anticipated of which advantage might be taken.   30. While the Special  Areas Acts have made it  possible to improve  in  many directions the  conditions under  which the people in these districts  are living and to bring to  them new opportunities of employment, the fact remains that the number of unemployed in the Areas is still very large.  It  is clear to me that there are aspects of the problem  which should be con- sidered from  a   national  standpoint.   The  Unemployment Assistance Board is to-day disbursing money  at the rate of nearly  40 million a  year to the unemployed who are not entitled to payments from the unemployment insurance scheme.   On the other hand the recent crisis has drawn attention to the fact that a great deal of special work is waiting to be done. Is it not possible to devise schemes whereby new openings can be found for able-bodied unemployed, particularly in the case of  young men ?                       Schemes of Work.    31. New  openings might be found for  young unemployed  men in the work which has to be done in connection with air  raid precautions  and other defence measures. Suggestions have  also been made for  centres which could fulfil the triple purpose  of school camps, holiday centres for working men and their
                            ttfamilies,  and, in time of emergency, refuges for persons evacuated-ated from congested  areas.  I understand that Lord Portal has submitted to  the  Home  Secretary  a  memorandum on thequestion.  I have already referred to the assistance given by me to theestablishment of school camps in areas where no provision hasbeen made by local authorities.  Where suitable accommodation is available  the  camps have not been  confined to  the summer months and successful experiments have been made in  wintercamps both  for school children and unemployed juveniles fromJunior Instruction Centres.  I believe there  is still need for additional school camps, taking the country as a  whole.  32. Following upon the Report of the Committee on Holidayswith Pay the Government has announced its intention to encouragement-age paid holidays for industrial workers.   Already about fourmillion workers are entitled to holidays with pay and, if the costis not prohibitive, in the next few years we may  expect to see vast increase in this number. There is little doubt that existingholiday resorts would find difficulty in  accommodating all thoseseeking a holiday away from home even though holidays werespread over a longer period; nor is it likely that the lower paid workers  could afford the charges usually made.  Although pri-vate enterprise may be expected to meet the demand in time, the urgent need for increased accommodation in all  parts of thecountry  seems to call for a comprehensive and  co-ordinatedscheme under some  form of public control.   33.  The capital expenditure of  providing centres for schoolcamps or accommodation for holidaymakefs would be consider-able, but the running costs could partly be met by  contributions from local authorities in respect of school children and unem-ployed juveniles attending  in the winter  months, and  by tirecharges  made for holidaymakers in the summer.   The servicesof unemployed young men might be utilised in the construction and upkeep of the centres and, in addition, the country wouldhave a valuable asset both in normal times  and  when  dealingwith the problem of evacuation in times of emergency.                       Administration.   34. A full description was given in paragraphs 25 to 32 of mylast Report of the principles which I  intended to  follow in the administration of the Acts  relating to the  Special Areas.  It is unnecessary, therefore, to say more in the present Report than that  I have continued to co-operate  with the various bodies referred to in those  paragraphs and that close contact has been maintained throughout the year with the Government Depart- ments concerned. The development of the industrial side of my work has involved  constant communication with  the Board  of Trade, the  Ministry  of Labour and the Home Office, while  in
connection with the acquisition of sites for industrial developmentmy Department has had to make heavy demands on the offices of the Chief Valuer and the Treasury Solicitor, which have beenimmediately and cheerfully met.  35! With much regret, in July, 1938, I had to part with Mr.F. N. Tribe, C.B., C.B.E., who took up new  duties in H.M.Treasury. Ever since the Department was formed in November,1934, he had acted as the head of the Departmental Organisationand  his great experience and ability have been of the greatestassistance to me since I took office nearly two years ago. I havebeen very glad to  welcome Mr.  H. C. Emmerson, who  wasappointed in his place.  36. There has been  no important change in the local  staffexcept that, to my regret, Mr. E.  G. Sarsfield-Hall, C.M.G.,resigned his appointment as District Commissioner for the WestCumberland Special Area; I appointed Mr. H.  G.  C. Mallaby,M.A., as his successor.  37-. The administrative  expenses of the whole of my Depart-ment, both at Headquarters and in the Areas, amounted duringthe twelve months under review to about , 36,000.  During thisperiod the expenditure from the Special Areas Fund on schemes which I have assisted amounted to about , 4,250,000, and further commitments amounting to about ^4,000,000 were entered into.                   Regionai Organisation.  38. No new regional organisations have been set up during theyear. The function of the Trading Estates Companies as regionalbodies intended to serve the whole of their Areas has been clearlydemonstrated by  the fact that, in  the Durham and TynesideArea, the North Eastern Trading Estates, Limited, have been concerned with the provision  of  nine factories  in  parts of theArea: other than the Team Valley Estate, and the South wales and  Monmouthshire Trading Estates, Limited, with seven  suchfactories.  Both the West Cumberland Industrial DevelopmentCompany and  the South West Durham Improvement Associa-tion, Limited, have come into full operation and reports on  their work will be found later in the Report.  PART  II.-ECONOMIC  SURVEY OF THE  SPECIAL                         AREAS.                   Changes in Population,  39. In the previous Reports (and particularly in Sir MalcolmStewarts  Third Report). reference was made  to  the changesin population taking place in the Special Areas.   It was pointedout that the population of those Areas was falling,  and that therate of fall was increasing, whereas in the remainder of Englandand Wales  the population  was  increasing,  and  the rate of increase was rising.  The latest figures available show that thiswas still the case in 1937.
  40. The  following figures  give  the  changes of population,during the last three years for which figures are available, inthe Special Areas and in the remainder of England and Wales:  	Estimated population at mid-1937.

In the Durham and Tyne-side Special Area, the rate of decrease Of population was not so great as in the previous year,  but in the other two main SpecialAreas it was greater than in the previous year.  41.  This fall in population continues to  be  wholly  due tomigration from the Special Areas,  but the natural increase in population, due to excess of births  over deaths, is still steadilydecreasing in  rate.  In  the seven  counties  which  include theSpecial Areas of  England and Wales,  i.e.  Cumberland, North-cumberland, Durham, Glamorgan,  Monmouth, Brecknock andPembroke, the number of live births during 1937  was 67,299,or 1,025 fewer than in  1936.  On the other hand,  the numberof deaths increased  from 52,431 to 54,166,  or by  1,735.  Thenatural increase thus declined from 15,893 to 13,133, a fall of2,760,  or 17-4 per  cent., in  the twelve months.  The corre-sponding decline in the rest  of England and Wales was only6-2 per  cent.   In 1931  the natural increase in the population in the  seven counties was 23,135, so that  in seven years therehas been a fall of 43 per cent, in the natural increase.   In thesame period, the fall in the  natural increase in the  remainder of England and  Wales was only 25 per cent.  This  decline  inthe natural increase in the Special Areas&apos;  population is takingplace at an increasing rate and, if present tendencies hold, it willnot be many years before there will be  a loss of population from the Special Areas due to excess of deaths over births,  aswell as that due to migration.
                             u ,42- In considering the position in the immediate future  of changes in the potential labour supply  in the Special Areas, itis  of interest also  to note the changes between 1934 and 1937in the  numbers of children  in - the higher age groups attendingpublic  elementary schools in the Special Areas,  according  toreturns furnished  to the Board  of  Education.   In  the fivecounties which include the greater part of the Special Areas  ofEngland and Wales, with  an  estimated population of about3J million persons,  the  number of pupils  aged from  nine  tofourteen years on  the school registers at 31st March, 1937, wasabout 280,000, or 8-4 per cent, of the estimated population.  Thecorresponding percentage for the rest of the country was about-5 per cent.  It is common knowledge that in the more pros-prosperous areas in the South and Midlands there is in some districtsa  shortage of juvenile labour  and that  in practically all partsof the ..country there has been a reduction in the past few years in the  numbers of children leaving school and entering the em-ployment field. But the figures indicate that in  the next fiveyears the numbers of children  leaving school and seeking em-ployment will  continue  to be  at a higher  rate in  the  SpecialAreas  than in other parts  of  the country  in  relation to  thepopulation.                        Employment.   43. Figures of the number of insured persons in employment,which  are available only once a year after the mid-year exchangeof books, are of special interest as they afford not only a valuablemeasure of the expansion or  contraction of  industry but alsoindicate  the extent to which changes in the number of unem-ployed persons in any  area  are the result of industrial  activityor of the migration of  workers.  The following table  gives thenumbers of insured persons unemployed and the  numbers esti-mated to be in employment in the Special Areas in England andWales at the end of June in each of the years 1935 to 1937:  Insured Persons (aged 16-64).

Figures of the number of insured persons in employ-ment at June, 1938, are not yet available,
  44-  It will be seen that, in the Durham and Tyneside Area,the increase in the number in employment in the two years from mid-1935 to mid-1937 was greater than the decrease during thesame period in the number unemployed.  In West Cumberlandand South Wales, the reverse was the case, showing that migra-tion of workers from these Areas was fairly high.              General Employment Situation.  45.  Unfortunately, the improvement noted in paragraphs 35 to39 of my last Report has not continued, the Special Areas havingbeen affected by the general trade recession, though to a slightly less degree than the rest of the country. The percentage increasein the number of the unemployed in the  Special Areas is, as willbe seen from paragrah 49, much less than in the rest of thecountry,  but  it must be remembered that the Special  Areasstarted with a much larger percentage of unemployment.  46.  There seems little doubt that, but for the rearmament pro-gramme, the  situation would have been much worse. As  willbe seen from paragraph 93,  the heavy fall in the merchant ship-building  programme has not been  reflected  in  a rise in theunemployment percentage in the ship-building and ship-repairingindustry, a fact which can only be due to the substantial amountof naval ship-building which is proceeding.  47.  Fortunately  in September,  1938, there  seemed  to  beindications of an arrest in the decline in  activity.                      Unemployment.  48.  During the year  ended 30th September, 1938, there  wasa considerable increase in unemployment in the Special areas as a whole.  On Tyneside, however, there was a  decrease  andin West Cumberland the  increase was small.  The highest levelof unemployment was reached in May (240,000) and since then there  has been a downward movement  to  the present level of234,000.  In the whole country there  was also an increase duringthe year, the  highest level for the twelve months being reached in June.  Statistics setting forth the numbers unemployed in theSpecial Areas from October, 1937, to September,  1938, will befound  in Appendices I to IV, which continue the figures pub-lished  in the  Appendices in my previous Report for the yearended  September, 1937, on the basis described in paragraphs 73and 74 of that Report.  49.  During the twelve months  under review the  percentageof unemployment in the Special Areas rose from 21-4 to 24-3,but this increase has been mainly in South Wales and Durham.
The  following table shows the position at both dates and the changes that took place in the period.Area.	Persons registered as unemployed.

The  largest proportionate  increase  has  taken place in durham in  South West  Durham it  was as high as 31-4 percent. but  the Durham and Tyneside Areas continue to  haveunemployment  percentages  well below the other Areas.   Theincrease in the whole of Great Britain was two-and-one-halftimes as great as it was in the Special  Areas, but the percentageof unemployment in the latter remains nearly twice as high as itis for the country as a whole, 24-3  per cent, compared  with13-6 per cent.  51. Appendix II gives figures for the  wholly unemployedonly, subdivided  into men, women and juveniles,  comparable with similar figures given in Appendix  II of my previous Report.Separate figures are shown for South  West Durham, where thewholly  unemployed increased  from  8,995 to 10,810, or by20-2 per cent.   Last year  there was a decrease of 20-8 percent,, so that the position is now as it was in September, 1936.  52. In Appendix III the figures are confined to EmploymentExchanges whose areas are  wholly or mainly within the SpecialAreas, the  only Special Area which is materially  affected  beingSouth Wales.   In that Area it will be seen that the increase inthe register (12-8 per cent.) in the year is considerably less ifthe large  towns  v/hose areas are mainly outside  the&apos;SpecialAreas are excluded.   The increase in the latter was as high as28-5 per cent.Local Variations in Unemployment during the year.  53. Of sixty-eight  towns in  the Special Areas  in Englandand Wales for which  comparisons with a year before are  given
                             nin the  Ministry of Labour Local Unemployment Index, forty-eight  showed  increases  while  twenty  showed decreases  inSeptember, 1938, as compared with September, 1937.  54.  In my last Report  (paragraphs  81 to 87)  figures weregiven showing the number of places quoted in the Index wherethe unemployment percentage  was over 30, over 40 and over 50at September, 1936 and 1937.  In September, 1937, there werefourteen places with percentages of over 30 and five with over 40,while  the highest percentage  was 43-5.  In September,  1938,there were twenty-five places  with over 30 per cent., ten with over 40 per cent, and four with  over 50 per  cent.,  while thehighest was 73 - 6 per cent.   Twenty-eight places  had  a per-centage lower than 20, while in 1937 there were thirty-eight such places.  In  four cases  the percentage  fell below the rate forthe whole of Great Britain, which was 12-9 in September, 1938,i.e. in Horden,  Seaham  Harbour and  Sedgefield,  in CountyDurham,  and Resolven, in South Wales.  55.  The following  table gives,  for the five  counties which contain substantial portions of  the  Special Areas and for theCounty Boroughs within  the Areas,  the number  of insuredpersons unemployed  at 12th September, 1938, expressed as a percentage of the total number of insured aged 16 to 64 years:                                                   Increase or                                   Percentage of    Decrease as         County or County Borough.

An analysis by age of the live register of unemployed men was carried out by the Ministry of  Labour on 2nd May, 1938,and it is of interest to compare the  results of this analysis withthose of the analyses at earlier dates.  In May,  1938, the totalnumber of unemployed men  on the live registers of the Employ-ment Exchanges and Employment Offices serving any part of
                            i8the Special Areas of England and Wales was 192,205, a decrease01 5&apos;5x7i or 2-8 per cent., on the number in the previous year.The following  table shows the distribution of these men amongthree  age groups,  and enables comparisons to be made  with previous years:  		18-34 years.	35-54 years.	55 years and over.

The groupaffected least by the slowing up which  has occurred in the rateof  recovery from unemployment  was the  highest  age-group,viz. men aged 55 years and over.  57.  If the comparison between the years 1938 and 1937 bemade on  the basis  of a  larger number  of  age-groups, theposition is as follows:-	Unemployed at	Percentage Increase orMen aged	2nd May, 1938.

Ignoring the small group of.men aged 65 years and over, the striking feature of the above table is the increase in the numberof young men unemployed.  In the first  group, aged 18 to 20years, there has been an increase of 34 per cent, between May,1937, and May, 1938, whereas there was a decrease of 42 percent, in this group  between May,  1936 and May, 1937.  this increase took place  mainly in South Wales, and was to someextent due  to the decline in transference see paragraph 68.  58. The  following table shows,  for each of the three mainSpecial  Areas,  the distribution among  three age-groups of thetotal number  of  unemployed men on  the  live  registers  at2nd  May, 1938, and affords a comparison with the position ayear earlier:  	18-34 yrs-	35-54 Yrs-	55 yrs. and over.

A similar  analysiswas carried out at 18th July, 1938, the results of which are givenin Appendix V,  together  with figures indicating the  changescompared with July, 1937.  60. It will be seen that  the number of men who had been on the register for less than one year at July, 1938, was greaterby 11,434, or 16 per cent., than the corresponding number atJuly, 1937, while the number who had been on the register for more than one year  showed  a decrease of 14,807, or 18-5  percent. The  latter decrease was spread over  all the groups having
unemployment of a year or longer, but was more marked insome groups than in others, as the following table shows:-Group.	Decrease at July, 1938, compared with July, 1937.

The decrease of 14,807  in  the number  unemployed for more than a year was distributed among the three main SpecialAreas as follows: West Cumberland, 911 (or a fall of 21-9 percent.); Durham  and Tyneside, 6,149 (or 16-7 per cent.);  andSouth Wales 7,747 (or 19-8 per cent.).  The proportion whichthe number of men unemployed for a year or more formed of thetotal number of men was as follows : West Cumberland, 52 - 5 percent.; Durham and Tyneside, 43-1 per cent.; and South Wales,44-2 per cent.The  Long  Unemployed.  62. At July, 1935, there were 226,000 unemployed men claim-ing  benefit or allowances in the Special Areas of England andWales and,  of that total, 58,600 or 26 per cent,  had been con-tinuously unemployed for three or more years.  In the remainder of Great Britain the corresponding figures  were  1,206,000 and90,400 or 7-5 per cent. The concentration or proportion of longunemployed was therefore three-and-one-half times as high in theSpecial  Areas as it was in the rest  of  the  country.  This high proportion of chronic cases of unemployment was one of thefeatures that gave  the Special Areas their distinctive character and  justified their  claim to special treatment.  63. By  July, 1938,  the latest date for which figures are avail-able, large decreases  had taken  place  in the Special Areas  inthe  number of men unemployed for  three years or more, which fell  by 43-2 per cent, to 33,279, or 22-5 per cent, of the totalnumber of  unemploy^ed  men  (147,979).  In the remainder  ofGreat Britain there had  also been a marked fall, by 20-6 percent., in the number of the long unemployed, those men unem-ployed for three years or more numbering 71,814,  or  6-4 percent, of the total of 1,126,662.
:;  64- The improvement in the employment situation since 1935is thus shown to have extended its influence in a marked degree to the long unemployed but relatively to no greater extent in theSpecial Areas than in the  rest of the country, the proportion of long unemployed men remaining roughly  as it was  three yearsago, three-and-one-half times  as  high as in the  rest of thecountry.  The actual percentage rate of fall in the &quot; umemployed for three years or more &quot; group was  over twice as  high in theSpecial Areas (43-2  per  cent.) as in the rest of the country(20-6 per cent.). The percentage fall in the &quot; unemployed forless than three years  &quot; class, however,  was nearly six times as high 31 per cent, in  the Special Areas and 5-5 per  cent, in therest of the country. The above figures subdivided into the threeSpecial Areas are contained  in Appendix VI.Industrial Distribution of the Unemployed.  65. Figures showing the  distribution by  industries of the insured unemployed are now regularly  provided for me by theMinistry  of  Labour and, although a table showing  the positionin the main industrial groups at certain dates was given in. my lastReport (paragraphs 103  to 108), it may  be of interest to addnow two further sets of figures, viz., those for  November, 1934,when my Department was first set up and those for September,1938, which are the  latest figures available.   These figures foreach of the  three Special Areas in England and Wales are givenin Appendix VII, and show  the improvement or  otherwise thathas taken place in the main industries during the period of almostfour years.  66. The decrease in coal-mining, ship-building and engineer-ing is very  marked over 50 per cent, in  each case and in allthe industries shown, with the exception  of public works con-tracting, the decrease was at  least 25 per cent.  The latter indus-try occupies a rather peculiar position, in that it is one into which men unemployed for long periods in other  industries tend  todrift, and there is  reason to believe that  at least some part  ofthe fall in unemployment in, for example, the coal-mining indus-try is accounted  for by the transfer  of workers  into publicworks contracting.  There are some  cases of increases  amongthe individual Areas but the  only industry, among those shown,to  have  an increase  in the total for  all three Special Areas isiron and steel, where  the rise has amounted to  26 per cent.                        Transference.   67.  In Appendix VIII a table is given showing the number ofpersons transferred out of the Special Areas in  the twelve months ended 30th  September, 1938, under schemes directed or assisted by the Ministry of Labour or by my grants, and  the number ofother  men  from the  Special Areas  who are known to have found work for themselves  during the same period.  Precise
information  as to  the  number of  these persons who returnedagain to the  Areas is not available,  but there is reason to believethat it is considerable.  68. It will be seen from the Appendix that some 27,700 per-sons are known to have left the Areas during the twelve months to obtain employment elsewhere.  (This figure excludes  depend-ants  who  did  not go into employment.)  Of this total, 12,300were from South Wales and 13,900 from the  North East.  Thecorresponding figures for last year  were 43,000 of whom 21,500were  from South Wales  and  19,300 from the  North East,  sothat  there was a decrease  in  the  total  number  of transfers  ofover one-third, the decrease being well over one-third in thecase  of South Wales and just under one-third in Durham andTyneside.  69. The number of  men transferred under the Ministry  ofLabour&apos;s schemes has fallen considerably,  from 13,280 to 7,770,but the number of women  similarly transferred has fallen  toa. much smaller degree,  from 4,660 to 4,210.   Similarly withjuveniles,  transference of boys showed a considerable falling off, from  4,870 to  2,150, but that  of girls was very well  main-tained, being 3,400  compared with 3,980 in the same period lastyear.  The  number of girls transferred exceeded that of boysin all three Areas,  particularly in Durham and Tyneside.  70. The number  of men who found work  for themselves inSouth Wales was 4,000 and in the North East 4,600; but, as wasthe case  last  year, they formed  a higher proportion of thetotal number of men transferred in  South Wales than in  durham and  Tyneside.      Board of Trade Survey  of Industrial Development.  71. According to the annual Board of Trade Survey,  541 new factories were opened in  Great Britain  in  1937,  of which seven-teen  were in the   Special  Areas.   This  compares with eightfactories in  1936 out of  a total of 551, and on  the strength ofthese figures alone represents an improvement. Of the seventeennew  factories, twelve were in the Durham and Tyneside SpecialArea, six  being on  Tyneside and six in County Durham. only two of these were at Gateshead, so  that tire Team Valley TradingEstate factories are only just beginning to  appear in this survey,partly on  account of the  fact that in 1937  only a few of the new factories on the Estate were actually in production and  partly because only  those employing twenty-five or more  persons atthe date of entry are entered in these returns.  No new factories are shown as opened in West Cumberland during the year.  72. In Wales and Monmouthshire, thirteen new factories were established during  1937, five of which were in the Special Areas.Two of the five were on the Treforest Trading Estate. The sameremark applies here as  to the Team Valley factories.
  73- Of 237 extensions of existing factories, only five were inthe Special Areas-all in the North East, four being on the Tyne.Five factories are shown as having closed down in the SpecialAreas in 1937, four in the Durham and Tyneside Area and one in South Wales,              Government Defence Programme.  74. Since September, 1937, there have been developments ofa  general character in  the Governments rearmament  pro-gramme.  This is now in its third 37ear and the volume of pro-auction has  expanded  very considerably,  thereby stimulatingemployment  throughout  the whole country;  and the SpecialAreas have benefited to a marked extent.  This trend is  likelyto continue during  the coming year  with the further develop-ment of  certain parts of the programme, particularly aircraft production.   Of special  interest is the extension of the systemof sub-contracting in connection with armament orders which,in fact, means that  a large number of the smaller firms, includ-ing those in the Special Areas should  now be able to participate in the  programme.   This method has the advantage of takingthe work to  the men.  It is unfortunately not possible to give an estimate of the value of orders so  placed.  75. The last year has witnessed a development of the Govern-ment factories  (including  &quot; shadow  factories &quot;), the  construc-tion  of which had been started  in previous years and,  as  anumber of these factories  are situated in the Special Areas,these localities have benefited correspondingly.   In addition, theconstruction  of two more  factories, under the Governmentprogramme previously  laid  down, has been undertaken.  Oneof these is situated in the South Wales Special Area at MerthyrTydfil  and the other at Pembrey which is just outside the Area.The  former will be of special interest  in view of the high degreeof unemployment prevailing at that place.  76. In addition to the  large sums spent in the  erection ofGovernment  factories and  agency factories  under the rearmament -ment programme in the Special Areas of England and Wales,Government   contributions  towards  extensions  of  existingfactories and  Government-owned plant installed in some of them have cost about , 4,500,000.  77. The Special Areas have also benefited by the greatly in-creased volume of Government armament  orders and have theadvantage of being included in the Schedule of Depressed areas to which preference is given,  other things being equal, in theallocation of  Government contracts  (not only those for  arma-ments).  Between 1st April, 1936, and the end of August,  1938,orders to the value of  47,260,700 were placed in  the SpecialAreas  of England and Wales by the Service Departments.
                            M              Railway Development Contracts.  78. As stated in paragraph 66 of my last Report, the Govern-ment, when agreeing in 1935 to  facilitate the financing of rail-way electrification and other works in London and other partsof the country, made it a condition that the Railway companies should,  in placing their orders, give a  preference, other thingsbeing equal, to firms in the Special Areas.  A good deal of rail-way development work was undertaken during the year underreview and  the  preference referred  to above was, of course,still in operation.                     Calcium Carbide. &quot;79. At the date of my last Report consideration was  being given by the Government to the Report  of  the Committeeappointed by the Minister  for the Co-ordination of Defence toconsider schemes for the production of calcium carbide.  TheCommittee recommended a scheme submitted by the BritishOxygen Company which provided for  the erection of two fac-tories, one at Port Talbot and  the other at Corpach in the WestHighlands of Scotland.  Legislation was required to enable theCompany to carry through  the Corpach portion of the combinedscheme, and the Caledonian Power Bill came before parliament in April,  but was, unfortunately,  rejected  by  the House  ofCommons  after  a  full  debate.   Meanwhile,   I had  been approached by  the  Company  on  the question of  the assistance which I  might  be able to give  under the  Special Areas Actstowards the establishment  of  a factory at Port  Talbot, and i made an offer of contributions towards rent, rates and incometax for  a limited period.   The Company made  an attempt toproceed with the Port Talbot factory by itself and in fact wentso far as to acquire the lease of a suitable  site,  but economicconditions intervened to prevent this being done as a commercialundertaking.  The Company was, therefore,  forced to abandon,at any rate for the time being, its activities in this direction.  80. I  do not  propose to comment further on  these eventsbeyond  expressing regret that it  has not so far proved possibleto start  this valuable industry in South Wales which possessesso many of the requirements necessary  for the  production ofcalcium carbide.                       Oil from  Coal.  81. In February of the present year was published the Reportof the Sub-Committee on Oil from Coal, appointed during theprevious summer by  the  Minister  for  the Co-ordination  ofDefence.  The Report deals in great detail with the principles ofboth types of processes, namely, those producing oil only andthose coming under the general description of low temperaturecarbonisation, which produce a smokeless solid fuel in addition
to oil,  tar and other by-products.  The Committee found thatany  further development of the production of oil from coal,and  indeed  the maintenance  of the existing production, were dependent on the continuance of a guaranteed preference on home-produced spirit.    They recommended  that the actualpreference of 8d. per gallon, of which 4d. was guaranteed at thetime of their Report,  should be guaranteed in full  for a periodof twelve years.  Following this recommendation,  the  finance act of 1938 provided for the maintenance  of the preference fortwelve years, subject to possible adjustments after May,  1942, inthe light of changes in price and in home production figures.  82. In the case of  low temperature carbonisation, the Com-,mittee recommended that assistance should be limited to partici-pation in the preference referred to above, and considered thatthe grant of direct financial assistance  for the  establishment offurther plants would not be justified.  As regards synthetic pro-cesses,  they hoped that by  the  extension  of  the guaranteedpreference one or more industrial concerns might be induced toundertake the erection  of such a plant. If financial assistancewere required,  this should be limited to sums  required foragreed special  items of research work.  83. I should point  out  that  these recommendations do notdebar persons having such projects in  mind from  applying for financial assistance to me and to the other ^bodies  concerned in giving financial assistance for  the setting up of industrial under-takings in the  Special Areas,  for which they are eligible underthe same conditions as apply  to other kinds of industrial enter-prise.  I referred in paragraph 55 of my last Report to  one casein which such assistance had been given, and similar assistance was also given to another undertaking of this kind in the NorthEastern Area.  One of these undertakings  is already in produc-tion, and it is hoped that the other will  shortly reach that stage.During the  past twelve months, however, I have received noapplications from persons contemplating projects of this kind towhich it has been found possible to offer assistance.         Industrial Situation  in the Heavy Industries.  84. In previous Reports attention has been  called to certainfactors likely to militate against any material increase of employ-ment in the  staple industries  of the Special Areas and in par-ticular  the coal, iron and  steel,  and  ship-building industries.One of the main factors involved is the increase in efficiency ofproduction in these industries.  This factor  in industry in general has been very fully treated in  the recent London and CambridgeEconomic Service Special Memorandum No. 42 entitled &quot; Out-put, Employment and Wages  in the  United  Kingdom, 1924,1930 and 1935 &quot;, to which I have already  referred as deserving   14010                                                B

The Memo-randum calls attention to the very great increase in output inrelation to employment which has occurred during the past fiveyears and this increase is no doubt likely to continue. In viewof the very full treatment of the subject in the Memorandum itis necessary in this Report  only to refer briefly to the conditionswhich have obtained during the past twelve months in the threestaple industries  mentioned.Coal.   85. Revised  versions of  the tables printed in paragraphs 126and 127 of the previous Report  are as follows:      Disposal of Coal in  the Special Areas and Great Britain.                       In  Million Tons.
Northern and  South Wales districts exceeded the 1935 and,  itmay be added, the 1936 figures.  Exports in 1937 were slightlybelow those of 1935 for the Northern  district but in excess for south Wales.  87. The present year, however, shows an appreciable fallingback as compared with 1937.  Output in Northumberland andDurham is down by 1 - 7 million tons and in South Wales by just over one million tons.  Exports in both the Northern and SouthWales districts are down, by over 900,000 tons in the North andby over 800,000 tons in South Wales.  88. The reduction in output was not immediately reflected  inthe employment figures. For Great Britain as a whole the aver-age number of wage earners  during the first nine months was784,000 as compared with 774,700 for  the corresponding periodof 1937; for Northumberland and Durham the  average figures were 158,700 for 1937 and 160,900 for 1938; and for South Wales131,800 for 1937 and  135,500 for  1938.  In Cumberland theaverage figures for the eight  months were  5,800 for 1937 and,700 for 1938.  It should, however,  be noted  that less time was  worked during the first nine months of 193&amp; than during thecorresponding period of 1937.  During  recent months unemploy-ment has been on the increase.  89. Unfortunately no progress  appears to have been  made during the past year in the solution of the problem of finding new methods for treating coal.  Reference  is made elsewhere (para-graphs 81 and 82) to the Report of the Committee on Oil from coal referred to in paragraph 130 of my previous Report.Iron and Steel.  90. The expansion of output which had occurred during theearly months of 1937 continued until the end of the year.  from january, 1938, however, there was a  slackening which becameintensified as  the year went  on.  The output of pig  iron, forexample, fell from a figure of 761,100 tons in January to 429,800tons in September,  the  latter  figure  comparing with one  of726,600 tons in September, 1937.  This is reflected in the increasein the unemployment percentage from 8 - 9 per cent,  in Septem-ber, 1937, to 22-2 per cent, in September, 1938.  91. The  output of  steel ingots  and castings  similarly fellrapidly after March to 658,900 tons in August, though Septembershows  an appreciable  increase  with a figure of  754,700 tons.This  compares unfavourably,  however, with  the  figure  of1,163,000 tons in September of last year.  The effect of this  onunemployment is shown in the increase in the  unemploymentpercentage in  the industries of steel melting, iron puddling andiron and steel rolling,  etc., from  10-4 per  cent, in September,1937, to 27-5 per cent, in September,  1938.   14010                                              B 2
Ship-building.  92. The  slowing  down of the merchant  ship-building  pro-gramme mentioned  in the last Report has continued during thepast twelve months.  The amount of tonnage under constructionon 30th September of this year was approximately 885,000 tons,as compared with nearly 1,200,000  in September,  1937.  Thetonnage being built  on the north east coast, including the Tees,has fallen in the same period from nearly 400,000 tons to 280,000tons. This reduction of 30 per cent,  is slightly higher than thereduction for the country as a whole of about 26 per cent.  93. It  is  remarkable, however,  that notwithstanding thissevere  reduction in merchant ship-building  the unemploymentpercentage in the ship-building  and ship-repairing  industry inAugust and September, 1938, remains practically the same as inAugust and  September,  1937.  The  fact  can no  doubt be accounted for by the  increase in  the naval work during theperiod. Marine engineering  shows  the same feature,  the unem-ployment percentages in August and September, 1937 and 1938,being approximately the same.  94. So far as can be seen there  is no  likelihood of an earlyrevival in merchant  ship-building. Orders are said to be coming in slowly and there  is no very evident sign of the large revival of international trade which would be necessary to encourage a substantial  increase in the ship-building programme.General Conclusion.  95. The experience of the  past twelve months, therefore, con-firms the views previously expressed that the heavy industriescannot be expected to absorb  the unemployed in  the SpecialAreas, and the year has also given a striking  example of thelarge fluctuations to which these industries are subject. Recenthistory, therefore, emphasises once more the need for broadeningthe  basis of industry in all the Special Areas.           PART  III-INDUSTRIAL  POLICY.                          General.  96. In paragraphs 215 to 221 of my previous Report I gave an account of the steps I had taken in view of the further powersprovided under the Special  Areas  (Amendment)  Act, 1937, tostrengthen the industrial side of my organisation.  The arrangc-ments  made have proved entirely satisfactory and I should liketo take this opportunity of renewing my thanks to my IndustrialAdvisers for the great assistance they ha.ve given me during thepast year.   In particular I  have been fortunate in having theunstinted help and advice of Lord Portal, who has continued to
14010devote a large part of his time to the attraction of industry tothe Special Areas, in  addition to  his work  as Chairman of theSpecial  Areas Reconstruction Association  and of  the SpecialAreas  Loans  Advisory Committee.  Close contact has been maintained with  the  Commissioner for  the  Special  Areas inScotland and the arrangements made for the co-ordination of effort and the interchange of information  have worked satis-factorily.                    Letting  of Factories.  97. Under  Section 2 of  the Special Areas (Amendment) Act,1937, the Commissioners may,  for the purpose  of inducingpersons to establish an industrial  undertaking in  any of theSpecial Areas, let a factory in any such Area.  In pursuance ofthese powers I had, up to 30th September, provided or arranged to provide sixteen  factories,  of which nine were  to be in theDurham and Tyneside Area  and seven in South  Wales.   Inthese Areas I have followed the policy described in my previous report whereby the Trading Estates Companies undertake theerection of the factories.  Of the factories above mentioned fourin the Durham and Tyneside Area and two in South Wales arein actual production and several  of the  others are nearing that stage.  98. In addition to  those cases in which factories are being provided, I have arranged to provide two sites upon which the undertakings will erect their  own factories.   Both of these arein the Durham and Tyneside Area.  99. Excluding the cost of the factories themselves, the amountof capital involved in the undertakings to be carried on in the factories which I am  providing is stated  to be about  750,000,and employment will be provided, when they are fully estab-lished, for about 4,000 people.  100. In addition, the West Cumberland Industrial Develop-ment Company has provided or  is providing tenants with fivefactories in respect of which the capital involved is about  90,000and which  will  employ, when  fully established,  about  400persons. Two further factories, at present un-let, are being built.                       Contributions.  101. Under Section 3 of the Amendment Act I  have power,for the purpose of inducing persons to establish industrial under-takings in approved  places in  the Special  Areas,  to  affordfinancial assistance by means of contributions towards any sumspayable in respect of the undertaking by way of rent, income taxor rates for a period  not exceeding five years from the date ofthe agreement.  In pursuance of  these powers I have, since theAct came into operation,  made offers up to 30th September to
sixty undertakings, excluding a certain number which have not,for one reason or another, materialised.  Of these, twenty are inrespect  of  undertakings  for the Durham  and Tyneside Area,thirty-two for the South Wales Area and eight for the Cumber-land Area.   Twenty of these concerns are now in production.  102. Of these sixty projects, twenty-six are on Trading Estates,of which only  two are on  the Team Valley Trading  Estate;twenty-one are for undertakings which are occupying factories to be provided on my behalf on sites outside the Trading Estates(including  five  provided, or to be provided, by the West Cum-berland Industrial Development Company)  and thirteen have provided,  or are providing, their own factories.  103. In twelve of these cases I have also exercised the power under Section 19 of  the Finance Act, 1937, to  certify to  theTreasury that it is expedient that  the persons  setting  up  theundertaking  should   be  given  relief  in  respect  of NationalDefence Contribution, and the Treasury have agreed to  arrangeaccordingly.  104. According to the information in my possession the total capital of these sixty  undertakings  (including fourteen of those mentioned  in paragraph  97) was upwards of  3,500,000, andemployment is expected to be provided by them, when they  are fully established, for about 8,000 people.  105. Among  these  sixty undertakings are  included  twenty-three undertakings which are being established either by aliensor in conjunction with aliens.                    Provision of Finance.  106. In my last Report I mentioned that  capital was avail-able for industrial undertakings in  the Special Areas from  theNuffield Trust, the Special Areas  Reconstruction Association,and the Treasury (under  Section 6 of the Special Areas (Amend-ment) Act, 1937).  The conditions  under which capital  may beprovided from  these  sources differ; in particular the treasury and the Special Areas Reconstruction Association are restricted to the provision of loan capital, the latter being limited normallyto sums up to  10,000 while the former has no such limit.  107. Up to 30th September,  1938, capital assistance from these three sources, which has not been restricted to newly-establishedconcerns, had been granted to 151  undertakings in the SpecialAreas in England and Wales, of which 48 are in South Wales,88 in Durham and Tyneside and 15 in West Cumberland.   Someoccupy  factories provided by me  under  the  arrangements described in paragraph 97, and some have been promised con-tributions towards rent, rates and income tax (paragraph 101).

New Industries  in the Special Areas.  108. In earlier Reports attention  has been drawn to the con-trast between the high rate  of unemployment in the heavy in-dustries upon which the Special  Areas have in the past been solargely dependent, and the  lower rate of unemployment in  theSouth and Midlands where industry is more varied. It is becauseof this contrast that continuous efforts  have been  made to ensurethat the Special Areas shall have their share of new  industrialenterprise.   The  new forms of  industrial  activity which have contributed to the relative prosperity of the South and Midlandshave been for the most  part manufacturing processes in lightindustries, and  in trying to  attract this new industrial develop-ment to the Special Areas it  has perhaps not been fully realised,particularly by persons resident in  the Special Areas, that  thelighter and more varied industries employ  a far higher propor-tion of female labour than the types of employment which  aretraditional in so many districts in South Wales  and the north of England.  The contrasts in the demand and opportunities formale and female labour in different  parts of the country  areillustrated in the following  table:  
  109. The position in the North Western  and North EasternDivisions is, of course, affected  by the textile trades, but thecontrast  is sufficiently striking between on  the  one hand theLondon, the South Eastern and the Midlands Divisions, wherethe percentage of females among total insured persons rangesfrom 23-7 to 31-1,  and on the other hand Wales with a per-centage of only  11-7  and the Northern Division  with a per-centage of 15-2.  The corresponding average percentage for thewhole country is 27-2.  no. Although the Trading Estates have only been in effectiveoperation since the beginning of  1937,  and the other  measuresby which I seek  to attract this types  of industry into the areas for sixteen months some of which have been months of arresteddevelopment I have thought it  of interest to examine, so faras facts and  figures  are available, the effect  on employment ofmy efforts to diversify the nature of  employment in the Areas.Nature of the New Industries.  in. The new industries which have been introduced are of avery varied character.   They include, in the North  East, wood-working  industries of various kinds,  (including veneers and manufactures of plywood such as plywood&apos; doors),  motor bodybuilding,  containers of  various  kinds, electrical  engineering,electric wiring, electric batteries, food products of various kinds(including confectionery), clothing, leather handbags, buttons,and  various light metal  industries.  South  Wales has also  avaried list of new industries, including electrical switchgear,batteries and other electrical equipment, toys, fancy  goods, paper and  paper board, typewriter carbons and ribbons,  roller skatesand  other steel products, silk tissues and silk printing, paint andvarnish,  abrasives, leather belting, footwear, chemicals, buttons,sewing machines, biscuits, clothing, etc.  112. The new West Cumberland  undertakings  were textilemanufactures, motor lawn mowers, leather and surgical instru-ments.                           .....  ...  113. New industries of this type probably  employ  a larger proportion of women  and girls than the average prevailing in industry as a whole; and this disparity will naturally be greaterif comparison is made with the existing age and sex distributionof insured persons in the Special Areas.  114. The following  table shows in the first  two  columns the proportions of males and females in the firms in the  three SpecialAreas which have been  assisted by me in one form or another and had started production  by 30th  September;  and in thesecond two columns the estimated distribution of the  estimatedinsured  population  in the Exchange Areas where the under- takings   covered by  the  first  two   columns  are  situated.

Development Councils.  115. The policy of giving financial assistance to the Develop-ment Councils in the Special Areas, described in my last Report,has been continued and much useful work has been done.  Thefollowing paragraphs give a short account  of what has beendone in each Area.    In all three Areas  there has been close co-operation between the Development Organisations and  the trading Estates Companies and, in Cumberland, the IndustrialDevelopment Company.North East Development Board.  116. The work of the Board, of which Lord Ridley has con-tinued to be Chairman, has  been maintained.  All the DistrictBoards in the Special Areas have continued to be represented on it.  117. On  the industrial side a booklet of  sixteen pages hasbeen published  containing concise information likely to  be  ofinterest  to  manufacturers, and editions have  been printed  in english, French, German and Dutch.   The  English edition  ofthe booklet was quickly exhausted and a reprint was obtained.The  figures for Great  Britain and the Ministry of  LabourDivisions are given in the previous table:                   .
The Industrial Folder published in 1936 has been reissued in a revised form, and a folder containing information regarding thegoods manufactured in the North East has also been produced.  118. A  new edition of the Travel Folder, mentioned in theprevious Report and issued in conjunction  with the Travel andIndustrial Development  Association,  has  been  prepared.   Inaddition to the copies  for  the Association a large supply was distributed by the Board by means of the London and NorthEastern Railway, at the Empire Exhibition and in other ways.A Holiday Guide Book was published in February, 1938, andhas received  favourable notice in the Press.  The demand forcopies has practically  exhausted the supply  of  10,000 whichwas obtained. In addition to the Travel Folder a route map was issued,  containing details of places of interest to tourists andof holiday centres  in the Area, and  a map of the main and secondary roads throughout North East England.  This has beenfound of great use at the  Empire Exhibition.  The issue of newsthrough the medium of Industrial Britain, the Press generally and  through broadcasting stations  has been continued.   two new  posters have been issued.  119. The^ Board  was represented by a  stand at the BritishIndustries Fair at Earl&apos;s Court and at the Empire  Exhibitionin Scotland.  The Board has  also co-operated with  the travel and  Industrial Development Association in their InformationBureau at Cockspur Street, London,  S.W.I.  120. The Technical Advisory Committee has begun the pub-lication of a series of  reports on investigations undertaken at its own instance into various natural resources of the Area.  InDecember, 1937, the first of these was published, being a reportby Professor Granville Pool on the Barytes, Fluorspar and Leadin Upper Teesdale and Weardale.  The Committee&apos;s advice hasalso been sought by intending applicants for assistance, includingcolliery undertakings and brick and tile works.  Among othermatters dealt with were the Governments land fertility schemes,and  a survey of the coal seams in the Haltwhistle district.  121. Many enquiries have been received from firms or indi-viduals regarding facilities for the establishment of industrial undertakings in the Area.  Some of these are dealt with throughthe District Boards and appropriate cases are referred to NorthEastern Trading Estates, Limited.   The Board is also able toassist the District Boards in many cases which come direct tothem in the first instance.  122.  During the year  the Board arranged for a  small Sub-Committee to prepare a written statement of evidence to be given before the Royal Commission, and this  was submitted in Feb-ruary,  1938.   Subsequently,  oral  evidence on  behalf of  theBoard  was  given,  the  witnesses  being  the  Chairman,  Mr.G. H. J.  Daysh, and the Secretary.
National Industrial Development Council of Wales  and Mon-    mouthshire.  123. The Development Council has continued its work underthe chairmanship of Councillor  George Williams, and is able toreport useful  progress in  various  directions.  124. Co-operation  with the Travel and  Industrial Develop-ment  Association  has  been  continued,  and the Council  hasco-operated with the Association in  the Information Bureau setup  during the year at Cockspur Street, London,  S.W.I.   Aweek&apos;s  special exhibition pointing  out the attractions of theSouth Wales Area to tourists was held, and another week  was devoted to a display of the industrial facilities of the Area.  Inthis latter the  Trading Estates  Company co-operated.  In theearly  part of 1938 a special  advertising  campaign was carriedout in some of  the leading daily  newspapers, and a small bookletwas issued containing the separate items published periodicallyduring the campaign.  125. The quarterly magazine  continues to be issued and has a wide distribution.  The August issue contains much useful in-formation about recent industrial developments in South Wales,together with some excellent photographs of several of the  new factories which have been built and of  the Treforest TradingEstate.  126. Special brochures have  been issued outlining the  indus-trial attractions of the Area and in co-operation with the travel and Industrial  Development Association the usual Travel Foldersin French, English and German have been  circulated.   the fifth Welsh Industries Fair was held at Cardiff from 30th  march to 9th April,  and  again proved a great  success from both thepoint  of view of attendance and that of business.   Some of the firms which have started industries  on the Trading Estate were able to exhibit their products.  Arrangements have been madeto hold  a Sixth Fair in March,  1939.  127. The Council  was again able to  be  represented  at theBritish Industries  Fair at Birmingham.  Further opportunities for  publicity arose at the National  Eisteddfod and  the  RoyalShow.  128. The Industrial  Survey  published  in the early part of1937 has been  well received, some 380 copies having been sold.The Council has maintained its Economic Advisory Department,and during the year much useful research has been carried  out.A considerable amount of information  has  been collected inorder to keep  the  files  of the Industrial Survey material up todate.  129. The Council has  submitted  to me  a suggestion  that afew factories  of a standard type should be erected  at selectedcentral sites in the centre and tops of the valleys on the grounds
that the existing estates are of little direct benefit to those partsof  the  Special Areas.  These factories would  be erected inadvance of requirements, as it was argued that unless some such scheme were adopted there would be little likelihood of inducingmanufacturers to establish industry in those areas.  130. It  must be  borne in  mind that  the Treforest  TradingEstate was specially selected,  among other reasons, as being thecentre of  a large area of unemployment.  In addition I havea large area available  at Dowlais, where one  factory  has beencompleted and another arranged for, and where there is amplespace for  many  more.   Further,  I  have arranged for the  g.e.e-tion of  another large factory in the neighbourhood of  MerthyrTydfil and four others  in other parts of the  Special  Area.  Ihave informed  the Council that I am not prepared to buildspeculative factories which,  if they remained  un-let, would bea bad advertisement for South Wales; but that I  am alwaysready to consider the acquisition of further sites and the con-struction of further factories  for intending  industrialists who,for sufficient reason, cannot be conveniently accommodated onthe Treforest Trading Estate or on the sites  already acquired.The question of acquiring further sites will have to be examinedagain in view of  the continuance of the Acts for another year.  131. During the year the Coal Research Committee issued its second  interim  Report  which dealt with the  Fischer  Tropschprocess as applicable to Welsh coals.  The  Committee hopesshortly to issue reports on other processes.  132. The  Council submitted written  evidence to the RoyalCommission and  a deputation appeared before the Commissionto give oral evidence.Cumberland Development Council.  133. The  Council has continued its  work  under the chair-manship of  Major A. Hibbert, D.S.O.,  M.C.  134. A publicity campaign  has been launched in co-operationwith the West Cumberland Industrial Development Company,Limited.  Posters drawing attention to the  Area  and to thefactory sites available have been printed and exhibited on themain line  stations of the London Midland and Scottish railway system and on  the Underground Stations in London.,  Adver-tisements  have  been prepared and are appearing in  selectedtrade papers.  Industrial Folders in three languages have been produced  and given a  wide distribution.  135. Brochures and Folders showing the scenic beauties of theArea have also been distributed and a new edition of the TravelFolder issued  in conjunction with the Travel and IndustrialDevelopment Association is now being prepared.  In conjunc-tion with  the Development Company a stand  was taken at the
       PART IV.-FACILITIES FOR INDUSTRIAL                     DEVELOPMENT.  139. I am pleased  to be able to record substantial  progressduring the last twelve months by the various regional organisa-tions  concerned  directly with industrial development.  For the particulars of the progress of these bodies contained in the follow-ing paragraphs I am indebted to North Eastern Trading Estates,Empire Exhibition in Glasgow,  and window displays have beenarranged at the Information Bureau of the Travel and IndustrialDevelopment  Association  in  Cockspur Street.  A part-timePublicity Officer  has been appointed to supply the local and national press with views and comments on matters of interest.  136. The Industrial Survey of  the Area  has  been completed and is now in the press.   The Survey of the flooded and aban-abandoned iron ore mines in the Area has been continued  and theReport is expected very shortly. During the year a preliminarysurvey of the valuable supplies of water in the Special Area was completed and this Report is now receiving active considerationby  a Joint Committee  of the  Development Council  and theIndustrial Development Company.  137. During  the year evidence  was given before  the  RoyalCommission.   The evidence had  been prepared in conjunctionwith Mr. Daysh, of King&apos;s College, University of Durham, whocarried out the Industrial Survey.                  Centralised Propaganda.  138. In my last Report I mentioned that I had, in conjunc-tion with the Commissioner for the Special Areas  in Scotland,prepared a small book entitled &apos;&apos; New Fields for Industry &apos;&apos; andwas in consultation  with him  regarding an extension of theefforts to  make more generally known  the excellent  facilities available in the Areas and the financial assistance which couldbe given.   Towards the  end of last year, in  conjunction  with theScottish Commissioner,  I arranged for a wide circulation of thisbooklet through the leading banks, the shipping companies andthe railway  companies.  Arrangements were  also  made for circulation  to our overseas representatives through the  Depart-ment of Overseas Trade.   Early in the new year we  decidedto insert advertisements in  a number of the leading trade  journalsand these  advertisements have brought  a number of useful en-quiries, some of  which have resulted in the establishment of undertakings  in the  Areas.  I  feel, however,  that the generalrecession in  development which  has been  the  feature of thepast twelve months has  rendered these efforts of less  effect than would otherwise have been the case.
Limited, South  Wales  and  Monmouthshire Trading Estates,Limited, the West Cumberland Industrial Development Com-pany and the South West Durham Improvement Association,Limited.          North  Eastern  Trading  Estates,  Limited.Team Valley Estate.  140. The development  of the Team Valley Estate has beenpushed on during the twelve months under review to the stageat which the lay-out  of the Estate, with roads, drainage, supplyservices, railways, etc., is nearing completion, so that a large area of the Estate is now available to receive factories.  It isnow possible to see in actual being the design for convenient andattractive factories with direct connection  on to the main Estateavenues, and the roads,  open spaces and  grass verges whichcombine convenience  of  access with amenities.  Despite  thevarious requirements which have to be met, it has been possible,owing to the co-ordination of the local architects&apos; designs by theConsulting Architect, to produce a homogeneous effect with nojarring note.  The Estate railway system has been  completed,and among the services which are now in operation are the clean-ing of the Estate roads, the collection and  disposal of refuse, themaintenance of street lighting, the working of communal boilerplants and a system of night patrolmen.  141. The actual factory construction has also made good pro-gress in the last twelve months. Whereas at the end of Septem-ber, 1937, twenty-two factories had been built, and a further tenwere in course  of  erection,  the  number  completed on  30thSeptember, 1938, was seventy-six  and nineteen were being built at that date. The success of the Estate as  a home for new industries is emphasised by the fact that six tenants have givenorders for substantial extensions to their premises after less thanone year&apos;s experience of the attractions the Estate has to offer,and two are already  in occupation of their extended premises.   142.  Concurrendy with the development of the site and con-struction  of factories, rapid progress has been made with theCentral Building which is to provide, besides the Estate Com-pany&apos;s own offices, other  offices for letting, a restaurant, a meet-ing room,  etc. The  Estate Company took possession of its newoffices on  1st August. Adjoining the Central Building, accom-modation  was being prepared for Banks, a  Post Office  and similar services.  The postal delivery to the Estate is now larger than that of any other district in the Gateshead area. The  firstpermanent canteen  on the Estate, which was opened by LadyLondonderry on 13th July, is at present serving over 300 mealsdaily at reasonable  prices but its full capacity is such that 600meals can be served at a single sitting.  In regard to recreation
facilities, a scheme has been submitted to the Area Committeeof the National Fitness Council, which is primarily intended forthe benefit of Gateshead as a whole and is as ambitious as the urgent need  of the area requires.  A  football pitch is  already in course of  construction on the Estate.  A  staff of gardenersis employed on the work of maintenance of existing open spaces,flower beds,  shrubs and trees and it is hoped that all the horticulture-cultural needs  of the Estate will  shortly be supplied  from itsown nurseries.  143. The number of persons employed  on  development worknaturally shows a decline with the completion of so much of the initial activities on the Estate, but on the other hand the numberof factory employees on the Estate at the end of September was just over 1,500. This number will tend to increase not only asfurther factories are occupied, but also as those already occupied,and in the initial stages of production, make progress towards thefull production of which the factories are capable. The  Employ-ment Exchange established by  the Ministry  of  Labour  on the estate continues to deal with all labour requirements, which arefilled  impartially  from  all  parts of the North  Eastern SpecialArea. High  opinions are still being expressed by employers onthe quality of  the labour supplied.  144. Every opportunity has been taken during the past yearto secure publicity for the Estate. Organised parties  are  con-stantly being  shown over the Estate; flood-lighting arrangements have been introduced in order to attract the attention of passen-gers on the main line trains to and from London and Edinburgh;and a new booklet, giving full details of the facilities offered bythe Estate, has been published and circulated widely,  both athome and abroad.Other Sites.  145. The Trading Estates Company has leased from me andis developing in co-operation with me a  group  site at Pallion,near Sunderland, of about seventeen acres, and another at St.Helen Auckland, in South West Durham, of about fifteen acres see paragraphs 181 and 183, respectively.  On the first  of these,one factory for the manufacture of clothing is now in productionand is employing  150 persons,  another is nearing  completion,the building of a third is well advanced (these two being for themanufacture  of oxygen and  other gases)  and a  fourth is being planned. At  St. Helen Auckland two factories are in production one manufacturing leather bags and the other buttons, bucklesand other ornaments and  a third,  for plastic  mouldings andengraved scales, is nearly  completed; a  fourth for the  manu-facture of cabinet work is about to be built. The  two factories in production were employing  216 persons.  At  North Shields one
factory for the manufacture of knitwear in the Continental stylehas been completed on land leased from me and is now in pro-duction, employing 60 persons.  146. In all these cases the experience of the Company and ofits staff is at the service of prospective tenants, and promoters ofindustrial enterprises in the North East  Special Area have in thisway a wide choice of location of factories erected and managed by a Company which has by now acquired wide experience inthe business of providing industrial accommodation.   South Wales and Monmouthshire Trading Estate,  Limited.Treforest Estate.  147. The whole of the civil engineering  work on an area of155 acres on the Treforest Estate  is  now complete, with theexception of a small area in the Llantrisant district at the Northend of the  site.  The site has been completely prepared for theerection of  factory buildings and it is now possible for the EstateCompany to guarantee that a factory can be built in from fourt six months. The Estate has been laid out in accordance withthe original policy of the Board.  Ample space has been allowedaround  each factory for possible  future  extensions  to  each individual factory unit, and two such  extensions have alreadybeen ordered.  In most cases tenants  have taken  short  termoptions on  the land adjoining their factory premises and, in theevent of the land not being required  for  extension purposes,additional factories can be provided.  148. The Company has developed  a Trading Estate  with modern factories and the most comprehensive supply of services.Factories have been built to the requirements of tenants pro-ducing goods which can only be made in  a factory designed for the purpose, but the majority are of standard type and areadaptable to various trades.  They  have been designed to con-form  with  every requirement of the Factory and  WorkshopsAct,  with the maximum amount of light and fresh  air, whichis conducive to the comfort of those employed, and which should provide the greatest degree of efficiency to the employer.   Theminimum size of a  standard factory is 6,300 square feet and larger types are available, ranging from 10,000 to 18,000 square feet.   Two  large Nest Factories have also been erected to accom-accommodate  a number of manufacturers requiring a smaller spacethan  the minimum standard  factory.  149. At the time of my last Report 17 factories were completeor in course of erection, and this number has now been increasedto 39 factories and  nine other  buildings. Only four companies were  in occupation of  their  factories  at  the time  of the lastReport, whereas at 30th September, 1938,  31 firms had begun to operate,  although some considerable time  may elapse before
a number of them will employ a full complement of workpeople.On the date stated, 682  persons  had been  found permanent employment in 29 factories on the Treforest Estate,  of whichnumber 469 were men and women over the age of 18 years.  Afurther 564 men were employed on development work and thetotal number of workpeople was therefore 1,246.  150. As a result of the  activities of the Company during thepast two years various types of new industries have been estab-lished  in the Special Areas of South Wales, and although theyhave been operating for only a short period the principals areof the  opinion that Treforest is a most suitable  location for theestablishment of a new  works, and they  have every confidence in their ability to succeed.  151. The  Treforest Estate is  the only Industrial Estate inGreat  Britain which has provided a high-pressure steam mainfrom which industrialists can obtain a bulk supply of steam forprocessing and  heating purposes.   The charge made for a bulksupply is much cheaper  than would be the case  if the user were compelled to expend a considerable amount of money on  aseparate  boiler plant, steam engines, etc.  152. The Estate is provided with transformers, switchgear andcables  sufficient  to  distribute a  demand of  approximately8,000  Kw.,  and the prices for either a high- or low-tensionsupply are strictly comparable with the charges made elsewhere.Bulk supplies of gas are  available at reasonable prices.  In orderto provide an adequate  and cheap supply of water for all pur-poses,  the Company has installed pumping stations on the bankof the  Taff River.  The Company has  its own reservoir andfiltration  and purification plant, and is completely independent of any other source of supply.  153. Full  provision is being made for  the  railway  sidingsalongside the factories to be connected  to the Great WesternRailway&apos;s main line from Cardiff to Merthyr, and  the RailwayCompany has arranged for the collection of goods at various times during the day, and for their despatch to any destinationwithin  150 miles of the Estate on the morning following the dayof collection.  154.  The Estate Company is also erecting two canteens and arestaurant for the use of employees and others  having business on  the Estate.   Adjoining the Estate  Administration  Officeanother building has been erected, which will  be  occupied by two Joint Stock Banks and the Post Office.  155.  The  total amount  of expenditure to 30th September,1938, on the acquisition of a site of 250 acres and the preparation and development of an area of 155 acres, complete with roads,drainage system, sewers, gas and water mains, electricity distri-bution, steam supply and  factory construction and other build-ings, together with administration and  advertising expenses,was about  700,000.
Other Sites.  156. I have acquired and have leased or arranged to lease tothe Trading Estate Company  sites at  Dowlais,  Cyfarthfa,Ynyswen   (Rhondda),  Porth   (Rhondda),   Llantarnam  andCwmbran for industrial development.  157. The first two of these  sites, as mentioned in paragraphs343 and 344 of my last Report, were formerly occupied by ironand steel  works which had been allowed to fall derelict.   AtDowlais some thirty acres have been cleared and developed, anda factory of 28,000 sq. ft.,  giving employment to 142 work-people has  been erected.   It is hoped to complete a furtherfactory of 6,600 sq.  ft. in a few months.  At Cyfarthfa a factoryof 140,000 sq. ft. is ready  for the installation of machinery  bythe firm to which it has been leased.  158. At Ynyswen an agreement has been  completed for the lease of a factory of 70,000  sq. ft. now in course of construction,while at Porth negotiations are in  hand for the  erection  of a factory of  17,000 sq. ft.   The factory at Llantarnam (76,000sq. ft.) is  already  occupied  and giving  employment to  over350 persons, and at Cwmbran  a factory of. 43,000 sq. ft. isalmost ready for occupation.     West  Cumberland industrial Development Company.  159. In  my  last  Report I recorded the constitution of this company,  which was registered on  14th August, 1937.  since that date I have completed  arrangements with the company for the financing of its operations which,  in  addition to indus-trial development somewhat  on the fines of the&apos; two  TradingEstates Companies,  include schemes for improving the amenities of the Area by the removing of unsightiy relics of past industry.The following paragraphs give a brief description of the work carried out by the Company during  the past twelve months.  160. At  Maryport an area of land  amounting to seventeenacres  to the south of the town and  near the Harbour has been purchased for industrial development.  Two factories have beencompleted and  one  was occupied by its tenants in the course ofAugust, 1938.  A third factory  is now being erected, it beingthe intention to keep two factories in hand available for promptleasing to tenants.  Negotiations are already proceeding whichit is hoped will lead to the leasing  of the larger of these twofactories.   The development  of  the  estate, together with other measures, will greatly improve the amenities of Maryport.  161. The Company has purchased Cleator Mill,  &apos;a large build-ing at Cleator,  which had been standing idle for several years,and extensive reconditioning has been carried out.   Excellentfactory space, amounting in  all  to over 100,000 sq. ft., is now available at a low rental and two tenants are in  occupation ofabout half this area.
  162. The erection of a large factory at Millom for the manu-facture of leather was commenced in April  and completion isexpected in October.  163. Nearly nine  acres of land have been purchased at Hen-singham, near Whitehaven, and the erection of a factory forthe weaving and finishing of silk was begun in August.  164. During the year  the employment given in the laying out and erection of factories  was equivalent to an over-all average of201 men for twenty-four weeks.  The factories so  far let areexpected to  provide employment, when in full production, forsome  700 persons.  165. Further negotiations are  in progress which it is hopedwill lead to the setting  up of further new industries, and theDevelopment Company  is also engaged in formulating a numberof schemes for the improvement of the amenities of the Area&quot;.  166. Close co-operation has been maintained with the  Cum-berland Development Council and joint committees have been set up for the purpose of organising publicity work and investi-gating commercial  proposals.  A stand was taken jointly bythe Company and the Council at the Empire Exhibition.  167. I am considering the possibility of carrying out, with theassistance of the Company, the work of removing or improving the appearance of the more prominent eyesores formed by theruins  of buildings,  etc.,  which   have been abandoned by industry and are likely  to  prove deterrents  to industrial  enter-prise  or  tourist traffic.               Other Industrial Development.   168. The foregoing lists  of  factories  which have been  or arebeing erected on the  Trading Estates, or on other  sites  in theAreas under powers conferred on me by the  Special Areas Acts,do not form an exhaustive account of industrial  development.Among  instances of  other industrial  undertakings being ex-tended or  established (in  some of  the latter cases  with  assist-ance  from me by way of contributions) I may mention that aniron and steel works at  Blaenavon has been  extended, while theLow  Temperature Carbonisation works at Bridgend mentionedin paragraph 54  of my  last Report  has been almost completed. A glass  works  has  been set up at Pontypool, and a foundry is being established at Taffs  Well.  The  New  jarrow Steel Com- pany is about to commence  the erection of plant on the site of Palmer&apos;s Yard,  and a  metal works  and a  tube  works have also commenced  production at Jarrow.  An undertaking  for the manufacture of pneumatic tools is in operation  at Gateshead, a coal  carbonisation plant  at  Seaham Harbour,  a plywood factory on the Tyne and a  timber works at Crook, Co. Durham.
   South West Durham Improvement Association,  Limited.  169. In paragraphs 329 to 333 of my last Report, I describedhow the South West Durham Improvement Association came tobe - set up.  The Association received its Certificate  of  Incor-poration early  in  October,  1937,  since  when the Board oifDirectors has  met on twelve occasions.  During the  past year the  Board was strengthened  by the  appointment of ColonelChapman (already a Director of North Eastern Trading Estates,Limited), and Mr. H. A. Booth as Directors.  170. I have entered into an agreement with the Association bywhich I have  undertaken to provide the necessary finance forapproved schemes for site clearance and treatment of pit heaps,within a maximum figure of  100,000.Derelict Villages.  171. Towards the end  of  1937 the Directors  instructed  theSecretary  to prepare reports  on a  number of villages which appeared  to warrant special treatment owing  to bad housing,lack  of social amenities  and  complete  absence of  industrialactivities.  They have now considered several such  reports andit is  already evident that prospects of industrial development inthe  proximity of many of these villages  must be  regarded asunpromising in the extreme.  The  question  of  housing is ofutmost importance  and, in this connection, arrangements havebeen made for the North Eastern Housing Association, Limited,to consult the Association on the question of the location of sites for  any housing undertaken by them for local authorities inSouth West Durham.  The policy of the Association is to ensurethat, as far as  this is practicable,  rehousing should  only  takeplace in districts where there is some likelihood of more or lesscontinuous employment and where there  are  opportunities ofemployment for the younger generation.  All the houses in EdenPit  have been scheduled under the  Slum Clearance Act and  Ihave given power to the Association to deal with the site as andwhen the  houses are vacated.  It is hoped that the inhabitantswill  be rehoused at Shildon and the site restored to agriculture.Recommendations  in respect of other villages are now beforeme.Clearance of  Derelict Sites.  172. As  a result of a preliminary survey of the area someeighteen derelict sites were scheduled for  attention.  The  sitesconsist of waste heaps, derelict colliery buildings,  coke ovens,etc.  Three of the sites have already been cleared,1 work is pro-ceeding on the fourth and contracts will be let in the near future for work  on another two.  On  one site a pit heap containingapproximately 120,000 tons of waste was levelled over  an areaof fifteen  acres  and the site is now  available for development.
On other sites waste  heaps are being levelled and used to fillin pit shafts, and for filling for roads and factories now being built on the St. Helen  Auckland Industrial Site.Planting of Pit Heaps.  173. Very  little data  was available to the Association on thepossibility of planting pit heaps but, thanks to the co-operationof the Officers of the  Forestry Commission and the Director ofAgriculture for the County of Durham, and to the efforts of theChairman, one  heap  of approximately  six acres was  plantedin March, 1938.  Despite the drought which followed the plant-ing, the trees appear  to be doing well and fatalities have beenfew.  Two further  heaps  are to be planted in October.  the ecclesiatical Commissioners have  given, four  pit-heap sites tothe Association free of cost.Group Site at St. Helen Auckland.  174. As stated in paragraph 183 I have purchased a site ofapproximately forty acres  at St. Helen Auckland, fifteen acres of which have been  leased to the North Eastern Trading Estates,Limited  (see paragraph 145), and  the rest to the  South WestDurham Improvement  Association, Limited.  The part handedover to the Association has been cleared and will be available to enlarge,  if necessary, the area leased to  the Trading EstateCompany, with whom close co-operation is being maintained.Future Work of the Association.  175. The  earlier  part of the period  under review  was, ofcourse,  one  of exploration, but it has been possible to expeditework during the latter  part.  The  question of the future of thederelict  villages  is of  paramount importance but, once  thegeneral principles now  under consideration have been settied,it should be possible to accelerate action in co-operation  withthe various local authorities in  the area.Acquisition and  Clearance of Sites  for industrial Development.  176. Further substantial progress has been made during thepast twelve months with the  acquisition of sites for industrialdevelopment and with the work of clearing and developing thosesites.  The following paragraphs give details of the work done.  177. In paragraph  335 of my last Report, it was stated  that,following a  comprehensive  report by a  firm of consulting engineers, a scheme was under consideration embracing a much wider area of the East Gateshead Waterfront than had originally been  proposed see  paragraph 150 of  Sir Malcolm Stewart&apos;sThird Report and  providing for the clearance and, where neces-sary, the levelling of  the area, and  the construction estate road-ways,  etc.,  with a view  to preparing the land for industrial
development,  housing purposes and  open spaces.  Much pro-gress has been made in the past year, despite the many difficultieswhich have inevitably arisen, including those appertaining tothe acquisition of the land on my behalf.  It  is hoped that, inthe near future, the land to  the east .of  the  Newcastle  SwingBridge will be leased to North  Eastern Trading Estates, Limited,and the  work of completing  the clearance of that part  of the site and preparing it for subsequent development will be  put inhand. Meanwhile, a good deal of preliminary work on the sitehas been carried out on my behalf by the Gateshead Corporation.   178. Good progress has been made with the work of clearing the waterside front at South Shields,  to which reference is madein paragraph  336  of  my  previous Report.  The  clearance andlevelling of the first portion of the area,  embracing about  thirty-five acres, has been satisfactorily  completed,  and work  on theremainder of  the scheme  is proceeding.  Now that the schemeis taking shape, it is realised  that a very  marked improvementin the appearance of the entrance to the River  Tyne is being effected, and  in my opinion the site  in its improved conditionshould prove  particularly attractive to industrial undertakings.I am informed that several such concerns are negotiating withthe Corporation,  and the prospects of the disposal of the sitesare reported to be good.  179. The clearance of the Holborn area of the County borough of South Shields, which is also referred to in my previous Report(paragraph 337), has not actively commenced, as the councils not yet in a position to  enter on all the  lands required  for thescheme.  It is, however, anticipated that the necessary formalitiesin  that  connection  will  shortly  be completed,  and I haveintimated to the Council  the  basis on which I am prepared  to afford assistance towards the cost of the. scheme.   180. I have leased the greater part of Palmer&apos;s Yard, Jarrow(comprising the old steelworks site and part of the shipyard site),together with the Slag Dump and connecting railway,  to theNew Jarrow Steel Company, who will  carry  out the clearance of the area so  leased in connection with their schemes of develop-ment.  I have also granted  the  Company  an  option   on theremaining part of the site, which the vendors agreed to hand overon 1st October, 1938.   181. I have completed  the purchase of the seventeen-acre site at Pallion, on the western outskirts of Sunderland, referred to inparagraph 339 of my previous Report, and have leased the land to North Eastern Trading Estates, Limited.  As stated in para-graph 145 of the present Report, one factory has been completed and two others are nearing completion,  while plans for a fourthare now being prepared.
   182. The Tyne Improvement Commissioners have  started work on the construction of the new timber quay and the pro-vision of road and rail access to the site between Hebburn andJarrow, which was described in paragraph 340 of my previous report.  As cleared and  levelled, it now presents a most attracted-tive appearance for industrial  occupation.  By  acquiring landadjacent to the  site,  belonging to Hebburn Urban DistrictCouncil, the Commissioners have increased the  available riverfrontage of this site from 550 feet to 700 feet.  A depth of 25 feet of water at L.W.O.S.D.  has been provided alongside.   183. Since the date of my last Report, I have acquired a site of some forty acres at St. Helen Auckland, a mile and a half tothe west of Bishop Auckland, in South West Durham.  As statedin paragraph 145, part (fifteen acres) of this site has been leasedto  North Eastern  Trading  Estates,  Limited,   for  industrialdevelopment and three factories are completed, of which two were in production on 30th September, and plans for a fourthwere well advanced. The remainder of the site, which is beingleased to  the  South West  Durham Improvement Association,Limited (see paragraph 174), was occupied by an unsightly pitheap, a great part of which has been levelled by the Association,while part, lying at the back of the site, has been planted withtrees.  The levelled part will thus be available  for subsequentindustrial development.   184. Other derelict sites which are being cleared by  the SouthWest Durham  Improvement Association, Limited, are mentionedin paragraph 172.   185. Good progress  has  been made by the Tyne  Improve-ment Commissioners with a number of schemes for the clearance of unsightly riverside sites.  The clearance and tidying up of aderelict site at  St. Anthony&apos;s of a total area of about eleven acreshas been completed. This site has excellent facilities, with road and rail  connections.  Clearance of another site at Hebburn,formerly occupied partly by chemical works  and partly by a ship-building yard, will be completed in the early autumn.  Thissite covers an  area of about twenty-eight  acres and has a goodriver frontage  with access by road and rail.  Work on a furthersite at Jarrow, formerly occupied by cement works and coveringan area of  twelve acres, was  begun during  September.   Theobject of these schemes was to  improve the general appearance of the riverside and to  make  immediately available to pros-pective occupiers attractive sites for industry.  The new appear-ance  of the sites  fully justifies the expenditure  upon them.  Iam informed by the Tyne Improvement Commissioners that theyare now considering other sites on  which similar work may bedone.   186. The site of the old Dowlais Steel Works,&quot; Merthyr Tydfil,which covers in all some ninety acres, has been leased to South
Wales &amp; Monmouthshire Trading Estates, Limited, in accprd-ance with the arrangements described in paragraph 343&apos; of mylast Report (see also paragraph 157 of the present Report).  !I87.  The purchase of the Cyfarthfa site has.been completed and  it has been leased for development to  South Wales  &amp;Monmouthshire Trading Estates, Limited (see  paragraph 157).  188.  The last-mentioned two schemes should  be of the utmostvalue to  Merthyr Tydfil and I am hopeful that further tenantswill be obtained for the Dowlais site.  Negotiations are in pro-gress with two prospective tenants.  189.  In addition to the two sites in Monmouthshire mentionedin paragraph  345 of my previous Report, which are at Cwmbranand Llantarnam, a site has been acquired at  Ynyswen in theRhondda Valley  and another  site is being acquired at Porth,also in the Rhondda Valley, for a new undertaking. (Regardingthese four sites see also paragraphs 156 to 158.)  190.  The clearance of sites in West Cumberland is, as men-tioned in paragraphs 159 to. 167  of this Report,  being carriedout by the West Cumberland Industrial Development Company.               Improvement of Pit Heaps, etc.  191.  Mention has been made in earlier sections of this Reportof the removal of derelict buildings and other eyesores whichhave remained as unhappy reminders of the former industrial activity prevalent in the Special Areas.  The process of completeremoval  is impracticable in the case of the extensive tips anddeposits  which too  frequently  form a permanent disfigurementof the landscape.  Nevertheless some improvement of the appear-ance of these  deposits can be achieved by schemes of tree plant-ing,  and I have invited the District  Commissioners  in SouthWales and West Cumberland to consider the formulation of such schemes, on  the lines  adopted by the South West DurhamImprovement Association,  Limited,  by local authorities.   Icontemplate the provision of grants towards this work from theSpecial  Areas Fund within a  limit of   6,000,  on the under-standing that the tips are vested, by gift or peppercorn lease, inthe local authorities which will carry out the  work.              Improvement of Shipping  Facilities.  192. Progress  has also  been made  with the work of  theimprovement of  shipping facilities described  in my previous report.  The following paragraphs give  an account of what hasbeen done during the past  twelve months.  193. Piles  are being driven in connection with the constructionof the 1,400  ft. deep-water quays on the river front  of TyneDock.  Detailed plans of the construction work  are being hurriedforward  with a view to  the commencement of  work at an early
date.  These plans involve a very large amount of detailed work.The engineers have been busy for several months and so far as can be ascertained the probability is that the detailed plans willbe ready in February, 1939.  194. Good progress has been made with the removal of FellingPoint, for the improvement of  navigation on the River Tyne,referred to in paragraph 349 of my previous Report. Dredging,which has  necessitated  a considerable  amount of submarineblasting on  account of the hard nature  of the ground encounter-tered, and excavation are  being continued.  Work is also beingcarried out on the formation of the slopes of the banks.  195. Work on the Sunderland fish quay has not yet been com-pleted but  very good progress has been made and it is hopedthat completion will not  be much longer delayed.  196. Good progress has also been made with the scheme forcoast  protection to the  south of  Sunderland Docks, which is dependent very largely on weather conditions.  197. Since the date of my last Report I have  agreed with theRiver  Wear Commissioners to  assist them  with the  work  ofstraightening the Entrance Channel to the River Wear betweenthe outer and inner  piers  into which  a ledge of rock projects.The work, which is dependent on favourable weather conditions and also involves a considerable amount of blasting owing to the hard nature of the rock, will probably take a considerable time.The cost is estimated at  60,000.  In conjunction with this work  the River Wear Commissioners are  also proposing to  use thedredger which  is engaged on this scheme, during times whenwork  at the Entrance Channel  is not possible,  for clearing anobstruction further  up  the river.  Appreciable progress hasbeen  made  with the Entrance Channel  Scheme.  The work inthe river will probably be undertaken mainly during the winter months.  198. The work of remodelling  the Dock Entrance at White-haven Harbour, referred  to in paragraph 352  of  my previous report, has made good progress and will probably be completedfairly shortly.  199.  During the year I was authorised to provide financialassistance, partly by way  of grant and partly by way of loan, toa scheme for the repair of Maryport Harbour at a total cost of 75,000. -The nature of  my offer will necessitate an amendmentof the financial provisions of the Acts relating to  the harbour and the necessary Bill is being prepared. Meanwhile, some pre-liminary exploration work has been  done and every  effort  isbeing made to push forward the preparation of the necessarydetailed plans with a view to a start being made if possible inadvance of the necessary legislation.   It is hoped that this work,in conjunction with  that  being done  by the West Cumberland
Industrial Development Company for the provision of factories,and the improvements in the matter of amenities (including theSea Brows scheme, now completed) will assist this very hard-hitcommunity.                     Communications.  200. Since the date of my last Report the Minister of Transporthas paid a visit to Cumberland to inspect the various proposalsfor a  West Coast Road, and discussion has since been proceed-ing between the Ministry and the various local  authorities con-cerned.  At  the date of  this Report it was  understood that thethree  County Councils concerned, namely,  Cumberland, West-morland and Lancashire, were in conference with a view to work-being out a scheme suitable for placing before the Minister for his approval.  201. I still hold the view, expressed in paragraph 357 of mylast Report, that the improvement of road communications withWest  Cumberland is of paramount importance for the industrialdevelopment of that Area.        PART V.-SUB-ECONOMIC EMPLOYMENT.  202. What is meant by &quot; sub-economic employment &quot; was explained, fully in Part X of my last Report.  It is employment which provides useful occupation for an appreciable number ofthat large group  of unemployed men who, through age or dis-ability or both, are unlikely to be re-absorbed into normal indus-trial employment; it is employment undertaken voluntarily,  sothat those employed remain free to take normal work for wagesif opportunity  to do so should occur; it is not work which islikely to be undertaken by any other organisation on a wage-paid  basis;  and, although  those participating continue to  be mainly dependent on their unemployment allowances, it offersthem a chance of improving the standard of living of themselves and their dependants.   203.  The chief schemes of sub-economic employment carriedon in the Special Areas are:  Group Holdings, Cottage Home-steads, Voluntary (Local Amenities)  Schemes, Allotments andthe Subsistence Production Scheme in Eastern  Monmouthshire.A full description of  these schemes  has been  given in each ofthe previous Reports, and it is only intended that  the following paragraphs should  bring their history up to date.  The numberof men finding occupation in one or other  of the ways describedis still approximately 10,000  (excluding  allotment holders).                       Group Holdings.   204. Activity in the development of group holdings, i.e., plotsof one quarter to half an  acre of land, part for cultivation asallotments and part for the keeping of poultry or pigs, continued
                            Siduring the twelve months under  review,  though to a  lesser degree than in previous years the main obstacle to develop-ment  being the  difficulty  in  obtaining  suitable land  within reasonable distance of the homes of would-be groupholders.The progress made in the last two years is shown by the follow-ing figures: 	At		At		At		30th September,		30th September,		30th September,	Area.	1936.		1937-		1938:		Groups.

In Durham ten centres, comprising  162 members, were established during the year, bringing the total in that county to103 centres, with a membership of 1,966.  In his report on theprogress  of the  scheme  in Durham, the County Director ofAgriculture (Mr. J. W. Cassels), who with his staff has been responsible for the successful execution and administration of thescheme in that county, expresses the view that the decline in thenumber of centres inaugurated during the past year is due partly to increased  employment, but in  the  main to  the increasingdifficulty  experienced  in  the  acquisition of suitable land.  Hestates  that despite  the  diminution  in  the  number of  eligibleapplicants, the establishment  figures for the past twelve monthscould have been more than doubled but for the land problem.The  scheme undoubtedly is  an unfailing attraction for unem-ployed men in this county.   The County Council is thereforeplanning  for  further  extension of  group holdings in  the next twelve months.  206. With a view to placing the whole movement in their area on a permanent basis  the Council is considering the adoption ofa scheme whereby the groupholders will pay an inclusive rentalcovering  that portion of the  cost which is not met out of thegrant from the Special Areas Fund and providing for the upkeepof equipment and periodic renewal  of stock.   The adoption ofsuch a scheme will  remedy certain  defects which have become evident in  the existing arrangements which are not such as togive an assurance of  permanence to the scheme.
  207. In Northumberland, where the group holdings schemeis administered by the Land Settlement Association, there were no new developments during the year but one existing groupwas closed down owing to unsatisfactory conditions.   In Cum-berland,  where the Association is responsible also, three newgroups were established and one existing group extended, whileone group was terminated owing to employment being obtained by the men and no applicants being forthcoming for the vacatedholdings.   Great difficulty  is still being experienced  in obtain-ing suitable land and this is the main obstacle to progress.  208. In  Glamorgan,  where  the  group holdings scheme is administered by the County Director of Agriculture (Mr. J. D.Davidson),  three  new  centres comprising 31 members,  were established during the year, but one centre was  closed downas the groupholders had lost interest and new tenants were not forthcoming.  There  has been  an appreciable slackening in demand for group holdings in Glamorgan, and this, coupled withthe withdrawal from existing schemes of men who have obtainedindustrial employment locally or who have been transferred towhole-time land settlement schemes, has  resulted in about 8 percent,  of  the  holdings remaining unoccupied  at the end of theperiod covered by this Report.  The 55 centres then functioning,which comprised 777 holdings (of which  549 were poultry holcl-ings and 228 pig holdings), had a membership of 714 members,of whom 33 were occupying two holdings each..  The remaining63  holdings  were  vacant,  except in  so far  as 19 were beingworked  communally by the other  members  of the  centresconcerned.  209. The reduced demand has permitted of concentration onthe  consolidation of the  existing  groups in Glamorgan  andMr. Davidson reports that,  while there  are many disappointingfeatures in the scheme, yet in reviewing the position as a whole,it is pleasing to be able to say that two-thirds of the groups inthe county are  successfully established  and serve the purpose for which they were devised.  210. The group holdings in Monmouthshire, the administra-tion of which is under the immediate supervision of PrincipalG.  H. Purvis, of the Monmouthshire Agricultural College, Usk,are stated to be without doubt a great  success;  the  quality ofthe stock is first-class throughout, with sub-normal  mortality,and the gardens despite the bad season have been generally wellcultivated and much appreciated by the men.   Mr. Purvis isof  opinion that the group holdings have done more than anyother single  factor to improve and  ameliorate social conditions,and  to promote  the physical welfare of the unemployed menand  their families;  further that the  interest  and  enthusiasm
of the men have been most commendable and that on the wholethere  is an ever increasing  improvement in  their standard  ofself-respect and conduct.  211. During the twelve months under review, four new centrescomprising 50  members were  established, bringing the total in Monmouthshire  to  twenty-two centres  and 273  members.None  of the holdings was vacant on 30th September, despite thefact that there had been 117 changes of tenancy during the threeyears&apos; operation of the undertaking.   It is of interest to note that48 of  the 117 members who vacated their holdings were trans-ferred  to   whole-time  land  settlement  schemes  and  four  toCottage Homesteads and that the remainder, with the exceptionof three unsatisfactory tenants, left to take up employment.  212. Seven further schemes, making provision  for 80 men,are in prospect; but here again development of the undertakingis seriously hampered by the difficulty in obtaining suitable landin the neighbourhood of the men&apos;s homes,  which has renderedit impracticable to  meet the  demand of some  140 men  in other districts of the county.                    Cottage Homesteads.  213. The  Cottage Homesteads Scheme undertaken by  theLand Settlement Association with my approval has made good progress during the past year.  The following statement shows the properties acquired by the Association, the area, the numberof homesteads provided or to be provided and the estimated average cost:                                        No.  of     Average cost                          Area.

Hon. LordRushcliffe, P.C.,  C.B.E.,  Chairman of the  unemployment assistance Board, on 30th June, 1938, and the event attractedconsiderable interest.  214.  Each homestead consists of a house and about half anacre of land.  The  estimated  average cost,  including  rates,water supply, drainage, fencing,  etc., ranges from ^460  at
Elmesthorpe to  521 at Caversham.   Most of the houses havethree bedrooms, but a small proportion (one in six) have fourbedrooms. ; 215.  The rent at  Cosby,  Elmesthorpe and Dunstable, exclu-sive of rates, is 8s. 6d. per week with an extra is. per week forthe larger houses.   A subsidy not exceeding the joint contribu-tion from the Exchequer and  out  of Local Rates under theHousing Acts  is paid from the Special Areas Fund in respectof each house and the balance of the  cost is to be treated as a loan repayable in forty years with interest at the rate charged by the Public Works Loan Board to local authorities. That partof the  cost which is not subsidised will be met from the rentsafter deduction  of  a  standard  amount per house for  repairs,ordinary management charges and contingencies.  216. An advance not exceeding  20 is to be made to each occu-pier.,of a cottage homestead for the purchase of livestock, tools,etc., and this amount will be repayable in full over a period ofabout five years commencing with the second year of tenancy.  217.  The extent to  which adolescent members of the cottageholders&apos;  families have  already  obtained  local  employment  isvery satisfactory.   I am informed by the Association  that, ofthe 200 children over school age transferred up to 30th Sep-tember, 167 had found employment.  Of these,  128 had neverpreviously been  employed, and 41 had been in their new homesiess than a month before finding work.  At Elmesthorpe, 23 outof 24 adolescents are in work;  at Cosby,  84 out of 90;  and atLong Lawford,  16  out of  19.   Several of the  men have alsofound part-time employment.            Voluntary (Local Amenities) Schemes.  218.  A full description of these voluntary labour schemes,together with  details of eight of them, was given in Part VIIof Sir Malcolm Stewards Second Report; and up-to-date generalinformation  about  the schemes  was given in Part XI of hisThird Report, and  in Part X of my Report for the year ended30th September, 1937.  219.  During the year ended 30th September, 1938, twelve new schemes, or extensions of schemes already being assisted, havebeen submitted.  Brief details are given  in Appendix X.  Thetotal number of schemes to which consideration has been givensince  November, 1934, is  now  152;  of these  134 have beenapproved for  assistance  out of the  Special Areas  Fund.  the geographical  distribution of the schemes approved for assist-ance is: 69 in the  Durham and Tyneside Special Area, 57 inSouth Wales  and Monmouthshire, and 8 in West Cumberland.
                            55:                      223Approximately 4,000 volunteers  have been  occupied on  theschemes, and  grants amounting to  58,800  have been made or promised.  220. It must be borne in mind that these schemes all origin-ated through the initiative  of local unemployed men, and  areof a type which would not normally be undertaken on a wage-paid basis.  The rewards gained by the workers are:  first,  the satisfaction of  obtaining for themselves, their  families and their neighbours the use of amenities  which would  not  have beenprovided by any other means,  and secondly, the maintenanceof their physical fitness and their morale.  Assistance  from  theSpecial Areas Fund is designed merely to ensure that the volun-teers should obtain the greatest possible benefit from their workon the schemes, and should not suffer financially by  the wearand tear of their own clothes.  It consists broadly of the pro-vision of tools  and  materials for the schemes, and of workingclothes, and in most cases a daily meal for the volunteers.  221. The number of schemes submitted during the  last year was considerably less than that for the previous year.  This mayhave been  due to some extent to the setting up  of the NationalFitness  Council, with powers to give assistance to schemes ofthis kind on a wage-paid basis.                        Allotments.  222. The Special Areas  Fund  continued to  afford  financial aid towards the cost of opening up new allotments, providingwater supply and communal huts, and also repairing or renew-ing fencing in some  instances on existing allotments which other-wise were likely to have gone out  of cultivation.  223. The number of allotments in the urban areas of Englandand Wales as a whole the only areas in regard  to which officialfigures  for recent  years are available was  substantially  lessat the end of  1937 than  a year previously;  but despite this,an increase was indicated as regards the urban  districts within theSpecial Areas, and particularly within the Durham Special area where,  however, the position is somewhat obscured by reasonof changes in local  government  boundaries under the County ofDurham Review Order, 1937.  224.  During last  season, some 46,000 persons in the SpecialAreas were assisted  by the Central Allotments  Committee in con-nection with that Committee&apos;s scheme for the supply for  seeds,fertilisers and implements to unemployed and partly  employedmen  throughout England and Wales.  The number so assistedwas about 4,000 less than in the previous season.   225.  The numbers  of  allotments which   have  been newlyopened or otherwise assisted by the provision  of grants from the

In my previous Report particulars were given in respectof certain schemes in the Durham and Tyneside Area which pro-vided for the  laying out of the allotment  site  on model  lines and the provision of a small glasshouse and toolshed for  eachplot. One further scheme of this type at Newcastle-upon-Tyne was  approved  during the period  under  review.  Brief  par-ticulars of this and previous schemes are given in the subjoinedstatement:  				GrantAuthority.	Area	Number	Total	from the	(acres).	of Plots.	Cost of	Special			Scheme.	Areas Fund.

Approval has also been given to a grant of  112 to theCumberland County Council towards the cost of providing ninesmall glasshouses and two poultry huts on existing allotments,on a  site containing thirty-five  plots acquired by the County-Council acting in default of the Little Broughton Parish Council.     Subsistence Production Society of the  Eastern Valley                    of  Monmouthshire.  228. In paragraphs 389 to 403 of my last Report, a very fulldescription was given of the activities  and aims of the schemeknown as the Subsistence Production Scheme organised  in theSpecial Areas Fund during the twelve months under review, and since the passing of the Special Areas Act, are as follows: 
Eastern Valley of Monmouthshire by the Society known as AnOrder  of Friends, and in paragraph  390 I stated that I had promised grants from the Special Areas Fund totalling  82,500towards the cost of development of the scheme. On completion,during the last year, of what might be regarded as the develop-ment period  I came to the conclusion  that  -an independentinquiry into the finances of the scheme was desirable.  I  accord-ingly appointed a professional accountant of standing to make an investigation into  the scheme.  As a result it became  clear thatthe scheme could not be conducted on a self-supporting basis.The use of the Special Areas Fund for a continuing subsidy tomeet recurring losses was inappropriate and I  have not, there-fore, promised any further grants, but I have continued to watch.the experiment with much interest.  229. The scheme has made a contribution of great value tothe efforts to find a solution  of the problem of the older unem-ployed men.   As  indicated,  however, not even  the  continuedpayment of unemployment allowances, on which it depends, isan adequate subsidy to make it self-supporting.  The organisersfeel confident that, if full advantage can be taken of past experi-ence, and if means can be found to house increasing numbers ofmen nearer to their work on the scheme, a  greater measureof success can be achieved.   Nevertheless, it remains doubtfulwhether, given the most favourable conditions,  a scheme of this nature can be made self-supporting as originally envisaged.  Thefollowing report has been sent to me by  Mr. Peter Scott.  230.  During the year a considerable number of members ofthe scheme have found paid employment in various new under-takings started in  the district, but new  men have taken theirplaces  and  the Society&apos;s membership  has been  maintainedthroughout the year at nearly 400  members.  A determined andnot unsuccessful effort has been made during the year to lower the running costs of the Society. On account of the experimentalnature of the work,  these have in the past tended to be high.Early  in  1938 the  three horticultural  centres  at Cwmbran,Pontnewydd and Griffithstown were closed down, and the mentransferred to  work on another part of the scheme.  This stephas simplified  supervision and the  distribution of  goods, andhas lowered the cost of both.  231.  Other important developments have been the rebuilding of old  houses on the different properties of the Society, whichwas begun in August, 1938,  and the acquisition by the  society of the lease of a likely coal level  at Brynmawr.  Work on the difficult task of reopening the drift was begun in the summer of1938, and it is hoped that coal will be available early in 1939.  232.  The Subsistence Production experiment is now three anda half years old.  During that time much has been  done and a   14010                                               c
great deal of unique experience has been gained. The routineof food production and distribution is now carried through withprecision and efficiency by men who were previously coal minersby trade, and who are for the most part  of  advancing years.It has been  possible, to some extent, to dispense with the help of the instructors.who were necessary at first.to teach and trainthe men.  .          Scheme of House Decoration, Sunderland.   233. The  scheme of house decoration in Sunderland which began in January,  1937,  was  described  in detail  in para-graphs 531 to 535  of Sir Malcolm Stewarfs Third Report.  Thescheme is for the  supply of materials and the loan of suitablebrushes, at  the cost of the Special Areas Fund,  for decoratingthe interior  of the  houses of the unemployed in Sunderland, thework being  earned out by the tenants themselves.   234. During the twelve months ended 26th  July, 1938, 5;90ohouses were re-decorated  under the scheme,  and the work ingeneral has  been carried out in-a most satisfactory manner.  Thescheme is now nearing completion, and I feel that at its con-clusion it will have abundantly justified the opinion, expressedin my previous .Report, that the. scheme was one  well worthy of assistance.                             ...                   PART VL-HEALTH.   235. Measures  designed  to  improve  the public health  andsanitary services in the Special Areas have continued to engagemy close and sympathetic attention and, with the aid of grantsoffered by me, good progress has been made  in the direction of bringing those services  up to the  general level obtaining inother parts  of the country.   236.  At the same time  I feel it incumbent to impress uponauthorities the importance  of alacrity in proceeding with schemes which I am advised are urgently necessary on grounds of publichealth, and for which provisional  approval  of  assistance hasbeen given.   It seems to me that some authorities,  with the know-ledge that substantial grants are available, proceed in a ratherleisurely fashion  to complete such  details as are required toenable me  to  issue final  approval of proposals.  Until  suchapproval has been  indicated to them, authorities are not at liberty to proceed with the execution of the  works.  Failure oflocal authorities to carry out with due expedition  schemes affect-ing  the  health and well-being of their inhabitants is a serious matter for the community, and when, as  in  the Special Areas,the  financial difficulties of authorities  have been so materiallyeased by the grants which I  have offered towards the cost of
14010approved works-, a substantial obstacle to the prompt executionof the  schemes is removed.  237.  I should regard it as most unsatisfactory and disappoint-ing if,  on the termination of my office, numbers of schemes forthe benefit of the health of the inhabitants of the Special areas were outstanding and  could not be proceeded with except bythrowing a heavy burden on the ratepayers owing to the fact thatdelays  in furnishing necessary  information  had prevented me from approving the proposals for grant from the Special AreasFund.  238.  I trust, therefore, that  authorities will do  their utmost to arrange that every possible step is taken by them to ensurethat all approved  schemes urgently necessary on  grounds ofpublic  health are put in hand with the minimum of delay. Tothis end it may be desirable for  some authorities  to considera modification of their normal procedure for conducting their business, and to arrange for a delegation of certain functions in so far as they relate to such schemes.  239.  Details of the various schemes related to public healthwhich  have  been  approved by  me during the  year  ended30th September,  1938,  will be found in Appendices XI and XIIto this Report.                         Hospitals.  240.  Foremost  amongst matters requiring special attention from the point of view of the health of the inhabitants of theSpecial Areas is  the question of adequate  hospital  facilities.  Itis  evident from the number of schemes which have been for-warded by local authorities and voluntary organisations in those areas  that the provision of  sufficient and  up-to-date hospital accommodation presented them with an acute problem, but theassistance which I  have been  able  to  offer in respect of thevarious projects submitted to me has relieved hospital authorities of considerable anxiety on the financial aspect of the schemes,and has enabled them to proceed with the carrying out of works which  otherwise  would have thrown an intolerable  burden  ontheir resources. During the past year I have approved a furtherseven schemes prepared by local authorities for the provision orextension of  hospitals  at an  estimated  cost of over  600,000,and eight schemes  submitted by  the authorities of voluntary hospitals and estimated to cost approximately  500,000  havealso been approved.  Included in the former figure are  sums of  296,000 and  174,000 for the provision of a new general hospital by  the Gateshead Corporation,  and a new CentralIsolation Hospital  by  the Lanchester  Joint  Hospital Board,respectively.  Of the sum of  500,000 for works to be undertaken by voluntary hospitals, no less than   385,000 is accounted for
by  important  schemes  submitted  by  four of the  voluntary hospitals   in   Newcastle-upon-Tyne.    Twenty-three  furtherschemes submitted by sixteen local authorities and seven volun-tary hospitals,  and estimated to cost  940,000, are at presentnnder  consideration.&apos;            Maternity and Child Welfare Centres.  241.  Measures  connected with maternity  and child welfarerightly occupy a prominent  position .in  the essential  health services of the country, and it  is satisfactory to note that the deficiencies in  this  important matter continue to  receive close attention by  the  appropriate  authorities in the Special  Areas.Schemes  for  the  provision of an additional  six Maternity and child Welfare  Centres  at an  estimated  cost of about  18,000have been  approved by me during the year under review.  Atthe date of  this Report fourteen  schemes  estimated to cost 77,000 were under consideration.                    Open Air Mursenes.  242.  In previous  Reports reference has been  made  to  the valuable  work  undertaken by the  Save the Children NurserySchools Committee in  providing schools where children underschool  age  are  given opportunities  for healthy development in both body  and mind.   Substantial assistance towards the costof schemes for the provision of a Nursery School at Jarrow andthe  extension of an existing Nursery School at Sunderland hasbeen offered  by  me during the past year, and  I have underconsideration proposals for the erection of a School at Blaydon.                 Joint Council  of  Midwifery.  243.  Mention was made in paragraphs 481 and 482  of my previous  Report  of the arrangements for the conduct by research Committee of the Joint Council of Midwifery of an experiment, previously undertaken by the National  BirthdayTrust Fund, for the distribution of special foodstuffs to expect-ant mothers in the Special Areas.  Provisional returns furnished by Medical Officers of Health in the areas in which the  experi-ment is being conducted show encouraging results in the  decline of maternal and  infant death rates amongst mothers  receiving the special  foodstuffs.  Following representations from the joint council and  after consultation  with the Ministry of Healtii,  Ihave agreed to make further grants to the organisation to enablethem to continue the experiment up to 31st March, 1939, witha view to  obtaining sufficient  additional data  on which the research Committee would be able to frame proposals of a per-manent nature for the  consideration of  the appropriate autho-rities, and  thus end the experimental stage of the&apos; scheme.
                            m                      District Nursing.  244. District Nursing services in the Special Areas continuedto expand during the  past  year  and  further assistance  wasgiven to the Nursing Associations concerned by means of grantsplaced by me at the disposal of the National Council of social service.  245. In the period under review five additional District Nurseshave  been appointed, making a  total of 99 out  of  the  127originally contemplated.   Four of the appointments were madein the Durham  area three  for Sunderland and one for theEther ley and Toft Hill district and the fifth in  South Wales,for Pontypridd.   The grant  in each  case only covers a  pro-portion of the maintenance cost,  the local nursing associationbeing responsible for the balance.  246. A grant was  made to the  Cumberland County NursingAssociation towards the salary for the first year and the equip-ment of a newly appointed nurse to serve the Wigton district.                 Medical Comforts  Depots.  247. It was represented to me  by the National Council of social  Service. that the considerable addition to the number of district Nurses working in the Special Areas of South wales and Monmouthshire, rendered possible by the provision of grants from the Special Areas Fund, had created an increased demandlor all types  of medical comforts  for use in the sick room  and during convalescence  on  the part of  people  who  could  not possibly  afford to purchase such articles when illness renderedthem indispensable.  It was pointed out that the nurses had a very limited supply of medical  comforts and that the existing Depotsof the Order of St. John of Jerusalem (Priory for Wales)  andof the British Red Cross Society (Glamorgan Branch) on whichnurses and .the public depended for the loan  of  additionalcomforts, were not as fully equipped as they  should be to meetthe demands  upon them.   In addition, the number of Depotswas  not  sufficient to supply  the  need,  and in  a  number ofdistricts there was no depot within  reasonable distance.  248. After  careful investigation  of  the  position and in  con-sultation with the Welsh Board of Health,&apos; I agreed to the pay-ment  out of the grant-in-aid  to the National Council of social service of a  sum up to a maximum  of  4,590 to provide forthe establishment and equipment  of  new Depots and  the re-equipment of existing Depots in  the  Special Areas of SouthWales  together with the supply of additional equipment to the nurses working in those Areas.  As a  condition of my approvalI required that no  charge should be made for the  use of thearticles by necessitous persons.
                    Cheap Milk Schemes.  249. Reduced price schemes for the provision of milk at 2d.a pint to expectant and nursing mothers  and children underfive years of age were introduced into the four areas mentionedbelow on 18th July, 1936, 16th January, 1937, 12th April, 1937,and 1st October, 1937, respectively.  The estimated  number  ofeligible  persons and the percentage of that number who haveparticipated in the  cheap milk schemes are as follows:                                    Number of         Area.             Eligible      Percentage                          Persons.     participating.RRondda    ...    ...    .....   11,000          61Jarrow      ...    ...     .    2,55Q          DOWalker      ...    ...    ...    3,600          61Whitehaven *      ...    . .    2,500          65  250. Investigations have been made into the milk purchases of families before and during the operation of the experimentsand the following facts  appear  from these  surveys.  It was found that the percentage increases in the purchases during theperiod were  Rhondda 47, Jarrow 114,  Walker 62  and White-haven 92,  respectively, the  average for  all the schemes  being61 per cent.  The average retail price for milk in these districtswas 27.33d. per gallon in Rhondda, Jarrow  and Walker, and26-33d. per gallon in Whitehaven, but the reduced price actually paid by those  participating in  the cheap milk schemes was17-93d.  per gallon including milk taken at full  price by theseconsumers.  The average per capita  consumption in all familieshas increased from 0-24  to 0-35 pints daily in  the Rhondda,0-14 to 0-30 pints daily in Jarrow,  0-21 to 0-34 pints daily inWalker and 0-20 to 0-39 pints daily in Whitehaven.  The pur-chase of milk at full price  by these families has  declined by70  per cent, but this decrease has been more than  replaced bycheap milk.   251. As stated in my  previous  Report the future of these special Areas schemes is  bound up  with the Governments MilkPolicy, but meanwhile I have agreed to continue payments in aid of the  above four schemes from  the Special Areas Fund fora further short  period.    Order of the Hospital  of St.  John of Jerusalem:  Priory                          for Wales.   252.  In  paragraph 495 of my last Report reference was madeto a grant of  5,000 from the Special Areas Fund to the Prioryfor Wales of the Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem,  * In Whitehaven  the Council of Social Service are also subsidising thoScheme at id. per pint, and the consumers pay lid. per pint.  The maximumquantity allowed is  450 pints per day.
towards the cost, of providing new Ambulance Halls and improv-ing existing unsatistactory Halls in the South. Wales Special Area.Thirty such  schemes, involving a total expenditure of  10,600,have  been  approved &quot;for grant during the past year,  and themajority of  the Ambulance Halls  thus constructed or  recondi-tioned are already in-use.  The actual expenditure was slightly in excess of the estimate originally submitted and I  decided toincrease my grant to  5,300.  &apos;  253. The schemes&apos;have also been assisted by generous gifts ofmoney  and materials from private individuals  and  collierycompanies&apos;,&apos;whilst.the latter, as well as local authorities,  havebeen sympathetic in providing sites at nominal rents.  The JointCommittee of the  Monmouthshire and  South Wales  Miners&apos;Welfare Fund have also co-operated with the Priory and with local Divisions by making a grant from their funds towards thecost of furnishing the new Halls.  254. In December,  1937,  I  approved a further grant of 2,783 tQ;the Priory to meet the cost of providing a  number ofthe Cadets with uniforms and equipment.  The  Cadets  are boysand girls between the ages of 11 and 18, forming a special sec-tion of the St. John Ambulance Brigade,  and their strength inthe Special Areas  of South  Wales is about 3,500.   A very largeproportion of the parents are unemployed and,  in  consequence,substantial numbers of the  Cadets would have lacked the essen-tial uniform and equipment but for my grant.  255. Previous Reports have contained an  appreciation of thework  of the adult Divisions of the St. John Ambulance brigade and I am equally impressed with the useful  part played by theCadet movement in providing a practical and useful  occupationfor juveniles in the Special Areas.   My grants to the Priory haveamounted in all to  13,083.                     Physical  Training.  256. In paragraph 497 of my last Report  I stated  that I had arranged for the continuation of the physical training classes forunemployed men in the Special Areas organised by the Ministryof Labour at the  cost of the  Special Areas Fund.   The classeshave again proved very successful.   The response by the unem-ployed and  the keenness and interest  displayed by  those whohave  taken advantage of these physical training facilities  havebeen  most encouraging.    In  a  large number of cases thoseparticipating have, as a result, obtained employment.  257. New classes were opened at ten places  during  the yearand  at the end  of September there were  forty-nine classes(thirty-two in the North of England and seventeen in Wales) atwhich 5,151 men were enrolled:  A list of the  places  in whichclasses were held during the year and the number of  enrolmentsto each class is given in Appendix XIII.  The  total  number of   14010                                              c 4
men who enrolled during the year was 15,836, compared with10,849 last year, and this in itself is an  indication of the sus-tained popularity of the classes.  258. Apart from the undoubted benefit of the physical train-ing and recreation provided in improving the physical conditionof all men taking part, the most important feature has been thenumber of men who have left the classes to go to employment or to training centres with employment in view.  There havealso been examples where employers have had recourse to the classes to secure the type of man required.   During the year13,939 men le:tt the classes, of whom 8,106 found work or were placed  in  employment and  1,301 proceeded to  training  andinstructional centres.  259. Physical training classes have also been carried on during-the year at occupational clubs for men and women and referenceto these classes is made in Part IX of this  Report.        Courses in Simple Cookery and  Food Values.  260. During the&quot; year Under review the National Federation ofWomen&apos;s Institutes has continued, with the aid of grants fromthe Special Areas Fund,  to  run with great success the cookerycourses in the villages in County Durham to which reference hasbeen made in previous Reports.  261. The series of lectures and demonstrations under the title&quot; Growing and Cooking  &quot;,  described in paragraph  506 of raylast Report, has now been given in ninety villages,  and a furtherseries has  been started.   This series  contains four lectures, the subjects being:  &quot; Meals  for Young Children &quot;, &quot; Food for school Children &quot;,  &quot; Diet for  Adolescents &quot;  and  &quot; InvalidCookery &quot;.  The lecturers are fully conversant with the difficulties with which housewives in the Special Areas are  faced, andtheir lectures and demonstrations show  how nourishing mealscan be prepared with due regard to economy and by the&apos;use ofhomely utensils such as would  be found in ordinary homesGreat interest has been shown in all the classes given, and I am sure  that they have  fulfilled  a very useful purpose.   262.  The National Council of Social Service has also continuedto organize cookery classes in the occupational clubs for women in  the Special Areas, and these are referred to in Part IX ofthis Report.                      Sanitary Services.   263.  Applications  for assistance towards the cost of executing schemes for the provision or improvement of sanitaiy services in the Special Areas have  continued to be received throughout the year under review.  Major proposals for placing the  districts in
those  Areas in a  satisfactory position  in  regard to essentialsanitary services were submitted in earlier years, and generallyspeaking, the later applications relate to smaller, though equally important,  measures for promoting the health and  well-being of the population.  I am confident that the schemes which havebeen or are to be. undertaken by local authorities with the aid of grants from the Special Areas Fund cannot fail to have a bene-ficial effect on the lives of the inhabitants.   Many will now enjoyfacilities which are available to residents in more prosperousareas  but could not have been provided; by the authorities with-out assistance from outside sources except by imposing an undueburden on the ratepayers.Water Supply.  264. Eleven  schemes, estimated  to cost   64,570, for  theimprovement of water supplies at various  places in the  SpecialAreas have been approved for grant during the twelve months ended 30th September, 1938.  With the exception of  a scheme from the Cwmbran Urban District Council for improvements attheir reservoir,  no great expenditure is involved in any of theproposals.   Generally  speaking, the Areas are  fortunate inpossessing adequate water  supplies.   At  the end of the year under  review  twenty-three schemes estimated to  cost  about 95,000 were under consideration.Sewerage, Sewage Disposal and  Surface Water Drainage.  265. During the past  year schemes of sewerage, sewage  dis-posal and surface  water  drainage approved by me outnumberedall other measures for the  sanitary improvement  of the Areas,and grants  have been promised in respect  of no less  than fifty-four schemes of this nature, estimated to cost  536,930.   Thetotal number of such schemes so far approved is nearly 300,and the expenditure involved is over  2,700,000.    Furtherschemes submitted by  thirty-four authorities, of  an  estimatedvalue   of  approximately   604,000,  are   at  present   underconsideration.Closet Conversion.  266. Attention continues to be given to this important measureof domestic sanitation,  and grants towards a further elevenschemes, estimated to cost  59,000, for the conversion of earth,ash and pail closets to  the water carriage  system have beenmade by me during the past year.  With one exception the pro-posals emanated from authorities in the Special Areas of durham and Tyneside, where the need for the work appears to be  greaterthan elsewhere.  The number of conversions involved in  theschemes is  6,733.   Decisions remain to  be given in  respect ofthree further schemes, estimated to cost  42,000.
Culverting Rivers and  River Bank improvements.  267. Ten schemes for regulating the flow of rivers and streamsto prevent public, nuisance and danger from flooding have beenapproved during the year ended 30th September,  1938.    Thecost of the work is estimated at about  15,000 and, as might beexpected,- the majority of the proposals are for the improve-ment of  the  conditions prevailing in the valleys in the SpecialAreas of South Wales.  At the date of this Report consideration was being given to seven further schemes of the nature referredto,  the cost involved being about  39,000.                     Public Street Works.  263. In paragraph 528 of my previous Report  I  mentioned that I was awaiting the receipt of certain information, from localauthorities in the Special Areas, before indicating the extent towhich I was prepared to assist them by providing funds towards meeting the cost  of works of public street repair and improve-ment represented to  be urgently necessary.  The information was in due course received and all the authorities who desiredto undertake work of the nature in question were notified of themaximum  amount of grant available to them for  the purpose.Tentative applications for grants within the limits imposed were received  from  fifty-eight  local  authorities,  and  up  to 30thSeptember, 1938, I had indicated to fifty-three of those authori-ties that, subject to the submission of  the necessary details, Iwas prepared to entertain formal applications from them forassistance.   The total number of streets included in the schemesof these authorities is 631 and the estimated cost of the works isabout  230,000.                                        -  -                    Private  Street Works.  269. As  indicated  in earlier Reports,  the  question of theimprovement of private streets  in the  Special Areas has beengiven close attention, and in paragraphs 531 to 533  of my lastReport I pointed out  that,  before proceeding further in thematter,  it was  necessary for local authorities to  modify theirpreliminary proposals so as  to bring the cost  of their schemeswithin the  limit of  expenditure  allocated to them.   Since thentwenty-six  local authorities have  forwarded their . revised pro-posals  and in  sixteen cases I have sanctioned the necessary measures for proceeding with the schemes.   The number ofprivate streets-to be put in order in these particular cases is 183at an estimated cost of about  80,000, towards which grants of varying amounts will be made,  according to the circumstancesof the froritagers.  270.&apos; As stated in my last Report, the whole of the  sum avail-able for private street works,  viz.,  200,000, has been provision-ally allocated to local authorities.   I am still awaiting proposals from certain  authorities.
                 PART VII. HOUSINGS.        North Eastern Housing Association, Limited.Durham and Tyneside.  271.  The North Eastern Housing Association, Limited, whose activities have been fully described  in previous Reports, hasmaintained a steady progress during the period under review in meeting the demands of the local authorities in the Special areas with whom it is co-operating, for the provision of new houses torehouse persons  displaced from unfit houses or to  abate  over-crowding.  Details of nineteen schemes approved by me in thelast twelve months  and involving the erection  of 1,632 houseswill be found in  Appendix XIV.  272.  The number of dwellings completed by the association is now 4,081, of  which 3,049 were completed during the twelvemonths ended 30th  September, 1938 an average of almost 60houses per week.  In addition contracts  have  been signed forthe erection of 3,034 houses;  tenders have been received, and contracts are about to be  entered into, for a further 393 houses;and  tenders will shortly  be invited in respect of another 537houses.  273.  The total  number of dwellings included in schemes whichhave been completed or have  reached an advanced stage has,therefore, now grown to 8,045 and the approximate number ofpersons to  be rehoused  in the new accommodation  is  36,000.The total cost of these schemes is over three  and a  half millionpounds.  The capital value of the saving to the ratepayers of therespective authorities for  whom these houses have been or areto be  provided  is  estimated  to be  in the  neighbourhood of 560,000.  274.  Further sites have been  acquired and  plans are  being prepared by the Association in respect of schemes embracing4,039 houses,  bringing the total number of houses in activeschemes  up to  12,084.   This figure represents about  80 percent, of the total number of houses of the Association^ antici-pated building programme in the Special Areas of Durham andTyneside.  275. The severe loss suffered by the Board of Management ofthe Association by the recent death of the Bishop of Jarrow (the R.T.. Rev. J. Geoffrey Gordon, M.A.) is very much regretted.West Cumberland.  276.  Reference was made in paragraph 543 of my previous report to the fact that the North Eastern Housing Association,Limited, had been  empowered to extend its sphere of  activityto the Special Areas in West Cumberland, and  although, owing
to a shortage of craftsmen and materials, it has not been possibleto make such a rapid advance in those Areas as in durham and Tyneside, some progress in the erection of houses has beenmade during the period under review.  Six local authorities,having a total need for 1,780 houses, have intimated  that theyare willing to co-operate with the Association.  277. So far 345 houses have been provided for in contracts,of which 30  have been  completed, and  tenders  have beenreceived for a further 100 houses. These 445 houses will providenew accommodation for 1,784 persons at an estimated  cost of 206,221  and  details  will  be found in Appendix XIV.   Inaddition,  plans are in  course of preparation for 398 houses,making a  total of 843 houses, almost one-half of  the total programme of the authorities  concerned.      Durham Aged  iViineworkers&apos;  Homes  Association.  - 278. In  the  twelve months  ended 30th September, 1938, Ihave offered grants in respect of  six further schemes for theerection by this Association of 42 dwellings for occupation rentfree by  aged mineworkers,  thus  bringing  the number  of dwellings included in approved schemes of  this nature to 107.Particulars of the schemes  approved during the year are shownin Appendix XIV.  Brancepeth and Oakenshaw  Collieries Aged Mineworkers&apos;                     Homes Association.  279. This  Association  acts  independently  of the&apos;  county-organisation for the  provision of  Aged  Miners&apos; Homes  in durham.  It has provided twenty-one homes and a recreationroom but has a waiting list of over ninety aged people desiringaccommodation.  The financial position of the Association doesnot permit it to proceed with the provision of the whole of thedwellings required but after investigating  the position  I haveagreed  to assist it in  the erection of  a further six homes.Provision of houses in  the Special Areas of Durham otherwise     than in direct  connection with Slum Clearance  and Over-     crowding Abatement Operations.  280.  Strong representations have been made to me in connec-tion with the location of houses required in the Special Areasof Durham.  Under  existing  arrangements the North EasternHousing Association, Limited, may, by agreement with localauthorities in those Areas, provide  accommodation  to rehousepersons  displaced under slum clearance schemes and  for  the abatement of overcrowding, but the  location  of such houses isrestricted to the area  or to the immediate neighbourhood of  thelocal authority for whom the provision is made.
  281. &apos;In some of these local  authority areas there is a high rate of chronic unemployment and little prospect of employmentbecoming available for an appreciable proportion of the work-ing population.  The Association has asked tor additional powersto enable them, in co-operation with the  local authorities con-cerned, to erect houses, for persons who will require new accom-modation, in districts in Durham where  employment  may be immediately available, or where the  prospects of employment are   more favourable.  The proposal is obviously reasonable andalthough there are certain practical difficulties I have felt justi-fied in authorising the Association to proceed with a limitedexperiment.  282. To secure that the accommodation may be let at rentswithin the means of the prospective tenants  I  have  agreed,where necessary, to make contributions from the  Special AreasFund  of  amounts not exceeding the capitalised value  of theExchequer contribution which  would have been payable to alocal authority, if they had themselves built the houses as partof their approved programme for the rehousing of persons dis-placed from clearance  areas or for the  abatement  of over-crowding, plus the annual contribution which the local authority would have  been required to  make out of  rates in respect of thehouses  as  a  condition - of  receiving  any  such  exchequer contribution.  283. These houses will not form part of the recognised pro-gramme  of  any  particular local authority  for slum  clearanceand the abatement of overcrowding.  I  consider, however, that financial assistance of the.character described will be justified by the effect that the migration of the population from the lessfavourably situated areas will have upon the overcrowding andslum  problems in  these areas, and  I  have  asked the NorthEastern  Housing  Association  tq make  arrangements  for the selection of  tenants for  this experimental programme  that will ensure the maximum relief in this direction.              PART VIII. AGRiCULTURE.                      Land Settlement.  284. In pursuance of the intention.mentioned in paragraph 553of my previous  Report,  I  appointed a Committee  of enquiry on the 27th July with  the following Terms of Reference:         &quot; To enquire into the working of the various schemes of    land settlement for unemployed men undertaken in England    and Wales since November, 1934, by the Land Settlement    Association, the Welsh Land Settlement Society and County    Councils respectively, and to report  thereon.&quot;
  285. Sir William Cecil Dampier, Sc.D.., F.R.S., accepted myinvitation to act as Chairman of the Committee,&quot; and Mr. RobertCobb, P.P.S.I., and Mr.  Walter Smith,  J.P.,  also  agreed toserve on the Committee.  The Committee held its first meetingon 29th July and has since been actively pursuing its enquiries,which I hope may be completed early next year.   I feel greatlyindebted to these gentlemen for being willing to give their timeand services to this important investigation which must of neces-sity involve a great deal of work and a  considerable amount of travelling.  286. The following table shows the position at 30th September,1938, of the schemes undertaken  by the various agencies con-cerned&apos; with the settlement of families from the  Special Areas.Fuller details are given in Appendix XV.  The figures in the   Isecond column show a reduction  as  compared with  the 3,000-   Ifamily programme referred to in my last Report (paragraph 553).The  reasons for this reduction are  explained in subsequent para-   Igraphs of this Report.                                           i			Approxi-							mate	Families			No. of met	No. of families to be settled.		number	settled	Men in	Total	who have			for whom	by	residence	number	completedOrganising Body.			land had	30.9.38	without	of	their			been	(see	their	persons	training (included i:			acquired	foot-	families.	settled.				by	note) .			column 4I,			30.9.38.

7i                 Land SettEement Association.  287. Full  details  of  the activities  of  the Land SettlementAssociation are given in their recently published Annual Report,and it is not necessary for me to do more  than  comment on cer-tain aspects of their work for the Special Areas.  288. As a  result of experience in the early  part of the year under review, I found it necessary to suggest to the Associationthat,  at  any  rate  for the time being,  the execution of the fullscheme which had been approved should  not be attempted.   Ireferred  in my  last  Report to the marked rise in the  price of feeding  stuffs  and  equipment and  the   serious  incidence  ofpoultry disease.  The schemes of the Land  Settlement Associationwere  particularly  affected by these unfavourable  developmentsbecause  on many  of their Estates only poultry  and pig holdingswere  contemplated.  289. While there was no reason to suppose that these circum-stances  would  not in time  be remedied, the Association feltunable to continue training settlers solely  in the keeping of pigs and poultry,  since the profits to  be expected in the immediatefuture offered little prospect  of affording  a livelihood when thetraining  period  came to an  end.  290. I therefore agreed to the Association^ proposal to reducethe poultry stock on the pig and poultry holdings to  a  much lower standard figure, to provide means for other activities, e.g.glasshouse cultivation, and to make  appropriate  financial con-cessions  to settlers whose initial efforts had been seriously ham-hampered by causes outside their own control.  291. This  unfortunate experience was  sufficient in  itself to impress  the  need for caution in going  forward with furtherschemes.  Other circumstances pointed in the same direction.  292. Early  this  year revised estimates  submitted  by theAssociation in respect of twelve of its settlements, showed thatthe cost of settling  a family on the land ranged from  about 1,600 to  2,000 (with an average of about  1,900) as comparedwith  the figure  of  1,250 mentioned  in  my  last Report, theincrease  being due in part to increase in the cost of building andother materials,  but in the main to the realisation that the cost oftraining  and  the working  capital required had been  seriouslyunder-estimated.  293. The rate of  recruitment for the  Association^  schemesdropped off very substantially towards  the end of  1937  and stillmore  in 1938.   Moreover, a large number  of settlers relinquishedtraining  for various  reasons  arid either  took  up employmentlocally or  returned home.  Thus for some  months there was actually  a diminution in the number of men on  the Association^estates.
  294- ln an the circumstances I came to the conclusion thatthe estates already  acquired by the Association would provideample opportunity  for testing  the efficacy of Land settlement as a  partial  remedy  for  unemployment, and I informed  theAssociation last May that further estates should not be acquiredfor the purpose  of schemes assisted  from the Special AreasFund. The estates  held by the Association for this purpose on30th  September, 1938,  would  permit of  the  settlement  of1,412 families.   At the same date 1,013 holdings had actually been  developed for occupation and of these 710 were occupiedeither by tenants or by men who were still undergoing training.There were therefore on  30th  September, 1938, 399 availableholdings  waiting development,  and  303 developed holdingsavailable for occupation, a total of 702.  Particulars of each ofthe Association^ estates will be found in Appendix XV.  295. While during  the last twelve months little progress  hasbeen  made in transferring families from the Special Areas tothe Association^ estates,  a substantial number of settlers havetaken tenancies  and ceased to  draw Unemployment assistance board allowances.  At the end of September, 1937, there were696 settlers in residence of whom 62 had completed training and become tenants  of the Association.  The corresponding figures at the end of September, 1938, were 710 settlers  of whom 276had become tenants.Training.   296. It was evident from  the number of instances in whichsettlers relinquished their attempt to qualify for tenancies beforethe end of their training period, and from the substantial losses of stock  arising in some of these cases, that the system of train-ing might with advantage be overhauled. The Association has,therefore, with  my consent initiated  experiments designed toimprove the system of training.  One of these is the establish-ment, on two  selected  estates, of training  centres at  whichselected candidates may be given their first three months&apos; train-ing by staff specially suited for the initial work of physical and moral reconditioning, and of explaining to the settlers the objects of the Association^  work and the system under which  settle-ments are organised.  It is hoped that in this way many of themisunderstandings and  difficulties which arose under the old system may be avoided.  The  two centres are expected to be inoperation this  winter.  Between them they  will accommodate 100 recruits at a time. I have also, on the urgent representations of the Association, agreed that twenty holdings, divided amonga number of estates, shall be let to tenants with agriculturalexperience, with a view to demonstrating to  settlers the oppor-tunities  afforded by the  settlement  scheme  of obtaining a livelihood from the land.
  297- Normally the period of training is still regarded as beingfifteen months, of which the first three months is for the settlers&apos;general reconditioning and building up.  It frequently happens,however, that the period has to be extended  for one reason andanother and no difficulty  arises in arranging for brief exten-sions. Longer extensions are sometimes asked for in individual cases for various reasons for example, where some new lineof activity  has been undertaken since training commenced, or where the training could not begin immediately on the settlersarrival owing to delay in provision of equipment or stock.             Land Settlement  in County Durham.  298. The Durham County Council, which is responsible forland  settlement  schemes in that county, has not acquired any new estates for this purpose since my last Report, but progress has been made with the development of estates already acquiredand the settlement of families thereon.  The Director of Agricul-ture for Durham, who is in immediate charge of the work undera Special Sub-Committee of the County Council,  has supplieda report from which the following paragraphs, 299 to 309, are taken.  299. The  results  of  the  experimental scheme  of  &quot; BareLand &quot; holdings instituted near the colliery village of WooleyTerrace, Stanley, have not justified the hopes of the promoters,as  there are now only  six of the original tenants left.   Theoriginal intention of this scheme was to enlarge on the &quot; groupholdings &quot;  idea by securing land for small holdings adjacent to the mining villages and to recruit  the settlers from the localunemployed, thus avoiding the necessity of erecting dwelling-houses.  The success of  the &quot; group holdings &quot; encouraged thehope that an enlarged scheme along similar lines, which wouldenable settlers to be self-supporting, was a practical possibility.The experience gained from this experiment  showed that landsettlement  could not properly operate on &quot; Bare Land &quot; hold-ings  when the selection  of  applicants was limited to  thoseresident in the immediate neighbourhood.   300.  Of the fourteen  settlers who  were originally placed onthe Bishop  Auckland  (Escomb)  scheme, ten have completed their training, and have been established as individual small-holders as  from 1st August, 1938. Two settlers  were found tobe unsuitable and, accordingly, left the scheme, but their placeshave been  filled.   301.  The training period of forty of the forty-one settlers on the Bishop Auckland (Toronto)  scheme  expired  on 31st July, 1938, and the trained men were established  as smallholders con- currently with the settlers on the Escomb section of the scheme. One settler, who was transferred to the scheme  at  a later date
than the rest, is continuing to receive instruction, and suppliesof stock and equipment to the holding concerned are still being arranged.  302. Provision of stock and equipment to the Greenfield Farm,Etherley, estate has just been completed.  Four glasshouses ofthe Dutch type have been erected, and a large crop of tomatoeshas been grown therein and is now being marketed.  Pig-houseshave also been constructed on the  scheme and  pigs have beenprovided.   Financial records in relation to each holding  arebeing compiled, in order to afford guidance as to the ability ofthe nine settlers to take up tenancies, which it is hoped  will bebefore the end of the current year.  303. Stock  and equipment have also been fully supplied atPelton House Farm. Six Dutch type glasshouse units have beenerected,  and  are now producing very good quality tomatoes,which are being marketed  on a wholesale basis.   An interestingexperiment  in mushroom cultivation is being conducted  on  thisfarm.   Indications are that the effort will be successful.  Thetraining period of fourteen of the fifteen settlers on this scheme isdue to expire before the end of this  year.  Records are being prepared to show the  trading results  of the individual  settlerspreparatory  to  the imminent establishment of  the fourteentrained men as  individual smallholders.  304. Training of the twenty-five settlers on  the  MoorhouseFarm, Eaglescliffe, is nearing completion.  The outdoor rearingof pigs, on the tethering system, which was essayed as an  experi-ment, has been highly successful.  Approximately 300 pigs arenow being reared in this way.  The system has  lately been ex-tended to other land settlement schemes in the  country.  FiveDutch type  glasshouses have been  constructed.   Earlier in theyear tomato plants were  introduced into the Dutch units, and agood  crop  of tomatoes  has resulted.  The crop  is not  yetexhausted.  No difficulty  has been  experienced  in  regard tomarketing;  the total saleable produce is taken  by a local  Co-operative Society.  305. The  Moor Farm,  Spennymoor, on which  ten families are settled, is entirely devoted to poultry-keeping and market garden-in g.   Ten glasshouses of the Dutch type were constructed sometime ago.  In these units a&apos;tomato  crop has been grown.  Dis-posal of the tomatoes  is being made on satisfactory wholesaleterms.  A stock  of 3,000  head of  poultry is at present being maintained.  306. Approved men, together with their families, have been drafted to  the Manor  Farm, Hart, scheme in  small numberssince March of the present year.  So far, work has been  mainly confined to  the initial  development of the estate (including theerection of poultry-houses,  wire netting and fences) to that stagewhen training proper can be commenced, though  a quantity of
day-old chicks, chiefly pullets, has been supplied.  The schemeis designed to absorb thirty-five families, all  of which  areexpected to be in occupation within the course of the next twomonths-.  307. Settlement of families on the Manor House Farm, HuttonHenry, was begun only recently.  Additional men will be trans-ferred to this scheme as  and when  dwelling-houses  become available for occupation.   Initial supplies of equipment are nowbeing made.  308. Though the conviction persists that poultry-keeping must continue to be the main  feature of the operation of the  small-holdings schemes, it is now recognised that the introduction ofnew branches  of land  settlement enterprise and the extension ofexisting  subsidiary  activities is advisable and, in fact,  neces-saiy. Not only is the level of income thereby more consistentlymaintained throughout the year, but  also,  where  disease orloss or damage seriously affects any one branch of the work, ashappens not infrequently,  the  consequences, which ordinarilymight be ruinous, would probably be such as to admit of speedyrecovery.  As  is already known, pig keeping is of major import-ance, whilst in the  sphere  of horticulture, a  greater variety of crops is being  produced.  309. The large industrial population of this  district creates forall of the produce of  the scheme a demand which far exceedssupply.  No  difficulty whatever  has yet been encountered in marketing all produce raised.                 Land Settlement in Wales.           Welsh  Land Settlement Society, Limited.  310. The Council has accepted with regret the  resignation ofLord Merthyr  as a member of the  Council of Management owingto the distance of his  place of residence from Cardiff and pres-sure of engagements  and business.  311. In November, 1937, an Executive Officer was appointed on the Settlement Society&apos;s Headquarters Staff.   His duties willbe to plan the rotation of crops and generally to supervise pro-duction,  buying and marketing on all the Society&apos;s Schemes.  312. Through the courtesy of the National Council of social service,  the Society was able to stage an exhibit of the lay-outsof its land settlement schemes at the Royal Agricultural Society&apos;sShow held at Cardiff in July, 1938.Progress of Schemes.  313. The Society has  now acquired,  by purchase or lease,about 2,500 acres of land, which will provide holdings or employ-ment for 258 settlers, including 26 not transferred from theSpecial  Areas who  are,  or will be,  engaged as  permanent
employees on Co-operative Farms. Three schemes are devotedto Co-operative Farming and two to Small Holdings, one ofthe latter in association with the Monmouthshire County Council.  314.  The Society has recently agreed  to purchase about 95acres of land, adjoining Boverton Place Farm, forming part ofa property belonging to the Glamorgan County Council,  thegreater portion of which has  been sold to the Air Ministry.  Theland will be leased by the Society to Boverton Castle Co-opera-tors  and will provide  employment for  six additional families of whom two will be accommodated in existing houses and fourin new houses.  The erection of these houses is proceeding.  315.  The Society has also agreed  to  purchase  Fferm Gcch,Penlline, extending  to  212  acres, for  the purpose of  a Co-operative Farm.  It is situated within 3J miles  of the markettown of Cowbridge and 12%  miles of Cardiff.  The land is mostsuitable  for  intensive  cultivation and  will enable about 23unemployed families to be settled.  316. Efforts made to purchase land offered by public auctionwere unsuccessful, and other properties offered were consideredunsuitable.  317. The actual number of settlers on the various schemes on30th September was 257.  This figure included 162 transferredfamilies and  22 non-transferred families on the Co-operativeFarming schemes, and 67 families and  6 settlers without their families  on small holding schemes.   Of the 162 settlers onCo-operative Farming schemes, 118 had completed training andwere members of a Co-operative Farming Society.  Of  the73 settlers  on small holding schemes 24 had completed their training and become tenants of small holdings.  Particulars  of  each  estate  acquired  will  be  found  inAppendix XV.Boverton Co-operative Farming Scheme.  318. The Boverton Castle Co-operators (Welsh Land Settle-ment),  Limited,  have  leased  Boverton  Place  Farm,  nearLlantwit Major, for 24 years from 25th March, 1937, at a rentalcalculated on a basis of 3 per cent, on  the cost  of acquisition and capital development of the property.   319. The first Trading and Profit and Loss Account of theCo-operators&apos;  Society  for a period  of ten months ended on31st January, 1938, showed a net profit of  1,755  6s. 2d.  Ofthis  amount  500 was placed to a&quot; Reserve Fund,  125 reservedfor Income Tax and  1,130  6s. 2d. divided among the membersqualified according to the Rules.  320. The Co-operators (excluding  foremen and other leadinghands)  receive weekly wages as fixed from time to time by theAgricultural Wages  Committee, under the Agricultural Wages (Regulations) Act, 1924.  The minimum wage up to 2nd March,
 1938, was 34s.  6d. a week, plus overtime;  it has since been increased to 36s.  In addition, the Co-operators receive a  free issue of vegetables of the approximate value  of from 2s.  6d. to 3s. a week.  The rent fixed by the Agricultural Wages Committee (inclusive of rates) and payable by the Co-operators for newly- erected five-roomed houses is 4s. a week.   321. The average  weekly wage earned per settler (excluding foremen and other leading hands), inclusive of  overtime  and piecework,  was  1 19s. 8d., the average bonus amounted-to 7s. id. and the weekly free issue of vegetables was  estimated at 2S. gd.  Thus the average weekly earnings of the ordinary agricultural workers, in cash or kind,  totalled  2 gs.  6d.  for the period under review.   The family income was considerably increased in many cases by the amount earned by the wives and children of the Co-operators as casual workers.  Another most satisfactory feature is that permanent employment on the Settle- ment is now assured to a large number of children of both sexes.   322. It has recently been necessary to engage additional labour to cope  with the work on the farm, and for the past  months weekly employment has been provided for about 40  men  who have been obtained from the Employment Exchanges at Barry and Llantwit Major.  It is estimated that for the twelve  months ending 31st January,  1939, the wage bill will amount to  12,000.   323. All crops have proved most satisfactory with the excep- tion of 70 acres of strawberries.   Owing to the drought in the early summer and exceptionally  cold wet weather  at  picking time these were a light crop which met a poor market.   For theiten months ended 31st January, 1938, the net weight of produce sold was approximately 2,000 tons, and it is estimated that for the current year this  figure will be doubled.  Prices have been well maintained and show a slight improvement  as  compared with last year.  The area of glasshouses was increased  during the year  from    acres to 3 acres, of which approximately 2-i- acres are cold houses and the remaining half acre heated.  Heavy crops of tomatoes have been marketed.   Additional mushroom houses have been erected during the year and there is  now an area of 7,000 square feet of growing space.  The crops, which are marketed locally, have been most satisfactory.   324. The Bredon Package Company, Limited, has rented out- buildings on both Boverton and Sealand Manor Co-operative Farms for the manufacture of crates, packing boxes, etc., and a number of the settlers&apos;  children  are permanently  employed. This arrangement also  results in  a saving to  the Societies in the cost of packing materials.   325.  A barn has been converted for the purpose of recreation rooms  and  a meeting hall  by the settlers&apos;  direct labour.  A recreation  committee has been  elected  and the winter&apos;s  pro- gramme  of entertainments, lectures, etc., is in hand.
Seaiand, Flintshire, Co-operative Farming Scheme.  326. Possession of the entire Seaiand Estate of 851 acres was obtained at the end of 1937.  A new Manager commenced duties in January, 1938.  Eighty new houses in the form of a GardenVillage have been completed.  The full complement of settlershas been selected and there is a waiting list of  applicants.  327. The Co-operative Society was formed on 1st May,  1938,and  has been registered as the Seaiand Manor Co-operators(Welsh Land Settlement), Limited.  A lease will be granted tothe Co-operators Society on terms  and conditions  similar  tothose applicable to  the Boverton Co-operators Society.  328. During the early part of the year much work was carriedout in the scouring of watercourses and ditches, and the laying of hedges.  Owing to the exceptionally dry weather during the spring it was possible to  improve the soil conditions very con-siderably.  The majority of the crops  have been satisfactory and&apos;the potato  and Brussels sprout crops outstanding. It was rather late in the season before  the erection of the  i-J acres ofglasshouses was completed, and plants  were not put in untilthe end of May, but an excellent crop of tomatoes  of first-classquality  has been grown,  and the prices have been exceedinglygood.  329. The possibility of obtaining a Village Hall for the useof the  settlers  is being  actively  explored by the  SettlementSociety.  An Entertainment Committee  has been elected  and avery successful sports  meeting was  held  on  August  bank holiday.  Cups  for the three best gardens have been presented by Mr. D. M.  Evans-Bevan and members of the Council of management of  the Welsh Land Settlement Society, Limited.Lianfair  Discoed,   Monmouthshire,  Co-operative  Farming     Scheme.  330. A Manager was appointed in January, 1938, and farm-ing  operations  commenced in  February.    Permission was obtained to erect houses before  possession  of the land wasgiven and the  families were  moved into the  houses as they became ready.   This arrangement proved much more satisfac-tory than  billeting  men  in a hostel until  the  houses became available.  The ruins of Lianfair Castle, and  Cherry Cottageadjoining, which were of no.use,for the Settlement Scheme havebeen sold to a descendant of the Kemeys-Tynte family who hadbeen owners of the estate for centuries.  Thirty-one houses havebeen built twenty in the form of  a  Garden  Village, namedTrewen.  All the settlers selected in the first  instance are inresidence, and there is a waiting list of applicants.  331. Nearly one-half of the farm has been cropped, and fairprices have been obtained.  Approximately one acre of land has  been covered with glasshouses,  of which about a quarter
                            79of an acre is heated.  The glasshouses were not completed untilJune, consequently the tomato crop, though of good quality, hasbeen a light one.Rosemarkst,  Pembroke,  Small  Holdings Scheme.  332. A&apos; scheme  for the sub-division of this property intoforty-two small holdings of from five to ten acres, with a centralfarm, was prepared, and contracts let for the erection of forty-two houses, with piggeries, but it was subsequently decided toreduce the. number of small holdings  from forty-two to thirty-four,  and to  increase the area  of the central farm.  Piggeriesand poultry houses have  been provided on all the holdings anda heated glasshouse on  eight of  them.  Two  blocks of threeglasshouses, not heated,  and one propagating house, heated,have been erected for the purpose of supplying  the settlers withearly plants.  The full complement of settlers has been selected,twenty-three of whom are to be in training up to 31st  March,1939.   The remaining eleven settlers  will  receive the  normaltraining of fifteen months commencing at different dates.Leech pool,   Portskewett,  Monmouthshire,   Small  Holding    Scheme.  333. The Monmouthshire County Council undertook  to pro-vide houses and piggeries for forty small holdings, but up tothe end of  September,  1938, only  thirty-two  houses andpiggeries had been  completed.  A heated glasshouse has beenprovided on  each  holding,  and  a  propagating house  on thecentral  farm.   Twenty-four  of  the. trainees  entered intotenancies of their holdings as from Michaelrnas, 1938,  and theremainder will do so as the houses and piggeries become ready.                Glamorgan  County Council.New Barn  Land Settlement Scheme, Flemingston.  334. Since  the  last  Report,  occupation  has been  given ofthe glasshouses and cold frames provided on  the mixed  and market  garden type holdings,  and the trainees have receivedinstruction  in the growing of  tomatoes, cucumbers, chrysanthe-mums,  arid such crops  as  are propagated under glass,  andalso in the matters  of heating and  ventilation.   Generally, thetrainees have taken  keen interest in this, branch of work andgood crops&apos; have resulted.  335&quot;. In September last, all  the twenty holdings were provided with one large white pedigree gilt and ten store pigs.  In addi-tion, for the general service of  the  Settlement,  a pedigree boarwas  purchased.   General instruction has been given in themethod of feeding,  rearing,  and farrowing of litters.  It canbe said that the majority of the trainees have shown particular
 attention in this section, as the porkers turned out have proved highly creditable and the prevailing market price has always been procured.   336. Losses  in the poultry  section from fowl paralysis have been heavy despite treatment  recommended by experts.   337. The machine purchased  for  doing  the  ploughing and cultivating failed to stand up  to the work expected of it, neces- sitating  the  purchase  of a  more powerful and  serviceable machine, which has responded to its work,  justifying the extra outlay.   338. Since the early part of this year, troubles have arisen between-some of the settlers and  those in charge, and the train- ing of seven of them was terminated.  This and other adverse circumstances have militated against the success of this scheme,.the futurer of which is being discussed with the County Council.                        Afforestation,   339. Particulars  of  the special  programme of afforestation in and near the Special Areas  are contained  in my predecessor&apos;s Third Report,  and  the  substantial progress made up to 30th September, 1937, in carrying  out the programme was indicated in my previous Report.  During the past twelve months, further substantial progress has been made, as will be seen  from the following information  on the  subject which has been supplied by the Forestry Commissioners (paragraphs 340 to 343)-   340. During the period under review, the Commissioners have considered detailed  reports  covering a total acreage of  13,479 acres and have  authorised the  acquisition of 9,860 plantable acres 5,162 in South Wales and  4,698 in the North of England. Since authority was given for the scheme  in February,  1936, the Forestry Commissioners have authorised the acquisition of 53,620 plantable acres and the legal formalities have been com- pleted as regards about 39,000 plantable acres.  The acquisition of additional land is proceeding as rapidly as possible.   341. During the  past spring some 30,000,000 seedlings were lined out and 1,100 lbs. of seed sown  to provide plants neces- sary  for future Special Area  planting programmes.  The area planted last winter and spring, in or within fifteen miles  of the Special Areas,  and additional to  the  Commissioners&apos; normal planting programme,  was 2,450 acres (South Wales 450 and North of England 2,000).  The proposed Special Area planting for  the  coming season  is  about 5,000 acres  (South  Wales 1,900, North of England  3,100).   This programme will  be increased in subsequent seasons.   The number of  men likely to be employed on planting and nursery operations  during the coming winter  is 400.
                             8i   342. An additional 50 Forest Workers&apos; Holdings have been planned and approved  during the year,  making a total of 235 under the scheme.  Since  1936, contracts have been arranged for the construction of  128 houses,  43 of which  are  tenanted, 19 are ready for occupation and, of the balance, 22 are nearing completion.  Progress in the establishment of holdings has not been as  rapid as was anticipated, the delay being mainly due&apos; to circumstances  over which the Forestry Commissioners have no control, such  as the difficulty  of obtaining reasonable esti- mates in these times of building activity, delay in the delivery of  materials  to  contractors  by  manufacturers,   contractors&apos; labour difficulties  and bad weather conditions.   343. The selection of tenants from the Special Areas has so far, however, been attended with serious difficulties. The number of applicants brought forward is insufficient to fill the holdings already  available and it has become clear that further efforts to recruit suitable men are necessary.  Steps were taken to enlist the help of local officers of  the Unemployment Assistance Board in this matter, but with what  result cannot as yet be stated.                       Land Drainage.   344. During the  year under review, a  large amount of work in connection with Land Drainage was carried out in the County of Durham, and I  am informed that considerable areas of land have definitely been improved  as a result  of the  work done. Speaking generally, the  schemes undertaken include the cleaning out and regrading of watercourses,  the strengthening of banks by piles and boarding, and the construction of reinforced concrete retaining walls.   Periodic inspections are made by a  Technical Officer of the Ministry  of Agriculture and Fisheries during the progress of schemes.   345. In my previous  Report it was mentioned that two of the&apos; seven land drainage schemes  in Durham approved by my pre- predecessor  had  been finished by 30th September, 1937.  Of the remainder, two schemes (Sedgefield and River Don) and one sec- tion (Carcut Beck) of the River Skerne scheme were completed before  30th  September,   1938.   During  the twelve  months covered by this Report, my approval was given to four further schemes  in Durham, three of which (River Browney at Lan- chester,  the Claxton Beck Dam  and the Black Beck at Barnard Castie) have also been completed, whilst negotiations are still proceeding with  the riparian owners  concerned  in connection with the fourth scheme and also the remaining sections of the River Skerne scheme.   346. At the date of closing this Report negotiations were pro- ceeding  in connection with  the inspection  and preparation of six- teen further schemes.
  347- The Monmouthshire  County  Council is  proposing tocarry put drainage works on part of  the River Ebbw betweenPontymister and Newport.  The Council is at present in negotia-tion with the various riparian owners concerned, pending sub-mission of  a detailed scheme and formal application for grant.  348. Since my last Report, no further progress has been madewith the schemes projected by the Glamorgan County Councilin connection  with the Whitchurch Brook and the Rivers Elyand Taff, except that, in view of the very exceptional circum-stances obtaining in the case of these schemes, which differ fromthose  affecting agricultural land in the ownership  or occupationof a comparatively few persons, it has been agreed in principle to allow contributions by  the minor local authorities  of the districts involved towards the cost, in lieu of contributions by theriparian owners concerned.  349. In  spite  of frequent  representations, the CumberlandCounty Council have solar not taken advantage  of my offer of grants, although  I understand that there is urgent necessity forwork  of this - kind in parts of the West Cumberland  SpecialArea.                      Field Drainage.  350. The circumstances in which grants are now available to owners or occupiers of agricultural land in the Special Areas ofEngland and Wales, in connection with the execution of works offield  drainage for such  land, are indicated in  my previous report.  351. Such assistance has  now been available  for  just overtwelve months, but very little advantage has so far been taken of the facilities;  in fact only.twelve schemes (nine in Cumber-land,  two in Northumberland and one  in Durham) have beensubmitted up to 30th September, 1938.  All these schemes havebeen approved and, with the exception of the scheme in Durham(the execution of which has  been deferred),  have also beencompleted.  352. In the  large majority  of the Cumberland schemes, thework  consisted of the renovation of existing drains that had ceased to function satisfactorily, together with  the provision,where necessary, of additional new drains.   The remainder ofthe schemes provided for the installation of  drains in fields that had not hitherto been drained, or for the installation of addi-tional drains.  The total  area of the fields covered by the twelveschemes is 106J  acres, of which 95 acres are situate in Cumber-land.   The total  cost of  the works was  1,031, towards which grants amounting to a total of  339 were approved.  This lattersum,  less the amount of  the County Councifs reasonable over-head  charges for expenses incurred in dealing with the applica-tion,  represents  the  assistance afforded  from the  Special AreasFund to the owners or occupiers of the lands concerned.  other schemes were  under consideration at the date of  this  Report.
          PART IX. SOCIAL  IMPROVEMENT.                      Social Service.  353. Many of the measures described earlier in this report are really measures for the social improvement of the SpecialAreas.   The provision of adequate  health  services and the encouragement  of various types of sub-economic employment,however,  have  deservedly been made the subject of separateParts of the Report. What now follows is a description of thoseVoluntary Social Service  activities  which I  have  been  ableto encourage and stimulate in the Special Areas.            National  Council  of Social Service.  354. In paragraph 653  of my last Report I explained that Ihad decided to continue the policy, initiated by my predecessor,of making the National  Council of  Social Service the  mainchannel of my grants for voluntary social  service work.   Ihave  been closely in contact with the National Council duringthe last year, and have also seen a good deal of the work, inthe Areas, of the local organisations to which my  grants arepassed on.  As a result,  I am fully satisfied that the money isbeing well spent, and I am indebted to all these bodies for their whole-hearted efforts on  behalf of the Special Areas.  355. The amount of my grant-in-aid to the  National council for the year ending on 31st March, 1939, is  200,000, dividedunder the following main heads:                                                              School Camps  for Boys and Girls    ...    ...    85,000    Occupational Centres and Holidays for Women    22,000    Adolescent Welfare Work       .........    25,000    Maintenance of Educational  and Social  Settle-      ments    ...     ...    ...     ...     ...    ...    22,000    Educational Activities, including lecture courses,      choral societies, drama groups, etc.  ...    ...    18,000    Improvement of District Nursing Services   ...    15,000    Miscellaneous Social Service Work    ...    ...    13,000   356. The last-mentioned item  is to  be spent largely on theprovision of new or improved premises for those Settlementswhich are unsatisfactorily housed.  The grant for  AdolescentWelfare  Work  this  year is a good deal smaller than was thecase last year, by reason of the fact that grants are  now avail-able  from the National  Council for  Physical Training and recreation  for  many of  the  objects  which I have  hithertoassisted.  For the same reason, I have not promised  any grantsthis year towards the cost of Community Centres in the SpecialAreas.
  357- I am indebted to the Secretary of the National council for the  following account of the various activities which  havebeen  assisted  from  my  grants   during  the  year  ended30th September, 1938.Adolescent Welfare.  358. During  the  past year the following national  juvenileorganisations have  continued  to receive assistance through the medium of  the  National Council  of Social Service, for  their work with adolescents in the Special Areas: -       Boys&apos; Brigade.      Bay  Scouts&apos;  Association.      Church Lads&apos; Brigade.      Girls&apos;  Friendly- Society.      Girl-Guides&apos;  Association.      Girls&apos;  Guildry.      Girls&apos;  Life Brigade.      National. Association  of Boys&apos; Clubs.      National Council of Girls&apos; Clubs.      Welsh League of Youth.      Young Men&apos;s Christian Association.      Young Women&apos;s Christian Association.  359. The  Tyneside Council  of Social Service, the community service  Council  for Durham County and the South  Wales and monmouthshire  Council  of  Social  Service have  also  beenenabled, by the aid of grants,  to continue the supply  of teachersto Juvenile Groups  in their areas for handicrafts,  music, dramaand physical training classes.  360. The  general progress noted in the last Report has been maintained, and for the past year even more satisfactory figures are reported.  The national  organisations  listed above  haverecorded a net increase of 248  in the total number  of their clubs,groups or units,  and a net increase of nearly 14,500 in member-ship.  The estimated number of  boys and girls directly affectedis now  over 85,000.  The  grants  have  enabled the  nationalorganisations to strengthen their personnel, to extend the train-ing and recruitment  of  voluntary  leaders and to assist indi-vidual clubs and units which would otherwise have had to closedown through lack of funds.  Grants have also been availabletowards the cost of camping  holidays, and about 17,000 boysand 3,300 girls  spent at least one  week in camp  during the summer of 1938. Some figures supplied by the National Associa-tion of  Boys&apos; Clubs are of  interest as  an indication of thegrowth  fostered by these grants.   The  number of clubs hasincreased from 29 to 142, and the total membership  from  2,550to 11,600, since the grants were first  made, and not less import-ant than the actual increase  in numbers is the marked and continuing improvement in  the general standard  of  club work.
  361. Particular importance has  been attached  by many ofthe organisations to the assistance afforded for the  training of voluntary leaders, as it is realized  that the future  of the move-men t very largely depends on satisfactory leadership, a problemmade more acute by the departure  of many  of  the best andmost active of the younger generation to seek work elsewhere.Women&apos;s Work.  362. The Tyneside Council of Social Service, the community service  Council for Durham County, the  South Wales and monmouthshire Council of Social Service and  the CumberlandFriends&apos;  Unemployment  Committee  have continued to receiveassistance  through  the  National  Council  of  Social  Service;towards  their work  for  the women&apos;s clubs.  There  are how318  women&apos;s clubs associated with these bodies,  containing amembership of about 20,000, an increase of 32 clubs, and about,000 members  having been recorded during  the year.  Themajority of these groups are associated with men&apos;s groups inthe clubs,  which are tending more  and  more to  serve as thesocial centres of  the neighbourhood, especially in the isolatedmining villages  of Durham  and South Wales.  This  develop-ment of what may be termed the  &quot;  family club  &quot; is a significantfeature, and  the social need which it fills is emphasized by thefact that the  .women continue to be  subscribing members even when their husbands find employment.  363. The grants have  been devoted primarily  to providingexpert instruction  in  handicrafts,  home-craft,  cookery and physical  training.  The value of these services and the  apprecia-tion with which they are received are  shown by the large attend-ances at the  classes.  In Durham, for example, the aggregateattendance during the winter of 1937-8 was  over  45,000, anincrease  of 30,000 on the previous year.  In South Wales theaggregate attendance for the quarter ended March, 1938, was103,000.  364. Assistance has  also  been  available  for the  YoungWomen&apos;s  Christian Association towards the  maintenance  ofclubs in  all three Special Areas, and for the Union of Towns-women^ Guilds to enable new Guilds to be formed where fundscould not be raised locally.  A grant has also been given again to the Beeches Educational Centre for Women, near Birming-ham, where  a. series of residential courses is held for membersof women&apos;s clubs from all parts of the country.   The grant madewas in respect of the large number of students  attending the courses who  came from clubs in the  Special Areas.   365. Holidays for nearly 5,000 women were arranged duringthe summer of 1938 by the regional  organisations  in the SpecialAreas.   Part of the cost was met by grant-aid, but the women
in ail cases made a small contribution themselves towards theirexpenses.Educational Activities.  366 .^ During  the year very  satisfactory progress has  beenmade in the development of educational activities in the SpecialAreas.i  Grants  have again been  given through the national council of Social Service for the work of the  regional organisa-tions in providing leadership and instruction in music,  drama,discussion groups  and classes.  367. These activities have continued  to make  a particularlywide appeal in South Wales, where the Council  of Social Ser-vice works in conjunction with  the Workers&apos;  Educational-Asso-ciation, the National Council  of Music and  the  Young Men&apos;sChristian  Association.  The Workers&apos;  Educational Associationconducted, during the year, 126 terminal classes, 48 one-yearcourses and 87  one-day schools, in addition to a number  of short-extension courses.  The  Young Men&apos;s  Christian Associa-tion undertook a programme of over 2,000 single lectures andover 100 short study courses. The policy on the whole has been one  of  consolidation,  resulting in  a number  of  the  terminalclasses progressing sufficiently to be placed on a one-year basis.The National Council of Music  was again responsible for variedforms of musical activities, including 15 terminal and nine one-year classes, which  culminated in  the  Three Valleys Festivalheld at Mountain Ash in May,  with Dr.  Malcolm Sargent as theConductor-in-chief.   The  appointment of a full-time DramaOrganiser in South Wales has led to a considerable increase  inthe demand for instructional  and  advisory services  by thedramatic groups, and very satisfactory progress is recorded.  368. In the North Eastern  Area,  the  Tyneside Council  of social Service and the Community Service Council for DurhamCounty have continued to develop educational work in conjunc-tion with the Workers&apos; Educational Association, and a series  ofone-day schools and short courses was arranged on the same lines as in the previous year, a  large increase in the attendancesbeing  recorded.   An interesting feature was the  successfulorganisation of  21 adult  education schools, which  appear  tobe achieving valuable results  in stimulating a general interestin educational studies.  The response has been very encouraging-ing, and it is interesting to note that the facilities are being usedincreasingly by the members of women&apos;s clubs.  The music anddrama groups continue to attract an increasing number of bothmen and women, and there has been a  steady rise in the range and the standard of the performances.  369. The promotion of educational activities has always been one of the prime interests  of the Cumberland  Friends&apos; Unem-ployment  Committee,  and  the  development  of this side of the
&apos; work  during  the past year is  reported to have been very en- ecouraging.  Twenty-one courses of lectures were held during the winter of 1937-8, as compared with eight in the previous year, and the subjects studied produced  interesting discussions and opposing points of view.   An extension of music  and drama work  is also reported from this Area. Social and  Educational  Settlements.   370. There are  nine of these Settlements in South Wales, at Maes-yr-haf,  Merthyr, Bargoed,  Pontypool, Risca, Aberdare, Pontypridd, Dowlais and Brynmawr; four in the North Eastern Area, at Durham, Spennymoor, Seaham Harbour and Bensham Grove, Gateshead; and one&apos;, at Maryport, in West Cumberland. The  special  contribution  made  by these Settlements to the cultural and,social life of the neighbourhood is that they have been able to combine, especially in South Wales, the provision of expert advisory services with the  maintenance of close personal contact with  the  communities which  they serve.   Grant-aid towards the cost of these services has  been available from the Special  Areas Fund  through . the National Council  of  Social Service...  371. The South Wales  Settlements  are  associated with 143 men&apos;s clubs, 132 women&apos;s groups  and 160 boys&apos; and girls&apos; clubs, with a.combined total membership of about 29,000.  An inten- sive programme of educational courses, classes and  lectures has been  carried  out during the past  year, and instruction has also been  given in handicrafts,  drama and physical training.  The average attendance at the classes has been high, and they have continued to  arouse keen interest among the members.   Assist- ance  has been  given towards the acquisition of new  premises at Maes-yr-haf, Merthyr, Bargoed and Risca, and when they are completed  and in full occupation a considerable  extension of the activities  is anticipated.  A marked  increase in the  vigour and  scope  of the work is  reported from  the  Pontypool  Settle- ment since their new premises were opened in June, 1937.   372. Since  Easter, 1937,  the Maes-yr-PIaf Settlement has been conducting, with  the  aid of a special grant of  1,000 from the Special Areas Fund, an experiment in the running of Children&apos;s Play  Centres in a  number of places  in  the  Rhondda Valley. Eighteen such Centres  are now  open, catering for some 1,400 young children.   The Centres are usually held in Church Halls, hired for the purpose,  on two  evenings  per week.  Toys are provided and organised games are also arranged by the super- visors.  The  results  of the  experiment are  at present under consideration by a Committee convened by the South Wales and Monmouthshire Council of Social  Service,  and on receipt of their  recommendation I shall decide whether it is possible and desirable to continue the experiment.
  373- The Settlements in the North  Eastern  Area are not sointimately  connected with the clubs in their districts, and have developed  more  on the lines of  educational centres for theirneighbourhoods.   An increased  membership has been reported,and the  programme of courses  and lectures for the past yearcovered  a  wide range  of  activities, varying from  lectures onacademic subjects to instruction in handicrafts and stage  pro-duction and management.   Two of the Settlements Spenny-moor and Bensham Grove also provided facilities for adolescentactivities, and from the former it is reported that even the adult-members are mostly under thirty years of age.  This change inthe age grouping of the membership is welcomed by the Settle-ment as.bringing a new outlook and increased vitality.  grants towards capital expenditure on premises have been made in thecases of Seaham  Harbour and Bensham Grove.  374. The  Maryport  Settlement,  which  was   opened inSeptember, 1937, has made excellent progress, nearly one hundredmembers ;being enrolled for  the  first session.  A  regular pro-gramme of university extension courses, classes and lectures is inoperation in addition to craft activities, and a large increase inmembership is expected in the coming winter.   To  assist in theexpansion  of settlement activities in West Cumberland, a smallgrant was also  made to the Cumberland Friends&apos; UnemploymentCommittee towards the equipment of an educational centre inWhitehaven, which it is hoped  will eventually develop into aneducational settiement for the Whitehaven district.School Camps.  375. The grants to the National Council  of Social Service forthe  maintenance  of School  Camps for boys  and  girls in theSpecial Areas have been continued during the past  year.   Thenumber of children and teachers who attended during the winter of 1937-8 and  during the past summer was as follows:    Winter 1937-38 ;   2,549 school-children;  212 teachers;  594 juveniles                    and 34 instructors from Junior Instruction Centres.  Summer, 193S :    36,013 school-children ;  2,094  teachers ;  1,209                    juveniles and 78 instructors from Junior instruction                    Centres.Totals:     40,365 children;           2,418 teachers, etc.  The number of children who have attended the seventeenSchool Camps from the inception of the scheme to the end ofSeptember,  1938, is  141,815.  376. During the past year the school children came from theareas of twelve local education authorities in South  Wales, threein West Cumberland and fourteen in the North East.  The usualharmonious relations have been maintained between the volun-tary organisations and the local education authorities mentioned
                            8g.above, who have been responsible  for the recruitment of thechildren and their instruction  during  the camp periods.  the health  conditions during the period under review have  been generally satisfactory, and an  average gain in weight of  threepounds per child per two-weekly session has been maintained.  377.  Boys and girls from Junior Instruction Centres have alsoused certain of the  School Camps during the  school  children&apos;ssummer holidays and, in some  instances,  during the winter.Other School Camps were made available during the summerholidays  for  the  use  of  organisations providing  holidays  foradolescents, women and unemployed men.  378.  At the end of June, 1938, the Pembrey School Camp, inSouth Wales, had to be closed, owing to the acquisition of  theproperty by H.M. Office of Works for National purposes.              PART X.-MISCELLANEOUS.                 Fairbridge Farm Schools.  379.  In paragraphs 710 and 711 of my last Report, particularswere given  of the assistance which I was affording  to the Fair-bridge Farm Schools, Incorporated.   During the financial year ending on  31st  March, 1939,  I am  continuing to  help  this organisation in two directions; first by a grant of  1,500 towardsthe  cost of  its local offices at Newcastle-on-Tyne and Cardiff,and secondly by a grant to cover practically the whole  of thecost of removing children from the Special Areas to  the- Middle-more  Emigration Homes in  Birmingham  or the FairbridgeHostel in Kensington, and of their maintenance at these Homesuntil their migration to  the Dominions can be arranged.  380.  During the last  year, the two local offices have investi-gated the cases of 370 children.  Those who  have been found tobe suitable  on medical and other grounds have been transferredto the Homes to be prepared  for migration.  Fifty-two have gone out to  the Fairbridge  Farm  Schools in  Canada  and australia during the year.  381.  The Secretary to the organisation has informed me thatthe  Special  Areas&apos; children who have been helped to migrateduring the  last three years are all thriving, and show promise of becoming adequately equipped for work and  citizenship inthe  Dominions.     Brynmawr  and Clydach Valley Industries, Limited.  382.  In paragraph 713 of my last Report, it was stated thata loan of  28,000 had been made from the Special  Areas fund to the Brynmawr and Clydach Valley Industries, Limited.  It   14010                                               D
gowas also reported that the furniture factory had been destroyedby fire.  383. A new  and  up-to-date furniture  factory was openedduring the year, and in spite of the temporary suspension ofboth production and sales due to the destruction of the oldfactory, the total value of orders taken for Brynmawr furnitureduring the twelve months under review was slightly higher thanthe previous record.  This achievement was helped considerablyby the results of an exhibition held in Manchester, which was opened in October, 1937, by H.R.H. the  Duke of Kent.  384. A London showroom, at 6, Cavendish Square, W.i, was opened on 19th May, 1938, by Mrs. Neville Chamberlain.  Itis hoped, with the help of this showroom, and of exhibitionswhich are still being held up and down the country, to effect aconsiderable and rapid development of sales.  Even during thelast year the number of employees increased from thirty-nineto fifty-five, and there  is a very fair prospect of  such  further development as will secure permanent success.  385. A new  boot factory  was  opened on 29th  September,1937.  The record  of this new factory is encouraging and antici-pated progress in the near future will, it is hoped, amply justifythe support which has been given  to the enterprise.   To theheavy type of foot-wear with which Brynmawr boot makers hadalready  established their name, footwear  of  a lighter type hasbeen  added.  The selling organisation has been strengthened,and orders brought in from the border counties as well as fromall over Wales.  Orders accepted during the last three monthsof the year under review show an increase of 60 per cent, overthe figure for the corresponding period of the  previous  year.It has been necessary to acquire new and up-to-date machinery,and to engage fifteen extra workmen.   386. The total number of workpeople employed by the bootand  furniture concerns, taken together,  increased during theyear from fifty-eight to eighty-nine.  The pay rolls now amountto nearly   9,000 per  annum, which  represents  a  very realcontribution towards the life of the district.           Northern Industries Workrooms, Limited.   387. Financial assistance has continued to be given towardsthe organization of the scheme known as Northern  IndustriesWorkrooms, to which  reference was made in paragraphs 714 to716 of my last Report. During the year, however, this scheme has been absorbed by a new Company incorporated under the title of Northern  Industries  Workrooms, Limited.  The  objectof this Company is to carry  on, on an enlarged scale, similarcraft activities to  those which have already been assisted. TheCompany proposes to  maintain seven workrooms (including the
                  PART XI. FINANCE.  390. The grants voted by Parliament for the Special AreasFund now total  16,000,000.  This sum is  intended  to coveractual expenditure, by the Commissioner for Scotland as well asmyself,  only up to 31st March, 1939, and does not in  any wayrepresent a financial limit to our commitments, for the  completedischarge  of  which Parliament  will be  asked,  as and when necessary, to vote further sums.  391. The actual payments by way  of  grant  or  loan, up to30th September,  1938, amounted  to over  8,500,000, out of commitments estimated to be  16,770,000. Although, as pointedout in my last Report, expenditure is necessarily  considerably in arrear of commitment, there has been, during the past year, a material acceleration in  the rate of expenditure.  This is  due,to a considerable extent, to the rapid progress made on industrialschemes.  392. A summary of the estimated commitments  entered intoup to 30th September,  1938, is appended, the figures given beinginclusive of those quoted in previous  Reports.   Under certainheadings the  commitments  noted are  provisional figures  only and do not necessarily cover the  full programme of  workscontemplated.three taken over from the smaller concern now absorbed),  andthe Nuffield Trustees have promised to assist by a grant. I haveagreed to grant a sum of  2,500 towards the necessary capitalexpenditure  which  will be  incurred in the initial  stages ofdevelopment of this Company.     Lady Headlam&apos;s  United Service Employment Scheme.  388.  I have continued during the past year to afford financialassistance to  this scheme,  by means of which juveniles  andmarried couples from the North Eastern Special Area are placedin domestic service in  the  South of England. The LondonHostel  for the scheme has also continued to receive assistance.During the year, 126  girls have  lived at the Hostel while  pre-paring to take up employment or awaiting re-employment, and120 girls have used it regularly as a  club.           Summer Camps for Military Training.  389.  During the Summer of 1938,  as in previous years, theWar Office arranged for Military Camps to be held in the SpecialAreas.  The places chosen were Tow  Law, in County Durham,and the Gower Peninsula, in South Wales. Local trade has againbenefited from these camps, and I am grateful to the War office for their continued assistance in this matter.
