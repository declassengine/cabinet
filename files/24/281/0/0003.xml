THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.                                                              &apos;7 secret.                                            COPY NO.     CP. 277 (58).                                  CABINET.                           EXPORT CREDITS LEGISLATION.             Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.   1. I was authorised by my colleagues (Cabinet 57 (38)Conclusion 9) in connection with the discussion on China toconsider with the Chancellor of the Exchequer the possibilityof making arrangements for the grant of credits for exportsto foreign countries in cases Where this might seem desirablebut where credits could not be arranged through the export credits Guarantee Scheme.   2. As a result of our discussions the arrangements we contemplate are that in the Bill to amend the export guarantees Act which has already been authorised (Cabinet54(38) Conclusion 10) a new provision should be insertedwhich would empower the Board of Trade, subject to the consentof the Treasury, to make arrangements for the giving of guarantees without consulting the Advisory Committee.  It isproposed that the conditions on which a guarantee shall begiven shall be     (a) that they shall be for the purpose of establishing           or of encouraging trade, or any branch of trade           between the United Kingdom and any country.           (This follows the existing Acts);     (b) that the Board of Trade may, with the consent of           the Treasury, give the guarantee when it appears           to them to be in the national interest to do so.The amount of guarantees of this kind outstanding at anyone time would be limited to  10 millions in addition tothe  75 millions it is proposed to provide for the ordinary commercial work of the Export Credits Guarantee Department.It would also be provided that not more than  2 millions would be used for services and any miscellaneous matters,                         -1-
leaving at least  8 millions for the export of United kingdom goods.   3. In the new clause there would he no restriction onguarantees covering the export of munitions and, at the sametime, in the clauses relating to the cornmerical &quot;business of theDepartment the reference to munitions of war would he modifieito refer to &quot;weapons of war or other goods which in the opinionOf the Board are constructed or intended for destructive usein war.&quot;   This would enable us to cover tentss motor lorriesand so on in the commercial section.   4. Since the Export Credits legislation for many years pasthas required the Department to produce a quarterly return  of guarantees given I think we shall have to provide in the Billfor furnishing Parliament with some information about the guarantees given under this new clause;   I think we canlimit this to a half-yearly return stating the amount of the guarantees, the countries concerned, and an indication of the classes of goods without giving any particulars of individualtransactions.   5. The only other point with which I think  I need  troublethe Cabinet is the question of the availability of exportcredit guarantees for colonial goods, which was raised by theSecretary of State for the Colonies.   It  is  proposed under  thenew Bill to take powers of a general character  which wouldnot exclude guarantees in  respect  of re-exports  from  thiscountry up to a limited amount;   these facilities will be available for re-exports of colonial goods and  I  should not propose to object  to their being  used for  such  re-exports  to alimited extent.   To go further  than  this  and take power togrant credits for colonial goods  exported  direct  to  third countries might be held to be  outside the  scope of the  Bill(the  object is  &quot;to establish or  encourage  trade between theUnited Kingdom  and any country&quot;)   and might  also  give  rise  to                               -2-
        opposition from traders in this country.           6. I have brought these proposals before the Cabinet as a        matter of extreme urgency, partly because it is desirable to        give an early answer to the Chinese about their order for        lorries, but primarily in view of the desire of the Whips that        this Bill should be available for a Second Reading in the        House of Commons before.the Christmas Adjournment.   I understand        that there may be some difficulty in securing sufficient        business in the immediate future.   I should be glad, therefore,        to have authority for the immediate introduction of the Bill on        the lines already approved by the Cabinet in CP.249(38) with        further provisions as outlined in paragraphs 2 and 3 above.  In        view of the urgency I hope my colleagues will authorise me to        introduce the Bill as soon as it has been approved by the        Home Affairs Committee and without further reference to the        Cabinet.           7. If possible I will circulate copies of the draft Bill        before Wednesday.                                          O.P.G.S.Board of Trade.   5th December, 1938.
