Copy^No.  48     203 (38).               TO  BE KEPT. UNDER LOCK  AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to     ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.PALESTINE.    I CIRCULATE for the information of my colleagues the annexed copy ofa private letter from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo regarding the situationin Palestine.                                                                      H.    December 14, 1938.(Personal.)                                        Cairo, December 6, 1938.    I HAVE been seriously considering once more recording officially my intenseconcern about the Palestine situation and the really grave danger in further delay in its settlement.  But as I don&apos;t want to be.labelled as too frequently  harpingon this chord it has seemed wiser to let myself go in a letter to you.    On the 25th September we received your telegram No.  444 (which I hadbeen shown in London) indicating  that His Majesty&apos;s Government,  in  view ofthe imminent danger of  war,  had decided  to suspend Jewish immigration into palestine.  The  crisis passed,  and we sat back and let things slide once more!    Reports from  various  sources suggest that there  is a chance of the balloongoing up once more  in the near future.  Whether this is really so or not, you can judge  far better than I: but  my own growing  conviction is to the same effect.  If that happens,  are we again going to wait until the eleventh hour togive way and suspend immigration?  The decision would be too late  to achieve its object,  for the Arabs,  realising the situation as  well as we, would not  be content with a concession wrung from us on the eve of war which would haveplacated  them in time of peace.  .  Bullard in one of his latest telegrams has indicated with appropriate forceand clarity Ibn Saud&apos;s feelings and the danger of his and his Arabs&apos;  joining in with the others to turn the Jews and ourselves out of Palestine unless immigrationhas meantime been stopped.    I have myself pointed out, with wearisome repetition, that unless the Arabsget satisfaction  over immigration we must face the fact  that, if war comes, weshall have to. take on the  Arabs as well as the Italians and Germans.  Whatwould  our  position then be in  the Near East ?  I shudder to think.    Concessions to the Arabs now may  secure terms of  settlement which leftmuch longer will not be accepted.  Up till last year it was pretty clear  that theArabs  would have accepted a 33 per cent. Jewish minority.   I am not so surenow;  and in another year they will probably refuse it outright.
    Is it too much to hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government will now realise the gravity of the danger of delay and failure to look hard political and strategicalfacts in the face?  I am not forgetting that His Majesty&apos;s Government believe(so I Understood from Mr. MacDonald last September) that Parliament  will not accept suspension of immigration; and that this was confirmed in Foreign office telegram No. 556 of the 4th November.  But when it  is a  case of such vitalmoment to the safety of the Empire the Government should  surely be preparedto explain the facts to Parliament and carry them with them ?    The tendency here  in Egypt towards reinsurance with Italy  is markedlygrowing and is due  to the fear that we are not  strong enough to protect Egyptadequately in the event  of an Italian attack.  If we again had the Arab  worldon our side, our whole position in the Near East would be so much strengthenedthat the Egyptians would have less cause to view the Italian menace with suchapprehension.    Can&apos;t  the Jews themselves realise that it is suicidal for Jewry to weakenGreat  Britain so perilously in the face of the  obvious  dangers that threaten?One would  have  thought that a man of Weizmann&apos;s intelligence would have seen that quick enough.   It&apos;s such an obvious truth.    As to the  forthcoming London  Conference, I confess that my hopes arerapidly dwindling.  If we could have got Mohamed Mahmoud genuinely interestedI  believe it would have helped a lot towards success.  As it is he is now justrather bored by the  whole thing.   It&apos;s all very well for you to tell me we can&apos;ttreat him with the full confidence of an ally because of Ibn Saud&apos;s feelings. but these things can be generally managed :  and  if  it was  we whom MohamedMahmoud was trying to draw in and not the other way round I can well imagineour feelings if we weren&apos;t taken with full confidence by our ally?  But I suspectthe real answer to be that we honestly do not ourselves know what our policy is ?That, if true, is the most fatal thing of all.  It seems to me obvious that a definite policy will at long last be wrung  from us either during the Conference or, if theConference  fails, directly afterwards.  That decision will of course be a hardone, but it  will  be ineluctable.   My  object is to warn  you most seriously thatwhether at the Conference or after it you will be obliged to call off immigrationif you want to keep the friendship of the  Arab world.  The longer you delaythat no doubt painful decision, the less value you will get from making it. If youleave it until the verge of European War you will get no value at all.
