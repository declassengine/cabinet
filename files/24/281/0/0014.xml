THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT-Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1938.Copy No. ^ ICABINET.-ETHIOPIA.         Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    I THINK my colleagues may be interested to see the attached memorandum,drawn up  recently in the Foreign Office; regarding the  present situation in ethiopia.                                                              ^    December 13, 1938.       MEMORANDUM RESPECTING THE PRESENT SITUATION IN ETHIOPIA.Military.    THE only area in which  it is known  that  Italian authorities are not infull control is that around Ankober in a range of mountains 80  miles to thenorth-east of Addis Ababa, whence Ethiopian  bands have raided almost as faras Moggio on the Addis Ababa-Jibuti Railway, 40 miles from Addis Ababa.However, there has been no attack on the railway, which  has not been cut  since october  1936, but  has  functioned with  absolute  regularity.    The italian authorities are evidently determined to clean up the Ankober area, where theyhave now brought their forces up  to sixty  battalions.  The  annual rains  from june to October are probably the reason for which the Italian forces have madelittle progress against the rebels in the Ankober district  during recent months.Six months ago the area where the Italians were experiencing greatest difficulties were the mountains of Gojjam,  180 miles to the north of Addis Ababa.  However,it appears that this area has now been subdued,  and Mr. Stonehewer-Bird reportsthat Italian control has been increasingly established in previously disaffectedareas.   However, the Sudan Government have reason to  believe  that a  revoltis developing  to  the north-west of  Lake  Tsana.  On  the 16th April last, theItalian forces in Ethiopia amounted to 53,000 white troops, but on the 1st Octoberthese had been reduced to 37,000; the number of native troops, 60,000; labourers,55,000, and Italian civilians, 25,000, is the  same for both dates.Civil A dministration.    The Italian Government are profiting by experience and are trying to obtain a better stamp of administrative official.   They are leaving local administrationso far as possible  in the hands of reliable Ethiopian headmen, and civil adminis-tration  is gradually extending.  That communications with  Italian  posts are maintained by air &quot;is due to difficulties of communication, particularly during the rains, rather than to these posts  being beleaguered by Ethiopian  rebels.  Theconstruction of  roads  is  proceeding,  though  perhaps not  so intensively  as heretofore.CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 288 (38).10165  [18354]
Economic Situation.    In  1937  the economic situation in Ethiopia was  extremely  bad, partly onaccount of excessive drought and partly  due to passive resistance on the partof the natives.   There may be some  improvement this  year, but  the  italian authorities, having liquidated  the former  intermediaries for exports such asthe business  of  Messrs.  Mohammedally  in Ethiopia, are  experiencing  greatdifficulty in exporting Ethiopian-produce.   Although the natives now  show atendency to accept the Italian lire in payment, the economic difficulties whichare being, and are likely to be, encountered by the Italian  administration,  are far greater than  the  comparatively minor  trouble that they experience as aresult of resistance on  the part of Ethiopian bands.Colonisation.    Only a very  few Italian families have been settled in Ethiopia, some roundHarar and others in the vicinity of Addis Ababa; the settlements that have beenmade have been  of an experimental nature.  The Italian authorities seem torealise that they cannot displace the  native cultivators  from their lands,  but should  try to  make  them  more  efficient,  also that  there  are  large areas  in abyssinia which are unsuitable for settlement  by  white families owing to  thealtitude.Slavery.    Slavery has  been  definitely abolished in Ethiopia,  and whilst the nativesmay be forced to work on the construction  of roads,  &amp;c, they receive payment;Efforts have been made  to.  provide liberated slaves with the means of  making their own living, and villages of liberated slaves have been  founded;The Coptic Church.    Mr. Stonehewer-Bird reports that according to missionaries who have workedfor years among the Ethiopians the faith of the average native Copt is with difficultyrecognisable as Christianity, whilst  their mode of  life and moral outlook bearsscant evidence of Christian teaching  or  belief.  The Coptic Church had been regarded as one of the mainstays of passive resistance  to the Italians.  However,Mr. Stonehewer-Bird now reports that there has undoubtedly been  an improve-ment in relations between the authorities and the Coptic Church,  which is partly due to Italian realisation that  for  obtaining the confidence of  the Ethiopiansthe Church is a  useful ally and partly to the decision of the  Church to make thebest of things even though this may mean subservience.To. Sum Tip:    The Italian control over Ethiopia is becoming steadily stronger, and onlyone small area (Ankober) is in Abyssinian control.  The  Abyssinians are cowedand would be unable to effect a widespread rebellion in the absence of outsideaid and encouragement  and knowledge that Italy is  engaged in a major war.In any discussion of the degree of control exercised by the Italians in Ethiopiait must be remembered  that their troops only  entered Addis Ababa less than two and a half  years ago, and that  it took the French far longer to completelysubdue French  Morocco.  The  economic difficulties  are far  greater than  thetask of subduing the few Abyssinians who are still fighting against the Italians;and it is clear that for many years ahead vast sums will  have to be poured intoAbyssinia without any dividend being obtained therefrom. In fact, the EthiopianEmpire is likely to be  as great  a drain on Italy as Morocco was on the Kingdomof Spain.Foreign Office, November 1, 1938.
