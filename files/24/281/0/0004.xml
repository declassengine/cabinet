  (tL.JS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT) . ,SECRET.                        CABINET.                           1   .,&apos; -&apos;CP.278(38)  Copy No./f/                   FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE RAILWAYS.                 Memorandum by, the, Minister,, of Transport *                   This document is in amplification of the  statement which         I made to my colleagues at the last  meeting of the  Cabinet         (Cabinet 59(38),  Conclusion 7) when  I brought  to  their notice         the financial  position of the Main Line Railway Companies and         their proposals for the repeal of the existing statutory         provisions relating to the charges  for the  conveyance of         merchandise traffic by rail.    The  companies&apos;  proposals, which         would not affect  passenger fares, are set out  in  two memoranda         and copies are attached (Annexes A  and B).              2.    When regard  is had to the  place which the railways         still occupy in the economic life of the  country  and in particular         to  the dependence of the heavy industries on cheap  rail transport         (secured through  the application of  the principle of charging         what  the traffic  will  bear)  it is clear that the  maintenance of         an  efficient railway system is essential  in peace time.   In war         the railways would be  a vital factor.   The need  for economy in         the use  of petrol or other imported  fuel  in an emergency is likely,         apart from any other considerations,  to necessitate the use of the         railways to an even greater extent as the main transport machinery         of  the country.     It  is imperative,  therefore, to  prevent a         situation arising in which the financial position of the railways         becomes  such as seriously to  impair  their efficiency.              30    For  some years past the financial position of the         railways has been unsatisfactory and in recent months has         deteriorated to such an extent as to occasion  grave anxiety.         This  year a decline in gross  receipts  which will probably amount         to  about  6 or  7 million less than  last year  will  be accompanied         by  an increase in expenses  (due to increases in wages and cost of         materials)  of  something in  the nature  of  3 or  4 million making
 a total  reduction  in net  revenue  compared with last year cf some  10  million.      4.   The  seriousness of the  situation is demonstrated by the  fact  that  the  estimated net revenue for this year is about  28  million against a  standard revenue under the Railways Act of 1921 of  51-2- million.   Expressed in terms of remuneration of capital,  the position  is  that some  416 million of capital may go wholly unremunerated out of a  total of  1,103 million. The  worst case  is  that of the London and North Eastern Railway where the amount likely to  be without remuneration may exceed one  half  of the total  capital of   377 mill ion.     5e   The Railway Companies contend that this loss of revenue is largely due  to  unfair  competition by road transport though it cannot be doubted that some part of the decline in receipts is due to trade  recession.   The road haulage industry allege a similar falling  off  in  traffic.   The Railway Companies admit that legislation during recent years has eased some of their difficulties but suggest  that it  has only touched the fringe of the problem and that the  proposed legislation with regard to road rates, even if undertaken at once,cannot have any practical effect in time to  save the  situation.     6.   It is in these  circumstances that the Railway companies have placed before me and the public their proposal for the repeal of the existing statutory provisions governing the charges and conditions for the conveyance of merchandise traffic by rail including such matters as classification, publication and unduepreference.   They contend that they should be given complete freedom to make their own bargains with traders as to the charges and conditions for the conveyance of merchandise, as is the case with the road haulier, and that nothing less than this will be of material assistances
IS      7,    This  proposal  is a complete  reversal  of  the general policy towards  transport  which  has &quot;been  adopted by successive Governments  since  the  WARE   Luring  the  whole of that period every investigation  -  Royal  Commission on Transport, Salter Committee, Transport Advisory Council  -  has  confirmed the opinion that  co-ordination and not  competition between  the different forms of transport is  the only  Way to  produce a transport system Which will meet  the  economic needs of  the co&quot;&amp;ntry.   Even as recently as  September  1936,  the Railway  Companies themselves supported this  view  in a  document submitted  by  them to the Transport Advisory Council in connection with that body&apos;s investigation into the question of service and.  rates,.   They woiald no doubt  justify their apparent  change of attitude by saying that  they are still prepared  to adhere to that proposition as the ultimate  aim, but  that they cannot afford to await its realisation.   They claim that  something must be done at once to meet  the  immediate  situation.   They  maintain that the removal of the shackles  on their  freedom to  quote rates would, by placing  them in  the same  position as road transport, enable merchandise  to find its proper  medium  of transport and thus promote, not a rate war,but a modus  Vivendi  on  a sound economic basis.      8.   In the Report on Service and Rates which the Transport Advisory Council submitted in October  1937 and  which was signed by the representatives of the railway  companies, it was stated that  the stabilisation of wages, working conditions and rateswithin the road haulage industry must  be dealt  with before seriouprogress could be  made in&apos; its relation to other forms of transport.   Wages and working  conditions have  already been dealt with in the  Road Haulage  (Wages) Act of last Session,  andwith my  colleagues approval, I  have  announced the Government&apos;s acceptance of the  general lines of the Council&apos;s Report asregards rates.    The Council, however, suggested that the roadhauliers should be afforded an  opportunity of building up a
 rates  structure  for their own  industry  and that they should be given  time  to achieve  this  object.   My information is that considerable  progress  has been made  in  this  direction but it is  clear  that even  if  legislation were  undertaken at an early date the  control of road rates could not become effective for some time,     90   So  far as it  is possible to judge  from press reports, the first reactions towards the railway companies&apos; plea for &quot;freedom&quot; have on the whole been favourable.   When, however, the implications of the proposals come  to be more fully realised there  may be  a swing in the other direction, particularly on the part of those traders whose goods are in the lower ranges of the railway classification  and  of other  transport interests.   Signs of this change of mind  are  already showing themselves in various quarters.     10.   The railways  declare that they have no intention of making drastic changes  in existing rates and that their actions will necessarily be  guided by commercial considerations.   None the less they have  not  themselves suggested  any practical safeguards for traders  or other interests that may be affected, and it does not  seem unlikely that cut-throat competition for those  traffics in which  road transport  has made the greatest inroads might  develop and be accompanied by an increase in rates on traffics (mainly  those of the heavy  industries) for which road competition  is  not  so fierce.     11.   The existing  control of railway rates is founded onnumerous statutory provisions ons, under which jurisdiction is vested in the Railway Rates Tribunal and the Railway and canal commission and the main  features of that control which would be affected by the  railway  companies proposals are set out in annex C to this  document.   In my discussions with the railwaycompanies&quot;they have  so far adopted the  attitude that their proposals should be  accepted in principle before any question of
 safeguards  is  considered.   Tlxey showed little inclination to accept my suggestion that this was the wrong method  of approach and that the proper course would be to consider separately the case  for repealing or modifying each statutory provision.      12.    To   accede to the companies&apos; full demands would be a  retrograde step in our efforts to introduce order  into the transport system of the country and, in addition, my colleagues v/ill  appreciate the somewhat insidious danger of rail and road interests agreeing ofl &quot;freedom&quot;.   It might, for instance, resul in a  demand from road hauliers for the sweeping away of the licensing control of the Traffic Commissioners so that they may run as many lorries as they like.   In such a situation the railways might well lose even more traffic than at present and the roads become even more congested and dangerous.      13.    A blank refusal of the proposals would, on the other hand, almost certainly produce most embarrassing results5 indeed I should fear  that the companies might -               (a) seek to place on the Government the blame         for their financial -position and all that may result         from  it, including  reductions in travelling         facilities and staffs               (b) announce the necessity for an immediate         reduction in wages which in the present temper  of         the Unions would in all probability result  in a         strike which would again be laid at the door of the         Government 1 or               (c) simply let matters take their course in the         belief that the Government will eventually  be forced         either to come to their aid financially or  to         nationalise them.     14.    Apart from these considerations, my examination ofthe position has led me to the conclusion that there is,  on merits, a   case for some material relaxation of the existing
statutory regulations &quot;but falling far short of the wholesaleproposals of the companies.   Until the matter has been more fully examined, especially by the Transport Advisory Council  towhom, as indicated in the next paragraph,  I have referred it,  i must of course reserve my final advice, but so far as myexamination has gone my present inclination is to a relaxation inthe direction of -               (a) the removal of the obligation on the Railway           Rates Tribunal so to adjust charges as to produce  the           standard revenue (See Annex C - item 2$.   Standard           revenue might be retained as an overriding limit to                          s           net revenue.                (b) the removal of the obligation on the companies ies           to notify all new or reduced exceptional charges and to           obtain the prior approval of the Tribunal to all           exceptional rates more than 40 per cent, below standard           and to all agreed charges (See Annex C - item 5).                (c) the repeal of the provisions as to equality           of charge and undue preference (See Annex C - item 10).           These provisions might be replaced by a right to traders           to claim equal treatment in like circumstances.     15.   In view of the terms of Section 46 of the Road and rail Traffic Act, 1933, I have referred the railway companies&apos;proposals to the Transport Advisory Council which was set up under that Section &quot;for the purpose of giving advice and assistanceto the Minister of Transport in connection with the discharge byhim of his functions in relation to means and facilities for transport and their co-ordination, improvement and development&quot;.A copy of the remit is attached to this document (Annex D) and my colleagues will note that I have asked the Council to takethe matter into very early consideration and have informed them of my view that there is, prima facie, a case for some materialrelaxation provided that due regard is had to the ultimate objective of the co-ordination of all forms of transport,   I
                                                     93                                                     hi W                         - 7 - should, hope  that the  examination of the proposals by the Council, which is  fully representative, will result in the formulation of a scheme  which will assist the railway companies to tide over their immediate difficulties without endangering the position of traders and  other forms of transport.   Ab a Government Bill will be necessary, I  shall have to ask for Parliamentary time to be allotted during the present Session,,  -^Unless it is possible to secure a  considerable measure of agreement the 3ill will be strongly  contested and the proceedings nay then be protracted.     16.   I must not leave the Cabinet with an impression that a decision upon the proposals submitted, by the companies will afford a  complete or  final solution of this problem, which inevitably,  to my mind, involves much wider issues.   In some quarters, the solution suggested for all our difficulties is the creation  of  a public Board which would control all forms of transport.   I think that a proposal of this kind is not practical politics  at  the present times  the setting up of any such organisation, even if desirable in itself, would be a most difficult and lengthy process as the various elements are atpresent constituted.   If, however, the decision on the present proposals should be in favour of some relaxation of the existingcontrol of charges, I consider that any announcement to that effect should be accompanied by a statement that the finalobjective of the Government is still co-ordination, coupled withsome indication of the means by which it is to be achieved.This would require early decisions on difficult and far reachingquestions, including such thorny subjects as the limitation of long distance haulage by road and the restriction of the use whicha trader may make of his own vehicles for the conveyance of hisown goods.   Unpopular as such measures would be in certain quarters if  it were found necessary to adopt them, I think thetime has come when the nettle must be grasped and in my opinion the country  is prepared to face the position and to support a
Government  which  shows itself ready to deal comprehensively withthe problem of transport,,     17.    As soon as I hove received the report of the transport advisory Council; which, I hope, may he early in February, Ishall again refer to my colleagues and I trust that in the lightof the Council&apos;s report and my own further consideration in thematter, I shall then be in a position to place before themconcrete proposals for dealing with the difficulties of theRailway Companies in a manner which will still safeguard theother interests concerned,   Meanwhile, I should be grateful  forany views which my colleagues may wish to express on this verydifficult problem which vitally affects every aspect of our national life.   Any such expression of opinion would be of thegreatest value to me in my search after the best solution.
         25ANNEX   AMEMORANDUM TO THE  MINISTER OF TRANSPORTRAILWAY CHARGES FOBMERCHANDISE traffic the RAILWAY COMPANIES&apos; ASSOCIATION,       FIELDEN HOUSE,          GREAT COLLEGE STREET,             WESTMINSTER, S.W.I.November, 1938.
MEMORANDUM  TO  THE  MINISTER  OF  TRANSPORT       RAILWAY  CHARGES  FOR MERCHANDISE TRAFFIC(HANDED  TO  THE  MINISTER OF  TRANSPORT AT  THE  CONFERENCE  HELD  ON                         23RD NOVEMBER, 1938.)      1. During the last fifteen years the Main Line Railway Companies havemade various representations to the Government upon the legal disabilities underwhich they are operating in comparison with motor transport on the public roads.At no time have the railways asked for preferential treatment ;  they have merelyasked that they should be given equal treatment with the road transport industry at the hands of Parliament.      2. Legislation has  eased some of the  disabihties of the railways ;  butit has not touched the great differences between the Parliamentary control of thecharges  and  conditions applicable to the  conveyance  of  merchandise  by therailways and the road hauliers respectively.      3.-The most recent representations of the Railway Companies were madeto the Minister of Transport on 24th May, 1938, when amongst  other mattershis attention was again drawn to the injury caused to the railways by the present one-sided control of charges for merchandise traffic.  It is upon this aspect that theCompanies once more urgently request to be heard.      4. In  1933 Parliament authorised the creation of the Transport Advisorj&apos;&apos;Council, and  in 1935 a  Committee of the Council  was set up to investigate thesubject  of &quot; Service and Rates.&quot;  Their report was submitted to the Minister inJuly, 1937, and recommended certain steps towards the creation of a system ofrates for the  road haulage  industry.  No  steps, however, have yet been taken byParliament to implement  this report.      5. Since  July,   1937,  the  situation  has  become  seriously  worse and meanwhile extensive propaganda  has  completely misrepresented the railwayposition.      6. The effects of the unbalanced legal position are steadily  accumulating,and the  Railway Companies have now no alternative but to ask for early legislativesteps to give  them equality with other forms  of transport.   Partial remedies on
the lines  of those suggested  in  July,  1937, even  if  enacted in the  presentParliamentary  Session,  would  not become effective  for a considerable  period,and even when effective would  not achieve equality of working conditions.                  RAILWAY COMPANIES&apos; PROPOSALS.      7. The Railway Companies accordingly submit that:         (A) The existing statutory regulation of the charges for the conveyance             of merchandise traffic  by railway,  together with  the requirements             attached thereto,  including such matters as  classification, publication             and undue preference,  should be repealed.         (B) The  railways, exactly like  other  forms  of transport,  should be             permitted to  decide  the charges and conditions  for the conveyance             of merchandise which they are required to carry.      8. Equality  of  conditions between all the various  forms of transporthaving  thus been achieved, it would  be proper that any regulation which mayin future be applied to any one form of transport should (in appropriate shape)be applied to all the others.  To this the railways would,  naturally, raise noobjection.      9. This  equality would have the further advantage that it would permitParliament  to deal with transport charges generally  without  being hampered byendeavours  to conform  to  a system of control  which has applied for over one hundred years to the railways  and was designed to deal  with  conditions no longerexistent.      10.- The Railway Companies&apos; proposals represent  merely a further develop-ment of the claim which they have urged for many years, that they should be afforded equitable conditions of competition.  They are not asking for preferential treatment or any form of artificial protection.      11. The conditions  of  competition which have  prevailed  over the pastfifteen years are inequitable, and are prejudicing the efficiency of the railwaysand their ability to meet the calls which are made upon them. This consideration is of  especial importance,  having regard  to the responsibilities which  would fall upon the  railways in the event of a national emergency.  It is already evidentthat under  emergency conditions the  railways would be called upon  to  performservices of a far more comprehensive character than are required of them at thepresent time, and of a far more  critical  nature than would  be expected of anyother form  of internal transport.  It is submitted that no effort should be sparedto see that equitable conditions  are given during peace-time to a public serviceof such vital importance if it is to fulfil satisfactorily the  responsibility  whichmust inevitably fall upon  it under conditions of emergency.
MEMORANDUM TO THE  MINISTER OF  TRANSPORTRAILWAY CHARGES EORMERCHANDISE traffic the RAILWAY COMPANIES&apos; ASSOCIATION,       FIELDEN HOUSE,         GREAT COLLEGE STREET,             WESTMINSTER, S.W.L.December, 1938.
MEMORANDUM  TO  THE  MINISTER   OF  TRANSPORTRAILWAY  CHARGES  FOR  MERCHANDISE TRAFFIC(HANDED TO THE MINISTER OP TRANSPORT AT THE CONFERENCE HELD                   ON 8TH DECEMBER, 1938).   1.  The Minister, when he received the Chairmen and General Managers of the Railwayson the 23rd November, asked them to amplify that part of their Memorandum which dealtwith the action to be taken.  In particular he requested that they should indicate the natureof the measure which they would ask the Minister to present to Parliament and their reasonsin support of it.   2.  The Railways have endeavoured in this Second Memorandum to meet the Ministerswishes.   3.  The legislation which the Railways have in view would  be short and comprehensive,and in effect would enable them to make in respect of the carriage of merchandise such chargesas are appropriate to the traffic to be carried.  This would entail the repeal of Part III of theRailways Act, 1921, and also of various other Acts and sections of Acts.   The proposals of theRailways do not extend to passenger fares and the  legislation would, therefore, continue theRailway Rates Tribunal in existence.   It is suggested that as regards  these fares the proposed legislation might apply machinery somewhat  analogous to that which  exists with regard to the fares  of the  suburban passenger  services  of the  Railways under  the London passenger transport Act, 1933.   4.  The foregoing paragraph indicates the  scope of the legislation which the Railways have in view.  They submit that nothing less would achieve the object which they are commendingto the Minister, namely, equality with Road  Transport.   5.  It may be well to review  the  position of Road Transport in respect of charges formerchandise.   6.  A Road Haulier when applying for  an &quot;A&quot; or &quot; B &quot; licence may at the discretion of the Licensing Authority be required to supply particulars of the traffics- which he expects to carry and at  the rates which he is at present charging.  Whatever may be  the objectof this requirement   the  Licensing Authority has  no  jurisdiction  to modify the ratessubmitted by an applicant for a  licence nor can any condition be laid down that the ratesshall  in fact  be charged.   7. A Road Haulier is in fact entirely at large with respect  to the charges which he maymake for  the carriage of freight.   There is  no obligation on him to conform to an intricateclassification or to go to a Court  of Law whenever he wants  to make a substantial cut ina rate or wants  to increase  it by the smallest fraction.  He  has complete liberty to varyhis charges upward or downward  as he may think appropriate, or in  a word, he is allowedto carry on  his business.  If he  abused his freedom he would lose his -business.   8. The Railways are in the  same position in that they too have  a vigilant public andalert  competitors.  They are equally anxious not to lose business.  They submit that theirsense of responsibility to the public, their  staff and all the interests which they serve is inno danger of being undermined if the restrictions  which impede them are removed.
   9. The Railways claim  that their  record  since amalgamation in their dealings withtraders  and trading bodies  entitles them to be regarded as pursuing an enlightened andbroad-minded policy in  all  questions of merchandise charges.  They respectfully submit that the  consideration  of  their  present  proposals  should be  undertaken  against  this background,  and they should not be exposed to the suspicion that they  will abuse thefreedom for which they  are asking.   10.  Leaving aside the record of the  Railways and the confidence which, we believe, ithas created in the minds of the trading public, we submit-that if it should prove that thisconfidence has been misplaced, effective means exist by which Parliament could bring themto a sense of their shortcomings.   11.  The Minister referred especially to the case of the  Heavy Industries.  He expressedthe view that in relation to these industries the Railways might still exercise something likemonopoly powers, and  he indicated that it would be desirable  to  consider in their casewhether something in the nature of special safeguards should be  provided, in the event ofthe Railway  Companies&apos; general proposals proving acceptable.   12.  The Railways have  given the matter  careful thought and submit the following considerations :       (i)  The extent of the monopoly possessed by the Railways so far as it can be said          to exist is very hmited.  Neither the Coal Industry nor the Iron and Steel Industry          is confined to rail transport.              Large quantities  of household and industrial coal now  pass by road, and          the radius of  distribution  is  extending, whilst in the case of Iron  and Steel,          large quantities of pipes, structural material, tinplates, etc., are  carried  by road          and in ever increasing volume.      (ii)  Any general attempt  to increase railway charges on  the traffics of the heavy          industries would naturally tend to divert a larger proportion  of  their materials          and output to competing  forms of transport.   The Railway Companies would          not lightly incur  such a risk.     (iii)  Any partial or discriminatory attempt to  raise charges would be exposed to the          same risk over the narrower field affected.  It is doubtful if there is a single firm in          the Heavy Trades which could not increase the proportion of its road transport          in retaliation for any action which it regarded  as  inequitable  on the part of the          Railways.     (iv) The Heavy Industries are efficiently organised and can readily  defend themselves          or  their individual members against unfair  or oppressive action by a railway.   13.  Having regard  to the  foregoing considerations, the  Railways do not feel that anyspecial safeguards applicable to  the Heavy Industries are really  necessary.   14.  The Minister has invited the Railways to specify particular features in the presentsystem  of regulation, as it applies to merchandise charges,  which are felt as exceptionallygalling. The Railways regret that they cannot follow the Minister into this field. They arenot seeking for a little relief which may perhaps help them to keep up  the unequal battlethrough another round ; they are seeking for equality with other forms of  Transport, andthey believe that the sense of justice of the country will support this elementary demand.   15.  The Minister has also asked the Railways to indicate what use they  would make of thisequality if it  were granted.  The Railways are glad of this opportunity of doing so.   16.  In asking for equality in the matter of charges for merchandise,  the Railways haveno scheme in mind for embarking on an increase of rates, either in general or as affecting anyparticular industry ; equally they do not contemplate  making  wholesale  reductions andplunging into a rate war with other forms of Transport.  Their charges will be  known and available to their customers  just like the price-list of any large manufacturer or retail-dealer,and they will be varied in the same way as circumstances  may demand.
 &apos;   1*7. In any action which they may take the Railways will keep clearly before them theadvantage to the public and to the Transport Industry as a whole of a co-ordinated industry.They believe the new conditions for which they are asking, by putting the various competingforms of the Industry on equal terms, will promote this object and not hinder it.    18. They would remind the Minister that this view is supported by previous experience.When the Railways received their  road powers in 1928 the fear was freely expressed thatthey would  use the powers to  embark  on a campaign  of cut:throat competition with theexisting omnibus companies.  Nothing of the sort occurred the Railways and the OmnibusCompanies entered into a friendly partnership, under which a strildng degree of co-ordinationhas been effected, and the public enjoys the most efficient road passenger service in the world.    19. This result was  only made possible by granting the  Railways the right to competeon equal terms in road passenger transport.  The Railways would wish to express the modesthope that similar results may flow from similar causes in the case of freight transport.   20. The  Railways  are conscious that the Minister attaches importance to the objective of establishing some system of rate regulation applicable not only to Road Transport but to theTransport Industry generally.  They  submit that in this direction also their proposals will help, and not hinder, the end in view.      (i) The present  system  of  railway  rate  control is  governed  by  the principle of         Standard Revenue which involves Standard Charges based upon an elaborate         Classification. No such principle is applicable, or could be applied to  other  forms         of Transport.  It would  therefore  he  impossible to  apply the same system of         control to Transport generally.  While the existing system of railway rate control         continues the hope  of  unified control  could hardly be  realised.  This  is an         important factor in  the  proposal which the  Railways  have  submitted  to         the  Minister.      (ii) The co-ordination between Road and Rail,  which  in the view of the Railways is         likely to advance more rapidly as the result of equality of conditions between the         two forms of Transport, will of itself help powerfully towards the establishment of         a  uniform system of control  since it pre-supposes some considerable measure of         agreement on equivalent rates  and charges.     (iii)  The larger and.more responsible road concerns are anxious to assist the Minister         but their efforts are defeated  by a less responsible section who see their salvation         in maintaining a completely free hand.  When the Railways are put in a position         of equality  with road hauliers the possibility of competition will make them more         willing to see the need of conforming to a general  rates structure.   21. In general, the Railways feel  that their proposals, by conferring equality on all the -competitors in the Transport Industry, will contribute substantially towards the achievement of co-ordination and regulation in the Industry, but it is not possible at this stage to outlinethe precise form which  the ultimate structure of rate control should take.  At the presenttime road rates and charging practices appear to be too fluid and too disparate for any formof control to be made effective within a reasonable time.   22. This memorandum  can only deal with the leading issues involved in the proposals made by the Railways. Doubtless many other important questions will  emerge from then-consideration.  The Railways submit however that these can only usefully be considered when the general principle of de-restricting the Railways, in respect of their charging powers for  merchandise, has been accepted  as desirable and urgent.    23. The  Railways would therefore respectfully ask the Minister to inform them whetherthe broad proposals which they have  put forward  are approved by the Government for urgent action.PllINTED 13Y OEO.

The nature of the Companies&apos; proposals is explained intwo memoranda submitted to the Minister by the Railway Companies&apos;Association, and copies of those memoranda are transmitted herewith(Annexes A and B).          The Minister would be glad if the Council would take thematter into very early consideration and report to him asexpeditiously as possible under the following terms of reference:-          &quot;To consider the memoranda which have been     submitted to the Minister of Transport by the     Railway Companies&apos; Association in connection with the     proposal of the Main Line Railway Companies that the     existing statutory regulation of the charges for the     conveyance of merchandise traffic by railway,     together with the requirements attached thereto,     including such matters as classification, publication     and undue preference, should be repealed and to make     recommendations.&quot;          In transmitting this matter to the Council the Ministerfeels that it may be of assistance to them to learn that, as atpresent advised, he is inclined to the view that in existingcircumstances there is, prima facie, a case for some material
9 9- 2 -relaxation of existing statutory regulations,  provided that due regard is had to the ultimate objective of the co-ordination ofall forms of transport.The Minister would ash the Council,  in framing their recommendations,  to consider particularly and advise him --     (a) whether in their opinion the whole of the          existing statutory provisions relating to          the charges for the conveyance of merchandise          traffic by rail should be repealed:;  or     (b) vriiether, while retaining the broad outline of the          existing position, certain provisions should  be          repealed or modified.;     (c) in either case, what (if any) safeguards would be          desirable for the protection of other interests.          In the hope that it may assist the Council in their consideration of these three points, the Minister has indicated on theattached document (annex) the main features of the existing statutory provisions relating to charges which, on a preliminarystudy, would appear to be affected by the railway companies&apos; proposals,I am, Sir .Your obedient Servant,(SGD. )  LLEONARD BROwETT.The Secretary,   &apos;The Transport Advisory Council.
