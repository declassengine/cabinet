THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  December 1938.SECRET.                                                         Copy No.CP. 286 (38).CABINET.REGULATION  OF IMPORTS OF  MUTTON  AND  LAMB.          Memorandum by the Minister of Agricultv,re and Fisheries.     I HAVE to bring to the notice of my colleagues the present serious depression in the sheep industry in the United Kingdom.  In the past few months, both the Secretary of State for Scotland and myself have received frequent representations on this subject from members of Parliament, agricultural organisations and from individual farmers, on behalf of producers in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland and as recently as the past fortnight we were strongly urged by  three representative  deputations to  take immediate  action to  relieve  the  present situation.     2.  Following  upon the severe slump in the prices of all classes of live-stock in 1932, there was a striking recovery in prices of home-produced  sheep and lambs when  the arrangements for  controlling  mutton and  lamb imports agreed upon at Ottawa came into operation, and  the  price position continued to be generally satisfactory until the autumn of 1937.  From that point prices have experienced a sharp decline until in June of this year they were over 30 per cent. lower than in the year, and had fallen to the depression levels of 1932.  There has been no further serious decline in  price levels in England  and Wales since the end  of June, but there is likewise no sign of a recovery.  In Scotland, on the other hand, prices of fat sheep continued to fall until mid-November, since when the usual seasonal improvement seems  to have started.   There  is no doubt that the state of the  sheep industry  at  the present time is one of  acute  depression. Whereas in 1936 and  1937 the price index for sheep coincided with the general agricultural  index  at  80  and 90 respectively,  by October 1938 the  sheep  index had  fallen to 64 compared with the general index of  82, while in earlier months the discrepancy was even wider.     3.  Sheep form a vital  part of the farming  enterprise.  In mountainous grazing districts, such as Wales, North England, and  in a large part of Scotland, the  profitability of agriculture is  almost entirely dependent on sheep values. Moreover,  in a number of arable districts,  particularly on the light lands  of Eastern England, the farming system is largely based on sheep and barley.  The severe fall in barley prices in recent months has accentuated the seriousness of the position in these areas.     4.  The  Governments policy for  agriculture in  relation to defence, which is to preserve and increase the fertility of our farm lands in preparation  for any call  that might have to be made on  them in an emergency,  is largely dependent on a prosperous sheep industry.    An essential counterpart to  the  increased application of fertilisers  that  is encouraged  by  financial  assistance under the agriculture Act, 1937, is that the land should  carry an increased head of stock.For the purpose of  stocking, sheep have important advantages over other classesof live-stock on very many holdings, and the Governments encouragement of land fertility is  damnified by unprofitable  prices  for  sheep.   Whilst the subsidypayments  to  producers under  the  Agriculture Act,  1937,  in respect of  their      [18340]                                                      B
purchases of lime and b j,sic slag in the past season amounted to some  1^ millions,it has been estimated that the present depression in the sheep industry represents a decline in values, if applied to the total sheep  population, of the order of 15 millions.  &apos;   5.  The Government&apos;s policy  for the assistance  of livestock production isembodied in the Livestock Industry Act, 1937, and in the Beef and Veal (CustomsDuties) Act, 1936.  Protection by tariff could not suitably be provided for the sheep industry, since less than 20 per cent, of our mutton and lamb imports comefrom foreign sources.   Moreover, freedom from duty is guaranteed in our  trade agreement with Argentina.  A subsidy for sheep on  the lines of the cattle subsidyhas  been strongly advocated  by the National Farmers&apos;  Union, but,  apart fromother objections, it would be very difficult to  administer, and, in  answer to questions in Parliament, I  have  consistently refused to contemplate such  a remedy.  Regulation of imported supplies is &quot;the method chosen by the Govern-ment for the protection of the sheep industry;  and powers have been provided under Section 11 of the Livestock Industry Act, 1937, to regulate imports fromall sources for the purpose of securing the stability  of the market in the UnitedKingdom.     6.   My colleagues will recall that, at the Ottawa Conference in 1932, in orderto counteract the general  collapse in all sections of the meat market, programmes of imported supplies from foreign countries were arranged and  incorporated inthe Ottawa Agreement.   The programme  for  mutton  and lamb provided  forprogressive quarterly  reductions in imports from foreign sources until a level of65 per cent, of imports in the  Ottawa Standard Year had been reached. Importsfrom foreign countries are still regulated at this level by Order under the ottawa agreements Act, 1932.  Under the Anglo-Argentine Trade Agreement of 1936,the United Kingdom  Government reserved the right to  impose a further cut of10 per cent, in 1938,  but  thereafter is  free to make such  further reductions asmay be necessary or expedient.    7.   Under the Ottawa Agreement with New Zealand, it was agreed that the objective of United Kingdom policy should be to raise the price of meat to  aremunerative level and progressively to increase the share of the Dominions inthe United Kingdom market.  New Zealand agreed that her exports to the UnitedKingdom of mutton and lamb in 1933 would be  at the same level as in the OttawaStandard Year, and that the increases  in each of the two succeeding seasonswould be limited to 5  per  cent.    8.   The  Ottawa  Agreement  with Australia stated  the objectives of  theUnited Kingdom policy as, firstly, to secure the development of home production,and, secondly, to give to the Dominions an expanding share of imports into theUnited  Kingdom.  In consideration of  the  cuts  agreed to be  imposed  uponimports from foreign sources,  Australia agreed to limit her exports to the UnitedKingdom in 1933 to the quantities exported in the Ottawa Standard Year.    9.   The United Kingdom Government became free to  regulate imports fromDominion sources after June 1934.   In fact, however, no  regulation has so far been imposed,  but  estimates  of probable imports  have been  provided by  theDominions from time to  time on which import  allocations have been arranged.Thus in 1936 Australia  agreed to an allocation of  1,750,000 cwts. and NewZealand one of 3,900,000 cwts. These allocations were renewed for 1937, and, inview of the reduced home supplies in that year,  allocations were later increasedto 1,900,000 cwts. for Australia and  4,010,000  cwts. for New Zealand. For thecurrent year, following discussions with representatives of  the Dominion Govern-ments, we have accepted their  revised estimate of joint  imports of 5,500,000  cwts.,which appears likely  to be realised.  This figure is the same as actual imports in 1937.    10.   Whilst, for various  reasons, imports  from New Zealand have shown aslight decline since Ottawa, there has been a substantial increase in imports from australia; and total Dominion imports in 1937  were  450,000 cwts. heavier thanin 1933, an increase of 9  per  cent.  The already dominant position of Australiaand  New Zealand in  the mutton and lamb market  has been accentuated by the drastic cuts on imports from foreign countries imposed at Ottawa;  and in 1937the two Dominions together supplied over 80 per cent,  of total imports of mutton
 and lamb into the United Kingdom.  The problem of mutton and lamb imports is, therefore, essentially an Empire problem, and no substantial relief to the home industry  can be anticipated from measures  affecting imports  from  foreign countries alone.     11.  In view of the serious position of the sheep industry, and the Govern- menfs declared policy  for its  assistance  by the regulation of imports,  I have, during  recent months,  been subjected to increasing pressure, both  from the agricultural  community and from Government supporters  in  the House of Commons, to regulate imports by Order under the Livestock Industry Act, 1937. The arrangements so far made with the Dominions, as described in paragraph 9 above, mean, in  effect, that the Dominions have sent all their available supplies to this market; any reduction in supplies that may have occurred has been purely fortuitous and not due to any conscious control of  the  quantities of exports.. Whilst arrangements of this nature may have been  defensible in the years when the home sheep industry was enjoying a period of  comparative prosperity, they &quot;clearly cannot be justified at a time when  the market is over-supplied and prices to the home producer have fallen below economic levels.     12.  It has become clear  that  the existing arrangements do not secure the confidence in the market that is essential to the welfare of the industry.  Both the Board of Trade and the Dominions Office have expressed agreement with this point of view, and inter-departmental discussions accordingly took place during August and September of  this year to consider what new arrangements should be made  for the control  of imported supplies.  The only alternative that emerged to the compulsory regulation of imports under the Livestock Industry Act, 1937, was the formation of a commodity council to regulate imports of mutton and lamb on  the same lines as imports of beef are regulated  by the Empire Beef  Council and the  International Beef Conference.     13.   My colleagues will remember that in accordance with their decision.oh the  6th  July  (Cabinet  31  (38), Conclusion 13), I  announced  in  the  House of Commons the Government&apos;s general support of the resolutions adopted  by the Empire  Producers&apos;  Conference at  Sydney  in  March 1938; -  that: the  orderly marketing of primary  products  was desirable and should,  where  possible, be secured by a conference of producers in the various  countries concerned.  This principle received  the approval of United  Kingdom and  Australian  Ministers in the Memorandum of  Conclusions issued after the recent trade discussions.  In pursuance of this principle a despatch was accordingly sent on the 4th  October last to the Australian and New Zealand Governments, inviting their co-operation in the formation of a producers&apos; commodity council  for  regulating supplies of mutton and lamb to the United Kingdom market as from  the beginning of 1939. Copies of this despatch and of the replies of the Australian and New Zealand Governments are attached as Appendices I, II and III to this memorandum.     14.   It will be seen that, whilst the Australian Government is prepared to accept in principle the control of supplies by a commodity council, provided it is limited to Empire countries only, the New Zealand  Government has rejected the proposal out of hand.  With my concurrence a further telegram (Appendix IV) has been sent  to the New Zealand Government urging them to reconsider their decision; but in the light of the views on commodity councils frequently expressedby the New Zealand Minister of Commerce, and reiterated in the New Zealand telegram, I am not sanguine as to the results of this further approach.     15.   The situation of the home sheep  industry brooks of no further delay inthe application of measures to restore confidence.  There has been an increasingvolume of criticism in the House  of Commons of the  Governments agricultural policy, and particular reference has been  made to the alleged inaction of the Government with regard to the difficulties of the sheep industry.  It is essential that I should  be able to announce  at the earliest possible  date  the measures theGovernment proposes to take with regard to imports of mutton and lamb during 1939. Should the further approach to New Zealand fail to secure agreement onthe formation of a commodity council, the only alternative remaining would bethe compulsory regulation of all imports under the Livestock Industry Act, 1937.     16.   The principles adumbrated at Ottawa, and referred to in paragraphs and 8 above, were that the home producer should have the first place in the home      [18340]                                                    B 2
market, and  that the Dominions should be entitled to  an increasing share ofimports into  the United Kingdom.  The former principle  was reasserted in theMemorandum of Conclusions issued after the trade discussions last summer withAustralian Ministers.  The cuts imposed on foreign imports after Ottawa havegiven to the Dominions the increasing share of imports to which they are entitled,but there is nothing in our agreements with the Dominions that would entitle themto an absolute or continuing increase in the volume of their exports to the UnitedKingdom; such an increase might well conflict with the right of the home producerto the first place in his own market and, in  fact, would inevitably lead to acontraction in the home output.  The 1938 agricultural returns show an increaseof over 1 million  head  in&quot; the sheep  population of the United Kingdom, andthere has been a substantial increase  in the marketing of home-produced sheep and lambs in recent months..  It is not possible to  maintain  a profitable market for this rising home production, and at the same time to allow the continued expansion of Dominion supplies in the United Kingdom market.  Some limitation on Dominion imports must clearly be  imposed, and it is essential that the home producer should know well in advance the extent of that limitation and that thelevel fixed will not be exceeded.  Such  a regulation would in no way conflict withthe policy agreed with the Dominions, nor, so far  as I am  aware, would it be inconsistent  with  the treatment  accorded to United  Kingdom  products inAustralia and New Zealand.     17.  In the  circumstances, and assuming  that the  further  approach to theNew Zealand Government does not secure a favourable response  to the formationof a  commodity council, I ask for the authority  of the  Cabinet to  the issueforthwith of an Order under Section 11 of the Livestock Industry Act, 1937, witha view to the regulation of imports of mutton and lamb from all sources  as fromthe beginning of 1939.  Such an Order would, as in the case of the existingOrders under the Agricultural Marketing Acts relating to bacon and potatoes,be in general terms, and would allow for variation in the quantities to be imported from time to  time in accordance with  the needs of the market.     18.  The Secretary of State for Scotland is in agreement with the proposal in this memorandum.                                               (Initialled)      W. S.

APPENDIX I.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA (No. 331)/NEW ZEALAND (No. 298).Sir/My Lord,                              Downing Street, October 4, 1938.    I HAVE the honour to state that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom have had under review the present position of mutton and lamb produc-tion in  the United Kingdom, the  general situation of which has been causingrecurrent  anxiety  for several years, and particularly  in the present  year whenthe economic position of the industry has become increasingly serious.   It will beremembered that in 1932 the price of mutton and lamb  in the United Kingdomfell to a point  which led His  Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Commonwealth ofAustralia and in New Zealand to agree, during the course of the Ottawa Con-ference, to limit their respective imports into the United Kingdom during 1983to the quantities imported during the year ended the 30th June, 1932, in con-sideration of action  on the part of His  Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom  to impose  reductions upon imports of mutton and  lamb from foreigncountries upon  a progressive scale which reached  a maximum of 35 per cent, bythe second quarter  of 1934 and has since  remained at that level.    2.  Imports of mutton and lamb from foreign countries represented in 1937only 19 per cent, of  total imports and only about 11 per cent, of total supplies on the United Kingdom market.   It is-therefore clear  that the problem of main-taining the United Kingdom market for mutton and lamb  at a reasonable level is mainly one between the United Kingdom, on the one hand, and the Dominionsconcerned,  namely, Australia  and  New Zealand, on the other.  The level ofsupplies has  consequently been the subject of consultation between the UnitedKingdom  Government and  the Governments of the Dominions  concerned eachyear  since the 30th June, 1934,  when the  Ottawa  guarantee  of  freedom ofDominion meat from quantitative regulation expired.  Programmes of imports were  accordingly  fixed for 1935-36-37 in consultation with Australia house and the New Zealand Government Office, and in some  cases with  dominion ministers who were  in London for other negotiations.    3.  Until the  autumn of 1937 the prices realised under these arrangementsfor home-produced mutton and lamb were fairly  satisfactory, but after that point prices  of home-produced mutton  and lamb began to fall  steadily.   Thefall has been  accentuated during the present year with the result that  prices have  receded approximately to the slump  level of 1932.  Concurrently  there hasbeen  during the past two years a steady increase in the United  Kingdom sheeppopulation.  Accordingly representatives of  the  two Dominions concerned [to commonwealth] (Mr. MacDbugall, Mr, Tinney, Captain Heywood and Mr. Morris,with  Mr.  Fisken when available,  in the case  of  Australia),  [to New  Zealand](Mr.  Forsyth, Mr.  Cockayne and Dr. Campbell, in the case of New Zealand) [to both] have been called into consultation on several occasions during  1938 witha view  to such steps  being taken as were possible to bring about an improvementin the price position of home  supplies.   In the event, the  original estimates ofsupplies from both Dominions for the current production year have been reducedwith  the result that  no great increase in imports during 1938 over those during1937  now seems probable.    4.  The  sheep population  of the United Kingdom has increased by over1  million,  or  more  than  4 per  cent, in  the past  year.  This increase,  which follows a normal cyclical upward trend,  is also due in  part to the encouragementrecently given to sheep production under the Agriculture Act, 1937, as a meansof increasing land  fertility in preparation for the calls that might have to be madeon agriculture  in an emergency. Serious as the economic position of  the  UnitedKingdom sheep industry has already  become, it appears,  therefore,  likely tobecome  even more  serious in 1939.  It was therefore decided to prepare  in con-sultation with representatives of Australia House and the New Zealand Govern-ment Office a survey setting out  the fundamental facts relating to mutton  and lamb  for the use of  the respective Governments in coming to conclusions on thesubject. A copy of this survey is enclosed.  This goes to show that, on a statistical        [18340]&apos;                                                   B 3
basis, United Kingdom production is increasing fairly rapidly, while at the sametime there appears likely to be a concurrent increase in the volume of production for export in the Dominions.    5.  The  policy of the  United Kingdom  Government for safeguarding thehome sheep industry was announced in 1936, prior to the introduction of the Live-stock Industry Bill (now the Livestock Industry Act, 1937).  Assistance by meansof a tariff on imports from foreign countries alone is not possible, since the pro-tective effect  of a tariff on the small proportion of imports coming from foreigncountries would be slight.  Moreover, freedom from duty  is guaranteed in theUnited Kingdom Trade Agreement  with-the Argentine.  Further,  a  subsidy formutton and lamb on the lines of the beef subsidy would be impracticable. Regula-tion of supplies is the method chosen to. assure to the United Kingdom producerthe first place in the home market to which, as agreed at Ottawa, he is entitled,and accordingly the United Kingdom Government has  taken power, under the livestock Industry Act, 1937,  to regulate imports of mutton and lamb for thepurpose of securing the stability of the markets in the United Kingdom.  Hithertothis power has not been exercised.    6.  So far as United Kingdom  agriculture is concerned, a position of greatdifficulty has now arisen concerning this  matter.  Producers&apos; representatives have invited attention to the fact that total imports of Dominion mutton and lamb rose from 5,043,000 cwts. in 1933 to 5,495,000 cwts. in 1937, and have continued at that level during the current year, while home production is now showing a substantial increase, so that the  total  market is becoming over-supplied.    It has, in fact,become clear that the present arrangements do not secure  the confidence in themarket that is essential to the welfare of  the industry.  Great pressure is thereforebeing brought to bear upon the United Kingdom Government to take immediate action to redress  the situation by  quantitative regulation  under  the  powers conferred by the Livestock Industry Act.     7.  It is appreciated that Dominion representatives have always maintained that the market for imported mutton and lamb is, to a great extent, independent of the market for home-produced mutton and  lamb, and claim  that the fallingprices realised for United Kingdom sheep and lambs this year have not been dueto, and cannot therefore be cured by the restriction of, imports, but are due in.part  to a fall in wool  prices  and in part to  the increased home production of mutton and lamb.  In support of their argument  they have pointed to the factthat, while the prices of the home product have been falling this year,  the pricesof Dominion mutton and lamb have been firm.  Whatever weight may be attachedto this argument, His Majesty&apos;s Government  in the United Kingdom fear thatthey  cannot accept the view that the question of mutton and lamb imports is not relevant to the matter under consideration.     8.  It is clear that there is considerable difference of opinion as to the degreeof control that would be necessary to safeguard the  home market.  It appears,however, to  the United Kingdom Government that the very existence of these differences of opinion supports the view which they have always taken,  namely, that the whole question of  the control of the supply of mutton and  lamb can most satisfactorily be dealt with on lines similar  to beef,  i.e., by  a  Conference  of producers.   [To  Commonwealth only.]   This course  would,   moreover,  be  inharmony with,the recommendations of the Empire Producers&apos;  Conference  at Sydney, which were  welcomed on behalf  of the Government by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries  in the House of Commons on the 13th July last (see my despatch Circular No. E. 23 of the 26th July).      9.  Accordingly, the United Kingdom Government hope that the Common- wealth/New Zealand  Government will feel  able, in all  the  circumstances, to signify their willingness for the necessary control of the United Kingdom mutton and lamb market to  be  secured forthwith  on Commodity Council lines,  the compulsory  powers of  regulation conferred on the Government by the Livestock Industry Act remaining in  reserve.  It would be for consideration whether, in view of the experience already gained by the Empire Beef Council  and Inter- national Beef Conference in dealing with a kindred problem, the  scope of either or both of those bodies should be enlarged so as to enable them to deal with mutton and lamb as well as with beef, or  whether a separate organisation should be created.
 [To New Zealand only.]    10.  It is recognised that  during his visit to the United Kingdom in  theearly part of 1937 Mr. Nash accepted, on behalf of the New Zealand Government,the principle of the International Beef Conference on the understanding thatmutton and lamb were  to be dealt with directly  between the United Kingdomand New  Zealand Governments, but, in  view of the  situation which  has now arisen, it is hoped that the New Zealand Government will feel able to reconsider their  attitude in this matter.  The position has, to some extent,  altered since then, both in the light of the  successful operation of commodity council  arrange-ments for beef, and of the subsequent serious fall in the price  realised by UnitedKingdom mutton and lamb.[To Commonwealth only.]    10.  Action along these lines would be in harmony with paragraph  10 of the&quot;Memorandum  of  Conclusions&quot; (Cmd. 5805) issued in July after the TradeDiscussions between representatives of the United Kingdom and of the Common-wealth Governments, in which reference is specifically made to the great benefitof the co-operation of producers along the lines of the Empire Beef Council and international Beef Conference in relation to other commodities.    11.  In conclusion,  His Majesty&apos;s  Government in the United Kingdom feel strongly that, from the point of view of safeguarding the United Kingdom sheepindustry, a very early decision in this matter is necessary.  They would thereforebe glad to receive the views of the Commonwealth/New Zealand Government by telegram at the earliest  possible date.   They are particularly  anxious to be in aposition to announce the conclusions reached by November, when the UnitedKingdom Parliament will be in session.    12.  A similar despatch  is being addressed to the  New  Zealand/Common-wealth Government.                                                          I have, &amp;c.                                               (Signed)      STANLEY.APPENDIX II.AUSTRALIA.   Telegram from the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, dated            November 4, 1938.- -(Received November 4, 12-10 P.M.)^o. 115.)    YOUR  despatch of the 4th October, No. 331.  His  Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the Commonwealth of Australia appreciate the concern which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom feel at the fall in prices  of home-grownmutton and  lamb, but cannot accept the view that the remedy lies in the curtail-ment of imports of frozen products.  The poor returns of 1931-32 for both thehome-grown and  imported referred to in your despatch  were  due to the heavysupplies of all classes meat relative to purchasing power. The present positionis that home-grown prices  of  mutton and  lamb are falling, whilst importedprices are holding.  This suggests that, as far as the supply factor is responsible,home-grown supplies and not the total supplies are influencing home-grown prices.There seems sound evidence to suggest that,  if material curtailment of importedmutton and lamb were arranged, prices of imports would in the first place advance,but there would  not be corresponding advances in home-grown prices.   high prices of imported mutton and lamb would then probably force the consumer intobeef, with ultimate reduced return for frozen mutton and lamb.   It appears thatthis reasoning, which, of course, is incomplete and only stated very  briefly, is not accepted by  the United Kingdom Government.   This difference of  opinion is, itis suggested, a fundamental  issue and before the Dominions  are asked to imposewhat might be a hardship on their producers it is considered that this issue shouldbe resolved.   The Australian Government agree in  principle with the proposalfor a commodity council, but wish to point out that it seems  unnecessary that an
additional body to those already in existence in regard to meat be formed.  It isfurther suggested that, as the foreign supplies of mutton and lamb are relatively small,  organisation  be confined to Empire,  which means, in fact,  the  UnitedKingdom, New Zealand and Australia.  The Australian Government is preparedtherefore to agree to Empire Beef Council becoming an Empire meat council, itsfunction being extended accordingly on a basis to be agreed upon by participatingEmpire countries.   We are also prepared to agree that a  review of  imports of mutton and lamb in relation to the production of home-grown muttoh and lambbe immediately undertaken by the council and ask that review includes  specificquestion of extent to which the rise and fall of the volume of imports affectingthe price of the home  product and whether  the remedy for home-grown positiondoes not lie in directions other than curtailment of imports.  We should also beglad to know whether the consumer would be represented.APPENDIX III.Telegram from the Governor-General of New Zealand, dated November 9, 1938.                       (Received November 9, 9-2 A.M.).(No. 124.)    HIS Majesty&apos;s Government in New Zealand have  given full considerationto the late Lord Stanley&apos;s despatch of the 4th October, No. 298, regarding mutton and lamb imports and desire me to inform you as follows :      (1)  At the Ottawa Conference understanding between the United Kingdomand New Zealand in regard to meat was set out in a letter  from New Zealandrepresentative to leader of the United Kingdom delegation.   One objective thereagreed upon was that of  &apos;&apos; progressively increasing the share of the Dominions inthe United Kingdom  market.&quot;  The United Kingdom undertook that effectivesteps would be  taken to  secure this  result.  Since that time the New zealand government has co-operated to the full with the United Kingdom Governmentto ensure the regulation of supplies.   This has been achieved by regulations  for shipment and qualitative check on exports.    (2)  In discussions conducted with Mr. Nash in 1936 and 1937 it was confirmed that objectives of Governments concerned included regulated expansion, but  notrestriction of supplies to the consumer.     (3)  At  these discussions Mr. Nash made it clear that New Zealand  was opposed in principle to the suggestion for an International Meat  Conference and agreed  to the institution of Beef Conference only  to  facilitate arrangementsalready made by the&quot; United Kingdom, and not because the  conference  waspreferred as appropriate body to deal with the regulations for beef supplies intothe United Kingdom.     (4)  The question of Commodity Councils in general has not hitherto been&quot;considered by the New Zealand Government.  Neither the New Zealand Govern-ment nor  the New Zealand Meat Producers&apos; Board received an invitation toattend  the  British Empire Producers&apos; Conference  at Sydney,  and both  theGovernment  and the Board are opposed to  the principle  of  the  Producers&apos;Councils.     (5)  While not supporting the suggestion that the Dominion mutton and lambhave been responsible for recent  falling price of United Kingdom  mutton  and lamb, it should be emphasised that New Zealand has not been responsible for  any increase in  the Dominion supplies that has  taken place since the Ottawa year.The respective shipments of mutton and lamb from Australia and New Zealandare as follows :                                                           Yearly                                                       tonnage.                                           ......      74,470                                           ......      65,220                                           .......     81,355                                           ......      89,210                                                         74,805                                           ......      94,125A australia :-    Ottawa standard year    1933 .........    1934 .........    1935 .........    1936 .........    1937 .........

If this had not been done, New Zealand could have reached and exceeded the Ottawa figure in  successive years.  Australia has not  applied a qualitative check.  Grading figures for Australian lamb shipped to the United Kingdom for the twelve months ending the 30th June, 1937,  are :          First quality, 36-48 per cent.,         Second quality,  45-52 per cent.,         Third quality, 18  per cent. New Zealand grading returns for the twelve months ending the 30th September, 1937, are :-         First quality, 73-56 per cent.,         Second quality, 26 - 44 per cent. Whether or not the United Kingdom has exercised its power to regulate imports mutton.and lamb  United Kingdom Livestock  Industry Act,  1937,  the fact remains that New Zealand has exercised control  and reduction of exports, while Australia has increased her shipments without control.     Furthermore, New Zealand in the recent discussions has agreed to increased. shipments from  Australia, but without prejudice to future allocations.     (6) Implicit in despatch under reference is suggestion that the principle of expanding markets for Dominion mutton and lamb is to be abandoned.   If this means that the quantity of New Zealand mutton and lamb sent to  the United Kingdom markets is not to increase or is to be reduced,  it would be manifestly unfair to New Zealand especially in view of the facts set out in the previous paragraphs.  Furthermore, New Zealand  would be penalised for having honoured both the spirit  and the  letter of regulated  marketing undertakings since  the Ottawa Agreement.     (7) The very  basis of New Zealand development has been  the continued expansion of markets in the United Kingdom and expansion  necessary to meet the debt services and an increasing purchase of British manufactured goods.  The mutual  advantages of  this are obvious.  New Zealand  has  a  narrow range of exports,  namely, refrigerated produce and wool.   Apart from wool, mutton and lamb is more important.   A restriction  on this item would be a severe blow to New Zealand, which is the largest supplier. Furthermore, New Zealand&apos;s  ability to absorb any surplus mutton and lamb is limited, her population being less than a quarter of that of Australia.  The same consideration makes  New Zealand the less able to suffer economic setback which would follow restriction of mutton and lamb shipments to the United Kingdom.     (8)  New Zealand Government therefore regret that they cannot accept thesuggestion put forward in despatch under reference.  They cannot willingly agreeto any suggestion of restriction of  mutton and lamb supplies  to the UnitedKingdom nor accept the proposal for a mutton and lamb conference which would decide the allocations of such supplies amongst the countries  concerned.     (9)  New Zealand Government will gladly confer continuously with  repre-sentatives of the United Kingdom Government for the purpose of determiningmost effective way of marketing of New Zealand supplies of mutton and lamb by regulation.
APPENDIX  IV.Telegram to the Government of Nexv Zealand. [Sent 11 P.M.  November 25, 1938.)NEW ZEALAND.(No. 168.  Important.)    YOUR telegram No. 124 of 9th November.    His Majesty&apos;s Government in the.United Kingdom have given careful con-sideration  to the reply of the New Zealand Government to my predecessor&apos;despatch No. 298 of 4th October regarding imports of mutton and lamb.   We fully recognise that imports from New Zealand are still below those of the OttawaStandard Year and that a high level of quality has been maintained.    It is, however, with the future that we are now more particularly concerned,namely, the prospect that supplies of mutton and lamb from all sources will in thenear future exceed the demand to an extent which will have a serious effect uponthe prices  realised  by the  United Kingdom producers.  The United KingdomGovernment view this situation with considerable anxiety.    As  shown by the  survey of which a copy was enclosed with the despatch of 4th October, it is anticipated that the United Kingdom output will continue toincrease concurrently with an increase in the output of mutton and lamb in bothNew Zealand and Australia.  Already United Kingdom output has increased and the census returns for  1938 show an increase of over  1 million in the sheeppopulation over 1937 which may be expected to add some 200,000 to 250,000 cwts.of meat to the United Kingdom  market in 1939 above 1938 quantities.   It was explained to Mr. Nash in 1936 and 1937  that the United Kingdom market for meat is not indefinitely expansible and  consequently that, in order  that UnitedKingdom producers may have the first  place in the home market, to which he agreed they were entitled, there is not room for unlimited imports from overseas.    The resulting situation is one on which the United Kingdom Government must come to an early decision (particularly  as regards  supplies for 1939)  and eon-cerning which they will be expected to  make an announcement within the nearfuture.   As we have already made clear on previous occasions, we are anxious toavoid, if possible, an  arrangement under which the  responsibility for the regu-lation of the market would rest upon the United Kingdom Government alone, andit is our considered opinion that a Council, somewhat upon  the lines alreadyoperating  in the case of  beef,  would  provide  the opportunity after mutualdiscussion for drawing up a considered plan of action.  Such a Council would notnecessarily be an instrument of restriction but would consider the whole problem with a view to securing an orderly adjustment of supply to demand and of sharingthe market equitably,  with due regard to the prior  claim of the home producer.In fact, the special conditions relating to Australia to which your Ministers have drawn attention, would appear of themselves to point to the value of full and frank discussion by somebody representing all the interests  concerned.    We are, of course, very much alive to the point raised in your telegram asregards the interests of the consumers; but we feel that in the long run the con-sumers&apos; interests are not best served by  excessive fluctuations of supplies and ofprices, or by inadequate returns  to the United Kingdom producers.    In so far as  contents of your telegram are directed to question of compulsoryrestriction  by United  Kingdom of imports of mutton and lamb, we would pointout that it is in the hope that we may be able to avoid the necessity for taking suchaction,  and be in  a position  to  meet pressure here in favour of  it,  that  our proposal for a producers&apos; Council is put forward.  We should certainly have noobjection to the nominee of New Zealand on the Council being regarded as a directrepresentative of the New Zealand Government if that course is desired.    To sum up,  we are most anxious that the problem should be  examined in a spirit of co-operation no less on the part of United Kingdom producers  than of oversea producers and with a full knowledge of all the relevant factors.   Weearnestly hope that in the light of fuller explanations given above your ministers may be willing, on a further review of position, to accept suggestion put forward in the despatch of 4th October.    Should much appreciate a yery early reply to this telegram.
