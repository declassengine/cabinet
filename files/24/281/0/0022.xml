TWENTY-SIXTH REPORT.                   Problems of rearmament, December 1938.     BY our terms of reference we are directed to supervise the preparation of periodical reports on the economic  situation; and  in accordance with  these instructions we now submit the twenty-sixth of these periodical reports.   Thereport represents  the  general  views  of the committee, without attempting toexpress the different shades of opinion held by individual members.     2.  The present report discusses certain of the economic problems raised bythe increases foreshadowed in our expenditure on rearmament.  In particular, itis concerned with  the question of the sterling exchange, to which in  presentcircumstances we attach the greatest possible significance.   We make suggestionsaimed at the strengthening of the position  of  sterling, which  seem worthy of examination.                                  (Signed on behalf of the committee) :                                                      STAMP, Chairman.     Gwydyr House, Whitehall, S.W.1,            December 16, 1938.[18318]
PROBLEMS  OF  REARMAMENT.                 I. The resources available for rearmament.    WE address ourselves in this report to certain economic problems connectedwith rearmament.   These problems differ according to the way in which  the physical resources necessary for the production of armaments are found.  Thepossible alternatives are as follows      (a) An increased use of existing unemployed resources, or a more intensive           use (e.g., through overtime) of resources  already employed.    (b) The diversion  of  resources previously employed on home investment, in           industry,  house building, &amp;c.    (c) A diversion of resources previously employed on the production of goods           currently consumed at home.    (d) A diversion of resources previously employed in production for export, or           the employment of additional resources situated abroad, through an           increase in the adverse balance of payments on current account.    2.   It  is not entirely within the  competence  of  the  Government to  choose between these different sources of supply. Difficulties arise under three headings,namely (i) the adaptation of the resources available to the  particular productionproblem set by rearmament; (ii) the effect of the employment of these resources forarmaments on the balance of payments and  the stability of the sterling exchange;and (iii) the question  of securing the appropriate financial resources without endangering economic equilibrium in  other directions.              (a) Bringing unemployed resources into production.    3.   The potential output of resources at present unemployed  in this countryis very large.  But much of the capital and the labour concerned cannot easily be adapted to the production of the goods required by the armament programme.  Tobring these resources into work on armaments therefore  raises the question ofadaptability  at  once.   Moreover,  any increase in employment  involves some increase in the imports of industrial raw materials and specialised manufactures,and therefore puts a strain upon the balance of payments, the amount depending on the exact nature of the goods required.  A rough calculation suggests  a pro-portion of one in six, so that for every five pounds spent at home one pound wouldrequire to be spent abroad.  In addition, the increase of incomes  involved in theuse of capital and labour previously  unemployed would  give rise to increased expenditure on consumption, and this in turn would give rise to increased incomes in the consumption goods industries.  Part of the eventual increase in expenditureon consumption  would find its way  abroad through expenditure on, e.g., food-stuffs.  Although it is probable that no more than 15 per cent, of  any increase in consumption expenditure would be spent on imported goods the total new incomesgenerated might much exceed the increase in incomes in the armaments industries,so that the relation between new expenditure on imported consumption goods andnew incomes in the armament industries might be substantially in excess of 15 percent.   This could only  be offset by increased taxation  falling on consumption;though the advisability of this clearly raises other issues.   These considerations are not peculiar to an increase in employment to  produce armaments; they are equally valid in  the case of increases in employment, for many other purposes.       (b) Diversion of production  from home investment to  armaments.    4.  A large part of the expenditure on armaments so far has been secured by the use of productive resources  which had been previously  employed on providing for home investment.  This involved only a small degree of industrialadaptation, and put no materially different burden on the balance of payments.
No increase in the general level of incomes resulted; and to have financed such expenditure out of taxation would have had a deflationary effect.  In so far as government expenditure  has  taken the place of an actual decline  in  private investment, the problems  involved have been  at a minimum.  But it would be another matter deliberately  to restrict private investment, unless  there  had developed a degree of labour shortage which is not apparent at present,  If sucha situation were to arise, a system of priority for orders might become necessary,as in most ways preferable to general credit restriction.  (c)  Diversion of production from goods for home consumption to armaments.    5.  The greater part of the goods and services on which consumers&apos; incomesare expended  are not of a character which allows  resources engaged in their production readily to be transferred to armament production. There are, however,exceptions, of which by  far  the most important is  expenditure  on  motor cars.From the point of view of public  finance  the diversion of resources  would haveto be achieved by additional taxation falling on consumers, of a kind which woulddiscourage those  forms of  expenditure which employ resources which might betransferred into  armament production; for  example,  an increase in  the horsepower tax or the petrol tax.  It is fruitless to  estimate what resources could be withdrawn from producing goods and services for consumption in an emergency.It could clearly be very considerable.  But the amount which could  be divertedquickly and without considerable adaptation, calling possibly  for  emergency powers, is comparatively small.              (d) A n increase in the adverse balance of payments.     6.  We do not, of course, include under this heading such an increase in the adverse balance of payments as has occurred this year through the curtailment of demand for our exports of goods and services, following on a reduction in the pur-chasing power of our customers.  What we have in mind is an increase in the adverse balance of payments clue to additional purchases abroad of goods requiredfor the rearmament programme, or reduced exports by those industries which are engaged at home in armament manufacture. An appreciable part of our armamentexpenditure so far has  been achieved in this way.  The advantage of providingfor armaments in this way is that it is by far the easiest  escape from the problemsof industrial  adaptation.  In the early stages of rearmament, which occurred at a time when  our domestic investment industries  were  fully engaged onprogrammes of private capital expenditure, it was possibly the only way in which increased armament expenditure could be achieved without causing considerableindustrial dislocation.  But just as reliance on an adverse balance of payments is the easiest way of avoiding the problem of industrial  adaptation, it brings outin its most obvious form the problem of the stability of the exchanges.  In 1937there was an adverse balance of payments (excluding the  trade in silver) of a littleover  40 millions. This year the adverse balance may be twice that sum, thoughthe increase is largely attributable to the American  depression.  How are thesedeficits to be  financed % Amortisation payments  and  repayments of loans onmaturity  provide us with substantial sums annually with which to finance newforeign issues.  If the process  of foreign issue, or the purchase  of securitiesfrom foreign holders,  out of these receipts were temporarily suspended, we could,for a considerable period maintain  an adverse balance of payments of  50 millions a year without any strain on our exchanges.   Until the readaptation of  Britishindustry to the new conditions of demand caused by armaments is complete, or until the  armament programme itself  is finished, it is  probably desirable to acquiesce  in an adverse balance of payments with the object of  relieving the strainwhich the process of industrial readaptation involves.  During this  period it maybe desirable to revert to the methods in force up to last February to control foreignissues, and to discourage emphatically  the investment of funds  in Americansecurities. When the capacity of  our investment industries has  caught up withthe increased demand now being placed upon them, it may be possible to reverse the process, and to reinvest, through a favourable balance of payments, the sums which we  now  withdraw from abroad.
                       II. Problems  of rearmament.                 (a)  The  problem of industrial  adaptation.    7. ^  There is an absolute limit to the rate at which expansion can be carried through without drawing on foreign supplies.   For the adaptation of industryrequires the expenditure of capital on plant and equipment; and  the industries which produce this plant  and equipment are those which produce armaments.If these industries are occupied on armaments they are  prevented  from makingthe necessary provision for their own expansion.  This trouble was greatest in theearly  stages of rearmament, and was particularly  evident in the pressure on the machine tool industry.  Though the worst  difficulties may have been overcome,the capital equipment of  the engineering industries has not yet been expanded to the degree necessary to cope with  a continuation  of the present armamentexpenditure.   Any  lull in demand, such as that which has  recently occurred,should be  utilised  to expand and improve the technical equipment  of  theengineering and  allied industries:  The future  of our exporting capacity in engineering products  is concerned.    8.  For the rest the problem seems to be (i) of organisation and adaptationto make the existing unemployed resources available for armaments by discussionwith employers and particularly Trades Unionists; and (2) of a system of priority for orders in the investment industries to prevent competition for the  available resources leading to an excessive rise  in costs.  These are technical matters ofthe greatest possible  importance and we doubt whether it is  possible to make progress without tackling  them.  But they  are beyond the scope of this report,which is concerned, not with the  armament programme itself, but some of its economic reactions.                (b) The balance of payments and the  exchange.    9.  The balance  of payments is in a sense the key to the whole position.An excess of  demand for foreign  currency may  occur  either  from an adverse balance of payments on current account or  through an outward flow of capital.In the short run the flow of capital is likely to have much more spectacular effects on the resources of the exchange account than  any drain caused  by an adverse balance of payments.   In the long run, however, the movement of capital is apt to follow the tendency to lose or to gain gold brought about by transactions on current account.  For a persistent loss of resources on current account underminesthe confidence  of holders of short-term sterling balances in  the  ability of the monetary  authorities  in this country  to maintain the sterling exchange at its existing level.    10.  The position of  sterling depends  on the extent of our  available gold reserves in relation to, first, that part of our adverse balance of payments on current account which cannot be met by the reduction of our  long-term capitalassets abroad, and, secondly, to the sterling balances in this country which mightbe transferred abroad in the case of mistrust of sterling developing.    11.  Our gold reserves are large; fully sufficient  if we had to take  accountonly  of the  adverse  balance of payments  in  the next three  or  four years on current account.  But they have been  entirely  accumulated through short-term capital movements which may be reversed.   It is the combination of a continuingdrain on current account with a sudden drain on capital account which wouldbe dangerous.     12.  The greater part of our  present gold reserve  has been  acquired  sincethe beginning of 1932.   Between that date and the end of 1937 we  had an aggregate adverse balance of payments estimated by the  Board of Trade at about 80 millions.*  Moreover there have certainly been heavy British  purchases of american stock exchange securities in the period, hardly less than  50 millions.In the same period, according to  Sir  Robert Kindersley&apos;s estimate, repayments of foreign loans have  exceeded new issues by about  50 millions. Thus operations on current account and in respect of long-term investments together would, in theabsence of short-term capital movement, have resulted  in a loss of gold in the    * Excluding net imports of silver, which probably represent a transference of  stockswithout a transference of ownership.
period, if the Board of Trade&apos;s  estimate of  the  current  account balance is accepted.  This  estimate may, of course, persistently  understate  our  currentreceipts  from abroad.  In any event, the inflow of short-term money in the six years was at least large  enough to finance our actual gold  acquisitions.  Thisshort-term money came from three  sources, namely            (i)  the liquidation of British commercial balances abroad,          (ii)  the increase in sterling area balances in London, and         (iii)  the inflow of refugee funds.The position has  potential dangers,  not  less than those   discovered  by  theMacmillan Committee shortly before our  departure from the gold standard.     13.   In spite, therefore, of the apparent strength of our reserves, we cannotregard the position of sterling as unassailable.  A series of  adverse balances ofpayments which  led  to a substantial loss of gold might set  in motion  a  with-drawal of short-term funds  from London  which  would quickly  exhaust  theresources available to meet it.  If that were to occur, not only might we have toconsider protecting the sterling exchange by the most stringent and unsatisfac-tory forms of exchange control, that is to say,  exchange control which  appliedto foreign^as well as  to British capital, but also it would be  necessary to confineBritish purchases abroad strictly within the limits set  by our current  receipts from abroad.  This would be a serious handicap to the rearmament programme,for, in so far as we can import armament goods, we  can  escape from some of themost difficult problems of industrial readjustment.  If Ave were in a position to ignore the increase of imports due to increased employment, and the loss of exportsdue to resources being otherwise employed at home, our freedom would be greatlyincreased. It is therefore desirable to do  what is possible to improve the adverse balance of payments before an  emergency arises.                       (e)  Problems of public  finance.     14.   A large budget deficit, even though it does not directly affect our balanceof  payments,  may constitute an additional  source of weakness to  the  sterlingexchange.  At the same time, to attempt to raise too substantial a proportion ofthe money needed to finance rearmament by raising the level of taxation may have seriously  deflationary consequences internally, leading to  unemployment, and areduction in taxable incomes, with repercussions on the yield of taxes.     15.   The deflationary effect of taxation to meet armament expenditure arisesbecause of the strain on the capacity of  the investment industries.  At presentthese industries are not capable of producing simultaneously the goods requiredby the Government, and the goods required, in conditions of normally good trade,for ordinary industrial replacement  and new investment, and for  export.   Inview of  the urgency of government demand, output of other goods has  to be restricted, e.g.,   by  a  system  of  priority  for government orders;  and  thismeans that some part of the  depreciation funds of  industry remain  unspent,that there is a falling off in the outlet for  savings provided by industry, andan  increased adverse  balance of payments.   Indeed, we have  seen above  thatour  rearmament has already been  associated  with  such   reactions.   In  sofar as this is the case, no new incomes  are generated  in this  country by  the armament programme. In these circumstances, if this  programme is financedbeyond  a  certain  degree  by  taxation,  consumers&apos;  incomes are  diminished,unemployment results, and the repercussions of armament expenditure on  thestandard  of living is greater than is necessary having regard to the productive resources available in this country.     16.  When the investment industries have so expanded under the stimulationof armaments demand that they can meet this demand, together with the  demandfor home investment and for exports, a larger proportion of armaments expendi-ture may be met by taxation  without deflationary  consequences.  Eventually,indeed, the level of taxation must be high enough to maintain our armed forces attheir ultimate level and to meet the charges on new debt created.  But during theprocess of transition it may notTbe possible to raise  so much of our expenditure bytaxation as this criterion would suggest.
     17.  The danger of reliance on loan finance is not so much that it will inflateincomes, as that it will require sources of savings to be tapped which are not easilydiverted into government securities.   The competing  outlets for new  savingsare (i) ordinary shares and domestic securities bearing a relatively high rate ofinterest, and  (ii) foreign securities  of  all kinds.  As far as domestic securitiesare concerned, the danger is not pressing.   The immediate danger is that the cashexpended by the government on armaments should not return to the governmentin the form of subscriptions to new loans, but should be  invested in foreign, andespecially American, securities.  In this event, an efflux of domestic capital would add to the other problems of maintaining the exchanges.  To avoid this result,which,  if the exchange showed  signs  of weakness, might  grow  cumulatively,measures require  to  be taken to prevent and to offset domestic  purchases offoreign securities.  So far as we. rely on loan expenditure to finance rearmament,we are compelled also to consider how the normal flow of capital can be  directed to strengthen government securities.  We would rather see that than a deflationarylevel of taxation.               III. Some remedial measures  for  examination.     18.  After the question of  readapting industry,  the central  problem  ofrearmament  is the maintenance of the sterling exchange.   Measures  must  betaken both to improve our balance of payments on current account, and to promotean inflow,  and discourage an outflow,  of funds on capital account.   We  makebelow a series  of suggestions which we believe deserve  examination from  thesetwo points of view.     (a) Measures to improve the  balance  of payments  on current account.     19.  We can improve our balance of payments  on current account either bystimulating our exports or by contracting  our  imports.  We attach the greatest possible importance to the stimulation of exports because  there are large resources available to provide exports, not readily adapted to other purposes.  The recovery in the United States will in itself assist, and we do not believe that the peculiarlydifficult experiences of some of our exporting industries in  the last twelve months will be repeated next  year.   If something more  than  this is  required, the alternatives are :       (i) A general reduction in the prices of our exports, to stimulate demand           and improve our  competitive position.   This can be achieved either           by reducing  all British prices, which would require either  a reduction           of wages or  a general industrial  slump brought about by  restrictions           on demand;   or by reducing British prices in  terms of world prices           through depreciation of the currency;  or by  a subsidy  on  exports           financed by additional duties on imports.  The  first method  is clearly           undesirable,  though the reduction of particular prices of  certain key           commodities, e.g., steel, would be useful.   The second method may be           helpful,  as our prices  of manufactured  goods  are at present rising           more rapidly than those of our principal competitors.   But we are           somewhat sceptical of the possible results of such a degree  of currency           depreciation, as under the  Tripartite  agreement and  the  Anglo-           American  trade agreement, is open to us.  Now that a  large  number           of currencies are based on sterling, and much of the rest of the world           conducts its  trade in ways which are little affected by changes in the           exchange value of sterling its effects  would be limited.  A flat rate of           export subsidies financed by an additional flat rate of import duty is           theoretically equivalent to a depreciation of the currency, which would           improve our competitive position relatively to all countries, even  those           linked  to  sterling.   Some of  us,  however,  consider  this device           impractical,  having  regard to  the  large proportion of our imports           which are  either guaranteed free entry or the  duties on  which have           been conventionalised,  as  well  as  likely to provoke  international           retaliation.  -    (ii) Discriminatory subsidies  on exports in particular markets.  A  general           reduction in the cost of exports has  the disadvantage that it  reduces
            the price of some goods which We Would export in any event, without            increasing our sales of them.  But just  as a monopolist can increase            his  gross  receipts by  charging &quot;what the traffic  will  bear,&quot;  an            exporting  country can increase  both the value and the volume of its            exports by adjusting prices to the conditions in each market, i.e., by            particular reductions in export prices.  There is even to-day a good            deal of commercial discrimination in  our exporting  trades, but this            aims rather at maximising the  profits derived from exporting than            at achieving the greatest  possible  value of  sales.   By utilising the            advantage which  we have in  some markets,  through cheapness of            transport or preferential  treatment, to subsidise  trade  in markets            where we  are at a disadvantage, we could extend our trade.   The            problems of organisation involved are formidable but not insuperable.     (iii) The linking of exports with  imports.  This policy covers such compara-            tively  acceptable methods  as  the utilisation  of our  position as the            world&apos;s biggest buyer to extract favourable trade agreements, as well            as the different forms of bilateral trading,  such  as  clearing and            payment agreements,  and pure barter agreements.  We have already            gone a long way  in  the direction of  trade agreements,  though we            have not exploited our position to the full.  The more extreme forms            of barter and  clearing trade are of  less  interest to us, except as            defensive measures, so long  as we can maintain the position of sterling.            For their principal advantage is that they enable a financially  weak            country to take the initiative in expanding its foreign  purchases,           without submitting to the  drain of foreign exchange due to the lag           between  an increase im imports and the consequential expansion of           exports.     20.   In so far as it is impossible to achieve a satisfactory balance of payments on current account by the expansion of exports, we may have to curtail our imports during the  period when our exchanges are  under pressure through the rearmament -ment programme.  There is a danger, however, that such action would react onour export trade, both by reducing the purchasing power of our foreign clients, andby provoking retaliatory  action  on their part.  The alternatives are either toreduce demand for imports by reducing total home demand, e.g.,  by such devicesas a turnover tax or by  reducing the range of exemption  on income tax; orto attack directly the part  of  home demand that results  in imports.  the disadvantage  of the first method is  that as imports represent  not more  than15 per cent, of total  demand, to improve the balance  of payments by  15 involvesreducing home consumption by  100.   To pursue this policy to the extent whichmight be necessary might involve an altogether disproportionate decline in thestandard  of living.  If, as we should  strongly urge, the second  policy were, incase of necessity, preferred, the following &quot;alternatives occur :      (i) Protective measures, i.e., those which aim at the substitution of similar          home produced goods for imported goods.  The scope for such measures          is probably small,  and they would  create new demand at home for          investment  goods, which we wish to discourage.     (ii) Measures to divert home  demand  from imported goods to  dissimilar          home produced goods.  This is really a question of raising the price          of  imported goods till  demand  is  reduced,  and at  the  same  time          preventing  the foreign producer  from securing the  advantage of the          higher price, e.g., by import duties. Measures of this kind would have          to be so devised that exporters would not  have  to pay enhanced prices          for their  raw material imports.  Even so, close attention would  have          to be paid to the repercussions of such measures on our export trade.     (b) Measures to improve the balance of payments on capital account.    21.  The above suggestions relate  to methods for diminishing the burden on the balance of payments brought about by the excess of imports over exports and  by the aggravation of that excess likely to result  from the rearmament programme.  Nevertheless, we should not feel unduly disturbed about  our ability       [18318]                                                    c
to meet any likely adverse balance on trade account, at any rate for some timeto come without the adoption of special measures such as the above, if it werenot for the risk that on  this continuing drain from our resources there  mightbe superimposed a large outward movement on capital account.    22.  It is advisable,  therefore, also to consider measures for retarding oroffsetting such movements on capital account.  Indeed, we are of the opinionthat some  at  least of  the measures suggested below should have priority over those outlined in the previous paragraph.    23.  The outward movements on capital account can take a variety of  forms,and the appropriate remedy depends on which of  them we are aiming at.   Theymay be classified as follows :-      (i)  New foreign issues  on the. London market  and new placings (such as           the recent Woolworth issue) of securities previously in  foreign owner-           ship, which are not offered under official or semi-official auspices for           trade or  political  purposes.  We consider  that the restrictions  on           such transactions  formerly in force should be rigorously reimposed           at once.  The fact  that there may be  occasion for  loans having           specific trade purposes in view, with which we should be most reluctant           to interfere, makes it all the more necessary to restrict offerings  which           do not satisfy  this criterion.     (ii) New issues for the  Dominions, India and the Colonies.  In this case           we think that there should be a strict supervision with  a view to           limitation, and that the authorities concerned should be urged wherever           possible to borrow on their home markets and especially in the United           States.  Indeed, in any case where other facilities are available, efforts           should be made to redeem  loans now outstanding in London and to           replace them by loans elsewhere.  At a time when the Home Govern-           ment needs the London market for its own requirements, it is reasonable           that Empire borrowers should  be asked  to do everything in their           power to satisfy their own requirements otherwise.    (iii)  Direct purchases by British  investors  in  Wall Street.  This  is a case           were requests in the right quarters are likely to be more effective than           direct prohibitions.  We think that British investors should be invited           not to increase  for  the time being their American investments, and that           the Banks, the Stock Exchange and the chief institutional investors such           as  the Insurance Offices and the Investment Trusts should be invited           to co-operate to this end.  The depreciation  of the sterling exchange,           no doubt, operates to  some extent as  an automatic check on such           purchases; since there is a risk  of ioss through a subsequent recovery           in the, exchange.. Nevertheless, uncertainty as to the prospective value           of sterling may also operate the other way.    (iv) The removal from London, or the exchange  for gold,  of  the liquid           resources  of nervous  foreign  holders.   This  is  probably a  large           factor in the  situation.   But  it  is  doubtful  whether  there  are           appropriate financial measures  for  checking it, short of  exchange           control.  These movements depend primarily on  political confidence           and secondarily on the expectations  held  abroad  as to the future of           the sterling  exchange, expectations often more extreme, as a result of           recent continental experience^ than those held in London itself. Unless           and Until we are prepared to impose a  general exchange  control, we           have to let these resources go to the extent they want to-which is a           reason  for  taking  any   available  action  under  other  heads.           Unfortunately, almost any measures taken to protect the exchange are           liable, by indicating nervousness on.our part, to,accentuate this drain.           On the other hand, the amount of such  withdrawals is not unlimited;           and there is probably no means, short of exchange control, of retaining           them in times of stress.  They are a perpetual source of danger which           we are perhaps better without.     (v) Outright  bear speculation against sterling by purchasing, dollars  in           advance of need or by purchase of dollars, cash or forward, as a pure           speculation  with a view to a profit from a subsequent depreciation           of sterling.  We have no evidence that  there is any large-scale action
           of this description.  Moderate transactions of this kind remedy them-           selyes in course of time and may even be the source of a subsequent           support for the exchange.    (vi) Banking and arbitrage balances which have been held in London hitherto           because it has been slightly more profitable to hold them there than           elsewhere.  A few months ago these probably  amounted to a  large           figure, but it is likely that they have been seeping away.  The reason           for this is partly to be found in the increase of the premium on the           forward dollar  which has  lately occurred.  Up to the summer the           return to a foreign  banker from liquid resources used in the London           market was just sufficiently in excess of the  return obtainable on           equally good security in New York to pay for the cost of eliminating           the exchange  risk through hedging them by the purchase of forward           dollars.  Since August the premium on  forward dollars has at least           doubled, with the result that transactions of the above type are less           profitable than before or even unprofitable.   Theoretically  there are           various ways of putting this right, but practically several of them are           objectionable.  In pre-war days the remedy of a higher bank-rate           would probably have been applied in such a case.  To-day the domestic           repercussions, especially on the  gilt-edged market, and the heavy loss           to the Treasury, constitute, in our opinion,  an overwhelming objection           to such  action in present  circumstances;  and  it would be opposed           to  the constantly repealled statements  of policy which  have been           made by  the  Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.           Another method would be for&apos; the  Exchange Equalisation Fund  to           bring down the premium on the forward  dollar by offering forward           exchange themselves on more favourable terms.  This is open, however,           to the objection that it would facilitate speculation against sterling.           There remains the possibility of replacing  the bank-money thus  with-           drawn by direct  borrowing on the part of the Treasury in terms of a           foreign  currency.  We  believe that  this  might  prove  the  most           economical and  advantageous  method,  and  we  recommend  its           consideration.  It might conveniently take the form of the issue  of          , British Treasury Bills and Bonds at a low rate of interest in Canada           expressed in terms of Canadian dollars with an option to the holder           to be paid his capital and interest in American dollars  at a fixed           exchange.   The purchases of the Air Ministry in Canada and some           special arrangements for  the  purchase of  Canadian  wheat  could           furnish a sufficient  pretext for  this.  But in fact the issues might  be           largely taken up  by American Banks and  thus furnish a substantial           and  satisfactory source of funds to the Treasury, at the same time           supporting the exchange and  providing  resources to meet current           outgoings.    24.  We should add that it is a further advantage, and one not to be over-looked, that all these measures would operate to conserve British savings for ourown Governments  new  borrowing  and would thus  facilitate  the problem  of treasury financing as a  whole. We continue to attach vital importance to themaintenance so  far as possible of the gilt-edged market and a policy of  cheapmoney.    25.  We have felt that we could be most useful in setting forth a list of thevarious available remedies without  advocating  any one  in particular to the exclusion of others.  But we desire to emphasise in conclusion our strongly heldopinion that action along one or other of these lines is urgently required and thatthe present position has  potentialities of real danger.Gwydyr House, Whitehall.
