                 BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORYCOUNCIL.                 STATE OF TRADE AT NOVEMBER,  1958.     Summary of reports submitted by the members of the  Board      of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some  cases        with statistical information from other sources).     OVERSEA TRADE.  Imports in November ( 78.0 millions)  showed a decline of  19.2 million as compared with November,  1937.Imports of raw materials and articles mainly  unmanufacturedwere  9.6 million less and imports of food, drink and  tobacco 4.0 million less.  Exports of U.K. products  ( 42,9 million)were  2.3 million less than in November, 1937*     EMPLOYMENT showed a decline between the  17th October  andthe 14th November, partly due to seasonal causes,  It  isprovisionally estimated that at November 14th the number ofinsured persons aged 16 to 64 in employment in Great Britain(inclusive of persons insured under the agricultural schemeand in the classes of domestic employment which becameinsurable on the 4th April, 1938) was 12,258,000.   -This figure was 36,000 less than the figure of employment on 17th  October,1938, and, on a comparable basis, 150,000 less than the  figureof employment on the I5th November, 1937*     RAILWAY TRAFFIC.  In the 4 weeks ended 27th November, 1938railway traffic receipts decreased &quot;by  861,000 or 7.11 per cent.;as compared with the corresponding period of 1937.     SHIPPING.   The freight markets have not improved,  thoughpurchases of wheat from the United States may lead to a betterdemand for freights.  Prospects of freights for the Argentinetrade are a little better.  The Chamber of Shipping index number of shipping freights for November was 122,3 as  comparedwith 127.6 in October 1938 and 162.9 in November, 1937,
                                                          3m     SHIPBUILDING.  Employment for work for the Admiralty isconsiderable anc! prospects are good in the areas which specialisein this work, &quot;but little has occurred to lighten the gloomyoutlook for cargo shipbuilding.  Tyneside has., however,  receiveda substantial order from Turkey for coastal ships.     BANKING..  The average cash held by Clearing Banks was about 1.5 million less than during October,  The deposits fell by 7 million during the month.  The seasonal rise in  bill ratestook place earlier this year than usual.  The rate  rose from17/32js at the beginning of the month to almost 7/8% at the end.In consequence of the withdrawal of foreign balances,  the bankshave not been free buyers of bills for some time.     FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ABROAD.Prance.  Sentiment has improved following the abortive 24 hourGeneral Strike.  Arrangements have now been completed for a5% loan to be issued at 98% in Switzerland and Holland to repay the outstanding 7% florin Bond of the Morrocan Railways whichare guaranteed by the French Government.  The Bank of Francere-discount rate was reduced from 3% to 2^% on 24th November,and there is a general downward movement in rates of interest.Czechoslovakia.  Confidence is returning, though the recentloss of territory is estimated to involve a reduction of 40% in revenue which cannot be balanced by an equivalent reduction ofexpenditure.United States of America.   Business activity experiencedappreciable expansion in November, with the motor car industryplaying a leading part in the upward movement.  The improvedtrend of business was not, however, generally reflected in stock Exchange prices.     ENGINEERING.  Activity was well maintained in November. Thevolume of Government work is gradually increasing but apart fromthis work inquiries and orders have increased only very slightly,if at all.  Exports of machinery in November amounted to 38,000tons valued at  5.1 million, as compared with 40,000 tons, valued at  4.8 million in the corresponding period of 1937.
                                                         (?v n r*     MOTOR INDUSTRY.  New  registrations of mechanically propelled vehicles  in October were 30,915,, a decrease of 2,929 as comparedwith October, 1937.   The  percentage fall was 8.7, as comparedwith a fall of 13,8%  in the year ended September 30th, 1938,compared  with the previous year.   It is estimated that earlyin December, 1938, there were  1,854,000 private cars in use,compared,  with 1,702,704 a  year ago, and 484,000 goods-carryingvehicles  compared with 472,002.   Exports of new complete private cars in November amounted  to 2,913 as compared with 5,303 inNovember, 1937.   There were also declines in exports of chassisfor commercial vehicles and for private cars as compared withNovember, 1937, but there  was  a slight increase in exports of complete  commercial vehicles.     COTTON. The improvement in production and employment inthe cotton industry which  began in September was maintained during November, but  has made  no progress.  The volume of newbuying has contracted but  most firms are more active as aresult of the orders  booked a  month or two ago.  There was littleimprovement in the export  trade, though its prospects are nowbetter as a result of the  Anglo-American Agreement and theagreement with Egypt,     The  index of cotton yarn  output per working day rose from93 in October to 95 in November (1935=100).  In November 1937the index stood at 117 and in  August 1938 touched a low pointof 74.   Most of the  recovery  since August is, however, a normalseasonal movement.     WOOL. The wool textile industry was more active inNovember  than in October;  the figure of machinery activity was79,3 per  cent, as compared with 75.3 per cent, in October and78.8 per  cent, in November, 1937.
     The number of unemployed in the woollen and worstedindustry in the West Riding of Yorkshire fell considerablys  inthe course of November.     Exports of tops declined in November as compared with theprevious month, though exports of yarns and tissues increased.There was practically no change in the level of raw wool prices.     GOAL. The slight improvement in the general industrial position in the United Kingdom had little, if any, favourablereaction on the production and sale of coal.  Steps have, however,been taken to meet any expansion of demand which may take place during the last few weeks of the year.   The improvement which occurred in the export trade in October was not maintained inNovember.  Discussions on the question of an InternationalCartel have taken place and have not been unsatisfactory; itis hoped that they will shortly be resumed.     CHEMICALS. Deliveries of most alkalies and heavy chemicalsshowed decreases in November5 which are partly attributable tospeculative buying in October.   The recovery in the trade indyestuffs of which there were signs at the beginning of October,has not continued.   The market for coal tar products has remaineddull, but there has been a slight improvement in the demand fo,.-wood distillation products, and the demand for pharmaceuticalchemicals has been fairly satisfactory.     TIMBER.  Imports of sawn and planed softwoods amounted to1,591,000 standards in the first eleven months of 1938 ascompared with 2,218,000 standards in the corresponding periodof 1937;  Other markets are likely to show a similar decline in imports.   The demands of the furniture and motor industries forhardwoods are below normal, but the demand from the shoe heeland brush trades is good.     CANADIAN TRADE.  The indices of common stock prices and ofbond prices rose in October.  The fall in wholesale prices whichhas been in progress since -July, 1937, has become less rapid.
     SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE.  The gold mining industry continuesto expand, hut conditions in other export industries are much less favourable.   During the first ten months of the yearreceipts from exports of South African commodities,exclusive of gold, have declined by  9.5 million in comparisonwith the corresponding period of 1937.
