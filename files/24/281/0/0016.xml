          REPORT OF   THE COMMISSIONER FOR  THE SPECIAL AREAS        IN SCOTLAND         FOR THE PERIODist SEPTEMBER, 1937, to 30th SEPTEMBER, 1938
REPORT   BY  LORD   GEORGE   NIGEL  DOUGLAS-    HAMILTON, A.F.C., Commissioner for the Special Areas    in Scotland, for the period from 1st September, 1937,  to    30th September, 1938.To the Rt. Hon. JOHN COLVIIXE, M.P.,     Secretary  of State for Scotland.SIR,   1.  I have the honour to submit this my first Report contain-ing an account  of my stewardship of the Office  of Commissionerfor the Special  Areas in Scotland from the time of my appoint-ment  in September, 1937,  following the resignation owing  to pressure of other work of Sir David Allan Hay, up to the end ofSeptember, 1938.   2.  This is the fifth Report of its  kind to be  issued dealingwith the work  of the  Commissioner for the Special Areas  inScotland since that  Office was set up in December, 1934.  Theprevious Reports have been :    First Report by Sir Arthur Rose for the period 21st Decem-       ber, 1934, to 30th June, 1935  (Cmd. 4958).   Second Report by Sir Arthur Rose for the period 1st July       to 31st December, 1935 (Cmd. 5089).   Third Report Final Report by Sir Arthur Rose to June,       1936 (Cmd.  5245).   Fourth Report by Sir David Allan Hay for  the period 7th       July, 1936, to 31st August, 1937 (Cmd. 5604).   In the present Report these  previous  Reports are referredto as the First,  Second, Third, or Fourth Reports.   3.  During my term of office there has been no new SpecialAreas legislation and I have continued  to operate  under theSpecial Areas (Development and Improvement) Acts, 1934 and1937.   4.  The present Report consists, like  its predecessor, of threeParts.   Part  I  gives  some description of the population and unemployment  position in the Areas, and of  the work of theMinistry of Labour in  relation to training and transference.Part II describes in  some detail the various schemes which havebeen continued or initiated during the year under the SpecialAreas Acts.   In Part III the  salient features of the year&apos;s work are commented upon and the conclusions to which  that work has led me are  described, both in relation to the wider questions
of which the problem of the Special Areas is but one aspect andin relation to possible future development.   5. In submitting  this  Report it is right that I should at thisstage make my grateful acknowledgment of the encouragement and help which I have received throughout the year in my work as Commissioner  from  many persons  whose assistance  and interest have been most valuable.   6. Outstanding for its encouragement and stimulus to every-one  who is working for  the Areas is the tour made by TheirMajesties The King and Queen on the occasion of Their visit to scotland for the opening of the Empire Exhibition on the 3rdMay, 1938.  The tour, which lasted for one and a half days andwas  informal in character, included  visits to the IndustrialEstate  at Hillington, where Her Majesty the Queen opened andnamed the principal roadway &quot; Queen Elizabeth Avenue,&quot;  theIndustrial  Estate  at  Carfin  and  the   adjoining  community service Centre, six large  burghs, Messrs. Colville&apos;s  Steel Works,Clydebridge,   and a variety  of social  welfare  developmentsassisted from the Special  Areas Fund.  I received messagesfrom Their Majesties,  expressing Their pleasure at the successof the  tour,  which was  deeply  appreciated by  the  whole community.   7. This Royal Visit was preceded on the 1st December, 1937,by an  extensive tour made by H.R.H. The Duke of Kent, to alarge number of  Community Service  Centres in the  SpecialAreas, and also the Industrial Estate at Hillington.   The deepinterest in these problems  which continues to be shown by theRoyal Family brings an encouragement which can scarcely beoverstated both to those  who are unemployed and to those whoare  working  in whatever way to  solve  the problems andalleviate the distress in these Areas.   8. To all voluntary workers in the Areas I also express mygratitude.  The Commissioners work must depend  for its suc-cess on the willing and efficient co-operation of others; in manycases this is done on a voluntary basis.   The Industrial Estates&apos;Companies,  the Scottish  Land Development Company,  theScottish  Council for Community Service, the  Governing Bodyof Carfin Hall, the Queen&apos;s  Institute  of District Nursing, theJoint Committee of the Scottish National Union  of allotment holders   and  Society  of Friends,  the  Special Areas  andthe  Second  Scottish  Housing  Associations,  the  MacaulayInstitute  for  Soil Research and the various  local  committees have  continued  their  generous  work, which  has  involved the  expenditure of  much  time  and   energy.  Similarly  theScottish  Development Council,  the  Scottish  Economic  Com-mittee, the Treasury  Advisory Committee, the  Special  Areas
 Reconstruction Association, and the Nuffield Trustees have co- operated loyally in those aspects of their work which relate to the Scottish Special Areas.   9. I am grateful also to the many Government Departments without whose help the Commissioners work could not be done. The variety of that work  during the year is illustrated by the fact that it has been necessary to bring into consultation not  only the Treasury and Scottish Office and the Scottish Departments of  Health, Agriculture and  Education, the Scottish Juvenile Welfare   and After-Care  Office  and the Registrar-General, but also  the Ministry of Labour, the Board  of  Trade,  Home Office,  the  Inland  Revenue  and  Forestry  Commissioners, Ministry of Transport, Scottish Physical Training and recreational- tion  Council, the Office  of Works, Post Office,  Stationery Office,  the Public Works Loan  Board, the  Exchequer  and Audit Department, the Department of Scientific and  Industrial Research, the Mines  Department,  the Committee of Imperial Defence  and the three  Defence Ministries.   Applications for assistance in initiating  public  works  have brought a great volume  of work to   the Department of Health and  I  take this   opportunity  to   thank  them  warmly for  the efficient manner   in  which  they  have  advised me  in all matters referred   to  them.   I  should  also  like to thank  the  Local and other Public Authorities who have had to carry out these works for the spirit of understanding and helpfulness which  they have  invariably  shown.  To  the Ministry of Labour I am  par- ticularly  indebted for their willing assistance at all  times.  I would add that  I have been particularly struck by the calibre of the men who are charged  with the management of Employ- ment  Exchanges in the Areas  and by the sympathetic under- standing with which they  face  the  problems of their work.  I am also deeply appreciative of the work done by all the members of my own department,  often under conditions of considerable stress.   10. I have kept in close contact with the English Commis- sioner and my conversations with him and his Department havebeen most valuable.  Lord Portal and Sir Nigel Campbell have continued as the  Commissioners&apos;  Industrial Advisers to give to me as generously as they gave to my predecessor the  benefit oftheir advice and experience.  Finally,  my work has been mademost  pleasant by the encouragement and help which I have received  from you, Sir, and from your predecessor in the highoffice  of Secretary of State.            I have the honour to be, Sir,                   Your obedient Servant,              (Sgd.)     G. N. DOUGLAS-HAMILTON,                                        8th December, 1938.o 19300A 3

                           PART  I                   SECTION (1)-POPULATION    1. Information concerning the population of the Special Areasin Scotland, estimated by the  1931  Census to be about  1,146,500,was given in some detail in the  Fourth Report, and I need thereforeonly include in this Report appendices showing the further informa-tion which is  available  in regard  to  the year 1936-37, and thefollowing comments on the general trend of population during theperiod to which this Report relates.    2. The death rates in the  Counties of Dunbarton,  Lanark andRenfrew increased during 1937  (as in the case of the whole  ofScotland), while the birth rates for the country and the three countieshave decreased except in the case of Renfrewshire, where the rate was 18-4 per  1,000 as  compared  with  18-1  per  1,000 in  1936.Further details are shown in Appendix III.    3. The population  of  the Counties of  Dunbarton  and  Lanarkhas not materially altered  since mid-1936, small increases of 831and 2,623 (-5  per cent, in each case)  respectively  being recorded.The population  of the  County  of Renfrew,  however,  which  at mid-1937  was  estimated  at 314,244, shows  an increase of  4,862(1-6 per cent.) since mid-1936, a rate of increase which is almosteight times greater than the corresponding increase for the country as a whole.    4. An appendix giving a comparison between the natural and theestimated actual  increase in   the  population  of  the  counties  ofDunbarton, Lanark (excluding  Glasgow), Renfrew and the whole ofScotland as at 1931  and 1936 respectively  was  included in theFourth Report.   The position up to mid-1937 is shown in Appendix IV  of this Report.  The  chief points  of note  are  the influx intoRenfrew County  amounting to 15,740  during the. period mid-1931to mid-1937, making a noteworthy contribution to the  net increaseof  population  in  the  Special  Areas.  This  increase provides  an interesting comparison with the outflow  from Scotland as a wholeduring the same period estimated  at 6,838.  Up to mid-1936,  asindicated in the Fourth Report  (paragraph 14) there had been a netinflux into Scotland since  1931  of  2,854.  Hence  the outflow  is concentrated in the period from mid-1936 to mid-1937.    This outflow from Scotland during the year 1937 is ascribed  tothe falling off in the number of people returning to the country from overseas and to the flow of the industrial population to the southern and midland parts of England.
   5.  The  population  of  the  counties  of  Dunbarton,  Lanark(excluding  Glasgow) and  Renfrew  forming parts  of the SpecialAreas has been reduced since mid-1937 by the effect of the GlasgowBoundaries Order Confirmation Act, 1937.   Exact figures are notavailable but the census of 1931 established the population of theareas annexed fromthe counties as 1,021, 3,182 and 610 respectively.                   SECTION  (2) UNEMPLOYMENT                           General.   6.  The  number  of persons registered as  unemployed  at 13thDecember,  1937, and 13th June,  1938, are shown  in Appendix V.These dates most nearly correspond with those in respect of which figures regarding unemployment were given in Appendix VI of theFourth Report.  Later figures are also given in regard to the insured population.  The recent trend has been as follows  Unemployment between the ages of 14 and 64.Date	Men	Boys	Women	Girls	Total14 December, 1936 .. . 21 June, 1937 13 December, 1937 13 June, 1938	53,085 45,794 52,187 48,388	3,243 2,267 2,494 2,458	8,218 7,558 10,274 10,483	2,959 2,699 3,234 3,106	67,505 58,318 68,189 64,435   7.  It will be seen that at 13th December, 1937, the total numberof unemployed between the ages of 14 and 64 was 68,189; 684 morethan at 14th December, 1936.  The rise was not, however, produced by a slight all-round increase.  In fact, unemployment among menand boys decreased by 1 - 7 per cent, and 23 T per cent, respectively,but these decreases were more than offset by the increases in respectof women  and girls, which  were 25 per cent,  and 9-3 per cent.respectively.   8. If the midsummer figures during 1937 and 1938 are comparedit will be seen that at 13th June,  1938, the number of unemployedbetween the ages of 14 and 64 was 64,435 which (while 23,318 fewer than  at 24th June, 1935,) represents an  increase  of 6,117 (10-5per cent.) on thefigure for 21st June, 1937.  This increase was common to all classes although the increases for women and girls were verymuch heavier than for men and boys.   9. Despite the apparent  all-round  increase in unemployment which is suggested by the foregoing figures  it will  be  seen  fromAppendix VI that  the level of unemployment throughout the yearended June,  1938, was, in fact,  considerably lower than  in theprevious year for all classes excepting women, in  which case therehas been a very marked increase.
m3   10. Unemployment among men and boys in the various countiesincluded in the Special Areas did not materially differ at 13th June,1938, from the position at 21st June,  1937, except in  Lanarkshirewhere unemployment  rose by 2,815 in the case of men and 261 inthe case of boys.  In all counties, however, there was an increase in umemployment  among women and  girls.   Details are given  inAppendix VII.                             Men.   11. The number of unemployed men at 13th June,  1938, was48,388, an increase of 2,594 (5-7 per cent.) as compared with 21stJune, 1937.  At  June, 1938, the number of unemployed  workersbetween 18-64 years of  age  represented  19-9  per cent,  of  theestimated insured workers in that group which is 0-9 per cent, higherthan the corresponding percentage for June, 1937, (19-0 per cent.).The  corresponding  percentages  for  the  rest  of  Scotland were18-5 per cent, and 17-4 per cent.    12. As  will  be seen from Appendix VI, however, the average level of  unemployment - in  the Special Areas during the twelvemonths ended 13th June,  1938, was only 46,827, a drop of 11-3 percent, as compared with the figure (52,802) for the preceding year.It is also significant that at 13th June, 1938, the number of whollyunemployed men between 18 and 64 had decreased  to 37,192 ascompared with 39,522 in June, 1937, a drop of 2,330 or 5-9 per cent.,while the number of claimants who had been unemployed for a year or more decreased from 17,640 to 15,282, a drop of 2,358 or 13-4 percent, (see Appendix V).    13. The position in the six main industries, which, between them,account for a large proportion of unemployment among  men, isshown in the following table : Number unemployedIndustry			Average for	21st June,	13th June,	12 months	1937.	1938.	ended			June, 1938.Building	2,479	2,335	3,108Shipbuilding	4,425	4,262	4,143Marine Engineering	634	573	619General Engineering	1,432	2,162	1,790Iron and Steel	2,223	4,322	2,607Coal Mining	8,631	8,848	7,977Total	19,824	22,502	20,244
   14. Building. Excepting  in  December, 1937, when owing  tobad weather the number of unemployed rose to 6,379, employmentremained  fairly  steady,  and  there  is reason to expect that this position will be maintained.   15. Shipbuilding and  Marine Engineering. There was  a slightbut steady decline in unemployment in these industries during theyear.   16. General  Engineering. Apart  from July,  1937, when  thenumber of unemployed  rose to 2,263,  due mainly to temporarystoppages on account of trades holidays, unemployment remainedcomparatively low until January, 1938.  From then on the position has worsened, one of the main causes being the suspension of workers at a  sewing machine factory which has experienced a falling off inorders owing to the China-Japan war.   17. Iron and Steel. Unemployment in this industry commencedto increase in December, 1937, and became progressively  heavier,the sharpest increases  occuring in May and  June.  The increase,which is fairly general throughout the industry, is probably due toover-production and a slowing down  in rearmament work.   Returnsfrom the British Iron and Steel Federation show that the productionin Great Britain of  steel ingots  and castings amounted  to  only776,100 tons  in June, 1938,  as compared with  1,106,400  tons inJune, 1937.   18. Coal Mining. The number on the live register at 13th June,1938,  was slightly higher than at 21st June, 1937, but the  positionover the twelve months ended 13th June, 1938, compares favourably with that for the preceding year.  There was a very sharp  increasein unemployment in July, 1938, and, although this appears to  havebeen due mainly to the incidence of  the trades holidays, the figuresfor August and September indicate a falling off in employment.This is partly due to a decline in export trade and to  the position inthe iron and steel industry.   19. An analysis, under age groups, of men on the live registerat 3rd May, 1937, and  2nd May, 1938, is shown in Appendix VIII.The decline in unemployment was common to all age groups withthe exception of the 18-20 group and it is significant that,  ignoringmen of 65 years and over, the greatest improvement occurred in thecase of men between 25 and 59 years of age.   This is no doubt dueto the higher proportion, of skilled workers  among the older men.                             Boys.   20. At June, 1938, the number of unemployed boys was 2,458,an increase of  191 or 8-4 per cent, as compared  with the figure atJune, 1937.   As in the case of men, however, the average level ofunemployment  was  considerably lower, the  figures  for  the twoyears ending June, 1937, and June, 1938, being 3,492 and 2,694respectively.
                            Women.   21. There was a very marked increase in unemployment amongwomen, the number of unemployed at 13th June, 1938, being 10,483(an increase of 38-7 per cent.) as compared with 7,558 at 21st June,i937.  While the average level  of unemployment  during the year&apos;ended June, 1938, did not rise to a corresponding extent, it comparesvery unfavourably with that during  1937.  This is largely due to ageneral slackening off in the various branches of the textile industry which employs a preponderance of  women and girls.  The  severeincrease in unemployment among textile workers may be instancedby the fact that in May,  1938, the total number of unemployed workers in the industry was 7,953 as compared with  4,613 in May,1937.                             Girls.    22.  The slackness in the textile trades referred to above has alsoadversely affected unemployment among girls; at 13th June, 1938,the total number of unemployed girls was 3,106, being  407 or 15-1per cent,  higher than  the corresponding figure  for  1937.  Thegeneral level of unemployment during 1937-38 was also higher thanin the preceding year.      SECTION (3) TRAINING AND INDUSTRIAL TRANSFERENCE. Training Facilities.    23.  An account of the Training Facilities afforded by  the Ministryof Labour in Scotland for men, women and juveniles is  contained inparagraphs 33 to 43 of the Fourth  Report.  Reference is made inparagraph 41 of that Report to the possibility of it proving necessaryto establish a Local Training Centre in Scotland.   The development of light industries on the Trading Estates, referred to  later in this Report, has  been such  as to justify the establishment of  a Local Training Centre, which, I  am  pleased  to  record,  the  Ministry of Labour have decided to set up on the Carfin Trading Estate.    24.  The object of the Centre will be to give unemployed mensome factory experience to increase their general  employability. It is not intended to train the men for specific trades or for particular employers, but  to develop their  &quot; factory  sense.&quot;  The  Centre will have a capacity to  allow for the  training  of 50 men at a time, although it wiU be possible to extend the accommodation if the demand justifies the increase.    25. The course at Carfin will be of three months&apos; duration,  and the men will be carefully selected.   They will go initially for four weeks  to the Ministry of Labour&apos;s Instructional Centre  at Glentress, near Peebles, at the end of which time those  most suitable will be selected to go forward to Carfin Local Training Centre.   As the latter
will have a capacity of 50 men and the course will last for threemonths, it means that some 200 men will be trained annually.Industrial Transference.   26. The  figures relating to Industrial Transference up to May,1937, in the case of adults,  and up to July, 1937, in the case  ofjuveniles, were furnished  in  paragraph 44 of the Fourth  Report.The  Ministry of Labour have continued these schemes and for theperiod June, 1937, to June, 1938, 1,959 adults were transferred fromthe Special Areas in Scotland.  Of this figure 875 men and 63 women were  transferred to England and 463 men and  558  women were transferred to non-depressed  areas in Scotland.  Of the men trans-ferred, 383 were from Training Centres.  During the complete yearended July, 1938, a total  of  361 juveniles (211 boys and 150 girls)were  transferred, of whom  196 boys and  19 girls  proceeded  toEngland, and 15 boys and 131 girls to the non-depressed areas inScotland.   27. It will be noted that there is  a great  disparity in the pro-portions of males and females, both adults and juveniles, transferredto England  and non-depressed areas  in  Scotland   respectively.This position arises partly from the reluctance of parents to agree totheir daughters  going so far  from their homes.  They prefer themto be in employment within relatively easy travelling  distance.Furthermore,  there is a  good  seasonal demand in  Scotland for domestic servants both in private service and in hotels, to  whichoccupations most of the girls and women were transferred.   28. Men transferees to England mainly went  to skilled occupa-tions,  e.g. engineering and  aircraft work,  while  those transferredto non-depressed areas in Scotland were predominantly employedon road schemes in unskilled  occupations.  The majority of theboys transferred to England were employed in industrial occupations,while those who remained in Scotland helped to  meet the demandfor seasonal hotel workers.                           PART II.            SECTION  (1) INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT.                  Scottish Development Council.   29. The Scottish Development Council has continued a sustainedpublicity campaign on lines  indicated in paragraphs 45-48  of theFourth Report.  The total grants allocated for  this purpose nowamount  to   43,525.  Out of the funds so  provided stands were taken at the Marine Engineering Exhibition atOlympia in September,1937, and at British Industries Fair, EarFs Court and Birminghamin 1938.  The Earl&apos;s Court  stand was honoured with a  visit  by her Majesty Queen Mary.
   30. I approved a programme of publicity to be conducted bythe Council on behalf of the Scottish Special Areas, which includedadvertisements in certain of the trade and technical press,  andSupplements  of  the Councils Quarterly  Magazine  &quot; Scotland&quot;dealing, in turn, with specific localities in the Areas and the SpecialAreas in general.  The Council has  produced, with my assistance,a brochure of the Scottish Special Areas entitled &quot; Opportunity for industry &quot; for distribution to industrialists generally, at ExhibitionStands and to other persons  and bodies who may be interested.   31. The London Information Bureau, referred to in paragraph45 of the Fourth Report, has continued and developed its activities and has been useful in  attracting many industrial enquirers.   MyLondon  Representative has  maintained  close  contact  with  theInformation Bureau so that  all enquiries  should  be dealt withexpeditiously.   Window  displays  have  been  varied  and  haveattracted considerable attention.    32. The Councils Special Areas  Industrial Information  Depart-ment in Glasgow has continued  its  activities and has been instru-mental in  furnishing the promoters  of many prospective industrialenterprises with  the information  they  required.   arrangements were made for this Department to compile an index of vacant sites and factories in the Special Areas suitable for industrial purposes and photographs of sites  and buildings have been  made availablein many cases.                          Film Publicity.    33.  At the beginning of  1938 the Council, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Scotland,  appointed a Committee, knownas the &quot; Films of Scotland Committee &quot; under the Chairmanship ofMr. Gilbert Archer, J.P., &quot; To promote the production and circu-lation of  Scottish  Films of national interest and to administerfunds for these purposes.&quot;  A sum  of  5,000 for film publicity hadbeen generously placed at the disposal of the Secretary of State bySir John A. MacTaggart.  Of this sum,   1,000 was allocated by theSecretary  of State towards the cost of  construction of the EmpireCinema at the Empire Exhibition while the balance was placed atthe disposal of the Committee as part of the fund for the productionof films.    34. I made a contribution of  1,500 towards the funds of this Committee to enable them to  carry out their initial project of pro- ducing six documentary films dealing with various aspects of the social and economic life  of Scotland, viz. : fisheries, agricultural research, sports, education, economic planning and a general survey film of  Scotland.   I am  particularly interested in the  two latter films which depict aspects of developments in the Special Areas with which I am more immediately concerned, such as the intro- duction of new  industries.  Aspects  of  the Special Areas  work
were also depicted in other films, notably social service and agricul-tural developments.    35. The Committee arranged to show these films at the EmpireExhibition  Cinema simultaneously with their release to  about 800cinema theatres in the United Kingdom.  It is hoped to arrangefor the films to be  shown in the Dominions and possibly in foreigncountries.    36. I was glad to be able to support these ventures believing as Ido in the appeal of  the film as a publicity medium and I am hopeful that lasting benefits to Scotland generally will result from the showingof these films.    37. I also made a contribution of  500 towards the cost of theEmpire Exhibition  Cinema, which in addition to the films mentionedabove  has exhibited documentary films covering numerous aspectsof Home and Empire services.                         Other Publicity.    38. It  was obvious,  however,  that  further publicity wouldbecome necessary in order to  place  the facilities available in theSpecial Areas, particularly those afforded  by  the 1937 Act, clearlybefore  firms contemplating developments.  I  have endeavoured toobtain publicity in a variety of ways.  Statements have been issuedmonthly and press conferences held  from time to time;  I should like to take this  opportunity of thanking the Press for  the readyassistance which they  have given me at all times.    39. In association with the English Commissioner, advertisementhas been  extensively carried out in trade  and technical journals;a letter has been circulated to the members of the London Chamberof Commerce and has been  distributed by the Secretary of eightTrade  Associations to their members.  Several wireless talks havebeen given.  Even so, I am doubtful whether  the  nature of the opportunities  available  at  present  in the Special Areas  is  fully understood  or appreciated.                   Scottish Economic Committee.    40. My  assistance  has enabled this  Committee  to continue its activities as indicated in paragraphs 50-51 of the Fourth Report.Besides several reports dealing specifically with certain light indus-tries, the Committee propose to issue a general report covering  their activities since the  previous report published in June, 1937.    Thefirst part of this report  will be  a review of Scotland&apos;s economic position  illustrated by statistics and emphasising the need for thedevelopment of light industries, while the second part will containstudies on the main Scottish industries and on various questions ofeconomic interest to Scotland.  A report  has been prepared  andwill be issued in due  course on the  Scottish export trades.   It isalso proposed  to conduct an   enquiry  into  the condition of theScottish  Woollen industry.
150   41. The Committee gave evidence before the Royal Commissionon the Geographical Distribution of the Industrial Population whichhas been published (Minutes of Evidence No. 15).  In this evidencethe Committee discussed, among other questions, the position arisingon the prospective termination.of Special Areas legislation and madesuggestions for a more comprehensive and permanent treatment of areas  experiencing industrial  and  economic  difficulties.  Thesequestions are also dealt with in the general report and the committee epropose to keep the position under close study and review.   42. A Sub-Committee, appointed to consider  the question offinance for. new industries, issued a  report, which was adopted bythe  Committee, containing proposals for the  establishment  of  aFinance Corporation  in  Scotland, having as its  main object theprovision of  financial facilities for existing businesses and for the promoters of new industries who are unable to obtain accommodationthrough the usual channels and who could satisfy the corporation of the soundness of their proposals.  It  was recommended that thisCorporation  should  operate  not only  in the Special  Areas  butthroughout  Scotland.  These  suggestions were communicated tothe Scottish Development Council who  accepted them and formed the  &quot; Scottish  Development  Financial  Trust Limited &quot; with  TheRight Honourable The Earl of  Elgin and Kincardine,  K.T., C.M.G.,as Chairman  of the Board of Directors.  The prospectus has recentlybeen issued.  I  welcome the formation of this Company, not only because of the benefits which may be expected to accrue to scotland as a whole, but  because it will  also assist  small undertakings in theSpecial Areas to get on their feet.   43. The Committee have also continued to devote attention torearmament  questions so far as they affect  Scottish industry andhave consistently  emphasised  the  importance  of  government contracts as  a means of providing  work  in the  light  engineeringcategory for  firms in  the Special  or Distressed  Areas which are capable of such work.  They have acted,  and continue to act, as a link between firms desiring to obtain War Office contracts and therepresentative of that Department in Scotland.   44. A list   of  the  Committee&apos;s   publications   is  given  inAppendix IX.                        Trading Estates(1)  Hilling ton   45. Reference was made in paragraphs  52-55 of the  fouth report to the acquisition of a site of about 320 acres at Hillington,near  Renfrew Aerodrome, for development as a Trading  Estate.This scheme  is financed from the Special Areas Fund. The moniesrequired for  its development are made  available free of interestduring the first five years of the estate&apos;s development and thereafter
                                io                           (D bear interest at  4 per  cent. The Company operating on the  Com- missioner&apos;s behalf own  the land and the factories.    46.  Entry to the site was  not obtained until the end of June, 1937, so that there had been little time at the date of the previous Report to  measure the success  which would attend this venture. Enough progress had, however, been made to hold out high hopes for the future.  Before describing that progress it is desirable  to give some account of the facilities which the Estate provides.    47.  Most of the factories have been planned in blocks of standard units of 5,000 square feet in area.  Three or four units are grouped together in one  block.  Yard space is provided at the back and averages 50 feet  wide by 80 feet deep.   The size of a standard unit may be increased in bays of 14 feet 6 inches, each bay adding 725 square feet to the floor space.  Offices are situated in the front part of each building.   For a tenant who does not require a factory of the standard  size, a  smaller or &quot; nest &quot;  factory is provided.   These have been planned in blocks of six, seven or eight units,  each unit providing 1,200 square  feet of working space.    48. In  both cases a tenant may rent one or more contiguous units, according to his requirements.  Every unit faces a main road with a carriage way 20  feet wide with two footpaths 7 feet 6 inches wide.  Between the roadside and the front wall is a parking space flanked by ornamental  grass verges.  The yard gives access to a service road 16 feet wide.    49. Apart from these standard factories, a manufacturer can, if he wishes, have a factory on a rental basis built to his own  specifically - cation, or he may feu a site on  the Estate to erect his own factory.    50. The  Estate  is  provided with  all  essential services gas, water and electric light, while the factories are heated by steam from a central boiler house which also supplies, if required, process steam. In the planning of the  Estate much attention has been paid to the provision of amenities to render it aesthetically attractive.  Flowering trees and shrubs  are being planted beside all  main roads, and a playing field has been set aside  for the use of tenants&apos; employees.   A central canteen building fronted with an attractive garden has been erected  to provide meals at moderate cost.   A central garage, with accommodation for sixty-four  large lorries, will provide a day and night service.   51. Mr.  Walter Elliot, then  Secretary of State for Scotland,summarised the general objects when he formally opened the Estatelast  November.   He  said :         &quot;  It may well be that the opening of the Scottish Industrial     Estate shows that  a second Industrial Revolution is in progress.      It is  not  necessary  that  ugliness and industry should  go     together. There is a new spirit coming in Scotland.   Fresh air     and  sunlight  pay  dividends  as  much as anything else.  It
kO                            11      is perfect folly not to pay attention to obtaining these great      subsidies.   I believe the cities of the future will lie out to the      sun and the strong winds, that the squalor which has marked      the beginnings of industrialism will pass, never to be seen again.      Here we are  planning a development which will show that      industry can  be divorced from ugliness.  There is no reason      why the opening of this Estate should not mark a new chapter      in the history of our country.&quot;    52.  The record of progress for the past year has abundantly fulfilled the highest  expectations.  The development of  the first 25 acres for standard and nest factories was so rapid.that within a few months it was necessary to develop a second area of the same size; on the opposite side ground has been feued to firms who require factories built to their own specifications; a total of some 80 acres is now under development.  There  are  indications  that in  the near future further developments will be required.    53.  By the end of September, 1938, a total of 67 tenants had been secured for 103 factories built by the Estates Company.   In addition sites had been taken by three banks and two areas, each of five acres, had been feued to firms for the erection of their own factories, one of which is completed.  The position may be summarised as follows :          No. of Tenants           No. of Factories               35                      59 Standard Units.               30                      41 Nest Units.                 2                       3 Factories built to order.                 3  Banks                       -                 2  Feuars               5 acres  of  land  each.                                        1 factory completed.     Totals    72                     104    When the estate is fully developed it is estimated that it will provide employment for upwards of 15,000 workpeople. (2) Lanarkshire  Estates    54. The persistence of heavy and prolonged unemployment in the industrial north of Lanarkshire an area dependent mainly for its prosperity on coal, iron and steel is a matter which has caused me considerable concern.   Apart from a revival in those heavy industries the only means of improving the situation is the introduction of new industries.  Encouraged by  the  success  which  had attended  the Estate at Hillington, I decided,  after a very careful survey of the whole  area, to purchase sites at  Carfin, Chapelhall,  and  Larkhall. They are all within 15 miles of  Glasgow with easy access to the towns of Airdrie,  Coatbridge, Motherwell,  Wishaw and Hamilton, and are ideally situated for road transport which,  in these days, is so important for light industry.
   55. Carfin, about 27 acres in extent, is the largest of the threesites.  Situated next to the grounds of the Carfin Hall community service Centre, it is two miles from Motherwell and four miles fromHamilton andWishaw, and lies east of the mining  village of NewStevenston.  It has  a  frontage of some 1,200 feet to a public road.This Estate will provide on full development for 70  to 80 factories.An interesting feature  of this Estate will be the establishment of thetraining centre by the  Ministry of Labour, referred to in paragraphs23-25.   56. Chapelhall, the most northerly of the three sites, is just over18 acres in extent and lies on the north-east side of the arterial road from Carlisle and the South to Stirling and the North.   It is on the outskirts of the village of Chapelhall, within two miles of Airdrie and four miles of Coatbridge.   It has a road frontage of 1,900 feet, and isexpected to provide 40 or 50 factories.   57. Larkhall, the most  southerly of the three sites, is about 11 acres in area and is bounded on the west by the Trunk Road London-Carlisle-Glasgow-Inverness.  It lies about four miles from Hamiltonand  five miles from Wishaw, and plans for about 40 factories havebeen prepared.   58. The three Estates will  be factored on my behalf by a new company called Lanarkshire Industrial  Estates Limited, which wasincorporated  on 30th July, 1938.   The  Commissioner, however,remains the owner of the factories.  Like Scottish Industrial EstatesLimited, this company is limited by guarantee, has no share capital,and does not operate for profit.  I have been able to secure the sameBoard of Directors as have so successfully and energetically operatedthe Hillington scheme, namely :        Sir Steven Bilsland, Bart., M.C. (Chairman).       W. Gallacher, Esq.       Sir William Goodchild, C.M.G.       A.  C. Murray,  Esq., M.C., F.F.A.       R.  G. Simpson, Esq., M.C., C.A.       Col. Hugh B. Spens, D.S.O.   Recently, Mr. Robert Bryce Walker, C.B.E., late County clerk of Lanark, has joined both Boards.  The registered address of thenew company is 29, St.  Vincent Place, Glasgow, C.1, the same asScottish Industrial Estates Limited, and the staff is  shared by bothcompanies.  I hope by this method to  secure uniformity in controland  administration of  all four Estates.   59. The functions  of the new company are  to  secure  tenants,draft the  contracts,  and  generally  supervise the  growth  of  the estates.  The intention  is to  provide  factories on  lines similar tothose at Hillington with full facilities and services for the  tenants.The  initial work of construction of roads and sewers  started inAugust, 1938, and it is hoped  that the first factories will be ready  for
occupation early in the New Year.  When these new Estates are fully developed they will employ about 3,000 workpeople.   60. Recognising the exceptional value of new industries in this area, I am prepared to give special consideration by way of remissionsof rent, rates and income tax to prospective tenants of these  newEstates.(3) General.    61. It is  indisputable that Scotland  lagged  very far behindEngland in  the post-war development of  light industries.  Muchstill remains to be accomplished  to  redress the balance, but theprogress of the Estates demonstrates that industrial Scotland, so  longthe home of the heavy industries,  has the ability to make  just as great  a success of the new and lighter industries.   Appendix Xgives a list of new industries established on the Estates and else wherein -the Special Areas in Scotland as the direct result of  facilities and assistance provided under the Special Areas legislation.   The wide variety shown in this list speaks for itself.                         Oil from Coal.   62. I received the report of two investigators appointed by the&quot;Oil from Coal&quot;  Sub-Committee, dealing with the geological and chemical examination of Scottish cannel and its oils. It was suggestedthat I should publish  this report  after codification  of confidentialmaterial.  As,  however, it appeared that  such codification would render the whole report almost unintelligible to the general public, Idecided,  with the concurrence of the Chairman and Secretary of theSub-Committee, that the heavy expense of printing and publication would not be justified.   63. An abridged  form of the report with the recommendationsof the Cannel Sub-Committee had already been published by the.Scottish  Development Council  under the title &quot; Second Report ofthe &apos; Oil  from  Coal&apos; Committee.&quot;  Furthermore, material in theinvestigators&apos;  report was incorporated in  a paper  entitled &quot; TheRecent Survey of  Scottish Cannel&quot;  by Professor W. M. Cumming,D.Sc, F.I.C., and Dr. Hugh B.  Nisbet, Ph.D., F.I.C.  (Chairman and secretary respectively of the Sub-Committee) which was presented for discussion  at  the  Conference on Oil  Shale and  Cannel  Coalarranged by the Institute of Petroleum held in Glasgow  in June 1938.I therefore  felt that  the attention of interested parties  had been sufficiently directed to cannel resources capable of exploitation, andI am grateful to those whose work, done at times under conditions ofconsiderable pressure, made this possible.   64. The  Council  also published another report entitled &quot; third report  of the &apos; Oil from Coal&apos;  Committee,&quot;  which  includes an account of an investigation conducted by a specially appointed Coal-
                               14                           Omasters&apos; Sub-Committee to obtain more definite information on thedemand for  smokeless  fuel  in  Scotland;   it also considered thepractical problem of producing a suitable fuel.           Straightening of two bends in the River Clyde.   65. This scheme, to  which reference is made in paragraph 73 ofthe Fourth Report, is designed to improve the navigable channel ofthe River  Clyde by straightening two bends  near Dalmuir andErskine. The scheme is being carried out by the Clyde NavigationTrust who  have informed me that operations are  proceeding satis-factorily.(a)  Reconstruction of Princes Pier, Greenock.(b)  Deepening Garvel Graving Dock and altering entrance to the James                    Watt Dock Basin, Greenock.   66.  Negotiations with the Greenock Harbour Trust regardingthese proposals have been protracted and have not yet reached adefinite conclusion.   The interests of a number of parties are affectedby  the schemes which, if undertaken, will involve  considerable expenditure.   Before I come to a final decision on the Trusfs applica-tion for assistance, I shall have to be assured that the parties directly concerned  show  a  readiness to contribute in proportion to thebenefits they are likely to secure if the schemes are  carried out.           Supply of electricity to villages in Lanarkshire.    67.  An application for assistance towards the cost  of extending the electricity supply to certain villages in Lanarkshire was submittedby  Lanark County Council  some  time  ago. In  their  application the Council stated that they  were undertakers under the ElectricityActs for the whole  of the County, but had entered into an arrange-ment with the Clyde Valley Electrical Power Company, under whichthe Company act as their  agents.  After a full examination of theposition it was found that I  was debarred under Section 1  (5) (a)of the  Special Areas (Development and Improvement)  Act, 1934,from assisting the project.                   Ardrossan Harbour Company.    68.  The Ardrossan  Harbour Company submitted  a  number  of proposals which they would be prepared to carry out if assistancefrom the Special Areas Fund were provided.   After full investigationit was concluded that the  Company constituted an undertakingcarried on for the purposes of gain and they were, therefore, informedthat  assistance from the  Special Areas Fund  was  statute  barredunder Section 1 (5) (a) of the  1934 Act.
Dredging of the River Leven between its entrance to the River Clyde                    and Dumbarton Harbour.   69. In paragraph 72 of the Fourth Report  mention is madeof the fact that as a direct result of the scheme for the dredging ofthe River Leven, a  firm likely to provide good employment wereto establish a factory in a disused shipyard  in  Dumbarton. Atthe request of the firm in question, Messrs. Hiram Walker &amp; Company,I performed the ceremony of opening the new distillery towards theend of September, 1938.   70. There are other cases in which the improvement of essential services with assistance from the Special Areas Fund has led directly or indirectly to the establishment of new industrial undertakings inthe Special Areas, but the development referred to in the preceding paragraph is a particularly striking example of the benefits whichmay accrue to an area if the natural resources  are readily availablefor industrial development.                   Attraction  of New Industries.   71. There are now a number of separate organisations activelydealing with the problem of attracting new industries to the SpecialAreas in Scotland.   These are :-          The Scottish Industrial Estates Company.         The Lanarkshire Industrial Estates  Company.         The  Scottish  Development Council,  who are   interested      generally in the industrial development of the whole  courrtry      and who, as explained in paragraph 32, maintain on my behalf      a special department to provide industrial information and      advice regarding the  Scottish Special Areas.         The Special  Areas  Reconstruction Association (Scottish      Board), the Special Areas Loans Advisory Committee (which      administers the Treasury Fund) and the  Nuffield Trust, all of      which provide capital for industrial development.         The Board of Trade, who are concerned with industry in      the country generally, and the Home  Office and the Ministry      of Labour who are responsible for the  admission of  aliens into      this country.    72. The question of the co-ordination of the associated functions of all the above organisations and also  of maintaining close coj operation  with  the Commissioner  for Special  Areas  (England and Wales) has called for consideration in order  to avoid overlapping or delays in dealing with inquiries.  The following  arrangements have been made for this purpose :           (a) I have appointed  a London Representative,  who, in      addition to being available for consultation by persons who
     may  be&apos; considering the  establishment  of  a factory in the     Scottish Special Areas, also acts as a liaison with the English     Commissioners Office and other Government Departments on     all phases of the work.         (b) Fortnightly meetings are held, which are attended by     representatives of my office in Edinburgh, by the London     Representative,  and the Industrial Officer, and also  by repre-     sentatives  of  the  Special  Areas Reconstruction  Association,     the Scottish and Lanarkshire Industrial Estates Companies,     and the Special Areas Department of the Scottish Development     Council.  These meetings  provide  a  regular opportunity  for     discussing  all aspects of  applications  for  factories  and  for     assistance in other forms.   73. The Special  Areas  (Amendment) Act,  1937, which empowersthe Commissioner to  let factories and provide financial assistance by means of contributions to rent, rates and income tax, has beenin operation since 6th May; 1937.   74. One or two  enquiries with regard to the letting of factoriesunder Section 2  of the 1937 Act have  been received and considered,but they have not  reached the  point at which the necessary sitesor factories could be acquired.   The case referred to in paragraph 78of the Fourth Report remains  therefore the only one which hasmatured up to the  present time.   75. In  the Fourth Report  it was stated  that my predecessorhad offered assistance under Section 3 (1) of the 1937 Act in respectof six new undertakings.  Since that Report twenty-nine furtheroffers have been made bringing  the total number up to thirty-five.The  assistance offered has comprised a  contribution towards rent,rates and  in  some cases, income tax.   In one case, I  have  also agreed to  recommend to the Treasury that relief from NationalDefence Contribution should be granted for an initial period.  Theextent of the contribution is decided in each case after considerationof certain  factors which include the  value of the industry  to  theAreas and  the degree of unemployment in  the district in which  theindustry is to be located.   76. The total capital represented by the undertakings in respectof which offers have been made is  1,325,300,  and it is expected that employment will be provided for 2,400 additional persons.  Twentyof the undertakings are located on the  Hillington Estate and twoat Chapelhall.  These represent capital of  579,900 and are estimated to provide employment for 1,370 persons.  Twelve offers relate toother parts of the Special Areas and  affect undertakings with a capital of   745,400 and estimated employment for 1,030 persons.One of the offers has not  yet been accepted by the firm concerned.
17154    77. Of the thirty-five offers,  twenty-five were made in respect of applications from Scottish sources and represented entirely new developments, the opening of branch factories, or transference to the Special Areas to enable expansion to take place;  nine were in respect of applications from England and one from abroad.    78. Offers of assistance are made only after careful consideration of the whole circumstances of each case :  this includes examination of the prospects of success and of the existing structure and capacity of the particular industry at the present time.  The Board of Trade is consulted regarding each  case.  In considering  applications I have been glad to have the  advice of Lord Portal and Sir  Nigel Campbell.    79. The total number of  applications  and inquiries  received regarding the facilities and inducements available for industry in the  Special Areas exceeds five hundred.  Of these, two  hundred and fifty-one have been  from Scottish  sources, one hundred and sixty-six  from England,  and eighty-six from abroad.  The last mentioned have come  principally from Central European countries, sixty-six  of them since March of  this  year.   Three hundred and thirty-four  of  the inquiries have  subsequently been  withdrawn, rejected, or have  lapsed,  but it is known that in certain of  these cases, where the applicants were not eligible for assistance from the Commissioner, they  have  received  capital  assistance from the&apos; Special Areas Reconstruction  Association   or  have  established factories in the  Special Areas without assistance.   One  hundred and thirty-four inquiries are under active consideration. Royal  Commission. on Geographical   Distribution  of Industrial                          Population.                         -   80. At the request of the Royal  Commission, and in co-operation with the Commissioner for England and Wales, I have submitted a memorandum on the effect on the Areas  of the withdrawal of big industries and am about  to submit a further note on  the  relative value of the different forms of assistance as a means of inducing the establishment of industries in the Special Areas. SECTION   (2) PUBLIC  WORKS, HEALTH SERVICES AND  AMENITY                           SCHEMES.                            General.   81. I have continued the policy adopted by the first Commissioner and followed by my predecessor of seeking to co-operate with LocalAuthorities in the Special Areas in  all measures likely to lead to animprovement in those  public utility services  which are essential tothe development of industry  and the safeguarding of public health.
Since the Special Areas legislation came into force schemes estimated to cost  4,599,618  have been approved for grant.  Assistance inrespect of schemes,  estimated to cost  1,366,688, has been providedsince I took  office.  These figures  show  that Local  Authoritiesgenerally have not been slow in availing themselves of the provisionsof the  Special Areas Act, but their real import lies in the fact thatno scheme,  designed expressly to  relieve unemployment or whichcould have  been carried out  without a grant, has been assisted.Every  measure  put in hand  has  been urgently necessary in theinterests of the community concerned, and would have been deferredindefinitely if State.assistance  had not been available.   82. Grants to Local Authorities have been a percentage of thecapital cost of schemes, leaving the Authorities to bear the  balanceof these costs and the&quot;whole of the amount required for maintenance.In many cases, particularly where Authorities have undertaken or are carrying out a number of schemes, I have taken full account ofall their financial burdens in fixing the percentage of grant.   83.  The  major part of the contracts in connection with thesepublic works  has  not yet  been  undertaken.  It  will  probablybe three years before the commitments entered into are fulfilled.Few approved schemes have  been  completed within the periodstated by Local Authorities in  their application for grants;  mostdelays have, however, been caused by circumstances beyond their control, and I have, therefore, sanctioned  extension of time, whilequalifying my approval by  urging the Local Authorities concerned to pursue the work with all  possible speed.                        Sanitary  Services.                         Water Supply.    84.  Since the inception  of the Special Areas Act, 18  schemesfor improving the water supply estimated to cost  575,335 have beenapproved for grant.  Of these six  were schemes of some magnitude.The schemes submitted for assistance were largely  concerned withurgent improvements of supply necessary on health grounds.  But,in the course of the work, evidence has come to hand of a matterof considerable importance connected  with water supply whichcannot be overlooked.  An adequate  reserve of water in a particularplace  at a particular time may be the determining factor  in nego-tiations for attracting new industrial developments.  It is therefore important that  the possible future requirements of industry shouldbe borne in mind in estimating  what supply should &quot;be provided. In one case referred to  in paragraph 86  an important industrial development was actually lost to the Area by the inadequacy of the water supply, in  spite of the urgent steps taken to overcome the difficulty.  In view of this evidence,  I initiated  a survey of the
affected area see paragraph  85.   It is for consideration whetherthis case points to the desirability of similar surveys in other areaslikely to be interested in industrial expansion.   Survey of Water Supplies in North Ayrshire and Renfrewshire.   85. These areas have  shown appreciable industrial expansionduring the last few years.   It  is therefore important that the watersupply in all districts should be adequate to meet existing domestic and  industrial  needs,  and that there  should  be reserve suppliesreadily  available to any  district  which  might be called  upon at short notice to  meet demands of new industrial  undertakings.To ascertain the  facts I therefore asked a well-known firm of CivilEngineers to survey and  report on the position.   The report wasreceived a short  time ago and is being considered in consultation  .with the Department of Health for Scotland.                 Irvine and District Water Board.   86. The  Irvine and District Water  Board are the  statutorywater supply undertakers for  the Burghs of Irvine, Kilwinning andSaltcoats and the Special Water Supply Districts of Kilwinning andStevenston,  and are, therefore, responsible for the water supply in an area of growing  industrial and national  importance.  Just over ayear  ago, a large  undertaking asked  the Board, as  a  condition precedent to their establishing a  factory in the Board&apos;s  area ofsupply, to give a guarantee that a supply of  water of from 300,000to 500,000 gallons per day would be made available for use in thefactory at the rate charged by the Board to other industrial con-sumers.  The  Board&apos;s resources were,  at the  time, just sufficientto meet the existing demands and they were  unable,  despite a promise of  temporary assistance from  a neighbouring Authority,to convince the firm that their requirements could be met pendingconstruction of a new reservoir in the  Dairy district, estimated to cost  200,000, which would place the Board in a position to supply the  firm  from their own resources.  I  intimated my willingness to assist in the  construction  of the reservoir  but the  Board  were unable  to induce the firm to alter their decision.  I  neverthelessagreed to assist in the construction of the reservoir and the schemeis now in hand.   Ayr County  Council Water Supply in the northern parts of the        i                     County.   87.  In the northern parts  of the County  of Ayr, dairy  farmingis one  of the  most important industries for  which an abundantsupply of water is essential.  The  County Council  were aware,from representations made to them, that in a number of  districtsthe water supply was either inadequate or of low standard and that  -unless remedial action were taken without delay, there was  a realpossibility that  dairy licences would be withheld.   They, therefore,
submitted a scheme to the first Commissioner for the constructionof main pipe lines  throughout the area,  and,  when this  schemewas well advanced, they asked whether I would be prepared to assist them with the construction of a system of distribution pipe linesaggregating approximately sixty-five miles  in length, and estimated to cost  101,775.  The cost seemed high in relation to the population in the district to be served, but the needs of these rural districtswere urgent,  not only  to  ensure the cleanliness  of the milk supplybut  also to  facilitate  the improvement of  housing conditions.                  Sewerage and Sewage Disposal.  &apos; 88. Since  the Special Areas  Act,  1934,  came  into operation,sewerage and sewage disposal schemes estimated to cost  2,501,350have  been approved for  grant.  I am glad that  so many LocalAuthorities have taken advantage of the Act to bring their sewage disposal systems up to date.      :              River Pollution Prevention.   89. Great progress  has been made  in reducing river pollution.When schemes for which grants have been  approved are completed,the problem of the pollution by untreated sewage of the River Clydeand its principal tributaries, and also of the Rivers  Irvine,  Garnockand  Leven, may be regarded as substantially  solved,  and a startin this direction will have been made  on  the Rivers Almond andCalder.   It is hardly possible to exaggerate the importance of this work in congested areas and I  hope  Authorities who still  haveproblems of this nature will not delay  the submission of proposalsfor consideration.             Prevention of Pollution of the River  Clyde.   90. In 1896, Lanark County Council convened a conference ofLocal Authorities in, or indirectly connected with, the Valley of the clyde, for the purpose  of considering what  steps should be taken to eliminate pollution of  the River.   Two years  previously  glasgow corporation had constructed Purification  Works at  Dalmarnock.Since  1896,   seventy-eight  purification   schemes,  costing  over 6,000,000 have been completed or are  now in hand.   Glasgow had given a valuable lead  and the problem would probably have been completely solved by  this time  if trade  conditions on Clydesidesince the war had been better, and if the  difficulty of securing suitablesites had not been so acute.   91. Of the seventy-eight schemes, twenty-five, estimated to costnearly  2,000,000, dealing with the prevention  of pollution of theRiver Clyde have been approved for grant since the Special AreasActs came into  force.   In respect  of these latter schemes  LanarkCounty Council have made the most notable contribution, while theBurghs of Lanarkshire and the County  and  Burgh  Councils of
Dunbartonshire  and  Renfrewshire  have each  played their  part.It is hoped that within three years all these services will be in full operation.         Sewerage and Sewage Purification in Lanarkshire.   92. Work on the schemes already approved for grant is proceeding satisfactorily and two at Blantyre and Bothwell and at Larkhall were completed early this year.   About a year ago, the CountyCouncil stated that they were giving preliminary consideration to afurther series of urgent schemes estimated to cost in the region of 300,000, and asked  whether a substantial measure  of assistance would be provided if they decided to put the schemes in hand withoutdelay. The Council were informed that if any or all of  the proposedworks were approved for grant, a higher percentage  of assistancethan  had been granted to them up to that time would be offered.Details of the schemes were recently received and in their letter ofsubmission,  and  later, in  conference,  the Council  made  strong representations that they should be given the  maximum possible assistance in view of the heavy commitments they had  entered into on housing, schools, hospitals and  drainage.  The residual drainageschemes  are likely  to cost over half a million pounds, and I feltjustified  in  offering them  a grant towards the  capital cost  at  a considerably higher percentage  than had been provided up to thattime.            Sewage disposal in  villages and rural areas. -  93. There  are  considerable difficulties in undertaking  sewage disposal schemes in sparsely peopled districts.  Creditable progress has,   however,  been  made and  schemes  covering a number ofindustrialised villages and rural districts have been,  or are beingcarried out in the Counties of Lanark, Dunbarton, Midlothian, WestLothian and Stirling.  In those cases  where I have considered theadditional rate necessitated by such schemes too high to  be bornesolely by the Special Drainage Districts concerned, I have made myassistance conditional on  the County  Councils contributing underthe powers contained  in  Section  33 of  the  Local  Government(Scotland) Act, 1929.           Regionalisation of Sewage Disposal Services.;   94. A noteworthy case of co-operation among Local authorities is the Irvine Valley drainage scheme.   Over three years  ago, AyrCounty. Council and  the  Town Councils of Darvel,  Galston andNewnulns submitted a proposal, estimated to cost  59,390,  for the drainage  of the upper reaches of the River Irvine.  The first Com-missioner approved the scheme for grant but subsequent negotiations between the Authorities on the question of an appropriate allocation of costs  proved abortive and  the scheme was  abandoned.  The
Authorities fully realised that some form of combined scheme was more likely to be in the general interest than individual schemes fortheir respective areas  and, after proplonged  investigation  and negotiation, they submitted revised proposals;  the estimated cost for the drainage of both the upper and lower reaches of the Riverwith outlet to the sea via the Kilmarnock outfall sewer amounted to 101,210.  This scheme broadened the rating basis and made possiblean agreed sharing of costs.  In view of the comprehensive nature ofthe revised scheme, I felt justified in offering a grant at an increasedpercentage.  This offer has now been accepted and work is likely to commence at an early, date.   95. I  appreciate  that  circumstances frequently preclude thepossibility of co-operation among Local Authorities, but I do suggestthat before Authorities decide to incur  heavy  commitments inrespect  of water supply or drainage schemes for their areas,  theyshould explore the position with neighbouring Authorities in orderto satisfy themselves that combination does not offer the best andmost economical method of providing the public service required.Water supply and drainage schemes need not, necessarily, marchwith Local Authority boundaries.                           Hospitals.   96. During the  last few months,  a  number  of applicationsfor assistance towards the  cost of municipal and voluntary hospitalschemes have been received, and it became necessary to formulatea broad line of policy in consultation with the Department of Health.The  view of the Department was that  there was likely to be a field of service for both municipal and voluntary hospitals for many years,but  that the maximum benefit  to the community of both  systemscould only be secured if those responsible for their administrationco-operated fully and cordially by an agreed division of function.This suggested that proposals, whether in respect of municipal  or voluntary hospitals would have to be considered on their merits andin the light of all the relevant circumstances, including the possibilityof formulating proposals on a regional basis.Lanarkshire General, Maternity  and Infectious  Diseases  Hospitals.   97. Mention of this scheme is made in paragraph 25 of the third report and in paragraph 106 of the Fourth Report.   After prolongednegotiations, a basis of co-operation was agreed between the CountyCouncil and the Town Councils of Coatbridge, Hamilton and Ruther-glen, but the collaboration of  the Town Councils of Airdrie andMotherwell could  not be secured.  The Authorities asked that thepercentage figure previously promised should be increased in view ofthe  fact that closer examination had revealed that the cost of thehospital had been materially under-estimated.
   98. Although the extent of co-operation originally stipulated as acondition  of  grant  had not been  secured, it was clear that theseproposals constituted a valuable addition to the health services of thedistrict.  I therefore informed the Authorities  that  I would beprepared to provide a substantial grant on condition that they so&apos;planned the buildings that  extensions could be put in hand with theminimum inconvenience and cost if co-operation of the other Authori-ties was secured at a later date.   The offer has been accepted and negotiations  for sites are  proceeding.             Greenock  Municipal Hospital  Scheme.   99. A few months ago,  Greenock Corporation reported  that theyhad decided to rescind their resolution to erect a Municipal Hospital,as they were not satisfied that additional hospital provision for thearea was  required.   A  scheme to erect a Hospital in  Greenock toserve both the burgh and the surrounding county area was approved for assistance over three years ago.  In the opinion of the Depart-ment of  Health increased  hospital accommodation in Greenock isas necessary  to-day as  it was then.  It is, therefore, a matter forregret that the Corporation have  resolved to abandon the project.Dunbarton County Council, and the Town Councils of Clydebank andDumbarton.   Joint  General  (including  Maternity)  and  Infectious                       Diseases Hospitals.   100. Reference to this scheme  is contained in paragraph  107 ofthe Fourth Report.  The proposal was then only under preliminary consideration, but detailed examination revealed that the need for the hospitals was well established, that the Joint Committee&apos;s proposals were designed on sound lines, and that, without assistance, the work could not proceed.   The Joint Committee were therefore offered a contribution  towards the  cost of the  scheme,  estimated at from 400,000 to  420,000.   The offer was accepted,  and intimation hasbeen received that negotiations for the purchase of a site are proceed-ing.   The hospitals will serve a population of nearly  150,000.  Ayr County Council Infectious  Diseases and General Hospital.   101. Ayr  County Council recently submitted an application forassistance  towards  the cost of  erecting an  Infectious  DiseasesHospital and a General Hospital  on a site near Kilwinning.  Thescheme is to be carried out in two stages, and as work on the infectious diseases Hospital was well advanced when the Councils applicationfor assistance was received, I found it necessary to reject the applica-tion for a grant towards this part of the full development.   An offer of assistance has, however, been intimated to the Council in respect ofthe proposed General Hospital, but as only a part of the County ofAyr is in the  Special Areas, the percentage assistance has been based
and  calculated on the estimated service which the hospital  willprovide for the inhabitants of that part of the County which is in theSpecial Areas.                     Kilmarnock Infirmary.   102. A short time ago, the Board of the Kilmarnock Infirmary (a voluntary Institution)  submitted details  of  the existing  hospitalprovision in the area, and asked whether assistance towards the costof erecting a new hospital could be provided.  The proposal is beingconsidered in consultation with the Department of Health forScotland.            Greenock Ear, Nose and Throat Institution.   103. The Board of this Institution (a voluntary hospital) recentlystated that they were proposing to erect a new building in which tocarry on  their work, and asked whether I would be prepared tocontribute to the Building Fund.                        Cottage  Hospitals.                         (a) Strathaven.                         (b) Lesmahagow.   104. Applications for assistance  have  been  received  towardsthe  costs of  establishing Cottage  Hospitals  at  Strathaven  andLesmahagow.  These villages   are  contiguous,   and the  partiesinterested in the proposals have been advised that while I might be disposed,  under  appropriate conditions,  to assist with the  cost ofestablishing and equipping a Joint Cottage Hospital to serve bothdistricts,  I  would  not  be  prepared to provide  any contribution towards schemes for each area.  This decision is being considered bythe parties concerned.               Maternity and Child Welfare Centres.   105. Assistance is being provided towards the cost of establishingMaternity and Child Welfare Centres at Baillieston  (Lanarkshire),Greenock and Rutherglen.  These Centres which are all situated in industrial areas will form a valuable addition to  the maternity  and child welfare schemes of the Local Authorities concerned.Recreation Grounds, Public Baths  and  Swimming Pond Schemes.   106. Since 13th July, 1937, when the Physical Training  and recreation Act came into  operation, the Commissioner has beendebarred, under Section 1  (5) (ii) of the 1934 Act from assisting LocalAuthorities with  schemes relating to physical exercise.  Work onschemes for  the provision of recreation grounds approved for grantbefore the passing of the Physical Training and Recreation Act has.either been completed or  is in  hand.  Schemes for the provision of
Public Baths and Swimming Ponds had been approved in two cases;the Coatbridge scheme to which reference is made in paragraph 115of the Fourth Report was  completed and put  into service  somemonths ago, and work  on the Kilmarnock scheme,  mentioned inparagraph  114  of  the same Report, is  progressing  satisfactorily.Close liaison has been maintained with the Scottish Grants  Com-mittee appointed under the Physical Training and Recreation Actin all matters affecting the Special Areas.                 Amenity Improvement  Schemes.    107. The Physical Training and Recreation Act,  1937, did notcurtail the  Commissioners  power in regard  to the provision ofassistance to Local Authorities in respect of amenity improvementschemes.  In connection  with schemes  of  this type  I, however,subscribe to the view expressed in paragraphs 110 and 112 of  theFourth Report that assistance should not be provided towards labour costs save in exceptional  circumstances.   During the current yearone  public park scheme has been approved for grant but, in thisparticular case, the area was congested and lacking in  amenities, and immediate reclamation of the ground proposed to be  converted was essential on general economic grounds.   No proposal for effectingimprovements in the amenities of an area by volunteer labour hasbeen received.                    Site Improvement Schemes.    108. Assistance has been provided to Coatbridge  Town Councilin connection with a small  site improvement  scheme and to PortGlasgow  Town  Council  in respect of a larger  development.   Theposition of Port Glasgow is peculiar in that it lies on- a narrow stripbetween the River Clyde and the Renfrewshire hills.  The scheme will make a notable addition to the amenity of the burgh, and bypartial reclamation 27  acres  will  be made available  for playing fields and other developments.              Repair and Improvement of Streets.    109. Section 4 (1) of  the Special Areas (Amendment)  Act,  1937,empowers the Commissioner to assist Local Authorities in the SpecialAreas with any expenses they may incur in  the repair and improve-ment of streets  which are  certified by the Ministry of Transport asbeing used wholly or mainly for purposes other than those of throughtraffic.  I had no  definite information regarding the condition of publicly owned  streets in the Special Areas, but considered that itwould be wise policy to confine any  grants which I might offer tourgent works which were being deferred on  account  of financial stringency, and not to offer  assistance towards the cost  of schemeson a Local Authority&apos;s normal street repair programme. Schemesfor which grants were made would then be in addition to the  Local     o 19300                                                B
Authority&apos;s  normal programme and would proceed  concurrently;in this way a solution to the problem would be secured more quickly.   110. A letter on these lines was, therefore, addressed to all LocalAuthorities in the Special Areas inviting them to survey the positionin their  districts with a view to the.-submission of proposals forconsideration.  The response to this invitation has, so  far, beeninconsiderable,  and leads me to assume that the condition of thepublicly  owned streets  in  the Special Areas must be regarded as satisfactory.  Offers of assistance have  been intimated in respectof fourteen  schemes,  and arrangements  have been made with theMinistry of Transport  whereby the Local Authorities  concernedmay  obtain technical  advice from the Divisional Road  Engineer,Scotland. One of the Local Authorities in the Special Areas recentlystated that  there were, in their areas, a number  of private streetswhich they would; like to have brought up to highway standard butthat they considered that it would be unreasonable to call upon thefrontagers to bear the whole of the costs, because the highwaystandard of  today was much higher than that which obtained whenthe statute  placing sole liability on frontagers  was enacted.  they asked whether I would be prepared to assist in view of the fact thatthey were prevented by statute from so doing.   111. After a full investigation of the legal position, it has  beenfound possible to assist Local Authorities to  meet any expenses incurred by them in the repair of private  streets in which they are interested as frontagers and also in the widening of other privatestreets.  It  is, however, my intention to make any assistance whichI might provide in such cases conditional upon the Authoritiestaking over the streets as public highways on completion of theworks.                     Housing Developments.                       Industrial Housing.    112.  Reference has been made in previous Reports to the fact thatcertain industries have, at various times, experienced difficulty insatisfying their requirements for skilled labour  in spite of the largelabour surplus in the Scottish Special Areas.    113.  In  the case of the coal-mining industry, to which particular reference was made in paragraph 15 of the Third Report, it has beenfound that  a lack of housing accommodation in certain of the  areas where coal-mining operations are still active is an important factor :labour has  been thereby precluded from  moving freely from  those districts where there is heavy and persistent unemployment due tothe  exhaustion of the main coal measures. Moreover, the miningpopulation  have shown considerable local mobility, and it is known that many  miners incur relatively large sums in  travelling daily totheir work.  It is therefore  clear that a wider general mobility can
only be achieved by the provision of new houses near the areas ofrecent development.   114. To meet this situation an interesting arrangement has beenmade between  the Nufheld Trustees  and a number of the coalcompanies, by which a considerable sum has been set aside  by the trustees to assist local  owners in the  provision of houses for menfrom the Special Areas whom they will take into employment both within and outwith the Areas.   Though the percentage of coal-minerslikely to benefit from this scheme may not be large it has, in my view,a particular significance in providing  employment to men in thetrade in which  they  are well qualified and  avoids the more generaland more serious problem of finding employment for men perma-nently  shut out from their former occupation.            Scottish Special Areas Housing Association.   115. The initial steps which were taken under the Special Areaslegislation to assist  in a solution of the acute general shortage ofnew housing in the Special Areas were referred to in paragraphs 103to 105  of the Fourth Report.   116. At the beginning of the period to which the present  Reportrelates  the promises  of co-operation received from Local Authoritiesencouraged the immediate formation of the Association  which wasincorporated as a  Company limited  by guarantee and not  having a share capital  on  8th November, 1937.  Control is in the hands ofa Council of Management consisting of  eight members,  under theChairmanship of my predecessor, Sir.David Allan Hay.   117. The terms of the Association^ Agreement with the Com-missioner which provides for financial assistance from the  SpecialAreas Fund require the Association to employ methods of constructionother than brick.  This restriction was necessary to prevent corn-petition for the labour  and material required in brick constructionof which there  was an acute shortage twelve months ago.  A greatdeal of investigation into methods of house construction  has, there-fore, been necessary to produce proposals which were acceptable tothe Department of Health for Scotland  and the Local authorities concerned.   118. The first  method which the Association have  decided toadopt is that of poured cellular concrete, which will provide houseswith solid 8-inch walls of concrete, made without sand, and cellularin nature.  There is every reason to  suppose that this type  of con-struction will  afford comparative  freedom from condensation  andcracking, troubles which have to be carefully guarded  against inpoured concrete construction.   As it was not possible to obtain acontractor experienced   in cellular concrete construction,  it  wasnecessary for  the  Association to employ  direct labour  under the supervision of  an expert. It  is hoped, however, that  once menexperienced in  the various processes  are  available, cellular concrete                                                        B 2
construction will become  an established method of house-building in which contractors will be able to engage.  The Association have succeeded in obtaining plant  which will facilitate speedy erectionwhile, at the same time,  permitting variety in the designs of thehouses to be erected.  Some delay was experienced  in  obtaining the plant, due at the outset to a scarcity of necessary material and,latterly, to a pressure of other orders on the manufacturers, but asatisfactory rate of delivery has now been obtained  and pouringoperations will shortly be commenced on a  large scale.   119. Another method  of construction  which will be  employedwill  provide  houses with walls of ordinary dense  concrete.   Thewalls will consist of two 3-inch thicknesses  of concrete  separated bya 3-inch cavity.  While, on grounds of cost,  the Association havebeen obliged to limit the number of designs, they are confident thatthe number adopted, combined  with  the use of flat and ordinarypitched roofs for each type, will  ensure attractive lay-outs free fromthe charge of monotony.   120. One result of the decision to use cellular concrete has beenthe encouragement given to a proposal to establish works in  theSpecial Areas which will produce foamed slag a material particu-larly suitable for cellular concrete.   121. The Association have also decided to erect timber houses.Two methods of construction have been adopted, viz., solid timberwalls and timber framed walls; framed construction will be adoptedonly in the case of the bungalows.  The houses will be of one and twostoreys, normally in blocks of two, and with adequate space betweenblocks; the flatted type of house will not be built.   It is proposed tostandardise the timber house plans with a view to securing economy in the use of skilled joiner labour which is not at present plentiful inScotland.    122. In view of the comparative novelty of the timber house inScotland, I agreed with the Association^ proposal  to  erect twospecimen houses of this type on  ground at  Carfin Hall.  The houses were in occupation by ordinary tenants from overcrowded accommo-dation within one month of the start of building operations and wereinspected by Their Majesties the King and Queen during their tourof the Special Areas in May, 1938.    123.  Work  of construction has begun  on four sites which  willaccommodate 758 houses, tenders for 2 schemes covering 218 houses are  under  consideration,  and plans for  other schemes are so well advanced that it will be possible in a  short time to invite furthertenders.    124.  The Special Areas Housing Association are now carrying outwork or considering  plans  in co-operation with 15 different  LocalAuthorities in respect of the provision of  about 5,000 houses  on 25sites, 11 of which have already been acquired.
1                      Burgh of Hamilton.    125. The special scheme referred to in paragraph  102 of theFourth Report has made steady progress under arrangements agreed with the Second Scottish National Housing Company.  Accommoda-tion has been provided for 71 families who  are now occupying oldproperties which have  been  reconditioned.   So far as can be ascer-tained at the moment the cost of the scheme will be about  8,000.    126. It was stated  in  the Fourth  Report that the number ofsquatters was about 70, but subsequent inquiries revealed that theproblem was, in fact, more extensive.   A recent inquiry shows thatthere still remain between 70 and 80 families living in squalid andinsanitary conditions.  The original scheme was only undertakenexperimentally to  deal  solely  with an  exceptional problem  ofsquatting with its  attendant social evils.  It  was an  emergencymeasure to deal with an urgent problem of public health.  I venture to think it has been a valuable step towards the partial solution of theproblem.  The problem of squatting is, however, essentially one forthe  Local  Authority  concerned and  I  hope  that  an energeticacceleration  of  the re-housing  programme will  render  furthersquatting inexcusable, and bring those  who  indulge  in  it intothe position of wilful law-breakers.  In  so  far as  re-housing pro-grammes have not  removed the main cause which  gives rise  tosquatting, the reconditioning of property  to provide  temporary accommodation is, in my view, justified.  I am giving considerationto the question of  a further scheme to deal with the  remainingproblem at Hamilton.               SECTION (3): LAND DEVELOPMENTS.  Arterial Drainage.  Land Drainage (Scotland) Acts,  1930-1935.   127. In paragraphs  116 to 118 of  the Fourth Report  particularsare given of two arterial drainage schemes in  the Special  Areasundertaken by the Department of Agriculture for Scotland on theRiver Kelvin and River Clyde (Hyndford Bridge), under the extendedpowers conferred by the Land Drainage  (Scotland)  Act,  1935.                River Kelvin  Drainage  Scheme.   128. The limited scheme for remedying  flooding in the Kelvinvalley, which was referred to in paragraph 117 of the Fourth  Report,was settled  by the Department of Agriculture in March,  1937, inpursuance of the Act.  Arbitration action is proceeding in connectionwith two claims for compensation for damage  arising  out of thescheme.  It is hoped that it will  be possible to proceed with theexecution of the works in  the Spring.o 19300
         River Clyde [Hyndford Bridge) Drainage Scheme.   129. Work on  this scheme (see paragraph 118 of the fouth report) which is designed to check flooding of the River Clyde in theCarstairs district of Lanarkshire, and  to improve the drainage ofagricultural land extending to 945 acres, was begun by the Depart-ment of Agriculture in March, 1937.  The major work, which involves the removal of a barrier of rock known as the  Sills, is nearing com-pletion.  Thereafter the minor works, which consist principally of theimprovement of  the bed of the river, will be  put in hand.                       Land Reclamation.   130. The experimental reclamation of 550 acres of. peat land atthe Woodend Farm described in paragraphs  119  to 122 of theFourth Report has continued to attract considerable public attention.   131. The Macaulay Institute for Soil Research, Aberdeen, whoare supervising the experiment, are satisfied with the progress made during the year.  It will, however,  be impossible to complete any final assessment of the economic value of the experiment  for someyears to come,  though the scheme is well advanced and the actualwork of  reclamation will be  completed during 1939.  The farm,excluding the land under reclamation,  is now being managed onnormal lines by the Scottish Land Development Company acting as my factors.   132. The reclamation work was commenced in May, 1936.  Thefirst  area of 25 acres was sown out  with grass seeds in September,1937, and  during the  current year the  following crops had been laid down : Hay (rye grass)   ..Hay (timothy)MashlumOats (with grass seeds)Marrow stem KalePotatoes, carrots,  cabbage, etc.141 acres 59  5 10  5  1221 acres   133. The crops which have so far been harvested are :     Hay   ..     ..     ..     ..   25 acres     1 ton per acre    Mashlum     ..     ..     ..    5   ,,     10 tons ,,    Oats   ...     ..     ..     ..   10   ,,     light crop    Marrow stem Kale  ..     ..    5   ,,     failure   The potatoes, carrots and cabbages have not yet been harvested,but it  is estimated that the potato yield will be about 6 tons per acre, while a normal yield of carrots and cabbages is expected.
   134. Covered drains have been laid in 250 acres which may nowbe regarded  as arable.  These drains,  which  comprise woodenboxes having a cross section  of about four inches square, are laidabout twenty yards apart and at a depth of A\ feet.  In the remain-ing area the system of open ditches has been adopted. The experimentis clearly demonstrating that the peat bogs of Scotland can be madeto yield crops and afford good grazing ground. It, however, appearsto indicate that the reclamation of large areas of peat land wouldnot be an economic proposition in the  absence  of special circum-stances, but the experience  and information which are being gainedwill undoubtedly be of great value should it become necessary atsome future date to increase the amount of land under cultivation.Moreover, there are in Scotland many  comparatively small areasof reclaimed peat land now under cultivation which are  not being used to full advantage.  There are also many farms, with  unusedpeat acres which the owners  might be prepared  to reclaim if they knew how to proceed in the matter, and what it would cost.  the experiment will be of value in both of these connections.   135. Careful  consideration will be necessary  in regard to thedisposal of Woodend  Farm and Moss once the  reclamation work has been completed.  If the farm were sold there  would be a danger that the incoming farmer  would, either from lack  of knowledgeor a desire to secure a quick  return, fail to accord the special care and treatment necessary in the case of reclaimed peat  land.  Insuch circumstances, the land would revert to its former conditionwithin  a  comparatively short period.   It would,  moreover,  beimpossible for the Macaulay Institute to carry out further research work  and to obtain the further information necessary to establishfinally the value of the experiments.   It, therefore, seems desirablethat the land should be retained for a further period.                Land Settlement Small-holdings.   136. Land settlement on  small-holdings is referred to in para-graphs 123 to 130 of the Fourth Report.  The policy outlined thereinhas been continued.  The Department of Agriculture, who  are theland settlement authority in  Scotland, have pursued a continuousprogramme of settlement with success for some years, and it wouldbe most unwise for the incumbent of a temporary office to carryout any experiment which  might in the long run impede the workof the  Department.  I  have accordingly confined my work toextending the possible field of recruitment.  No purpose would be served in offering too  great  an encouragement  to men  who  have little  experience of agriculture and no  knowledge of  the arduouslabour which  alone can  bring success.  I  am, however, confident that the men who have been assisted to settle on the land are wellfitted for their occupation  and possess the qualities and character to appreciate the opportunities provided.   I intend to continue tosupport the  policy whereby unemployed plot holders, who  have                                                        B 4
shown in a practical way that they have the requisite preliminaryknowledge  and  willingness  to  undertake  this class of work, areselected and assisted to become  small-holders.    137. During the period from 1st January, 1937, to 30th September,1938, the Department of Agriculture settled a  further 308 men onsmall-holdings in Scotland. Of these, 74 holdings were in the SpecialAreas, while a further 130 were situated within the industrial belt,which stretches roughly from Ayr to  Dundee.  Families from theSpecial Areas settled on holdings within the Areas during the sameperiod  numbered  71,  while  a  further 11  families were placed onholdings outwith  the Areas.  Thus from 1934 to the  present date414 families in the Special Areas have been settled on small-holdings,of which 25 have  been assisted from the Special Areas Fund.    138. Two  additional schemes  assisted from  the Special Areas Fund are now in  operation,  one at East Fulton Estate, near John- stone, Renfrewshire, and the other at Stonebyres, Lanark, where 22 trainees  representing  households  of  130  persons have been installed.  The periods of training  will extend  until 30th June, 1939, and 4th July, 1939, respectively.                              Plots    139. The policy  I  have pursued  in  regard  to plots has been governed by the  same general consideration as in the  case of small- holdings.   The  Department  of  Agriculture  are  responsible  for providing plots and the plot holders are given valuable assistance by the  Toint Committee of the Scottish National Union of Allotment Holders and the Society of Friends.  With a view to giving additional encouragement to the movement I agreed in January, 1938, to regard two-thirds of the  10 loan  for stock and equipment  as a  free gift. This loan was previously repayable in full by instalments.     140. During the year there has been a reduction in the number  of plot holders, due largely to the reabsorption  of these men into  industry.  The number of  men in  occupation of plots at  1st May,  1938, was 1,883,  of whom 880 were in the Special Areas, as compared  with 2,070 and  1,006 at 1st May,  1937.   In spite of this  reduction  in the total numbers 53 loans have  been given  since the  offer  of a  proportion of free grant became  operative.      141. Since the scheme started 1,330 men  have been supplied by  the Joint Committee with seeds,  lime and fertilisers at reduced rates,  the  cost being  repaid by instalments, while 444 men have been  granted loans for the purchase of stock and  equipment.                             Allotments.      142.  Valuable work is  being done in assisting allotment holders   by the Joint Committee of the Scottish National Union of Allotment   Holders and  the  Society  of  Friends.  I have  throughout kept in   close contact with the Joint  Committee.
   143. It is to be regretted that the number  of allotments under cultivation in Scotland continued to decrease during 1937 and fellfrom 21,682 to 20,492, a decrease of 1,190, the corresponding figuresfor the Special Areas being 8,888 and 8,604, a fall of 284.  A numberof allotments provided under private arrangements are not includedin the  returns compiled by the Department of  Agriculture and theabove  figures are,  therefore, representative rather  than accurate indetail.   The position is also illustrated by the fact  that the numberof&apos; Associations under the Special Areas scheme fell by 18 during the1937 and 1938 seasons.  A further pointer is the fact that the numberof unemployed persons who received assistance by way of seeds,fertilisers and tools during the year  1937 was 6,835  as  comparedwith 8,406  during 1936.  This recession is  due partly to  the  re-absorption of men into  industry, which renders them ineligible  forassistance, partly to the increased provision of modern houses withgardens, and partly to appropriation of land by Local Authoritiesto meet their requirements for rehousing.  It does, however, appearto represent some waning of interest in this form of activity.  If thisis the  case, it is  certainly unfortunate, because there is no more immediate  or  effective palliative  to the evils which accompanyunemployment. Allotments  provide at once an interest which canbe absorbing, a health-giving occupation which is second to none,and an addition to the family budget which is small but excellent in quality.   144. An examination  of  the  situation  showed  that the onlyconsiderable difficulty lay in the provision of suitable land on terms which  afforded a reasonable relationship to the rents which would beobtainable  from allotment holders.   In  order to test whether these difficulties  could be  overcome  by the provision of  more generousassistance  to Local  Authorities,  I decided  to increase the offerpreviously made from 25 per cent, to 75 per cent,  of the valuation,as certified by the District Valuer, of land purchased for allotments.The offer was made on the understanding that a long lease would begranted to allotment holders at agreed rents and that the land wouldnot be disposed of or diverted to  other use without my consent.A letter conveying this new offer was sent to Local Authoritiesand  a conference  of their representatives was held at which  thescheme was explained in detail. I regret to record  that the responsehas not improved.  Two proposals have been put  to me,  one ofwhich  proved impracticable  owing to the very high price demandedfor the land. The other case is still under consideration by the LocalAuthority concerned.   I am accordingly forced  to  the conclusionthat there is no one in the Special Areas who would like an allotmentbut who is unable  to obtain  one.           Calderwood Experimental Farm Development.   145. After  prolonged consultation  with  the  Scottish  LandDevelopment   Company, the  Department  of   Agriculture  and
representatives of the Ministry of Labour, I have carefully reviewed the past results and the future prospects of this experiment, referredto in paragraphs 136-139 of the Fourth Report.   146. As a farm run on normal lines it could,  I have no doubt,show a profit, but as a scheme for training men with a view to fittingthem  for employment in  agriculture, it  can only be  carried on at considerable cost to State funds.   147. As originally conceived, this farm was intended to provide a training ground for elderly ex-industrial workers. For various reasonsthis plan had to be modified  and younger men were taken on fortraining.  The difficulty  of placing men after training has  been increased by the passing  of  the  Agricultural Wages  Act, which makes no provision for the employment of improvers.  In view ofthe uncertainty of  being able to place  the  men when trained, Ihave had to  consider fully whether the  cost of the scheme can bejustified.  I am, however, exploring with the Company the possibilityof instituting a scheme for the training of juveniles for work on theland.   Whether  this will be practicable is not yet certain.                   Group Occupational Scheme.   148. As indicated in earlier reports a Group Subsistence or Home-crofting centre was  opened at Wishaw, Lanarkshire, with the objectof testing  experimentally the possibilities  of  this  system in theScottish Special  Areas.   Approximately twenty acres of suitableground were  leased and special buildings were erected to accommo-date the various craft and agricultural  activities required for the experiment.  The group members were local unemployed men, someof whom had received instruction in the &quot;ideas of homecrofting atthe earlier demonstration centre at Lampits Farm.  For the purposeof the experiment,  a paid supervisor was employed  to control thescheme and ensure  that adequate records of its progress were kept.    149. The scheme continued to operate for some time without anadequate production to support the expenditure.  As time  passed it became  increasingly  doubtful whether  the  scheme  could bestowany material benefits on the members, apart from the improvementin their morale  and  physical condition, unless it  received a sub-stantial and  continuous subsidy or unless steps could be introduced to secure a considerable increase in production.  The number of men engaged in this work did not at any time exceed 20 and was diminish-ing under improved industrial conditions. After thorough investiga-tion the conclusion was reached  that,  while increased productionmight be secured by  intensifying the methods of cultivation andstock rearing, further capital expenditure would be involved.   Itwould, moreover, have been necessary to embark upon a long-term policy.  On inquiry it  proved impossible  either  to purchase the landoutright or to obtain a  lease for a sufficient period, and I was accordingly reluctantly forced to decide  that the  experiment should
be brought  to a  close.   The lease was accordingly  terminated asfrom Whitsunday, 1938.                 Mission for the Deaf and Dumb.   150. A further grant was made  to the Mission  for  Deaf andDumb for Glasgow and the West of Scotland.  The scheme which isbeing carried out by the Mission provides for  training unemployeddeaf and dumb persons in horticulture.  The  total cost  amountedapproximately to the figure of  3,085 and the grant was increasedto  1,391.   At 21st September, 1938, there were ten trainees inoccupation,  seven being from the Special Areas.                The Scottish Training Farm for Boys.   151. The grant  approved by  my predecessor has enabled theScottish Labour  Colony Association  Limited to acquire  additional land at their farm at Stevenston, Ayrshire, and to reconstruct thepremises which were burnt down.   The  reconstruction  work hasbeen completed, and I opened the new  premises on 11th May, 1938.The number of boys who have passed  through the Training Centrefrom  1st March,  1937, to 30th September, 1938, is 84, of whom 16came from the Special Areas.                     Fairbridge Farm Schools.   152. I have offered  a grant to assist the Society to  acquire an office in Glasgow.  This will enable  them to  extend the sphere oftheir  work to the Special Areas in Scotland.  I  have also offered aper capita grant towards the cost of transferring the  children to theSociety&apos;s hostels  and their  maintenance pending emigration.                        Afforestation.   153. My negotiations with the Forestry Commission  have con-vinced me that a scheme of afforestation within the Special areas is not practicable having regard to the difficulty of acquiring suitableland.  The  Forestry  Commissioners  have,  however,  now indicatedtheir willingness  to set aside a number of forest holdings in Kirk-cudbrightshire  for  men drawn from the Special Areas if  certainpreliminary difficulties can  be overcome.  The  arrangements are notproving easy.  I  am  nevertheless hoping that this will provide themeans of settling a  number of families  on Forest Holdings.                        Beautifying Bings.    154. After consultation with the Forestry Commission  I approved a grant of  350 towards the cost of improving the appearance of aniron-slag  bing  at  Newmains,  Lanarkshire,  which overshadowshouses in the neighbourhood.  The owners of the bing have granted a lease,, at a nominal rent, to the appropriate  Local  Authority, whohave undertaken the  work and the cost of subsequent maintenance.
Bushes have been planted and grass sown on the bing and a pathwhich leads to the summit is in course of being fenced.    155. It is not certain yet whether  this experiment will prosper.The bing  has been the playground for 3&apos;ears of the children in theneighbourhood and the  fencing  and the newly planted trees are suffering damage.  If, however, these difficulties can be dealt with,I hope that this  example will induce further action on the part  of owners and Local Authorities with a view to ridding the countrysideof a proportion, at any rate, of these  unsightly features.   It seems possible that something  can be done  with isolated bings.  Where,however,  many exist close to  each other the cost of dealing withthem is likely to be prohibitive and the  beautification of one binghere and  there, while leaving  neighbouring  bings untreated, is.of little value, whether aesthetic or hygienic.                 SECTION (4) SOCIAL SERVICES.                   Model Occupational Centres.    156. The  experimental scheme  conceived by the first Commis-sioner  for providing a  number of Model Centres, as  shown  inAppendix XI, has nearly been completed.  I  have throughoutworked in close co-operation with the Scottish Council for community service during Unemployment, who are responsible for the provisionof equipment and supervision  of these centres.    157. Fourteen centres have now been opened, and the remainingone to be provided out of the grant allocated to the Council is in course of construction.   The Council approached me for assistanceto  build  another centre,  but I share the view of my predecessorthat the  experiment is already sufficiently extensive to  enable  its value to be assessed without enlargement.  It may be appropriate to emphasise in this Report that it was never the intention to providecentres throughout the Special Areas on a comprehensive scale.    158. I have  been surprised  and  disappointed to  observe  the relatively small extent to which the communities, for which centreshave been provided, have supported  and  participated in their activities. It  seems to me that  the conduct and  welfare of the centres,  whose potential  value extends almost to the whole com-munity which they serve, are matters in which the Local authorities concerned have  a  measure of  interest and responsibility; I have,therefore, associated myself with the Scottish Council for community service in bringing the position to the notice of these  Authorities.    159.  The Council have asked  me for assistance to  enable the centres to employ full-time supervisors, representing that continuouscontrol of operations is  necessary and  that  persons  of the rightcalibre could do much to increase local participation  by the com-munity in the activities of the centres.  Experience has shown that
it  is  not practical  to depend on  volunteer  service  for  routineorganisation.  While I agree in principle with these representations,I have hitherto felt unable to provide assistance, as I regard this asan expense which ought to be borne by the persons who enjoy  the amenities provided by the centres.  It may be, however, that  the raising of the necessary money locally for the provision of a  salariedsupervisor is in some  cases either impracticable or likely  to leadto undesirable lines of development, and it may yet be possible toarrive at a basis of  agreement on  this  difficult  question.   160. It is too early to form any accurate conclusion  as to  thesuccess of this  experiment.  But the  progress in many areas isalready very striking.   The ideas behind it are new and have been only partially understood.  But there is a growing body of people who are acquiring the technique and who by pooling their experiencesare finding  solutions  to  their  problems  and are  developing  newspheres of activity.   161. The centres are undenominational in the sense that all arewelcome of  whatever  church or creed.  This  is a  feature the pre-servation of which  I  regard as most important.   In practice  this position has not been so easy to attain.  Indeed it is clear that it isonly by sustained effort that those in  charge of these centres  willbe able to break down local divisions.                Minor Community Service Schemes.   162. Offers of assistance have also been made to small community service schemes; these have, in the main, been limited to the supplyof materials and on the  understanding that  the  necessary labour should be undertaken by members of  the communities concerned.Members of community centres, in general, have  shown  a  markedunwillingness to give their services voluntarily and it is disappointingto record that only one proposal conforming with this principle hasbeen received.   In this case it is proposed to erect  a hut which  willprovide  social,  educational and,  to  a minor  extent,  recreational facilities for a small community.  Detailed plans and specificationsin respect of the scheme  are being prepared.                  Equipment for Women&apos;s Clubs.   163. The Scottish  Council for  Community  Service  have repre-sented to me  that  in  small villages and towns where  facilities for social and occupational activities are non-existent  the  provision ofclubs for women would be a valuable and valued amenity.  I have accordingly offered the Council a  grant of  300 to enable them toestablish  and equip clubs in selected  places in the Special Areas.The  grant for each  club will be limited to   50 and has been madeon the understanding  that the  Council will be  responsible for their future maintenance.
                      Cambuslang Institute.   164. A grant was offered to enable the Cambuslang Instituteto carry  out  certain  necessary  repairs to  the  building  whichhas  been  used  as  a  social and recreational  club  since  1885.The grant was limited to  480, and was offered on condition that the institute would themselves meet a quarter of the cost.  The grantwas accepted and the work is now almost completed.                        Nursing Services.   165. The Queen&apos;s Institute of District Nursing have continuedto administer the grants which have been made to encourage theprovision  of adequate nursing services throughout the Special Areas.Twelve nurses are now employed in districts where nursing services were formerly non-existent or insufficient. A recent inquiry showed that the resources of those local associations to whom assistance hadalready been given,  should enable them to  maintain their services at the  present  level, and that further assistance would only bejustified in special circumstances.  It is expected that the financialposition of local nursing associations will be further improved as aresult of  the provisions of the Maternity Services (Scotland)  Act,1937, although it is not possible at the moment to predict the extentto which they will benefit.   A sum has been set  aside to meet anyfurther approved claims which may be received.   These are servicesof exceptional value and if there were reasons to  suppose that their future maintenance was in jeopardy I should be prepared to examinecarefuUy  the possibility of further assistance.                    Ambulance Associations.   166. A review of the position of the Ambulance Services in theSpecial Areas shows that, while  one  or two Associations are notin such a satisfactory financial  position as could be desired, thereis no  strong  case  for  further  assistance from  the  Special  AreasFund.  The Department of Health share this view.                    Physical Culture Schemes.   167. The physical  training  classes for  unemployed  men andwomen, which the Ministry of Labour conduct on my behalf, havebeen continued throughout the period under review.  The increasingpopularity of the classes is shown by the fact that the total numberof attendances during the year ended 30th September, 1938, was237,885 as compared with 190,849 for the preceding year.  Detailsof the classes are given in Appendix XII.             Special Foodstuffs for Expectant Mothers.   168. The National Birthday Trust  Fund, which exists  for thepurpose of promoting the extension of maternity services throughoutthe country, have contributed towards the cost of providing selected
foodstuffs to expectant mothers. .. Reference is made by the Com-missioner for the Special Areas in England  and Wales in his third and fourth Reports (paragraphs 282-285 and 478-483 respectively)to the assistance which has been given to secure  the  extension ofthe scheme to those areas.    169. The National Birthday Trust Fund desire the introductionof permanent measures which would provide for the local medicalauthorities to make free distribution along similar lines.  The joint council of Midwifery,  who are co-operating with the Fund, have appointed a special Research Committee,  and  arrangements havebeen made to distribute through the agency  of local Medical Officersof Health different combinations of foodstuffs;  the results will thenbe collated for purposes of comparison and examination.    170.  The Committee are anxious that the results available fromthe  experiments should  be as comprehensive and  conclusive aspossible, and, to this end, the Joint Council of Midwifery have asked me for a grant to cover the cost of supplying the foodstuffs in certainScottish  Special Areas where  the Local Authorities  and medical officers  of  Health are in favour  of the proposal  and willing toco-operate.  The  Department of  Health  for  Scotland,  whom  Iconsulted regarding the  proposal,  suggested  that  their  ScientificAdvisory Committee might be willing to co-operate with the research committee in setting  up  a joint  scheme for the Special Areas inScotland.   The matter has been explored jointly by these bodies,and it was decided to  await  the results  of the experiment  inEngland (which should shortly be  available) before taking steps to formulate a scheme for Scotland.                   Athletic and Recreation Clubs.    171.  The Scottish  Athletic Federation, Former Pupils&apos; Union,have continued their  efforts to establish former pupils&apos; clubs and,after  consultation with   the  Physical  Training and Recreation,Scottish  Grants Committee, I made a further  grant  to enable theUnion to extend their work throughout the Special Areas, exceptingLanarkshire, for which provision  had already been  made by mypredecessors.  The  Federation  have  established  forty-five clubs.In pursuance of the policy outlined in paragraph  158  of the fouth report,  applications  for  assistance received  from  small athleticand recreation  clubs  have been  referred  to  the Scottish GrantsCommittee.                           Carfin Hall.    172.  The general  scheme of development  at  Carfin  Hall  hasalready  been described in previous reports.  Its development as  alocal community  centre  has  progressed, and  it  is satisfactory to record the continued  support  from voluntary  funds  and services,although much more will be needed if the Centre is to continue its work successfully.  A  scheme for the provision of  a playground and
 the conversion of derelict  stables to accommodate a boys&apos; club is being carried  out by local voluntary labour under the leadership and  guidance of Colonel  R.  B. Campbell,  C.B.E., D.S.O.,  M.A., Director of  Physical Education at Edinburgh University.    173. The Governing Body have drawn up proposals for the estab- lishment of a residential training scheme with the object of training leaders  who are undoubtedly  required for  all aspects of  social welfare   work.  These  proposals,  which  would  involve  further capital  expenditure and  increased  running costs,  are receiving consideration.   A tentative  approach  has been  made to  bodies concerned in the promotion of social welfare, but, while the response has been sympathetic, it is evident that there is a general desire for more definite information about the financial details of the proposed scheme  before they enter into commitments.   Accordingly, I have been asked  by the Governing Body whether I, as Commissioner, can provide further assistance.    174.  In my view it would be difficult to  justify the additional capital expenditure if the  premises  are merely  to serve as a local social service centre; I hope, however, that as a result of discussions now taking place it will prove possible to grant further assistance towards the  development of a  training centre.    175.  Before leaving this subject, I must record my regret at the resignation, owing to ill health, of  the Chairman of the  Governing Body, Colonel  S.  MacDonald,  C.M.G., D.S.O., Sheriff Substitute  of the  County  of Lanark,   The enthusiasm  and able  guidance  of Colonel  MacDonald has been  largely instrumental in the centre&apos;s success.   I am glad  that Mr. James A. Nimmo, who from the outset has taken an active interest in the centre, has consented to succeed him as Chairman.                   Welfare Work for Adolescents.                     fuvenile Organisations.   176.  It is impossible to over-emphasize the importance of welfare work for adolescents,  and  the part played in this matter by the well-known juvenile organisations, particularly in the congested and often drab conditions which exist in an industrial area.   Even in a period of prosperity, the facilities for this section of the community, at a vital stage in their lives, are sometimes difficult to establish and maintain, and  these difficulties  are immeasurably increased in  an area like the Scottish Special  Areas,  where the number of public- spirited  persons willing and able to  give voluntary and financial support is relatively very small.   177. From the outset of the Special Areas scheme, assistance byway of grant has been  provided to all the youth organisations, asshown in Appendix XIII, to enable them to develop the scope of their work, especially the provision of clubs, the organization of camping,
                                          168physical training and for the purpose of enabling unemployed adole-scents to take part in the activities on a basis of equality with theirfellows.    178. In assisting this work, it has been thought right to encourageonly those activities which had  a reasonable chance of maintaining their position, once established, with the assistance of local voluntarysupport; for obvious reasons it would be unwise to initiate an under-taking which, in the end, would prove to  be an impossible burden.Subject to this proviso, however, it has been the policy to providesuch assistance as the organisations concerned could profitably use.    179. It is a regrettable fact that there are  a number of smallcommunities where provision for youth welfare is still badly needed,but where, owing to the general impoverishment of the district, itappears impossible  to provide facilities for which the locality couldultimately take responsibility.   This  is a  problem which is causingme the greatest concern; the situation is here stressed in the hopethat voluntary support from other areas may be forthcoming whichwould justify a grant towards the initial establishment of premises.The type of  assistance I have in mind is  that given by the  british broadcasting Corporation in Scotland to the Blantyre OccupationalCentre.    180. Several generous offers of assistance have also been receivedfrom individual donors, by which a material part of the initial costs of a club establishment has been provided as well as funds towardsthe cost of operation and maintenance;  this has enabled me toprovide  a measure  of  assistance from public  funds.   A  notableexample of this is the Port Glasgow Boys&apos; Club, which I opened onthe 22nd September.  The sum of  1,118  was  given from  privatesources towards the cost of this club, which will be a lasting benefitto the youth of a district hitherto poorly equipped in  this respect.I have recently been able, as a result of generous local support, tooffer assistance on a similar basis to the Girls&apos; Clubs at Coatbridge andGreenock.  I venture to hope that other districts will attract similaroffers from voluntary sources which will enable these much  neededdevelopments to be extended to some of the small and  isolatedcommunities.    181. The grants  which have been made to the various organiza-tions have provided for a programme of development covering aperiod of three years.   I have throughout indicated my willingness to  consider assistance towards  such extensions  of the  programme as the organizations may be in a position to  undertake.    182. The welfare work for adolescents is, in some respects, withinthe scope of  the Physical Training and Recreation Act, and,  for thisreason, close contact has been maintained with the Scottish GrantsCommittee, in order to obviate the  possibility of  overlapping and
duplication.  By arrangement  with that Committee,  the  offer of grant made to the Boys&apos; Brigade in connection with the reconstruction of the premises at Balrossie,  Kilmacolm, was reduced by  3,000when the Grants Committee offered to provide a sum not exceeding 4,000 towards the cost of  the reconstruction, estimated at  7,500.I have throughout kept  in the closest  touch with the  ScottishJuvenile Welfare and After-Care Office.                         Holiday Camps. -   183. The Scottish Council for Community Service were enabledby  a grant offered by  my  predecessor to organize summer campsat Rothesay and South Queensferry.   During the 20-week period14th May to 30th September, 1937, 3,564 families comprising 19,331individuals  spent a week in camp.  These figures represent an in-crease of 221 families and 1,592 individuals over the corresponding figures for the preceding year while the costs met  from the SpecialAreas Fund for the 1936  and  1937  years were  10,707 and  12,534respectively.    184. Towards  the end  of  last year the Council  sought  myassistance  to  enable  them  to  continue their scheme;  on inquiry,it appeared unlikely that the necessary funds could be  obtainedfrom the Physical Training and Recreation Authorities. AccordinglyI agreed to make a further grant to meet any deficiency which mightbe  incurred.  The two camps were held again this year; detailedanalyses of the numbers and cost are not yet available.  I am satisfied that these camps have thoroughly justified their establish-ment and proved of exceptional value in providing many unemployedfamilies with  the opportunity  of a week&apos;s holiday by the sea.            Camping Facilities  for  School  Children.    185. Following the successful, though modest, scheme referred to in  paragraph  168  of the  Fourth Report, a further small grant was made  to  the  West  Lothian  Schools  Camping Association;  this enabled them to extend the provision of camping holidays for schoolchildren.   About  220  boys  from the Special Areas  enjoyed a fortnights holiday at the camp during the current year as comparedwith 112 in 1937.                Hugh Smiley Day Nursery, Paisley.    186. The  hut  at  the  Hugh  Smiley Day  Nursery, Paisley, mentioned  in  paragraph 170 of the  Fourth Report, was formally opened on 21st October, 1937.   As the final  cost of the scheme, viz.  586, was in excess of the revised estimated cost, I agreed to increase the grant to  520.  Classes  for children under 5. years of age are held in  the forenoons and it is hoped at an early date to form a Mothers&apos; Club with a view to  disseminating knowledge on child welfare.
      Nursery School at Elgin Street Pttblic School, Clydebank.   187. After consulting  the  Scottish  Education  Department,  agrant was  offered to the County Council  of  Dunbarton to assist in the provision of a nursery school at the Elgin Street public school,Clydebank.   The work of construction is now proceeding and it  isexpected that it will be completed by the end of this year.   No otherproposal of this nature has been submitted by Local Authorities inthe Special Areas.       Children&apos;s  Playground at  Craigieknowes, Greenock.   188. The  construction of the  toddlers&apos; playground, and a hut to accommodate about 50 children, on ground owned by the corporation of Greenock (see paragraph 171 of the Fourth Report) has now beencompleted  at a total  cost  of  822.  This amount exceeded theestimated capital cost; however, I agreed to increase the grant of 438 to  600.  The Corporation  have undertaken responsibility forthe control and maintenance of  the scheme.             National Union of  Townswomen&apos;s Guilds.   189. Paragraph  172 of the  Fourth Report  indicated that anapplication  for  further  assistance  was under consideration.   Afurther grant of  120  has now  been made to the organization toenable them  to establish new branches of the Townswomen&apos;s Guildin the Special Areas.                    Newbattle Abbey College.   190. An application has recently been received from  NewbattleAbbey College asking for assistance to  increase  the  number of students.   I  have no doubt that there are many men in the  SpecialAreas to whom a course of study  at this working men&apos;s college wouldbe of lasting value.  There are certain difficulties in offering a grant,particularly in view of the fact  that the college is situated outside theSpecial Areas.  It is a matter for regret that I found it impossible toassist this  most valuable development.      Summary of Schemes approved and under consideration.   191. Details of the assistance offered in respect of all schemes approved up  to 30th September,  1938, are given in Appendix I. the authorised  commitments amounted to  4,200,964, involving a totalexpenditure of  7,683,325, the latter figure being exclusive of thecapital brought into the Areas by the new firms being established on the Industrial Estates  and elsewhere in the Areas.   particulars of schemes under consideration are given in Appendix II.
                          PART  III.                    GENERAL CONCLUSIONS.                   The Nature of the Problem.   192. The  foregoing part of this Report shows in sonie detail the progress which has been made  since August, 1937, in the workwhich  I have continued or initiated since I became  Commissionerjust over a year ago.  It now remains to indicate the salient featuresas I see them, and to discuss how far these problems may be said tohave been solved, and how far they persist. For reasons which willbe clear to the reader of this Report,  I welcome the decision of theGovernment  to  continue  the  Acts for a  further period.   I have proceeded, on the assumption that in the course of the next twelvemonths the Government will have before  them the Report  of theRoyal Commission on the Geographical Distribution of the industrial population,  and that  they will then wish  to  consider whether theSpecial Areas legislation should be replaced by some further  pro-vision.  I have,  therefore, attempted  in  this Report  to  indicatemy views with that possibility in mind.   193. The  problem  of  the  scheduled  Special Areas has been described many times, and  its nature is fairly  well understood.They are not only districts which have  suffered for an extendedperiod from severe unemployment;  they present a further  essential feature in that unemployment  has   arisen  through  the  reducedopportunities  of employment  in  one  or two  of the basic primaryindustries.  These  industries suffer  most severely  from cyclicalvariations and are dependent to a large extent  for their prosperityupon demand in international markets.   It  follows that an  area which is mainly dependent for its economic life upon such industries will suffer most severely and most immediately  when a trade cyclebegins to manifest itself.  Conversely,  such an  area will get a fullshare in the prosperity in the subsequent  boom, but the nature ofthat restored prosperity is sometimes  forgotten.  If the depressionhas  been deep  and prolonged, recovery  is  slow and  incompletebecause of deterioration in the general quality and  diminution inthe amount of effective equipment and  supply of  skilled workpeople.Later the boom acquires full impetus, but even then it provides lessthan full employment and is actually dangerous because it obscuresthe fact that the area is still vulnerable and will revert to&apos;a state of depression when the boom has spent its force.   194. A boom in the  heavy industries  is,  therefore,  little morethan a temporary relief for such an area.  Since a disproportionatedependence upon these industries is the root  of the evil, it follows that the object must be to change the unstable industrial equilibrium
168by  the  introduction of as many  secondary industries as can be induced to establish themselves there, or as the area can  economi-cally maintain.  At the same time it is  of importance to safeguard the interest of existing industries so long as they can take a healthyplace in the  economic structure of  the district.  That broadly isthe policy underlying the Special  Areas  Acts.  These  secondary industries, being dependent more upon the home markets of thecountry as a whole than upon foreign demand, feel the effect of a trade cycle less  immediately and  less keenly than the primaryindustries.  Many of them produce what  a few years ago  wereluxuries  but have  now  come to  be regarded as necessities, thedemand for which is inelastic within wide variations in the general trade position.    195. In theory it  is necessary to decide what is the  optimumproportion to be aimed  at in the  district  between primary and secondary industries, and thereafter to decide what public services ofall  kinds  are required.  In practice  in the Special Areas the point at which such a question will have more than a theoretical importance is far distant.  Broadly it has had  to be assumed that the  urbanpopulation will not greatly change its size or industrial make-up inthe near future, and that  the necessary  public services ought there-fore to be brought  into a satisfactory state  on something like theirexisting scale.    196. The  problem of  attracting fresh   industry  and helpingexisting industry has  been tackled in a  number of ways both direct and indirect.  The aims  have been first  to make the place  more attractive, secondly to improve the  quality oi; the labour supply,and thirdly to offer direct inducements.  The steps taken to achieve these aims may be divided into the five following categories :     (1) Public and Health Service. Prolonged depression has  mademany of  the districts unattractive.  Public  services, such as  water,sewage, hospitals and roads need constant rejuvenation and upkeep,and have themselves created a  burden which  an impoverishedcommunity cannot sustain.  Accordingly  the  Local authorities throughout the Areas have been assisted to  modernise their servicesthrough the  provision of  grant.  This has avoided an unreasonableburden upon rates already heavily loaded by the demands of publicassistance on  a reduced valuation.  The object is to ensure that thepublic services in these communities shall not suffer by reason of theheavy unemployment which the district has had to carry, but shallbe  at least equal to anything which  a prospective industrialist could expect to find in any other part of the country.    (2) Amenity Schemes. Secondly, a  good deal  has been done toprovide playing fields and public parks, to clear away unsightlyindustrial debris, and to abolish  the drabness which  at one timeseems to have been regarded as a sign of industrial solidity.
   (3)  Social Service-, Welfare, Training Classes and Land Schemes. Thirdly,  the morale and employability of the industrial population has been maintained by the  establishment of social service centres,welfare activities, of many kinds, assistance in the provision of plotsand  allotments,  various forms  of  agricultural and horticulturaloccupation and physical training classes.  This work is supplementary to the scheme of training and instructional centres conducted by theMinistry of Labour, the main object of  which is, however, to givea proportion of the unemployed  population  a chance to seek freshopportunities  in other districts.   (4)  Housing. Fourthly,  a programme of housing development has been instituted which is  additional to that which Local Autho-rities could already do with State help.   (5)  Industrial Indticement. Fifthly,  a more direct attack uponthe problem has been made by the provision  of factories and factorysites, bQth on trading estates  and elsewhere; by grants in the form ofcontributions  towards overhead charges such as rent, rates and taxesto tide over the difficult years which the industrialist transferring toa new area has to face; and by making loan capital  available, aprovision which is supplemented by the  Nuffield Trust Fund.  Thisis in addition to a  measure of preference which  the Governmenthave undertaken to give to depressed areas in placing contracts andlocating new Government factories.   197. By this combined attack, both direct and indirect, it is hoped to strengthen the economic structure and, by reviving the spirit ofthe  Areas, to recreate a robust social  life.  Prolonged depressiontends  to  bring the life of the community almost to a completestandstill.  A healthy social framework is just  as  important as themost perfectly devised industrial structure.   198. These methods  are justified if they succeed in the long run,and  are probably sounder  economicaUy than any other.  Theypresuppose that the area is a  &quot; depressed,&quot; or, if the term is preferred,a  &quot;special&quot;  area,  but  not a  &quot;derelict&quot; area.   Some  districts,fortunately rare  m the  Scottish Areas,  are  almost whoUy derelict.That is to say their geographical situation and lack of amenities and natural resources are such that it is useless  to hope for any revivalwhatsoever.   Dependence upon  one basic industry has been com-plete, and exhaustion of raw materials,  or a change in demand, hastaken it away, and nothing can replace it.    199.  It is  true that in Scotland this  element is  present in many areas,  but it is a contributory and rarely the predominant factor inthe  situation.  It exists rather in the special sense that it is likely that some of the areas will not again be restored to their full formeremployment capacity.   Where this situation exists, even in a smalldegree, it is necessary to face certain consequences.  There is heavyunemployment, particularly among  the older  men,  and the basicprimary industries do not even during periods of  good trade, as at
present, provide employment for more than a proportion of the menwho previously depended upon  them for  their livelihood.  one reason for this is that mechanisation and labour-saving devices havemade enormous strides in the last two decades.  In the coal industry the approaching exhaustion of the better coal measures and the need to exploit more difficult seams, have driven Scotland further along the road to mechanisation  than  has been necessary in the  easierconditions  of some of the English and Welsh fields;  the processhas  continued,  until  to-day  over three-quarters  of  the coal ismechanically cut.  Where a few years  ago ten men were needed toproduce a given amount  of  coal now nine only are required.  Theeffect  of this is greater  than the percentage reduction suggestsbecause of the  large employment  given by  coalmining per unit of output.  In iron and steel the change has been more spectacular.It is probably not generally  realised that in straight production theoutput per man has increased about threefold during the last twenty years.  This means that when, as at the present time, rearmamentand some general revival has temporarily restored output to some-thing like  its pre-depression scale both on the Clyde and  in  the surrounding coal fields, nevertheless  the number of men employedis much lower than it would have been  a few years ago.  The result is that the older men who during years of unemployment  have lostsomething  of their former  skill, have little or no hope of beingreabsorbed into  their occupations; and these are the very  peoplewhom it is most difficult to transfer into the new secondary industries which  are being attracted into the area.   200. Like others, I have  been  driven to the conclusion, unpalat-able as it may be, that no solution which aimg at getting these oldermen back into ordinary wage-earning employment  can  whollysucceed, and that there will always be a fringe for whom  the most that can be done is  to  provide  some form of what  my Englishcolleague has described as &quot;  sub-economic employment.&quot;  A limited number of experiments in this category have been carried  out inthe Scottish  Areas,  but  they have not all been  successful. Theessential difficulty in this work is that  it involves providing advan-tages for those  who have long given up the  struggle in preference to others who are manfully refusing to give way before hard circum-stances.  Even with  the best administration  it must encouragethose  who  are losing hope to give up  the effort.   However,  if themeasures designed to readjust the balance in the economic  structure of the  Areas succeed, the problem will gradually disappear  and inthe meantime opportunity is increasing for all and especially for the younger people.   201. The heavy primary  industries  will always be the backboneof the Scottish Areas, but it is probably too much to hope that theintroduction of  light industries will do more  than provide employ-ment  for a proportion  of  the  surplus  thrown up from the  heavy
industries.   In other words so far as can be  foreseen at presentmany of these Areas will never again provide employment  for as many people as they were able to carry during the last  period of prosperity.  This fact is recognized in, for instance, the scheme oftransference which  the Ministry of Labour has been administeringwith success over a period of some twelve or  thirteen years.   202. While such a movement of population creates problems, itis  not,  in  my view,  an unhealthy  development. The  economicinstability is due largely to the fact that the technique of production has outstripped that of distribution;  the natural and healthy trend in years to come must be in the direction of greater employment inthe distributive and allied services, rather than in production. this movement has been most marked in recent years, but it has not been so rapid as  to absorb the surplus in  the primary producing areas.In the wide  sense  distribution includes not  only the  retail trade,transport and commerce but also Government service, the profes-sions;  banking and  insurance.   A  general movement  towardsincreased employment in  the  distributive services in  this sensemeans that the concentration  of the industrial population  in theareas of primary production is no longer necessary or desirable.   203. In the light of these  broad general considerations, it isnecessary to examine how far it has been possible  to proceed in theScottish  Areas and to consider what further steps require to betaken.                   The Unemployment Position.   204. In such an examination it is customary as a first test to look at the  unemployment figures.  They must,  however, be usedwith caution.  The problem of a Special Area is not disposed of even where unemployment  has been  reduced to  a negligible pro-portion unless that reduction has  been brought  about by factors which will minimize its vulnerability  during the next trade depres-sion.  Conversely,  the figures may not show much improvement,but if it has  been possible to readjust the economic balance of theAreas in such a way as to reduce the risk of a serious setback duringthe next slump, then I think that the  problem is on its  way towardssolution.  The object of the Special Areas Acts is  not  immediately,and at the expense of other considerations, to  reduce unemployment.The methods envisaged are more fundamental and in the long run, ifthey succeed, more effective.  Even  if alongside  the  more  funda-mental  treatment of the problem every opportunity is taken to alleviate distress by palliative measures, it is necessary  to remember that relief schemes  as such are  not  within the scope or spirit of theSpecial Areas Acts.   205. The facts with regard to the unemployment position at thepresent time in the Scottish Areas are  set out in Part II of thisReport, and the relevant Appendices.   While from December, 1934,to mid-1937 unemployment fell from 94,998 to 58,318, it will be seen
 that through the past year it  has risen to  64,435.  It is  worth noting, on the other hand, that the number of men who had been out of work for twelve months or more fell from 28,983 in December, 1934, to 17,640 in June, 1937, and to 15,282 in June, 1938, an indication that the so-called &quot; hard core &quot; is not insoluble.   The improvement shown up to about a year ago was mainly the result of the general recovery.  During the past  year  the trade recession has had its effect  upon  the  figures,  an  effect which would have been more noticeable but for the influence of rearmament.  Generally speaking, as in the previous year, the main recovery is in the heavy industries which, while welcome, does not contribute to  a permanent solution of the real problem, and, indeed, by obscuring that problem, may, as I have said, retard its  solution.  In the West of Scotland  money is not easily found  for  anything but the heavy industries,  the traditions of which  have been  inherited.  That  may  have been sound economics in the days of Adam Smith.  To-day it cannot be defended with the same conviction.   It will be a tragedy if, in spite of the efforts being made to tackle the problem of these Areas they&apos; are thrown back once more upon periods of feverish activity inter- spersed with spells of acute depression.    206. It will be noted that large  numbers of men registered as formerly engaged in  these heavy industries  remain out of work. In coal mining, for instance, the figures still stand  at an average of 7,977  during the year ended June, 1938.  Yet the  coal masters say that no efficient skilled man is out of a job and that in some districts they cannot get men.  Such an opinion cannot be  dismissed lightly and  I have  tried  during the past year to  reconcile  the seeming discrepancy.   It is, I think, generally realised that the Ministry of Labour figures can be greatly reduced if unskilled workers  are left out of account.   Moreover,  the balance  of skilled men includes a number of the older men who will probably not get further work.  To arrive at a hard and fast conclusion on this is not easy.  It is common knowledge that in the last two years men who up  to that time had been  regarded by the coal masters as unemployable in the  mining industry have returned to work.   It is, however,  difficult to avoid the conclusion that the men now left unemployed are unlikely  ever to get work in the industry again.     207. To this statement there must be  one qualification.   It is frequently said that although there are perhaps  a few thousand men  available throughout the  Areas, they are not available where they  are  needed.  In other words,  output could  be increased and new seams opened up in certain districts, if sufficient  men for the purpose were resident in the locality.  Transference is rendered impossible through lack of houses.  An inquiry into the number of men  who would be both suitable and likely to move if houses  were available suggested that the number might  not amount to more than four or five hundred, but a reliable estimate is difficult because many
 men who profess themselves unwilling to move might modify their attitude if, in  fact, they knew that  they had steady work and a house to go to.     208.  I have used coal mining as the most outstanding example, but it can, broadly speaking, be said of the  other heavy industries also, that there is a surplus which can never  be absorbed except by transference to other work or by training to a new occupation.     209.  The conclusion to be drawn from the figures of unemploy- ment as a whole, so far as they provide an answer, is that while the foundations being  laid are sound, the problem is not yet  nearing solution.   It is, however, necessary to emphasise that the effect of the Commissioners work up to the present time is only beginning to be felt.  The greater part of the schemes of public  work approved for assistance has still to be carried out.  Although these schemes were  not initiated as a means of relieving unemployment, they have a valuable secondary effect of this kind while they are being carried out.  The industrial schemes which  do provide increased employ- ment. more immediately are as yet only in their infancy.     210.  I should like now to discuss more specifically in relation to* each  of  the  five broad categories set out in paragraph  196 what stage has been reached in the treatment of the problem.                     Health and Public Services.     211.  These include water supply, sewerage and sewage disposal schemes, hospitals and  road works.   Except for the  last  named, assistance from  the Special Areas Fund has been  available for nearly four years and it  may be that the schemes  in operation or accepted for grant will, when completed, bring the  level in a large part  of the Special Areas approximately up to that of comparable districts elsewhere.  In reaching this conclusion one has to assume that the volume of population and locality of development  will not change fundamentally.  On this assumption the limit of  justifiable provision will soon have been reached, except in so far as it may be possible to promote some further measure of reorganised provision and regionalisation of certain services, e.g.  hospitals.  This last is a matter which I hope to discuss further during the coming year with the Local Authorities concerned and with the Department of Health.                         Amenity Schemes.     212.  In these schemes much of value has already been under-  taken, although  difficulties of acquisition and cost  have  prevented more from being done.   The problem of dealing with bings is one  to which I have given considerable thought,  but I have been unable to find  any satisfactory solution, and would welcome  any  new, thoughtful suggestions.  No practicable  method of  extinguishing  a burning bing has yet been devised.   Various attempts at afforestation-  tion are still of doubtful value and in any case only effective in the
case of isolated bings.  Some bings are being used for industrial purposes.   Certain  coal and shale  bings can now be used in themanufacture of bricks, and a process has also been evolved for usingblast furnace slag as  a building material.  It is unlikely, however,that these industrial  purposes will ever do more than touch thefringe of the problem; its ultimate solution can only be reached bysome method  of  fertilisation not yet discovered,&apos; or by facing thevery heavy expense of partial levelling.  In the meantime, all that can be done is, where possible, to avoid putting new housing schemes in places rendered unsightly or unhealthy by the presence of a bing.Even so, little purpose is  served in beautifying existing bings until it is possible to control the location of new  ones.        Social Service, Welfare, Training Classes and Land.    213. These schemes include physical training classes, conducted on  the Commissioners behalf by the  Ministry of  Labour, social service centres,  assistance to youth  organisations,  holiday  camps and various horticultural and agricultural schemes.    214. Many of these have been in existence for nearly four years.In some cases, if and when the Special Areas Acts are replaced byother legislation, it would be desirable to provide for their  con-  -tinuance  by some  other  authority.  I  refer in particular to  the physical training classes  which  have  been conducted with suchmarked keenness and enthusiasm.  It may also be  necessary tomake further provision for the encouragement of the model occupa-tional centres conducted on my behalf by the Scottish Council for community Service during Unemployment.   I hope that it may alsobe  possible to ensure the future of Carfin Hall, which has been successfully established as a local community centre and is now onthe  threshold of  the  next stage of its development as a centre fortraining club  leaders. There has hitherto been no such centre inScotland  and its value for this purpose is beyond question.  Theprovision of holiday  camps for unemployed men  and their familiesis one of  the most  useful  and satisfactory  pieces of  work which the,Scottish Council for Community Service has had the opportunity oftackling,  and I hope that there also it may  be possible to make provision for the future.   Certain of the youth welfare movementsmight also find it difficult to carry on effectively in the Special Areasif the assistance provided by the  Commissioner  ceases; here,  too,I hope that legislative changes will not prevent assistance to thesemost useful movements until such time as they can be. reasonablyexpected  to become independent of public  funds.    215. One  task  which is  of vital  importance  remains to  be accomplished.  I refer to the absence of  any serious  attempt toco-ordinate the activities of the various social service organisationsin Scotland.  A  planned  economy for  Scotland calls for a plannedvoluntary social  service and  the realisation that in this sphere asin  that of certain departments of Governmental expenditure the
wealthier must subsidise the poorer areas.  I should consider that further expenditure from the Special Areas Fund  would be  fully justified if it resulted in  welding into  a strong national body thevarious organisations which are  at present doing fine work in  most difficult circumstances.  I propose to pursue this question.   216. In regard to land schemes I have found it more convenient to comment in Part II in the course of examining the actual schemes.                            Housing.   217. There  are  two important branches of the  Commissionersactivities, namely  housing  and  industrial development,  in whichprogress is still urgently required.  So  far as housing is concerned,a description has been given in  Part II of this Report of what ithas been possible to achieve during  the past year.  Prior to thatno direct assistance had been given from the Special Areas Fund todeal with the problem which, in itself, is one of the most serious inthe Areas, and one of the biggest obstacles to  any substantial re-habilitation.  Under the energetic Chairmanship of Sir  David AllanHay the Special Areas Housing Association has been able to makea good start.  Its work in demonstrating what can be done  with alternative methods of building construction will have lasting value.When  the Association began its work comparatively little use hadbeen made  in  Scotland of  poured concrete and  timber construc-tion.   A  substantial part of the necessary exploratory work hasnow been completed, and I confidently  expect that the Associationwill soon be in a position to build houses on a large scale.   218. I have, nevertheless, felt for some time that  careful con-sideration ought to be given to the possibility of  extending thescope of the Association in certain directions.  At the present time it does not touch directly such problems as the provision of houses to meet  the needs  of expanding  or shifting industry, the provisionof houses for  newly  married  couples, or the reconditioning  ofexisting  properties.  Of the three the first is perhaps the  mostimportant.  Some  degree  of elasticity  is  possible  under Scottishlegislation in regard  to  rehousing  schemes  initiated  by CountyCouncils.  If a County Council  foresees an industrial development in one part of  its area which will be hindered by  lack of housing,it can provide  houses in anticipation  of  actual  demand on theassumption  that those to be employed  in that  development will betransferred  from other parts of its area.  Such  provision  must,however,  show that it has effected decrowding or slum clearancein other parts of the county and in practice, moreover, this power has  not been  widely  used.  Every  district has  its own housingshortage, and serious  objection  is naturally taken to the accom-modation of newcomers in  preference  to local  residents.  anyone who moves  to  a new district always finds  accommodation difficultto obtain.
   219.  An  interesting  example  of  what  can be  done  to  meet this  situation  is  described  in  Paragraph  114  of this Report.The  Nuffield  Trust have  devised  a  most  useful  scheme  toprovide houses for the  coal  mining industry.  Assistance of thiskind could,  with  advantage,  be carried  further.   Moreover, theproblem is not confined to the coal mining industry.  There areone or two  instances, and in the next  year or two there will bemore, where  expanding  industry  has  created peculiar housingproblems  which cannot be dealt with  by  the ordinary  methodsunder existing legislation.  I  am  therefore  considering whethersomething on similar lines cannot be done by the Housing Associa-tion and am in consultation with that body and with the Depart-ments concerned.   220.  With  regard to the other problems mentioned in the pre-ceding paragraph,  viz. housing of newly married  couples andreconditioning, both merit sympathetic consideration,  and I hopethat  the time  will come when it may be possible  to tackle  themsystematically. At the present stage it is  necessary to recognisethat no extension of the methods by which the housing shortage isbeing attacked is justifiable if it is likely to hinder the solution ofthe main problems of slums  and crowding.   That aspect of thequestion will be borne in  mind in any arrangements which it maybe possible to  make for  the building of houses to meet the needs of expanding and shifting industry.  In the case of  reconditioning,  Ihad  hoped  that  I might  have  found  myself   able  to  makedefinite proposals on  this subject,  but my  examination of theproblem has forced me to the conclusion that at the-present time,when there is  a shortage of skilled labour in some  of the buildingtrades,  any large  scale  reconditioning policy would inevitablyinterfere with  progress  in dealing with  the  evils of the slums andovercrowding.   I think,  however, that as soon as the labour supply position shows definite signs of improvement, serious consideration should be given  to the   advisability  of  including  a  policy  ofreconditioning or modernisation  of property  that is  structurallysound as  part of  a balanced  attack on the  deplorable  housing conditions that exist in  our urban areas.                    Industrial Developments.   221. I come now to the consideration of the measures designed as a direct stimulus to industrial development.  Unlike most of theother measures, which have had a four years&apos; trial, these have had little more than one year of effective life, and a final judgment upon their  efficacy would be  premature.   It is,  however, necessary toendeavour to make some assessment.
                           Hillington.   222. The Hillington  Trading  Estate is the  most  significantdevelopment in the Scottish Area.  Although set up  under the1934 Act, it was not established until last year, and the first factorybecame available  less than twelve months ago.   In  that time,however, it  has made sufficient progress to dispel  the fallacy thatthe Areas are incapable of expanding and diversifying  their lightindustries.   It  further demonstrates the value of trading estatesas a means  of encouraging and directing expansion.  It is chargingeconomic rents and most of its tenants have had no special induce-ments from the Special Areas Fund.  Moreover,  it is  in a very favourable  location, and was designed as a  scheme  of  regionalrather than local planning.  Most  of the new factories  would nothave  been in existence at all if Hillington had not been there.   Ithas been criticised  on  the ground that even when fully developedit will not provide  employment for more than about 15,000 work-people.  I consider, however, that  an estate giving employment  tothat number and supporting at least twice as many is of reasonablesize.  Indeed, I venture  to hope  that the value  of this kind  ofdevelopment will be so  clearly demonstrated  that others  will be promoted elsewhere.   223. Such  developments might well  be   part of   a  plannedeconomy throughout the country which would involve the considera-tion  of public services, including  transport  and  housing.  It  isnoteworthy  that in many industrial areas there is no person or bodywho is even charged with the oversight of all public services or in aposition to consider methods of co-ordination.  If industrial estatesbecame common they naturally could not be  expected to createentirely  new  employment.  Their  function would  be rather  toregroup existing enterprise in the most  efficient and geographicallydesirable  units.  Some  expansion would undoubtedly  follow  re-grouping.   224. I have been particularly  struck by  the  value of havingfactories ready and available for the prospective tenants.  In somecases  tenants have been lost because factories were not completed and ready  for occupation  at  the  time  of  application.  The time taken to build a factory has been  rather longer than usual duringmost  of the past year owing to the demands made on the buildingindustry from  other quarters.  The trading estates owe  much  oftheir  success to building in  advance of orders, and I hope that thiswill be continued freely.                        North Lanarkshire.   225. Three  more modest  experiments in  trading estates havebeen  begun in  Lanarkshire.  These estates, situated at  Chapelhall,Carfin and Larkhall, are, like Hillington, designed to serve a district
rather  than a place.  Their future is naturally still problematical,but it has been clear from the outset that they raise some different considerations.   At Hillington the special inducements  providedby the Acts  are in the main unnecessary.  Whether that  will bethe case in the near future in North Lanarkshire is difficult to say.In the meantime, I am prepared to give financial help on a generousscale in order to attract new industries.   226. North  Lanarkshire presents the most difficult problem inthe Special Areas. The three trading estates and the public works which have been initiated  in  the  county  constitute  the  beginningof what will, I hope, be a supreme justification of the Special AreasActs.   The district forms part of the industrial area of the Clyde,and it is not its geographical situation which is at fault so much asthe accumulated waste of  industrial depression.   Unsightly indus-trial rubbish, derelict buildings, neglected amenities  and  a surplusof population unemployed, all representing the debris of  a  passingindustry, have been  at the roots of the problem;  but fortunatelythese features are  now disappearing and a large measure  of generalreconstruction  has commenced.   Such drastic  and  fundamental changes, however, cost money, and must be  judged on the  longview.   The full achievement is beyond the resources and  powers ofthe community unless they  are generously helped from  outsidesources.  The help so far given has been almost entirely directed towards  the reconstruction of the  essential health  and  public services, and most of what can be done with that object has alreadybeen initiated.   The establishment  of  the  new industrial layout ofthe area has barely commenced.  It involves the introduction ofnew industries  on a  large scale, and will take a considerable  timeto complete.  I regard the  continuance of the various forms ofencouragement and positive assistance  to  new industries described in the  following paragraphs  as of exceptional importance in this case.           Contributions towards Rent, Rates and Taxes.   227. The exact value of the power to make contributions towardsrent, rates and taxes is not easy  to assess.   These remissions areinterchangeable with and complementary to other forms of financialassistance, but their special utility  arises from the fact that they arethe only  free grant  to industry which the  Acts provide.  TheS.A.R.A. loans and those made by  the Treasury Committee carry a commercial rate of interest and all  factories are let at an economicrent.   The fact must be faced that a combination of circumstanceshas reduced the attraction of the  worst hit areas which only some means  of  temporary subsidisation will counterbalance.  Moreover,these remissions have proved of attraction to the larger and wealthier
 concerns who are not  in need of loans  but are interested in the direct inducement of a monetary grant.   Accordingly, if they are used with  discretion and confined substantially  to the worst parts of the Areas, they have a real value and are in my  view fully justified.                      Provision of Factories.    228. The other form  of  inducement  for the administration of which I am directly responsible is the provision of factories on sites not forming part of the  trading  estates.  So far developments of this kind have  been few.  It is  difficult to  find disused factories suitable  for acquisition and  adaptation, both because  roofs  have often been removed  to avoid payment of owners&apos;  rates, and because the factories have  mainly  been  used  for  heavy industries.  The danger of subsidence due to mineral workings reduces the number of sites suitable for new  buildings.   Certain developments, however, in  connection  with the  present rearmament  programme  may stimulate the provision of rented factories in the  course of the next year.                       Financial Assistance.    229. I have no responsibility for the administration of the other financial organisations operating in the Areas, but by the courtesy of the Nuffield Trustees and Lord Portal, I am  able to give some figures.  Up to  30th September, 1938,  the assistance  given to the Scottish Area has been as follows : Nuffield Trust  275,700; Treasury Committee    45,000; Special  Areas  Reconstruction  Association 210,500; Total   531,200.  Capital from other  sources amounted to  351,300, bringing the total of capital introduced up to  882,500. In all, 46 cases were  assisted  of which some also received help in theform of a contribution  towards  the cost of rent,  rates  and taxes or the  provision of a  factory.   The  employment  to be provided isestimated  to be 4,381.   The corresponding figures for Englandand Wales  are : Capital  provided  by  the above  organisations 3,134,201, and other capital  2,540,490, making a  total of  5,674,691.The number of cases assisted is 151 and the estimate of employment 16,718.    230. These figures  suggest that it is more difficult to attractindustry to the Scottish Area than to some of the  other areas.  ThatI believe to be the case and it may be that in future legislation more generous provision such as loans at lower  rates of interest and more generous remissions  will  have  to  be considered for  areas whereexperience  shows that attraction is difficult.   At  present manyfirms have definite views as to the area in which they wish to established themselves and  the  inducements are  insufficient  to influence themto go elsewhere.
    231.  In general it can be said that while the Scottish Areas have had their full share of the smaller concerns only a few big under- takings have come to the Areas.  Clearly, however, if inducements are to be seriously used  as a means of attracting industry to any part of  the country  they must be big enough to produce results unless they are counterbalanced by restriction upon the establish- ment of new enterprise in other districts.  While it may be necessary in  the light of fuller experience to give this question  careful con- sideration, at this stage the results only emphasise that a period of one or even two years is not long enough to enable a firm judgment to be formed.                          Share Capital.    232.  The question does arise, however, whether some provision should not now be considered  against the time when the resources of the Nuffield Trustees will be exhausted.   The peculiar  value of Viscount Nuffield&apos;s generous provision has been that, free from the restrictions  which hedge  in the expenditure  of public money, the Trustees have, in many cases, been able to take up a part of the share capital in the concerns which they have assisted.  This is a valuable power.   If a new concern has  sound backing  it can usually raise loan capital in the open market, but in times  of depression the sub- scription of its ordinary share  capital may be difficult.   It cannot overburden itself with loan capital,  and so the Treasury Fund provided by the  Acts, which can offer  only this form of capital, is unable to assist.    233. I feel diffident about  expressing a definite  opinion on  so intricate a  question as the extent to which it  is right to risk public money in the share capital in an industrial concern.  The objections are obvious.   At the same time I feel that the absence of the power in future to help new undertakings by a subscription to their share capital will make it more difficult to achieve  substantial results  in the Special Areas and it is arguable that it is justifiable to risk losing something now in the hope of  reducing in the long run the heavy financial burden which directly  and indirectly in numerous  ways is imposed upon the Exchequer by these Areas.               Assistance to Experimental Processes.   234. I have felt for some time that more might be done  to help new and experimental processes.  At the present time the Depart-ment of Scientific and Industrial Research can within certain limits assist at  the laboratory stage of a new process.  The next  stage is the &quot; try-out &quot; on a semi-commercial scale, but  for this no Govern-ment help  is made available either directly  or indirectly.   Manynew processes  never reach maturity through lack of capital  at this extent M  19300C
critical stage.   In such cases an opportunity to establish a valuablenew industry may  be lost.   I  consider that a scheme  designed to foster new enterprise in the Area should include encouragement ofsuch new and experimental processes, even though in the nature ofthings their ultimate success  is bound to be problematical.  I hopethat in the forthcoming review of the problem careful consideration will be given to this question.                        Overseas Publicity.   235. The power of  the  Commissioners  to  assist in  overseasadvertising is extremely limited.  Publicity in America, for instance,would be of great value, and would, in my view, repay the necessaryexpenditure by attracting new  capital and industrial  enterprisesfrom  overseas.   In saying this I fully recognise the  help given bythe Department of Overseas Trade and the Travel Associations, butthe Commissioners might with advantage be empowered  to increasethe scope of their assistance.  With proper limitation of assistanceto firms who would not compete with existing industry more couldbe achieved in  bringing in from abroad persons with  new processes and fresh ideas.                  Other Industrial Developments.   236. Whilst much of my attention has necessarily been directed to the various activities aimed at  attracting new industry to theAreas, I have also continued to take an interest in the other questionswhich have an important bearing upon its economic future and  inthe paragraphs which follow I comment briefly upon certain of these.                         Oil Production.   237. In  connection with the  progress  and development  ofindustries which  affect directly or indirectly the basic industries,I have continued my interest in the question of oil from coal.   no progress has so far been possible in the direction of introducing a lowtemperature carbonisation plant, although the extended government guarantee which  resulted from  the deliberations of the FalmouthCommittee may  yet  produce  results.   Meantime  I  am glad  to note that the shale industry of the  Lothians has  been able,  as aresult of  the increased preference, to extend  its crude oil plants, re-open two mines  and open two  new mines.  These extensions will put an end to the spread-over arrangements under which more than half of the 4,000  odd men now employed are still working and giveemployment to nearly 600 additional men.   I venture to hope that further developments will be possible later.
               Gas Supplies in the West of Scotland.   238, I have continued to take an interest in this question.  Theeconomic  employment of industrial gas is vital for the West ofScotland.   Unless gas from coke ovens can be used, the productionof pig iron, already so seriously diminished, will cease and such aresult  must directly affect  the steel and shipbuilding industries.It is a matter for regret that the negotiations between the glasgow corporation and Messrs. Dixon&apos;s have not yet reached a satisfactory conclusion, and in the interests of the whole area I hope that some basis of agreement may yet be found.   239. I have also been interested in the continued considerationof further developments in the Coatbridge and Airdrie districts andhave explored with the  various parties  concerned  some means oflinking up such  developments  throughout  the  neighbourhood.I have indicated that I am prepared to do everything which is withinmy powers under the Special Areas Acts to expedite this development,and  I trust that the opportunity presented by this offer will not be overlooked.   240. This question of gas supplies in  the West of Scotland is ofsuch vital importance  that  if arrangements on a voluntary basisprove  impossible, I have no hesitation in recommending  that a statutory  authority with wide powers be set up whose duty it willbe to buy from the industrial producer and  sell to the  domesticconsumer.  In an area such as  this where the State has such a bigliability in the event of severe industrial depression, it cannot allowwaste of resources to continue unchecked.           Aerodrome Provision in the West of Scotland.    241. Public attention  has for some time been  directed to theabsence in the West of Scotland of a civil aerodrome which could be developed to  the  scale laid down in the Maybury  Report.   Theeconomic  loss to the  area may in time be considerable unless thesituation is rectified;  I have during the year been in close  consul-tation with the Air Ministry and the Local Authorities concerned.    242. If it proves impossible to find a suitable site for an aerodromea scheme which I  have had in mind for some  time may be worthserious examination.  It should be possible to acquire a bing andthe surrounding land at a reasonable price and I believe  that itwould be practicable to level them and lay out a first class aerodrome.Such a scheme, while expensive, would be of the utmost value both to the district and to the  country.   I intend to have this proposalconsidered, more closely.
                   Government Contracts.   243. As  recorded elsewhere in  this  Report the  scottish development Council through  the Economic  Committee  have lost no opportunity of  inducing the Government to place as many  contracts  as  possible  in  the  Areas,  and  I  have endeavoured to co-operate closely both with the Committee andwith the Government Departments concerned.   I am not,  how-ever,  satisfied that the  potentialities of these  Areas are beingcompletely utilised.  It  is to be regretted that the opportunityafforded by the air programme has  not so far been used fully to develop in Scotland the very industries which more than anyother  would  have helped  to  achieve  a  sound  economicequilibrium.                    Economic  Committee.   244. It is right that I  should acknowledge the  great  help which I have received from the Economic Committee under theable  chairmanship of Sir  Steven Bilsland.  The  information which they  have made  available has been of  very great value.Their reports deal in detail with many aspects of the economic position in  the Areas and I have not thought it  necessary  tocover the  same ground.                    Trade Union Position.   245. The Chairman  of the Slough Trading  Estate, in his evi-dence before  the  Royal  Commission  on the geographical distribution of the  Industrial Population,  said that &quot; the manu-facturer in light industries will not willingly face  the labourproblems  involved in north country Trade Unionism,  as  corn-pared with  the  more  happy-go-lucky  arrangements  betweenmanufacturer and  employee in the south.&quot;  I have a feeling that the attitude  which  this statement describes probably exists,but  I believe equally that that attitude is based on a completemisconception.   There is probably a higher sense of craftsman-ship  in Scotland than exists in the South, and the functions ofeach trade are not  only more rigidly demarcated, but their divi-sions are  probably more closely observed than elsewhere.  Themaintenance  of  this demarcation  has  necessitated close co-operation between the employers and employees, and in the oldestablished  industries the co-operation has been to their mutual advantage.   The application of existing rules  to an entirely new method of  production may at times cause certain delays  whilethe necessary adjustments  are being made, but machinery exists for the purpose  of making these adjustments and no employer who is prepared to give his men fair treatment need have theleast hesitation in coming to the Areas.
                        Conclusion.   246. In conclusion, I have attempted in  this review of theposition to give an impartial picture of the scene.  I am hope-ful of the future.   I believe that&quot; the progress made at Hillingtonand elsewhere is no more than a beginning, but the foundationsare sound and the progress satisfactory.  As compared with theposition at the end of 1934 the situation is radically improved.Heavy unemployment,  once general throughout the Areas, isnow localised in one or two districts.   The Areas can graduallybe brought back  into a healthy state.   Their services will  soon be up to date, and their amenities improved.   Their population will gradually be adjusted to numbers which they  can  support in the new economic equilibrium which must come;  the previousdependence upon one or two of the  heavy industries  will be modified by the increasing introduction of those secondary in-dustries which have helped the  South-East and  Midlands ofEngland so greatly in recent years, but which so far have  been little seen  in  the  Special Areas  or,  indeed,  in  Scotland  asa whole.  The progress  will  not be rapid or  spectacular.  Itmay  take ten  years  before  it  will  come, but  the  slowerand steadier the growth,  the  stronger and more  abiding will bethe new structure.o M 19300
