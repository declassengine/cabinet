(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)^ SECRET. CP.  876 (38).                                        Copy No. U I                            CABINET.            THE  STATE OF BUSINESS IN  THE KING&apos;3 BENCH DIVISION OF                         THE ROYAL COURTS OF JUSTICE..-                     Memorandum &quot;by the Lord Chancellor.            It     I am compelled to  draw the attention of my colleagues            to the state of business  in  the King&apos;s Bench Division and at            assizes and to lay before them a proposal for meeting demands            which have been made both by professional and public bodies            and  in the House  of Commons,            2*     Most of the recommendations of the Royal Commission            on the Despatch of Business at Common Law have now been            carried out.   But effect has not yet been given to certain            recommendations made by the Commission, and by the Committee            subsequently appointed under the chairmanship of Lord Finlay            with  regard to the circuit system.   The more important of            these recommendations may be summarised as follows-:-                  (a)  The Royal Commission recommended that civil work                        should be taken at every town on the Autumn                        circuit.   The Finlay Committee went further                        and recommended that civil business should be                        taken on every circuit at every assize town                        visited by a  judge.                  (b)  It was  recommended that a fourth assize should be                        given to Birmingham, and that Cardiff, Swansea                        and Chester should be visited by two judges at                        each  assize and that two judges should visit Exeter,                        Bristol and Winchester at the Autumn assizes.                  With the present number of 7 ing&apos;s Bench Judges, it is            not  possible to carry out these recommendations, but I am            of opinion that they are  desirable and that effect should            be given  to them.
3.-     I now pass to the present position on the circuits.There is serious congestion of work at  the Liverpool  and manchester assizes,   I have received the following resolution which was passed unanimously &quot;by the Liverpool Chamber ofCommerce on the 27th July last:-                     -              &quot;That the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce         desires to&apos;draw the attention of His Majesty?s         Government to the continuous congestion at the         Liverpool and Manchester assizes and requests         that early steps should be taken to remedy the         present unsatisfactory state of affairs.&quot;                                                           -4.     The Liverpool Law Society has also drawn my  attentionto the congestion of business at Liverpool.   There is adecided increase in the number of actions entered for trialat the Liverpool assizes.   Even by sitting late in court9sitting on Saturdays and appointing silks from the circuitas commissioners., the judges cannot complete the lists.  Forinstance, at the last Spring assizes there were 61 civile, 33divorce and 14 criminal cases5 and it was ffewsssary to leaveover 26 of the civil cases until the next assizes.5.     The work to be done on circuit generally has alsobeen increased by the operation of the Matrimonial  Causes ^ct,1937.   The increase for this year as compared with 1937 isestimated at 100 per cents and for succeeding years at about50 per cent.                                     -6.     During the year ended 31st july&apos;s 1938, it wasnecessary to appoint four Commissioners of Assizes.   Twoof these sat at Manchester and one at Nottingham to dealwith heavy lists.   In the fourth case, it was necessary toretain a judge in London to preside over the Railv/ay and canal Commission, and as there was not another judge to spare.a Commissioner had to be sent to the Midland Circuit07.     On many occasions in the House of Commons in thelast two years the Government have been asked to appointnew King&apos;s Benah Judges.   In the debate on the Supreme Court
?of-Judicature (Amendment) Bill, 1938, on July 14ik_.la.-3t,Mr. Clement Davies, Mr. Dingle Foot, Major Milner, Mr. Lyonsand Mr. Herbert all asked that additional judges should beappointed to the King&apos;s Bench Division, and similar requestswere made on November 8th, 1937, in the debate on the SupremeCourt of Judicature (Amendment) Bill, 1937, by Mr. Lyons,Mr. Silverman and Sir William Davison.8.     At present the Kingfs Bench Division consists ofthe Lord Chief Justice and 17 puisne judges.   On the 13thFebruary, 1935, there were 19 puisne judges and this remained the number until the 27th April, 1937, when Mr. JusticeMacKinnon was appointed a Lord Justice of Appeal, and thenumber was reduced to 18.   On the 22nd May, 1937, the number was further reduced to 17 by the resignation of the late  Mr,Justice Horridge, and it has remained at 17 since that date.9.     At the beginning of the present Michaelmas term,there were 1,440 cases awaiting trial in the King&apos;s bench division in London.   If the judges are to keep abreast ofthe work in London, it is clearly not possible for them to spend any longer time on circuit than they do at present.   Butit is very desirable to put an end to the present congestionat assizes, and in my view it is also desirable that two  Judgesinstead of one should in the ordinary course go to the severaltowns mentioned in the Reports of the Royal Commission and theFinlay Committee.   If these results are to be attained,  I see no course open except the appointment of additional judges.10.     The other recommendations of the Royal commission have, for the most part, been carried out.   Some relating tocircuit arrangement are under consideration of the Lord chief justice and their practicability must still be regarded asdoubtful.   But even if they were carried out, the net saving
 of  judicial time which would result from then would not amount to a substantial part of the whole time of a single judge, and can  for the present purpose be ignored. 11.     One of  the recommendations which has not been carried out is  the appointment of a business manager.   I mention it because it has excited some attention from the public.   I am myself in favour of the proposal, but I am also satisfied  that at the present time there are serious difficulties as regards carrying it out. 12.     My recommendation is that resolutions should be presented to Parliament under section 11 of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925, (as amended by  the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Act, 1935), for the appointment of two additional judges of the King&apos;s Bench Division, bringing the total of the puisne judges of that Division to i9, as it was in 1935.                       (Initialled) M. 22nd November, 1938.       Since I drew and signed this memorandum I have received an urgent call to despatch a third judge toManchester, where there is a list of 190 civil cases, 227 divorce cases and some 40 odd prisoners.   22 of the causes are remnants from the summer.   Obviously this mass of work cannot be disposed of before Christmas by only two judges.                                                  r
