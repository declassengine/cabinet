(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAINIC  MAJESTY1 8 GOVERNMENT. ) 3 EC RE T. &quot;CP. 237(58).                                            COPY NO.  0-                           CABINET.                COMPENSATION TO CIVILIANS FOR LOSS OF                   LIFE OR INJURY FROM AIR ATTACK.&apos;            Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.                  In October, 1937, the Cabinet approved in           principle a scheme of compensation drawn up by a Sub-           Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the           question of Compensation to Civilians for Loss of Life or           Injury from Air Attack.   Broadly, this scheme contemplates           that compensation should be paid from public funds, under           the control of the Ministry of Pensions, in respect of           death or serious disablement of gainfully occupied persons,           and of Air Raid Precautions Volunteers, at a flat rate           irrespective of means and without an insurance element.           The flat rate would be that apjpropriate to the private           soldier recruited for the hostilities in question.                  In submitting the scheme the Committee of Imperial           Defence  had recommended that -                (i) The Sub-Committee&apos;s Report should be endorsed                      by the Cabinet as a suitable machinery, on    ^                 the understanding that any decision as to                      whether or not a scheme of compensation should                      be put in force at the time of any future                      emergency was a matter for Government decision                      at the time               (ii) no general announcement should be made regarding                      any national compensation scheme, but that                      the Home Secretary should be empowered, in
           the course of his  discussions  with the Local           Authorities,  to state  that  the principle  of           compensation to Air Raid Precautions  Personnel           was accepted by the Government, without           specifying any particular rate or mentioning  the           fact that a national Scheme of Compensation was           contemplated&apos;]      (iii)the term &quot;gainfully employed&quot;  should be  more           precisely defined.   (Go I.Do/297th Meeting,           Minute $&apos;) e.          At its 333rd Meeting on 6th October last theCommittee of Imperial Defence further agreed that the HomeSecretary and I should take steps to link up the proposals in regard to personnel with those in regard to damage to property, with a view to the preparation of a public announce-ment covering both these matters.         I have given further consideration to thisquestion of personal compensation, and have reached theconclusion that in practice it would be difficult,  if not impossible, to adhere to a scheme which restrictscompensation (apart from Air Raid  Precautions Volunteers)to gainfully occupied persons.   In this  connection I maymention two categories of persons whom it would, in my view, be difficult to exclude from any scheme to beadopted    (a)  Young persons at school who are seriously           disabled and whose potential earning capacity           is materially affected;    (b)  Disabled wives -with young children for whom some           other form of care must be provided;          If this view commends itself to my colleagues,I propose that another Committee should be set up to re-
ill examine  the  scope  of the- scheme and to recommend what, if any,  additional categories of persons should he brought  within it,  and what &quot;benefits should be provided in such cases0   The  proposed Committee could also consider what action  would  be necessary in order to resolve certain  difficulties which arise on the question whether in some  cases under the lav/ as it stands a claim under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts would be held to lie.       I suggest that the Minister of Pensions shouldbe the Chairman of the Committee, and that the members should be officials of the Departments primarily concernedo   The Departments primarily concerned would appear to be the Ministry of Pensions, the Home Office, the Ministry of Health and the Treasuryo       In addition, there should, I think, be a public announcement on the general question of the Government&apos;intentions in this matter     It would be desirable forsuch an announcement to be expressed in general termssuch as those in the attached draft0       I ask the approval of the Cabinet to -     (l)  the appointment of a Committee to consider the            question of some extension of the scope of            the compensation scheme previously approved;     (2)  an announcement of a general character on the            Government&apos;s proposals in regard to            compensation, to civilians for personal            injuries a                              (Intldo)    J.S.Treasury Chambers, 3 *W. 10    9th December, 1938 0
               DRAFT ANNOUNCEMENT.       The Government have had under considerationarrangements for giving compensation from public funds inrespect of death or of injury involving seriousdisablement caused, by air raids or other warlike action..It will be for the Government of the day at the time ofa future emergency to. decide upon the precise arrange-ments to be adopted.  In order to facilitate an immediate decision should the need arise, the details are beingworked out of a scheme to cover civilians in appropriate cases.  The plan will, in any event, extend to allcivilians gainfully occupied as well as persons enrolledas volunteers for air raid or other such services who might be injured or killed while on dutyc  In such casesthe rate of compensation for persons injured or fordependent widows or children of persons killed would.broadly speakings be calculated by reference to thestandard rate payable to or in respect of the privatesoldier recruited for service in connection with thesame hostilities.
