T^egrams &quot; SHIPM1NDER, VIC, LONDON.&quot;   Any further communication on thissubject should be addressed to      The Secretary,       Ministry of Shipping,           St. James&apos;s Park,              London, S.W. 1,and the following number quoted.MINISTRY  OF  SHIPPING,     9th February, 1918.Sir,***** tfrjKias^^vaffflO          In continuation of my letter of  the  2nd instant,I am directed by  the  Shipping Controller to  report forthe information of  the  War Oahinet as follows.-    (1)   Convoys.        (a)  Homeward Bound Oonvoys.             Since  the  last report nine convoys,  consistingof 99 ships (679,200  tons d.w.) have arrived.  There wereno casualties, but  the  s.s. &quot;GLBNAMOY&quot; which started in aconvoy from Fort  Said on the 27th January  and  was droppedat Alexandria because her speed was insufficient, wastorpedoed when coming on in a local convoy.  She  succeeded,however, in returning to Alexandria under  her  own steam.There are now on  passage home 16 convoys consisting of293 ships.        (b)  Outward  Bound Convoys.             Since  the  last report 8 convoys consisting of .102 ships (717,400 tons deadweight) have  arrived.  Thereare now in the danger zone 5 convoys consisting  of 81 ships.There were no casualties whilst in convoy, but the s.s.&quot;HAXBI&quot; out of a  Milford Convoy was in collision withanother ship and  had  to return to Mount Bay, and the&quot;MAIZAR&quot;, dropped at  Gibraltar owing to engine trouble,having proceeded, after repairs, in a local  convoy was&quot;torpedoed and sunk.I he Se ere tarTwocretary?War Cabinet.
         Two statements are enclosed showing(1) the number of convoys,  steamers and tonnageconvoyed up to 2nd February, 1918;  (2)  Percentageof losses - and steamers actually in convoy.   (2)  Finance.          Luring the week ending the 2nd instant thesum of  1,395,875 was paid for compensation in easesof total loss of requisitioned ships, making a totalof  44,026,455 paid on this account since the 1stApril, 1917.   (3)  Extension of System of Ship Licensing.          On 1st  February the system of Ship licensing,which has hitherto applied to British steamersregistered in the United Kingdom over 500 tonsemployed outside  the limits of the  coasting trade ofthe United Kingdom,was extended so  as to apply toall British ships, irrespective of sizS,proceedingfrom the United Kingdom and to all  ships of whatevernationality in the United Kingdom Ooasting trade.   (4)  Irish Qat Orop 1917.          In 1917 the increase in production of oatsis stated to have amounted to  -  461,546 tons.          Out of this quantity about -     (a)  50,000 tons have  been shipped to Great Britainin the course of trade.     (h)  20,000 tons have  been purchased for Armypurposes,     (c)  20,000 tons for seed for  English Board,     (d)  50,000 yet to be  purchased by the Army forretention in Ireland.                           Total  140,000 tonsleaving
 leaving a balance  of  321,546  tons.   Out of this about 3,000  tons  have been  ground into oatmeal and shipped to Great  Britain.          It  is exceedingly disappointing that larger quantities  have not beeome available for export, as substantial relief to tonnage had been looked for from this source.   The Director of Cross-Channel Transportation is however  informed that the balance of the crop is required  in Ireland for human consumption and to replace animal  foods which would have been imported in the normal  course.     potato Crop.          The actual increase in the potato Crop in 1917was 1,719.394 tons.   Of this quantity          59,108 tons have been exported since June 1917 for Military and Civil purposes.          80,000 tons to be purchased for Army and Navy          20,000 tons to be exported this month toEnglish Merchants, and 5,000 tons to be exported during the month of February to the Board of Agriculture forseed, making a total of 164,108 tons and leaving abalance of 278,569 tons.          In consequence of the falling off of thesupplies of maize, Indian corn and cattle foods  usuallyimported into Ireland, it is calculated that the greatbulk of this remainder  will like the oats  be  used for-feeding purposes in Ireland.    (5)  Neutral Tonnage requisitioned.          The  Norwegian steamer &quot;LUNA&quot;  has  beenrequisitioned.                                            The
          The s.s. &quot;AVANTI&quot; (Danish) was torpedoed onAhe 2nd instant, and the s.s. &quot;LOFOTEN&quot; (Norwegian)was sunk on the 3rd instant.  It is not known definitelywhether the latter was torpedoed or mined.    (6)  Standard Vessels.          The following standard vessels have &quot;beendelivered.          s.s. &quot;WAR ARABIS&quot;, built at West Hartlepoolwas delivered on the 29th January.          s,s; &quot;WAR BRACKEN&quot; built at Glasgow and s.s.&quot;WAR PYTHON&quot; built at Belfast were delivered on the24th January.    (7)  Coal position in Canada.          It was reported to the Cabinet three weeks agothat the position was bad and it was necessary to shipcoal from this country to Canada.  The position hassince righted itself and supplies of coal for bunkersare now sufficient.    (8)  General coal shipments.          The amount of tonnage available for supply ofooal for the bunkering stocks abroad is unusuallyrestricted.   Important bunkering stations such asGibraltar and Egypt are very short of coal, whilst noother service can spare colliers without the risks ofserious shortages.   The immediate cause - apart fromthe ordinary shrinkage of tonnage - is the increase inthe amount of tonnage required for wheat.  The depletionof bunkor stocks cannot of course be allowed to continueindefinitely, as the result would be the immobilisation                                                   of
of merchant ships for lack of fuel,  and some re-adjustment will have to he make soon between the manycompeting demands *    (9)  Stores for the British Army in France,          The quantity of military stores discharged inFrance during the week ended 2nd January 1918, was182,684 tons, as against a programme figure of200,000 tons.  This is the biggest out-turn sinceNovember 24th, 1917;          Exchange of British and German Prisoners of War.           The third party of prisoners for repatriationto Germany consisting of                 5   Officers               388   Other ranks               400   Civilians                12   Neutralsembarked at Boston last week and they have been  disembarkedat Rotterdam.           The vessels are expected  back at the  end ofthis week with English prisoners from Germany on board.     (10)  Enemy Aliens in China,           The question of conveying enemy aliens fromChina to Australia has been under discussion, and thisDepartment has suggested to the Foreign Office  thatJapanese tonnage should bo employed  for the purpose,      (11) Repatriation of Australian and New Zealand Invalids.            Reference was made in Statement of  the 17thJanuary to the proposed change in the arrangements forabove.  It has now been decided to carry a certainnumber in vessels sailing right through to Australiaand New 2ealand, the remainder being conveyed to Durban,kept in a Hest Camp there, and taken on to Australasiaas opportunity offers.                                                    It
          It is proposed to establish a triangular servicebetween Australia/Bgypt/Cape, the vessels on this serviceto bring reinforcements from Australasia to Egypt, thento proceed to Durban via Sast Africa, and convoy invalidsfrom there to Australasia.          The matter is being referred to the ColonialOffice to obtain the approval of the Australian, HewZealand and South African Governments to the proposedmethod of repatriation.   (12)  American Trooping. ,          Three of the vessels employed on Americantrooping service have been torpedoed, viz:  the &quot;ANDANIA&quot;,&quot;AURANIA&quot; and &quot;TUSCANIA&quot;.          The two former vessels were outward bound, butthe &quot;TUSCANIA&quot; had 2,180 American troops on board.  Ofthe total number on board, including crew,  viz:  2,404,information has so far been received that 2,114 havebeen saved.          The decision of the Versailles Conference onthe question of the conveyance of Americans as individualsto be trained with the British Army in France, has nowbeen received.  It awaits the approval of the AmericanGovernment, but steps are being taken to carry out thonecessary shipping arrangements. The loss of the threevessels mentioned above, and the gravity of the  foodsituation are not helpful in this direction.                    I am,                         Sir,                    lour obedient Servant,                              (Sgd.)  JOHN  ANDERSON
