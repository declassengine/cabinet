                                 Intelligence  Bureau.SECRET.                                Department of Information,                                            FFW/022.                WEEKLY  REK)RT  ON  FRANCE,  XIII-                      (Feb.  6th,  1918)                               n   In the last three weeks the tfaillaux business has continued tooccupy a great deal of space in the French mind, but matters ofwider importance,  in which discussion reaches a higher level, havebegun to compete with it.    Before proceeding to them it may be awwell to say what there is to say about the great Accused and hissmaller companions in crime or misfortune.   The first thing that strikes an Englishman about all those trialsis the way in which the press is allowed to discuss them, assumingguilt as it pleases and reproducing every kind of irresponsiblerumour.   It may be British self-righteousness,  but certainly mostEnglishmen   will think that .out system of publishing only the actualproceedings in Court and making no assumptions or assertions aboutcases that are sub judioe is very preferable.   It astonishes us tofind not only Socialist and Radical papers, which always in all sub-jects incline to the view that public affairs should be conductedon the model of the town-crier in the streets, but even ancient andrespectable organs like the Temps, demanding that documents, such asthe alleged Luxburg ravelations about Caillaux,  should be issued inextenso for public debate, instead of being reserved, as we shouldthink proper, for production at the trial itself.   However, in spiteof these demands not a great i eal that is new has been published inany official way:  there has merely been a war ef statements andoounter-statements between Caillaux^s friends and enemies as to thecontents of the famous Florence safe,^as to whether it was improperlyopened and documents abstracted from it before its judicial openingin Paris in Caillaux!s own presence.    Not much of this is either
trustworthy or important.    What is more important is that Caillaux,in a letter published by his Council,  does not deny the authenticityof the much discussed papers proposing something like a revolutionin Prance.   He does not of course say anything about the detailsgiven in the press.    But as his friends take the line of defend-ing the scheme rather than ef denying it,  it may be assumed, thatthe accounts given are more or leas aoourate.   They describe a planfqo;limiting the pewers both of the Senate and the Chamber, in favourof ^^e^:&quot;jC4uncil of State&quot;.   The scheme was apparently worked outin considerable detail and the men chosen who were&apos; to carry it out.General Sarrail was to command the Army, and there was to be a newMinistry of Police for all France with &quot;a safe man of the type efCoccaldi&quot; (a great friend of Caillaux&apos;s ) at its head.   It is saidalso that relations with the Vatican were to be resumed and theOrleans princes recalled.    The document was called by the authorthe ^Rubicon&apos;, and the Press has adopted this name   Possibly itsauthor so named it in recollection of the faot that  !Rubicon&apos; wasthe name written on the document which Louis Napoleen handed toHorny a few hour3 before the coup d&apos;etat of Dec 2nd, 1851.   Theparallel is more than verbal:  for it looks as if th*3 new ooupd&apos;etat, like the old, though made by a man who is the hero of theextreme Left, would have been turned by him on the whole, as thatwas, to the profit of the Right.   The Socialists would apparentlyhave found themselves duped.   Caillaux would have acted in thespirit he avowed in conversation some months a o with an English-man, who asked him whether he expected great social changes inFrance, to which he replied, &quot;No, we make revolutions, notreforms, in France&quot;.
                                                            -  :  380  I                           - 3 -   The parallel goes still  further.    One would have expected everyRepublican to repudiate with indignation auch an obvioua project ofCaesarism.   But it is interesting to notice that the Pays,  most os-tentatiously Republican of  all papers,  always sounding the alarm-bellabout the alleged assaults  on the Republic,  Still loves the Republicless than M. Caillaux, with whom it is constantly declaring it hasno connections.   For it actually defends the scheme, although itappears to give all real power to the CQuncil of State ana the Prime                                 .         -             -Minister who is nominated by that body and cannot be turned eut bythe Chamber, except at the  price of a dissolution, a price Parliamentsare rarely inclined to pay.   The language used by the Pays curiouslyrecalls the kind of language used by Napoleon III.   &quot;What after allis there so dreadful in a plan which defines the parliamentary sys-tem, which delivers the business of law-making frAm the dangeroushands cf the incompetent, which establishes  order an the publicservice and unites liberty  with authority?&quot;.   This is the very language of 1851.   One would suppose it could  *deceive no Republican, and  one would imagine that Caillaux would befinished as a hero of the iueft.   But after all the furious hatredof the Right is a great possession to him.   Meanwhile Caillaux him-self and his more prudent friends take another and, from the immediatepoint of view of the trial, a more useful line.   They argue, withsome force, that to put ideas of constitutional changes on paper isnot a  ^lot1 of any kind, much less treason.   And they equally urgethat Luxburg&apos;3 statements,  if not confirmed  by other evidence, cannotbe accepted as proof against Caillaux:  or any Frenchman!s life wouldbe at the mercy of any German,                                                 to   These are legal questions which are best left/the judges.  Mean-while all that can be said  is that it seems  to be generally believedthat Caillaux is guilty and that the Government when the time comes
 will show that it has conclusive evidence of his guilt.  The Army, both officers and men, are described as very hostile to him:  and there are some $igns that the Socialists - who never liked him per- sonally hut looked upon him as the man to reform Franflfc finance in accordance with their tastes,- are inclined to draw away from him. It is perhaps only the folly of the militant reactionaries wha 4emar4 his head with or without the necessary evi&amp;enoe that makes them rally to his defence.    Of the Malvy and Bolo affairs - so muoh less interesting politi- cally - nothing need be said except that the Senate has begun and  hen adjourned the trial of Malvy, and that Bolo&apos;s trial has als* begun but has hitherto provided more matter for the reporter in search of incidents- in Court than for the student of the political situation and outlook.   Bolo is taking a defiejit swashbucklef Dumasesque attitude as a means of appealing to the gallery, but no- body seems to have any serious doubt of his guilt.    Meanwhile in France, as elsewhere, no news from the Law Courts or the Parliament interests so manjr oeople as that gftmrfc about the supply of food and the regulations about abtaining it.   The event of the last three weeks in this matter has been the introduction of bread-cards and the limitation of each person to 300 grammes (nearly ll.oz.) per day.   This began in Paris on Jan. 29th.   The amount is to be the same for everybody irrespective of age or occu- pation:  but the Minister of Jood promised that he would grant per-*H?.ssion for extra rations in necessary cases.   He explained that the measure was rendered immediately necessary by the great reduction in the Irench yield of corn and more recently by the fact that impor- tations during the last few months have been far below the expected scale.   He hoped to be able to raise the ration to 350 grammes by the 15th of March.   On the whole his action has been well received.
It is to be hoped that it will really be enforeed.    As jet this aeerpvery uncertain.    Newspapers record the experiences of those who hadno difficulty in obtaining twice their allowance.    In the same wayEnglish visitors are much scandalised by the length and luxury of th*meals served in Paris clubs and privite houses,  including a successionof meat dishes quite unknown to English people,  who have recentlybeon making^onsiderable sacrifices to supply their Allies with food.Occasional reference is made, one gladly recognises, in the FrenchPress to these and the still msire remarkable sacrifices of the Unite4States in this matter.   The Debats has given an account of theLondon food restrictions, pointing out that we also pay immenselyheavier taxes than the French and speaking of its countrymen as inthe matter of bread still the most favoured people in Europe.Another paper admits that there is not one of the Allies which has                                         itssuffered so little discomfort or changed/habits  so little as France.   These admissions at any rate show the right spirit, and altogetherboth the country and the Army are probably in a  healthier conditionas a whole since the arrival of Clemenceau and the arrest of Caillata..Those in close touch with the Army say that the  soldiers as well asthe officers universally drank their bumpers to  the cenfusion ofCaillaux on the night of his arrest:  and during the air-raid onParis the other day a reporter declares that in  the streets heseveral times heard people saying &apos; Avec Clemenceau c^a va changer1.But not everybody loves M. Clemenceau, and not everybody hatesCaillaux:  and there is certainly a feeling of war-weariness inFrance as there is in every other country.   Moreover, memories ofthe Dreyfus case combined with the foftlish language of Royalist andReactionary papers make3 the working-classes,  already a little sus-piciicus ef Clemenceau.,- inclined to listen to stories of Royalist &apos;plots and to be very jealous in their scrutiny of Court Martialproceedings.   And some of them were irritated at the refusal of
passports to  Russia and are  suspicious  of Imperialism on the part oftheir own,  and still more  of the Italian and English,  Governments.Even the silly rumour about  our  being anxious to keep Calais afterthe peace is  not universally dismissed  with the proper contempt.No working-class in Europe probably has been so little affected byBolshevism as the thrifty,  practical,  intelligent Frenchman, espec-ially the peasant.    No doubt, however,  it has been a disturbing forpein France,  as elsewhere.   But the nakedness of German Imperialism atBrest and Berlin, and the  defencelessnass of Russia before it,  have                               i                                  Vunited with the speeches of Mr.  Lloyd Goorgo and Mr. Wilson to  have avery steadying effect on French  working-class opinion:  do that it ?ssaid that the agitation on the passport question has died down.   Thsidealist section of the workmen  is now largely reassured as to  theidealistic aims of the Allies.   Meanwhile of course the general discussion of War-aims has beenfed by tht* speeches of Counts  Hertling  and Caernin and by the Ver-sailles Conference.   There was  a general feeling that neither of theenemy statesmen had said anything that  brought,the prospect of peaceany nearer:  and even after the  Allied Conference and the Communiqueissued at its close there  remains some  desire for a joint statementon War-aims made by all the Allies including the United States.  Itis felt that Hertling and even Czernin speak an altogether differentpolitical language to the  Allies,and that the Allies cannot tooclearly emphasize the difference in the ears of their own peoples,the neutrals, and the enemy peoples themselves.   The Socialists areespecially anxious for this course in view of the Russian situationv/hich,  in their view, might be improved by a large and open demo-cratic policy.   In this connection the Socialist Rumanite of Feb.  opublished two very interesting articles, one making a very vigorousprotest against the Bolshevist dispersal of the Constituent Assemblyand describing it as a coup d&apos;6tat,  &quot;the crime of crimes in the eyes
paign of the Italian Corriere della Sera for an agreement between theItalians and the Jugoslavs as the only way of safety for either.-of Socialists&quot;.    It regrets that the Allies had no$ tried to save theConstituent Assembly by offering to discuss peace with it;  and,after drawing attention to the Constituent&apos;s dying protest againstthe separate armistice concluded by the Bolsheviks and against theirnegotiations with the enemy for a separate peace, desires even nowto follow the policy which it calls that of Sir George Buchanan;   thatis to offer to meet the representatives whom the Constituent Assemblywas anxious to appoint and to endeavour to arrive with them at anagreement on the conditions of a general peace.   &quot;The Assemblywished to act with us:  let as act with them:  let us say we are onlywaiting for their delegates&quot;.   This, in the view of the  Humanitywould serve both the cause of the Allies and the cause of democraticGovernment in Russia.   A still more remarkable article in the same issue deals with apamphlet written by M. Trotsky in October 1914 which is apparentlyquite unknown in England.    In this artiste- M. Trotsky not only de-nounced Germany as the author of the ultimatum to Serbia and there-fore of the war, but condemned her pre-war attitude to France andEngland and demanded the break up of Austria with a separate and en-larged Poland, Roumania and Serbia, as the only road to politioal pro-gress in Central and South Eastern Europe.   The Humanite accordinglyinsists that he must act on these principles to-doy on pain of beingpronounced a traitor to his own ideals, if he fails to do so.   Other papers, especially the Debats, have been insisting on theWestern Allies having no delusions about Austria.   Fears are ex-pressed that Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Wilson are deceiving themselveswith the idea that it is possible to find a solution of the South-  .-Eastern problem without a fundamental break-up of the Austrian-Hun-garian Empire.   The Debats has been vigorously supporting the cam-
(   The only other point worth noticing is perhaps the vigour withwhich some organs of French opinion lay stress on the necessity ofthe Allies  opening an economic offensive,  &quot;the o^ly kind of effen-sive which at this moment can promise a decisive result&quot;,  and the onlycondition by which the Allies can make sure not to lose their victoryafter gaining it.   The Pays,  from whioh these quotations ate taken,seems also to fear that owing to her small  merchant fleet Francemight be at the mercy of her Allies for a supply of raw materials:and argues that an economic agreement extending into the yearsof peace would be the surest foundation for a true and permanentunion between the Allies and the best preparation for the ultimateSociety of Nations.
