(Memorandum by Ministry of Shipping)     In August last the Ministry of Shipping and the Port andTransit Executive Committee raised the question of increasingthe Transport Worker s* Battalions by 5,000 men.  The War Officresisted this demand on the grounds that they were releasingso many men for agriculture that it was not possible furtherto weaken the strength of the Army.  It is necessary,  however,once again to press for the proposed increase in the TransportWorkers  Battalion ,  for, as was anticipated in August, thedevelopment of the Convoy System, the long nights and the badweather, have proved conclusively that the present strength ofthe Battalions is.entirely inadequate to maintain the flow oftraffic through the ports, with the result that  vessels arebeing detained and their carrying power thereby diminished.     At the moment there are urgent demands for help from Liver-pool, Manchester, Glasgow and Greenock, which cannot be met.; .owing to there not  being sufficient men available.     Further,  apart from the demands for mobile labour at theports,  it is desirable that the application of the scheme to.the railways should be extended.  At &quot;&quot;-pre sent the scheme is onlyin operation in the Sheffield and Bradford areas; in those -areas it has worked without any hitch,  and it is manifest fromthe experience thus gained that the occasional employment of asmall number of men at the railways prevents blocks and.greatlyincreases the carrying power of the rolling stock.     The extension of the scheme to the Canals has proved inevery way a success,  and has been the means of relieving therailways of a considerable volume of traffic.  Some of.theScandinavian steamers are being diverted to East Coast ports,and if these cargoes  be carried to their destinations the &quot;canals will have to be still further used,  with a consequentincreased demand upon the Transport&apos; Workers  Battalion., ..     It will thus be  seen that the raising of the strength ofthe Transport  Workers  Battalions by 5,000 men is a matterof extreme urgency.Ministry of Shipping.
