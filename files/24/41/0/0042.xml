Labour uisturbancos in the form of strikes and deliberatereduction of effort while at work have had a most prejudicialof feet on output, particularly on the Clyde 0  Tho full effeot ofthese disturbances is not reflected in the January completions?but will become apparent in&apos;later monthSo     Tho piece-workers engaged in shipbuilding on the Clyde went enstrike towards the end of the year to enforce the application ofthe 12^&apos;&apos;2^ advance to their earnings, and in general did not returnto work until a fortnight after the holidays *  The rivetters com-
