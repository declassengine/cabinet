Fisheries Division.                      Administrative Section.       It has &quot;been a busy week as regards the many and variedsubjects dealt with on the general administrative side, &quot;but nothingto call for particular mention except that the questions relatingto the fisheries at Knapp Mill, Hampshire, and Powiek Weir,Worcester, have &quot;been further advanced and that special Bills andProvisional Orders in the Current Session have been examined aofar as they affect fisheries.       Endeavour is &quot;being made to organize the fish frying tradewith a view to creating some organization to whwn supplies of fataand oils may he allocated for the us^ of the industry.       A Committee is about to be constituted f*r the purpose ofinvestigating refrigeration problems in connection with1 thepreservation of fish.       Officers of the Department have beon busily engaged inconnection with further closures of mussel beds on account of dangerto public health, and the Treasury will &quot;We asked to authorise theexpenditure ef funds not only for the purification of mussel beds,but for the stocking and development of such beds in order thatsupplies may be maintained.

                      Motor L&amp;an Committee.        Several interesting and instructive examples of theincreased catches of fish resulting from installation of motorpo&quot;/er in sailing vessels have lately come to the notice of theCommittee.   For instance - a Brixham trawler of the smaller or&quot;mule&quot; type which was engined in the latter part of 1917, in theseven weeks following on the installation of the engine, has earned 1,000, and this figure is hotter than that of any other vesselin the port even including those of the largest types.       The own^r of a Poole motor boat, realising the increasedefficiency of his boat with the engine installed in her, hired,during part of the Spratting Season, a second craft which he towedout to the fishing ground and on more than one occasion broughtboth vessels back completely full of sprats.       Poole men are now realising that their present craft, whichwere suitable for the oatches of fish obtained when sailing, are nowquite inadequate for the catches they are able to obtain under motoppower, and for this reason are thinking of going in for largervessels to enable them to bring in increased catches and go furtherafield.            Fishermen&apos;a Registration and Recruiting Section.       Fishermen and Naval Service.   Steps are being taken to putinto force at an early date the September call,  whose execution wasdelayed at the instance cf the Beard,  and by means of alternativeexceptional measures arranged by the Naval Authorities.       4 Conference has been held with the Naval RecruitingAuthorities as te the steps to be taken to obtain fishermen fromNewfoundland for patrol work etc.,  which, if carried out will reducethe calls upon the English fisheries.       Fishermen. Fish Trade and Military Service.    The census ofthe Grimsby Fish Trade was summari38d in a report, copies of whichwere supplied to the National Service  Ministry and the LocalGovernment Board, and at a meeting held at Grimsby,  convened bythe National Service Ministry a resolution was passed which bindsthe Associations to meet and consider whether any measures ofco-oprtratlon could be arrived at, which would release men for theArmy.   It is arranged that these Committees shall have the fullparticulars, afforded by the firms themselves, of their staffs wherethese include men of high category eligible for Service,  and theBoard&apos;s District Inspector will attend meetings.                         Fresh Water Fish.       Mr. Kaurice was present at a meeting of the Committee,  and theReport on Eels was fully discussed.   A general conclusion wasarrived at, that, subject to the adjustment of details,  therecommendations contained in the Report should be supported by theBoard.       A sub-Committee was appointed to deal with the question ofthe Elver catching-&apos;depot at Epney and  its report is  expected to bepresent at the next Committee meeting.Fish
                      Fish Food Committee.        Sprat Fishing.   It has now been definitely decided to closethe work at Poole.   Considerable quantities have been bought anddespatched to merchants inland, with good results.&apos;   But the catchesnow being made do not justify the Committee in continuing the work.
