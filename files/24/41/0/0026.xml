SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,2.2.18.Department of Information.C 17.The following are notes of a further conversation withthe same member of the Finnish Delegation now in England, belongingto the Young Finn Party, the first part of which was given inMemorandum C 16 (January 24th).Aland Islands,     It is the case that recently a very great majority of theinhabitants of the Aland mainland have asked to be united toSweden.  Suppose that we agree that the Aland mainland should goto Sweden;  we must then take into account the fact thatgeographically the Aland mainland is connected with the Finnishmainland by hundreds of smaller islands also belonging to thatgroup, where the population is mixed as regards the language.How many of these small islands will have to be included withthe Aland mainland in this union with Sweden?   The number ofFinnish-speaking landowners among-these smaller islands hasincreased very rapidly in recent years.   Will it then follow thatafter twenty years, when the majority of these smaller islandshave become Finnish-speaking, Sweden will be willing to hand themback to Finland?   As a matter of fact, there are fewer Swedish-speaking people in these smaller islands than there are even inNorthern Sweden;  for in Northern Sweden there is a purely Finnish-speaking population who are Swedish subjects to-day.    Theethnographical frontier is not identical with the political frontier,and if the Swedes insist on the right of self-determination for theinhabitants of the Aland mainland,  the same prrlnciple ought logically
110to be applied to the Finns in the North of Sweden.   As it is,the Swedish Government have done all that they can to compel theseFinnish people in Northern Sweden to become Swedish-speaking andlose their Finnish nationality.   Their children have been takenaway from them and sent to the South in order to improve theirknowledge of the Swedish language.   Nothing comparable to thiskind of treatment has ever been applied to the Swedish peopleliving in the Aland Islands.   Personally I have nothing againstthe transference of the Aland mainland to Sweden, but thenreciprocity must be observed;  any such transaction must bein the nature of an exchange and we should have to receivecompensation in Northern Sweden.   In Finland it is only theAlanders themselves who are in favour of the change, because weFinns all understand that we have an equal claim with regard to theNorthern part of Sweden.   The Finnish-speaking people there havealways resented the Swedish policy of oppression, although during theperiod of our great political difficulties with Russia, Swedishrule was, on the whole, preferable to them compared with Russianrule.British Recognition of Finland.     &quot;During the period that we shall have to wait for fullrecognition from- the  British Government the pro-Germans in Finlandand Sweden will naturally do their best to use this delay againstGreat Britain with the object of improving German interests.You will have noticed that in a speech, reported in the dailypapers of January 27, Ktlhlmann referred to the Importance ofGerman exports to Finland, which, he stated, were equal in extentto the German exports to Turkey.    He insisted accordingly thatGermans should pay great attention to the Finnish question, inorder to t^ry and improve the economic relations between thecountrie^.   So far as I see, this is perfectly right from the
Ill                             5.German point of view, but with regard to the Finnish point of viewwe have no information to the effect that the Finnish Governmentand Diet have changed their mind from the position taken up beforeChristmas when we, the Finnish Delegation, were informed thatour Government would insist on full neutrality, and maintenance ofthe best economic relations with all the Great Powers, withoutfavouring Germany in any way.   During the war it has, of course,been difficult for the Allies to establish commercial relationswith Finland owing to the German naval supremacy in the Baltic.Great Britain could now, however, buy timber in Finland and therebysecure comparatively cheap supplies and, at the same time, givethe Finns an opportunity for labour, since at the present momentthe timber oompanies have too much timber in stock through havinghad no opportunity for export during tho period of the war, withthe result that their employees are out of work.   Though GreatBritain cannot directly sell to Finland she could buy in order tosecure this timber and keep it out of German hands;  and I shouldlike to add that if the British Government take this course ofaction, the Finnish Government could much more easily accept theproposal that the Finnish Government should prohibit the export ofwood and other commodities to Germany.   If the British Governmentaccept the proposal that they buy timber in Finland, the Finnishprivate companies and working men would not disapprove of suchan agreement, because from their point of view it does not matterto whom the stocks are sold.   Every year in the open marketthe Finnish Government sell 2j million growing pine and fir trees;the private companies sell still more.   (It may be stated that thespeaker was Minister for State Domains and State Forests in thelast Cabinet).   In 1917 not half of that amount was sold, thoprices offered being too low because of the difficulty of gettingit out of the country.   I notice that in British commercial
                                                               &quot;112                            4.periodicals there have been articles lately to the effect thatBritish firms ought to secure the possibility of getting timbereither from Russia or Finland after the war, and i think that itwould be a very successful enterprise from both the Finnish and the &quot;British point of view if the British Government would enterinto negotiations with the Finnish Government for selling timberfrom the Finnish crown Forests directly to the British Government;sawn wood Could be stored in the internal parts of the country till        *the end of the war.Recent Political Events.     &quot;In view of the recent coup dTetat I should like to insiston the point that the Finnish Socialists are not against theindependence of Finland, since in the beginning of December oflast year the proclamation of our sovereign independence wasunanimously sanctioned by our Diet, almost half of the  member-ship of which was Socialist.   The reason for the presentdisturbances lies in the fact that our Socialists are gfraidthat the Finnish bourgeois majority would not consent to theoverthrow of the present capitalistic order of things in Finland.Therefore, before the Russian Bolsheviks withdraw the Russiantroops from Finland, the Finnish Socialists want to makeuse of these Russian armed forces in overthrowing our bourgeoisie.After a Social Democrat success, the Finnish Socialists would askthe Russians to leave the country;  but there is no difference^between the Finnish Socialists and bourgeoisie with regard to themaintenance of Finland^ sovereign independence.   The soledifference lies in the point whether the Finnish Republicshall be a bourgeois Republic or a Republic established on theproper lines of Social Democratic doctrine.   Therefore theSocial Democrats have utilised the very grave economic conditions
113In the country and the presence of Russian troops in Finland asa pretext far open hostilities against the Finnish Governmentwhich is supported by the majority of the Diet.     &quot;All over the rest of Finland,&apos; except the capital and perhapsVyborg, the Red Guards and Bolshevik troops will undoubtedlybe fairly easily defeatedj  but in Helsingfors and in Vyborgthe revolutionaries can rely on Russian fortresses and big guns,and therefore the Government troops perhaps will not risk an openassault, so as not to provoke a bombardment of these towns.The Russian Baltic Fleet has also to be reckoned with;   thegreater part of it is in Helsingfors harbour,  aid though theharbour is frozen the guns can still be used against the town.This most regrettable state of affairs may last for some time,because as soon as the Red Guards are defeated the Socialists willfight the bourgeoisie on some new lines - for example, sabotage,local strikes and so on.     &quot;To understand the real inwardness of these events, however,it is necessary to recall our recent previous history.Parliamentary reform took place in Sweden in 1866;  the old systemof two Chambers was introduced;  at the same time, the franchisewas much extended and considerable attention was paid to thepolitical development of West European countries.  On the otherhand, in Finland, where the Diet was convoked in 1863 for thefirst time since the reign of Alexander I (1809), Liberal voiceswere suppressed, and the majority of the Diet considered that thefour-Chamber type of representation which we had had previouslywas the best that we could expect to have.   During 1905 FinnishLiberals tried in vain to convince the Swedish Party that theFinnish people must have a more modern form of representation.The Swedish Party had the majority in the Nobility and Burger
Chambers, and the Old Finnish Party had the majority amongst theclergy aid farmers, and these two parties fought against eachother as to whether the schools and universities should be Finnishand Swedish or wholly Swedish,   This question of education was,therefore, of the greatest Importance, as upon it depended thequestion of the official language of the country, and the decisionwhether the officials of the State should be compelled to knownot merely Swedish but also Finnish.   In other words, it was afight between the old Swedish bureaucracy and a new Finnishbureaucracy.   Both these parties got their political ideas fromGermany and Sweden, and they certainly resisted every Russianencroachment on Finnish internal affairs.   During the&quot;period1863-1905, however, neither of them paid very much attentionto social questions, and the Young Finnish Party which wanted toreorganise the Finnish political and social life on West Europeandemocratic lines, could hardly exert any influence in the develop-ment of political conditions owing to the exceptionally one-sidedand narrow franchise!.   When, however, the period of fullRussification began in 1899, the upper classes realised that theywould need to have the direct support of the vast majority of thepeople against the Russians, aid accordingly during the years1899-1905 the two Conservative parties became temporarilysympa thetic to suggestions of reform.   Immediately after the greatpolitical strike of 1905 all the three bourgeois parties agreedin giving the country universal suffrage, including even women.The old Parliament of four Chambers was abolished and a newDiet with one Chamber only was introduced (1906).  Unfortunately,when the new Diet was introduced Stolypin, as Premier of Russia,began in 1908 a new policy of oppression and stopped all the reformsaimed at by the Diet.  Accordingly it happens that to-day, even
115after the outbreak of the Russian Revolution, the new Diet hashardly had, during these last ten years, any opportunity of set,t3.ingthe most urgent social reforms.  Particularly during the lastmonths the Social Democrat agitators have blamed the bourgeoisparties for not having done anything before the introduction ofthe new Diet nor after it for the benefit of the people, and forthis reason also to a considerable extent the more ignorant classesof the people have lost all confidence in reforms throughpa^ltoaontary action and only trust to much more revolutionarywthods^  They do not look upon the Russians as their best friendsand do not want to remain in political union with Russia.On the contrary, they look on the Russians as the nearest andmost powerful^epresentatives of international Social Democracy.If, however, they could have invited German or Swedish SocialDemocrats or even British Labour troops to Finland, they would havedone so just as readily.  Revolutionary Russia, bureaucraticGermany and bureaucratic Sweden - the only Powers with whom we havebeen in direct and immediate contact - have all done us harm.On the other hand, whatever political or economic influence,coming from France or Britain, has been, exerted amongst us has proveda great success.   Nowhere, for example, in Northern Europe hasthe co-operative movement tn British lines been developed sosuccessfully as in Finland.   The same is also true with regard toinsurance companies, the largest of which in the whole ofNorthern Europe is the Finnish Suomi Company.    These factsprove that we are not a people who need to be governed onbureaucratic lines.   We have the right spirit for mutualassistance as in Anglo-Saxon countries, but we have had to waittoo long.  Everybody can read and write in Finland, but the people
had ho opportunity to reorganise their social and politicallife until it was too late.  Our educated classes can talkabout art and Shakespeare, but they know absolutely nothingabout social conditions.    The poorer classos hear it said thatnow is the time to establish a heaven on earth:  why should we notfight against the bourgeoisie?   That is the kind of ideologythat is at the back of the present upheaval&quot;.2*2*18.
