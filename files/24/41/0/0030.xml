                0 P E R A I I 0 H Sy .From;- (?) Colonel De Candolles, Rostoff Don,To     0*1*G*S              Repeated Colonel Barolay,  Jassy,Hb* 24 January 28th,          From north and west the Bolshevicks continue to press.During my last stay at tfovoohercask on January 24th thereoccurred a real panic*          Later on it transpired that the alarm had &quot;beengreatly exaggerated,          The main cause of disturbance was that the Cossackre-inforcements tainted with Bolshevism had refused to moveforward to replaoe other Cossacks who had retired withoutcause.          At the moment luckily the Boishevlcks were unableto follow but it is rumoured that the situation again to-dayis alarming.          These incidents have shown how unreliable are theCossacks particularly those around Hovoohercask,          It has been decided therefore to remove the League&apos;sHeadquarters to the practically non-Cossack town of Ilosstcwwhich according $o Korniloff is better situated for retre..&apos;ingtowards the south and east and where the recruiting andorganisation can be effected more freely,          Ko mil off who told me that lie could not travel ervento Rosstow except under the disguise of a common soldier isevidently very much disappoiaveu vizn tbe Don Cossacks andcontemplates a possibility of eventual retirement to the Volga,          (?) Altogether it is now (word omitted) that theleague cannot be prosperous without ^nore outside help thanmere money.          The League&apos;s  recruiting is proceeding at abouthal  the estimated rate and only 2,500 volunteers had beenenlisted last (?) Friday, the very numerous refugee officersdisplaying no alacrity to join up.          As against that, events in other parts of Russiaand elsewhere might at any time raise its prestige (? wordomitted) prospects,.          But we have had no reliable news of any kind forover a week from Petrograd, Kiev, Jassy or London, owingdoubtless to the precarious telegraphic conamunications,          JStews of moves in Siberia the Kediterranean or theWestern fronts might be very effective here.
