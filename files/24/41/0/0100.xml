MEMORANDUM

At the Imperial War Conference 1917, the following ?lution (No. XXIV) was passed dealing with the temptations to which men of the Overseas Forces are subjected when on leave:- 

"That the attention of the authorities concerned be called to the temptations to which our soldiers when on leave are subjected, and that such authorities be  empowered by legislation or otherwise (1) to protect our men by having the streets, the neighbourhood of ? and other places of public report, kept ?, as far as      practicable of women of the prostitute claus, and (2) to take any other steps that may be necessary to ? the serious evil that exists."

It was clear from the discussions which led up to this Resolution that there was a very strong feeling as to the need for effective action; and there in no doubt that public opinion in the ? is greatly exercised over the question.

Since the Conference terminated there have been constant consultations between the Departments concerned as to the form which action should take.

The War Cabinet will  be  mare that under Clause V of the Criminal Law Amendment Bill, it is proposed to make it an offence for a person who is suffering from veneral disease in a communicable form to have sexual intercourse with any other person or wilfully to communicate such disease in any other manner to ? other person, or to solicit or invite any other person to have sexual intercourse with him or her.

In the opinion of those best qualified to judge, such an ? would do much to check the prevalence and ? of veneral disease, and, in the interests of efficiency, the naval
naval and military authorities concerned would be glad to see it pass into law as soon as possible.

It has been suggested that the principle ? in Clause V of the Bill should be embodied in a Defence of the ? Regulation, but such a ? would be outside the scope of the Defence of the ? Act if it ? made of general application, and further it would be difficult from a Parliamentary point of view to defend such a course.

The authorities concerned are, however, satisfied that it is desirable to pass a Defence of the ? Regulation on the lines indicated, making it an offence for a ? in ? from venereal disease in a ? form to have sexual intercourse with any ? of His Majesty&apos;s forces; and at a ? between representatives of the Departments held at the Colonial Office on February 7th 1910 it ? agreed to recommend the immediate issue of a Defence of the ? Reputation in the terms of the ? draft.

It was felt to be desirable that the Regulations ? receive the ? of the ? Cabinet before it is issued.

W.H.L. 12.2.18.
