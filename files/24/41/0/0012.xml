(This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic IVJaje3ty&apos;s Government.)ECRti,From: C.M.A.               Despatched 3.85 p.m. 28.1.10,,.To:-  D.M.I.               Received   5.15 p.m, 29,1.18.245 Jan.  8.  Weekly summary fer week ending Jan. 26th.POLITICAL.  It is possible that the recent disturbances (1) on Tiflis-Baku lina between Tartars and soldiers on troop trains; (2) inTrebisond with marauding bands of looal Turks; (3) in Lrzinjan andErzer^m regions; (4) in Lrivan and Kalaat Basut areas; may pointtc some more oonoerted intentions than the natural desire offollowing up an evacuating army and loot.          ^he interruption of telegraphic communication for thelast 4 days on I.:, line at Akstafa. Kamarluand Assemukhanlu maybe intentional.  Centre of Pan-Islamism is at Baku and Elivavetpol.It is known that for months past Turkish^propaganda has been rifehere; agents here say it is part of the scheme of Enver Pasha inthe early spring Cor Turks and Tartars to seize the Caucasus.  Upto the present my endeavours to mark down Tartar party leaders havenot been successful.          On General Dunsterville&apos;s arrival suggest we have Britishofficer in Baku temporarily.  Disorders have not yet been suppressed.          Disturbance at Elizavetpol originated in an attempt byTartars to disarm Russian soldiers at Armenian instigation.  T.C.Government sent Georgian company to deal with Tartars;  This was apolitioal move.          The interview with President and financial Minister ofT.C. Government was satisfactory; lack of money having made themmore amenable.  Gegechkori affirms that his Government will enterinto closer relations with south-east federation so soon as theArmy is evacuated; at present it is impracticable in view of thepossibility of civil war.  T.C Government, though nominallyrecognised in Baku is without real authoritythere.   At any momentT.C. Government may be replaced by Government consisting of memberselected for national assembly by all natives;  land question hasalso weakened Governments position.FINANCIAL.   No news has oome from Baku, owing to-total interruptionof Communications.  During past week all banks have stopped issueof money.; No sterling drafts sold here yet.   Propose purchasegold in Persia for krans, as this is more advantageous.  No bondshave yet  been issued by T.C. Government.MILITARY.    An impetus has been given to the Russian VolunteerCorps, and they are confident that 1 division will be ready in amonth  and the corps in 2* months from now.  Corps Commander Dratsenkcis a remarkably sound and capable man.  Russian Volunteers havebeen formed in Terek Province also for internal defence.Armenians on front constitute a line of observation only from KalkitFrzinjan  Khinis Melasgird to Van, with reserves at Erzerum Hassan-Kale Kars Alexandropol Tiflis and Erivan.  Bashkala Urumiyah Ushnusection is still held by Russian 7th Corps,.GENERAL.   Speeches of Wilson and 10.0yd George on war aims havemade exoellent  impression here, particularly the latter among theArmenians.C.2. Copies to:  M.I,l.a,
