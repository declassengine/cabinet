INTERNAT10NAL LABOUR CONFERENCE

Memo by Mr. Barnes

Some six weeks Ago, I wrote a letter to the Prime Minister, giving as my opinion that the position as regards an international Labour and Socialist Conference had somewhat altered, and that it might be advisable to agreet? such a conference, always providing that there was a common agreement amongst the Allies reached first, and that they in turn should have an opportunity of meeting bon? fide representatives of LabouraAnd Socialist rank and file in enemy countries.

The matter is now again assuming an acute form, in ? much as a deputation of the Labour party is going to Paris next week to meet at least the French and Italian Labour and Socialist parties and then after that, the Italians and Frenchmen are coming here and a conference is to be held on the 20th. February. There is now, I think, a chance of an agreement as between the delegates of the three countries, and that will be a new fact,  inasmuch as the last attempt to get that agreement,  which was made here in London last Autumn broke down.  It is true that on the strict letter of the Labour Party resolution guiding the matter, America should still come in. But still, America is not technically an Ally; And therefore, providing Agreement is reached on the 20th., a demand will again be made for passports.

The question Arises how shall we meet that demand? I am inclined to think that the passports should be granted if representatives from the Trade Union Congress and Labour Party are given a chance of meeting persons equally representative of German and Austrian labour. That appeals to my mind as the right course to adopt, for two reasons.

(l)Public opinion here is, I believe, developing in favour of it.

(2)I think the time any become opportune when we might use such an international conference as a diplomatic weapon for stoking up opinion in enemy countries in favour of roasonable peace terms. I note that the Bolshevists are aiming at an international conference of their own, and one from which they say, they would exclude men like Henderson And Branting as being quite back numbers. The development of that idea might be prevented by the holding of international conference of comparatively responsible people like the Labour Party of this country. But if it waS hold, I should make a confident of one or other of the persons going from here as delegates with a view to guiding the counsels at such conference so  far as possible on the lines of the British war aims.

To refuse would create friction and strengthen the disaffected element in the community.

I venture to circulate this now so that we may be consulting the French and Italian Government in time to avert untoward development.
