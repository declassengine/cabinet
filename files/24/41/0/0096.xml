War - CabineF 329^ Minute 12        The Committee called by Lord Derby to consider the decision    of  the War Cabinet on paper G.T.-3411 of January 23rd, namely    that the Military Service Acts  should continue  to be  applied    to  Russians and that in the event of it being impossible to    get them all  into the Army, they should be sent to camps as    suggested by  Lord Derby and &quot;be maae to understand that their    return to Great Britain, once they  had been  deported  to Russia,    could not be  permitted, .met this afternoon.        The Foreign  Office Representative laid  stress on the    reasons why the compulsory . enlistment of Russians in  this    country should now cease,  as set out by Mr.  Balfour in his    Memorandum of January 21st, which had already been circulated    to  the Cabinet (GvT* 3411.).&apos;  He also explained  that a strong    protest had been received from.  Monsieur Li-tvinoff practically    denouncing the convention,,  and  that. Mr.. Lookhart had  had a    conversation  with. Monsieur  Chiehirine who  stated that the    convention was causing  great irritation in Russia and    damaging British,  int.ere-.sts..  In. view further of Foreign Office    telegram Ho..  219.  to-Mr.. Lindley of-February  9th, the  Foreign      ,. vi. ew.    Office/was that such, a  serious.cause of.offence, as the contin-    uedoperation of  the convention, should if possible be avoided,    and that the  War-  Cabinet decision as to interning them should    be  reviewed in the light of the later decision. The  views  of    the other Departments were  that the abandonment of the- convention    would revive  domestic difficulties  which the convention was    designed to remove, namely  complaints of unequal treatment  of     ritish subjects who are called up  for service  and of allied    aliens.  The  lapse of the convention would also be hailed as a    triumph for Bolshevik propaganda.
                   &quot;2-                                        I     The suggestion of  internment  of Russians  in  special camprappeared impracticable  for  the  following  reasons     (1)  Special powers  would  have to  be taken to  effect this,     (2)  Provision would have  to  be made for  the wives  and     children of those  interned, who number  20,000  in London     alone.     (3)  Tonnage is not  available to  effect the  transport of     the interned Russians  to Russia;  and even if it were     considered politically desirable  to  provide  such tonnage,     each ship taken would  mean one less  vessel for transport-     ing American troops  to Prance.     (4)  A very heavy  burden will be  put upon the  police who     will be responsible  for rounding  up  Russians.  There are     now 8,000 absentees  unaccounted for  in  London, and it     was considered that  it would inevitably lead to reprisals     against British subjects  in Russia.     It is therefore for  the V/ar Cabinet  to  decide  whether theconvention be continued for domestic reasons or allowed tolapse,  and if it is decided to  drop it,  it is  suggested thatall that is necessary is  merely to suspend action (i.e.  to calup no more Russians for service),  and  not formally  to  denouncethe convention.  Such action would probably  be followed by ademand  for the release cf the  4,000 -  5,000  Russians nowactually serving.  The Committee were  of  the opinion that thisdemand  should be resisted,  but  they desire to  point out thatMonsieur Litvinoff is almost certain  to press  for it. Alterna-tive  suggestions for using the men,  e,g.  for military purposesother than actual fighting, or on compulsory work of nationalimportance,  if any scheme for  this could be  devised, would beequally objectionable to the Bolshevik Government,  andMr.&apos;Lindley has reported that  this would lead  to  reprisals.If however it is hereafter decided to  force  friendly aliens
and.-nJeutrai.s.,.to--do work of national importance,  it  is  clearthat Russians should not he placed in a favoured position.Foreign Office,     February 11th, 1918.
