[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys  Government.]^413Printed for the  War Cabinet.  February  1918.SECEET.JANUARY  SHIPBUILDING  OUTPUT.    MY attention has been drawn to ajpaper circulated by theAdmiralty on the causes  of the  failure  of  the shipyards  toreach, their expected output in January.   In this it is shown that,while holidays, weather, housing, and general  labour unrest havetended to reduce output,  the principal adverse factor has  beendisputes arising out of the V2\ per cent, bonus.  It is, of course,very difficult to appraise the influence of individual factors ofunrest upon the general labour situation.  I must, however, drawthe attention of the War  Cabinet to certain serious  inaccuraciesin fact -    Eor instance, an  example is quoted that  as the result  of a&quot;Stay-in strike&quot; policy  &quot;in one engineering establishment theoutput of the month was reduced by 40 per cent, of the normal out-put of that establishment.&quot;  This statement was also made to theWar Cabinet when they were considering the 1\ per cent, bonus ofpiece-workers, and  appeared greatly to influence their decision.I therefore asked the Admiralty the name of the firm in question,and was informed it was G. and J. Weir,  of Glasgow.  This firmmanufacture pumping machinery for all classes of ships; they are,at the present moment, well ahead with their deliveries,  Pumpingmachinery for ships is invariably delivered three to six monthsahead of the completion of the  ships.   It  is therefore difficult tosee what relevance the present situation  in G.  and J. Weir&apos;s shophas to the failure to realise the shipbuilding output for January.The  introduction of this  example is extremely misleading,  and,even if the facts at G. and J. Weir&apos;s were as  stated, thef wouldafford no explanation of the short fall in Admiralty output duringJanuary.    I am advised that it is not correct to  state that the strike inthe shipbuilding yards on  the Clyde towards the end of last yearwas caused by the 12^ per cent, bonus.   It was initiated by  theboilermakers, who  definitely struck  against  a Committee onProduction award.  Of 11,500 men who were on strike, 10,000 wereboilermakers; and the boilermakers&apos; dispute had no relation what-ever to the 12^  per cent, bonus.   Sir Thomas Munro, who visitedGlasgow in January, after careful enquiry, reported that  the 12-^per cent, advance was not, in his opinion,  an active factor in thesituation, and that the unrest  was  due  to  the activities of apacifist and revolutionary  section of the men industriously work-ing on the general dissatisfaction which existed. This element hasbeen present in  the Clyde area more than in  any other  districtduring the whole course of the war.    In Belfast, again,  the strike which occurred was, as in the caseof the boilermakers on the Clyde,  a strike against a Committeeon Production award.  The workmen  and employers had agreedtogether on a 1\ per cent, advance.  The Committee on Productionwould not recognise this, and awarded 5 per  cent.; but a monthlater gave the award on which  the workmen and employers  hadpreviously agreed.
     The Admiralty Memorandum dwells also upon the housirlg accommodation in  Glasgow.   The Glasgow housing  conditions have long been unsatisfactory, but the acute difficulties which now exist are due to the Admiralty&apos;s desire to draft immediately large numbers of men  to the  Clyde  for whose reception no previous arrangements have  been  made.   This should surely have been foreseen in estimating future outputs.     With regard to the  holidays and  the  weather,  these also might  have  been  foreseen.   Holidays  are  usual  in  Scotland from the 1st to the  12th of January, and  it is well known that all outputs are profoundly  affected&apos; thereby.  The  weather also  in these regions is usually bad  at-this season of the year.     The estimate that approximately 120,000 tons of  shipping would  be produced  by  the shipyards  in January was always con- si dered by the&quot; officers of this  Department  to be  an impossible one, having regard  to  the above inevitable conditions and to the general capacity of  the shipbuilding  yards.  We have for a long time pointed  out that  these  inflated  estimates  would  not  be achieved, and I  have  deprecated, as strongly as possible,  the diversion of steel plates to  the shipyards from urgently-needed. services like the tanks  and locomotives without any true relation to the  capacity&apos;of the yards  to build  them into ships.     There would, I think, be no difficulty this year in supplying the Admiralty, as and when  they require them, with all the plates they are able genuinely to build into ships.  But it is surely wrong that these precious  plates should be taken away  from services  of the highest consequence and war urgency only to be hoarded  in shipyards for long  periods  before there  is any  means  of  using them.     The output  of plates is steadily increasing,  land  we have delivered to the Admiralty  during the five  months of last&apos; yearnearly  70;000  tons  more  than we  undertook  to  do.  Their con-sumption has been much less  than their expectation, and the FirstLord has  stated in his  recent  Memorandum  on   ShipbuildingRequirements that &quot; steel is no longer a limiting factor.&quot;                              WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.    February  8,  1918.
