M3?AL7?ORZEHS1 STRIP.                            IB LQHDOH DISTRICT ,                        gotgsjby Mr-.      Barnes.      1.  It has lasted a fortnight come Monday nextu           The demand is for l/ld0 per hour minimum rate for the           London district.      2.  If agreed, to. it will give the London men about 40/- per           week $vf&amp;9$5eir pre-war earnings.  It is also in direct           defiance of the Treasury agreement of 1915, to v/hich the           Sheet Metalworkers were parties, in slmt it &quot;breaks away           from the agreement that the pre-war rate should not he           increased ,      3.  It is an unauthorised strike, there being no strike pay           and the Union officials being, if not against it, at all           events passive.      4.  The first shop to give the l/ld0 per hour was a shop under           Government control about eleven weeks ago.&apos; -  The shop had           just been taken over, and the l/ld0 may have been paid           unvvittingly because of lack of complete knowledge of the           facts and consequences *      5.  Since then, some shops have paid the l/ld*  on demand being           made, the plea having been put forward that the Govern-           ment shop was paying it-,      6.  Cases have oeen taken from other shops to the Committee           on Production which has invariably turned  them down.           Those shops who are paying are doing so contrary to           Committee on Production awards *      7.  One of the shops still outstanding is Farnborough, a           Government shop, and being regarded as belonging to           London although 50 miles away,      8.  The strike being unauthorised and unsubsidised, may not           last long, but the men are apparently well led and have           put themselves apparently within the law by giving due           notice and working out that notice.      9.  The countrymen are also apparently in sympathy v?ith them           as the Birmingham men have refused to do the work which           might have been tilted on there instead of being done           in London.     10.  The three very awkward features in the situation are:-           1.  That tho Committee on Production has refused to              assent to the increased rate, and&apos;           2.  theft the increased rate would give the men a very              much larger increased earning than any other classI              of men during the war, apart from it being an increase              in rate rather than bonus and therefore a breaking              away from the 191,5 agreement, and           3.  it might start a new cycle and give rise to freshi              demands from other classes of workmen,,  2  Whitehall Gardens, S.W.. l.
