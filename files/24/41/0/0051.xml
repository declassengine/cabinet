PROPOSED INVITATION TO FRENCH AND ITALIAN PARLIAMENTARY AIR COMMITTEES TO VISIT THIS COUNTRY.

Copy of letter  from Mr. W.Joynson-Hicks., M.P.to the Prime Minister.

15. St. James&apos;s Place.

S.W.1.

5th February, 1918.

My dear Prime Minister,

The Parliamentary Air Committee some little time ago decided to invite the Parliamentary Air Committees of France and Italy to pay a visit to this country. We, however, let the matter stand over until such time as your now Air Minister should have got into the saddle.

I have now been in communication with Lord Rothermere, and he writes me: "Needless to say so far as the Air Council is concerned I can assure you of our cordial support.  You can rely on my help".

This being so it merely remains to ask the permission of the War Cabinet to issue this invitation. To those of us who believe in the ultimate victory of one side or the other in the Air the interchange of views cannot but be advantageous; added to which anything that brings the Allies closer together must be to their mutual advantage.

I trust that the War Cabinet will welcome this proposal as cordially as does the Air Council, and if they or any secretary would like to see me I need hardly say that I am at their disposal.

Believe me,

Yours sincerely,

(Signed). W.JOYNSON-HICKS.

Chairman.
