The tenant of a 200 acre  grass  farm nearTowcester, who lives at a distance from his  farm,  had  beenordered to plough up 53 acres.   His tenancy expires atMichaelmas 1918 and the farmhouse is unoccupied.    The ExecutiveCommittee are accordingly about to take;possession of  the  farmand to break up the 53 acres themselves, using  the farm alsoas a depot for the Department^ horses and ploughs.Surrey.  The Committee have taken possession of 290 acres  ofderelict land at Oxted, Tandridge and Godstone, which  ismostly covered with thoras and brambles, and is occupied byvarious persons.  , The clearing, hedging and ditching  will bedone by soldier labour, and the subsequent cultivationscarried out&apos;by the Departments Motor Training  School  whichis near -by... l        *The Weather.The weather during the past week was very  favourableLOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION.Agricultural Executive Coj,imittees.

The Committee have been in conference wdthe Masters of Beverley Pastures, and as a result  they are about Jtake possession of, and to let for cultivation, 20 acres of  thePigham Pasture.   The rest of these pastures are unsuitable  forploughing.Golf Courses.  The East Sussex Committee have ordered the ploughiJup of 55 acres of the East Blatchington Course.    In Surrey  30 adof the Beulah Hill Course are to be ploughed, and  15 acres of theBeckenham Course;  20 acr&apos;es of the latter will be  used for allotmaIn the West Riding 13 acres of the Otley Course are being ploughedup.

During the week 7 Orders have been  jmade authorising landlords to determine tenancies  on account of blfarming in respect of 562 acres, and 4 Orders have been made by tlBoard determining the tenancies of 31C  acres.                   I                      HORTICULTURAL DIVISION.                    IFruit and Vegetable Preserving    56 Demonstrations in Bottlingand Drying and 8 in Canning have been given during the week,    [Fruit Section -  At. the instance.of the Department, the LondonSalesmen&apos;s Association has undertaken to establish a basketmaking workshop, and is now in negotiation with the V7ar Office   I
for sanction to use Gore Farm,  Dartford for this purpose.20 German Prisoners of War have been -sent to the Sveshom MarketGardeners&apos; Association for their Co-operative Basket MakingFactory.Provision oi Lund for Allotments - Reports received from 1,111districts show that 236,541 applications have been rm.de forplots under the Order, and 212,401 plots have been providedcontaining a total area of 16,333 acre3.          The number of Inspectors in tho Allotments Section isnow 12, and thoy have visited 31 districts during tho past week.On the advice of the Inspectors, Local Authorities have acquired628 acres, making provision for 11,724 new allotments.  It isnoteworthy that the large majority of the allotments included inthis number (which has not been included in th^ total figuresin the preceding paragraph), aro each of 16 rods instead of themore usual and somev/hat restricted 10 rods, which it iscustomary to provide.   The Inspectors continue to do usefulwork in arranging for the continuance of the tenancy of allotmentholders in cases ^here they have received notice to quit fromprivate landowners.          The High Court has refused an application made by anoccupier of land for an injunction to restrain Exeter Municipaland County Borough from entering on the land for tho purpose ofproviding allotments under tho Cultivation of Lands Order.                           TECHNICAL DIVISION.Inspection of Land - The Colcsbourno Estate in Gloucestershire  -.7us inspected by one of thu Technical Advisers of the Depart-ment.  The Committee feel that under present conditions sucha large area Of land cannot be allowed to remain unproductive,and in view of the local difficulties involved they wish thoDepartment to guide them in the matter.
          The Estate comprises 3,200 acres, but some of it islet and much is in woodland, park, etc, so that the inspectiononly applied to about 1,400 acres, of which 330 acres Is arable,150 acres virgin down or hill grazing, and 800 acres grassland,of fair quality.   The remaining 700 acres has all been in arab]cultivation, but during the last 30 years or so, has beenallowed to become practically derelict, and rabbits are theonly form of production or source of income from the greaterpart.          The Inspector has recommended that the ExecutiveCommittee be authorised to serve notices requiring the owner(1)  to plough up and cultivate for corn and potatoes in 1918not less than 53 acres, including certain specified fields;( )  to plough and summer fallow, with a view to sowing rye or-;;heat in autumn 1918 or oats in spring 1919, not less than 167acres, including specified fields;  (3)  to plough and cultivatefor corn or potatoes in 1919, a specified field of 18 acres,   IIt is further recommended that, subject to a satisfactory -     fscheme being drawn up, the Committee be authorised to take     Iover a specified portion of the remaining land and to employa gang of prisoners with a view to bringing as much as possiblelunder crop in 1919,                                            jPlant Diseases,   A summary of existing information relating tolFrit Ply has been prepared, partly to assist farmers In        Jcombating the pest during the present season, and partly to    Iform a basis of further experimental work,                     j          further information has no;; been received with       Ireference to the destruction of wheat in the Wadebridge distrlflof Cornwall, confirming the original diagnosis as to the damage!being due to slugs  (vide Report dated fcnd ultimo).  Suitable   Itreatment Las been advised,                                    1
          Numerous complaints have been received as to damagedone to potatoes by the organism Bacillus solanacesrum.   Thisdisease is being investigated.   There are also reports of thepresence of Chafer larvae in newly-ploughed grassland in Wales,and of the dectruction of wheat sown on newly-ploughed grass-land due to millipedes.          A memorandum giving advice ac to the treatment ofseed grain for the prevention of Smut has been prepared forpublication.                      i^UR^I VISION.Soldier Labour.  Of the ploughmen sent from overseas on two months1agricultural furlough, 193 have gone back to France during the vreek,leaving 1,225 still on the land.   Exclusive of these men 33,708soldiers (23,443 skilled and 10,265 unskilled) have been attachedto depots to date, and of these 29,404 (22.100 skilled and 7,304unskilled) are out with farmers.          The position as regards skilled ploughmen was fullyexplained in last week&apos;a report.  . With a view to meeting theurgent domand for such men. as quickly as possible the Departmenthave suggested to the Military Authorities that in place of11,000 unskilled soldiers still to be drawn from the Army underthe Cabinet decision of June 27th last they should furnish 6,000really skilled men, if this can be done without undue delay.          A few men (36 in all) of the Canadian and&apos;South AfricanForces have been placed at the disposal of the Department during &apos;the week,&apos; and have been sent out.          An:additional 20 men have been cent out for training astractor drivers, making a total to date of 2,587.Horses.  Orders for the Issue of 57 additional horses have beensent out during the - week making a total of 5,365 horses to date.Prisoners of War.  Four additional prisoner ploughmen camps havebeen opened during the week, making a total of six such camps to
date, comprising in all 229 prisoner ploughmen.  These areexpected to be followed at an early date by a large number of ocamps, which are nearing completion.  In all 101 schemes for themployment of these prisoner ploughmen have been sent to the WaOffice.         The number of combatant prisoners of war now employedthe land is 5,026, and together with 1,543 released aliens, ma]total of 6,569 prisoners now employed on farm work.,                           Women&apos;s Branch,         During the winter there has been evidence that membersthe Land Army and other women workers on farms have stuck to thjobs from a patriotic desire to help their country, and that inface of what are often difficult conditions.  In order to encouthe women, and to counteract the loneliness of their lives, anumber of meetings of women, land workers havo been held in thecountry towns which have been greatly appreciated.  Incidental!such meetings with their picturesque processions.of Land Army eVillage Workers have served as good recruiting agencies.         Three Efficiency Tests have been held in Middlesex, mtests in milking have also beeh-held in North Wales during theweek.  The results have been good, most of the women who entersproving themselves very efficient.         An experiment is being made in Devonshire with RyracusRiding Ploughs,  Several have been obtained and are to be workea unit of women.  A certain amount of work will be taken oncontract, and as soon as a trial-has been made a report will bepublished.  If the experiment is successful it is hoped that we:will materially assist in breaking up the land in Devonshire.
          In Suffolk 15 women 6re employed on tho Brandon farms,some driving engines for pumping water and grinding food for cattle,others driving milk to the station,  and doing milk rounds.          Six now Group Leaders have been appointed within tholast fortnight.  There is an increasing demand for their workthroughout the whole country.                    MECHANICAL CULTIVATION DIVISION.          The following statement shows the position as regardsthe provision of tractors owned by the Department:-          Consigned to County Committees and            Tractor Schools up to and including  5th February..........................    2,137Consigning Instructions given during  the week...................... 102.

          Three tractors in one unit in Oxford ploughed 73j acreequalling an average of 24 acre3 each per week, on an average fu-;consumption of 4,7 gallons to the abre;  and a Titan Tractor insame county ploughed 31 acres on a fuel consumption averaging5,3 gallons to the acre.          The best performance of the week was that of the Redhilunit in Surrey which with three tractors achieved 94 acres j givir.an average acreage per tractor per week of 31 acres.   The averanfuel consumption was 4t5 gallons per acre.   One of the TitanTractors in this unit ploughed 51 acres in tile week on a  fuelconsumption averaging 4.1 gallons to the acre,          A Titan Tractor in the Kesteven division of Lincolnshirploughed 26 acres on an average fuel consumption per acre of3.2., and, another in Norfolk ploughed 30-1 acres on an averagefuel consumption of 4 gallons to the acre, while a third  tractorof the same make in Shropshire ploughed 27f acres on a fuelconsumption averaging 3,4 gallons to the acre.                     SUPPLIES DIVISION.Fertilisers,  The arrangements for dealing with fertilisers  inthe season 1918-19 are being discussed with the Ministry  ofMunitions.    It is proposed to fix by Order prices of sulphateof ammonia, superphosphate ar*d basic slag at rates includingdelivery to consumers station.   The need for economisingrailway transport demands that distribution shall be so control^as to prevent them being sent unnecessarily long journeys.   Theprinciple will not be extended to compound fertilisers&quot;.          The rise in the price of acid will under presentconditions cause a material and serious increase in  the pricesof superphosphate and sulphate of ammonia next season.
 Sulphate  of  Ammonia.   The  supply  of  sulphate  to  the lest Indies and  other British colonies for  sugar crops  is assuming importranc^&apos; because  the- United States  of  America has  asked the Ministry of.Munitions to undertake the supply to them of  ammonia (presumably including sulphate),.    The alternative  use  of nitrate  of soda or some nitrogenous  organic material is under  consideration. Basic Slag..   The  production of  the British Basic Slag  Company, the  largest  producers, may exceed their estimate by 10,000 tons,: This amount  is  now being offered  for sale to  Approved  Agents.           The long negotiations for  grinding  low grade slag are making better progress..   It  is stated  that the  Cambridge works will begin producing  within a fortnight,  and  arrangements at other centres are also proceeding. Potash,   Deliveries of blast  furnace flue dust proceed regularly. the  distribution  during December  amounted to  about 1,400 tons, and  the  total supply  since October to about 3,700 tonsc Lime, Waste carbonate of  lime  from  munition  works in Cheshire  is  now being supplied  regularly td farmers, over 250 tons being loaded weeklyj  which is about the  maximum quantity for  which trucks  can  be provided.   Orders  are in hand, however, for  about I;900 tons, and  this  is probably as much as  it will be possible  to  deal with  this season..           In several  cases men  from Agricultural Labour Companies have  been lent to lime  works  during the autumn and winter but  these men are now being recalled.   Their servioes at the present  time would be most useful, in lime production,  more particularly as these men  are now practically skilled  lime workers,, and are  of more use  to agriculture thus occupied than on farms, whore their labour  would be unskilled.   The Labour Division has been asked to arrange for  a limited number of men from Agricultural Companies to  be retained for lime works.. Sulphate  of  Copper0  The Ministry of Munitions is about to issue,.at the request of  this Department,, an  Order fixing the wholesale and retail  price of sulphate  of copper...
Seed Wheat.  Any surplus remaining after February 15th will bedisposed of, as it would be un:;ise to recommend the availablevarieties for sowing after that date.Seed Oats,  (i) Manx Oats.  Additional quantities are arriving iLiverpool and are being examined.   The condition of the last cosignments is rather better than those previously received.            (-tl) Irish Oats,  Twelve cargoes have been received,3, 47 tons in all.   The condition of some was unsatisfactory adone or two will be rejected.   It is not practicable to recleanthese oats in large quantities, and where they need recleaning twill be sold to the farmer on the clear understanding that he rawdo it himself.   Instructions have been issued In Ireland foradditional care in the selection of consignments.          The demand for black oats in the South and West of Endis considerable, and a complete cargo of 37S tons has elready besold,                                                           I            (iii) Sc^^^s^Oats. : About 3,280 quarters in all habeen purchased during the last week, of the varieties &quot;Record&quot;,&quot;Abundance&apos;5, &quot;Yielder&quot;, &quot;Leader&quot; and &quot;Victory&quot;.   Arrnagements abeing made for these oats to be distributed from stores in EnglalThe selections have been made by a small Committee consisting oilmerchant with an intimate knowledge of seed oats, a member of thAdvisory Committee on Cereals, and an officer of the TechnicalDivision.  .                                                     jSeed Potatoes,  Up to 2nd February .10,115 tons have been ordered!forward, and 530 tons delivered.   A very large quantity is noT.Tlrail as the weather has been favourable.             ,  -        IPotato Spraying.  Very successful meetings have been held at WaiPortland and Dorchester,   Over SI meetings have already been  1arranged in Dorset alone, and despite previous apathy in the colit Is likely that spraying will be taken up generally.         \
          The Town Hall, Grimsby, has been offered free of chargefor a lecture on Potato Spraying.          The Chief Constable of Bedfordshire has promised hismoot hearty co-operation, and has allowed the local Organiser totrain police to be of practical service.          A successful lecture was given at Taunton Barracks tothe men of various Units ongagod in agricultural labour, and thereis an ever growing demand for lectures at Military Camps.          Lectures in &apos;.Vales are most successful and farmers drivemiles to the meetings despite inclement weather.&quot;/art Disease in Potatoes.  Applications for licences to plantootatoes on infected land are being dealt  vith.        ^  The number of applications for the Board&apos;s certificateapproving dealers for the sale of recognised resistant varietiesof &quot;seed&quot; potatoes may amount to 1,500 as against less than 300last year.  In addition to the quantity of resistant varietieswhich will be supplied to dealers, the Department is distributingseveral thousand tons, and growers should have no difficulty inobtaining their requirements.Seed Control.  Inspectors V visits to seed merchants show that thorequirements of the &quot;Testing of Seeds Order&quot; are not yet beinrcomplied v/ith generally by retail seedsmen, owing rather toignorance of its provisions and to shortage of labour than toobstructiveness.          It -//as not expected that the trade would be able tofollow  out the requirements of the Order immediately, and for thepresent season the Department-fs efforts are directed to educatingrather  than to forcing seedsmen to adopt the procedure laid do-m.Seed Exports and Liiitary Service.  The importance of  affordingfurther protection to seed experts is being urged on the Ministryof National ServS.ce, which has also been asked to release fromthe Army certain experts of low medical category.  Unless some                             - 11 -
relief  is  afforded to the trade, the distribution of  seeds wil]be seriously prejudiced.Seeds for  the British Expeditionary Force  in France.   Arrangemeare being  made to purchase large quantities of,vegetable seedsrequired by the. Director of Agricultural Production of the B.E.,France.  As much as possible has been  obtained from Frenchseedsmen,  but the bulk must be provided from this country.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P.     President of the Board of Agriculture                         and Fisheries.
