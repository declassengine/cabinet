SECRET. (This Document  is the Prop^y^oj&apos;^il!i^ll!i2^ ^a^esty&apos;s Government)MINISTRY   OF   FOOD.for  Week  ending Wednesday, January  30,  1918.PART  I. ACTION  TAKEN.                       CONTROL  OF.  SUPPLIES AND  PRICES.    Allied Purchases- The  conditions of  the American railways and  the Atlanticports have continued to delay the shipments of foodstuffs which have been purchasedand the anticipated  January arrivals of bacon, hams, and lard  are only 16,500 tonsas compared with a requirement of 38,000.   Mr. Owen Smith, however, has informedus that every effort is  being made by the  United  States G overnment  to clear thecongestion on the railways and get forward  foodstuffs, so that better conditions are&apos;hoped for in February.   Some delay in shipments must also be attributed to the factthat the allocations of foodstuffs to the Allies for January purchase  were not madeuntil the beginning  of January, and therefore orders could not be placed so as to getdeliveries before the latter part of  the  month.  This is  a  result of the generalco-ordination of purchases  by the Allies and the American Government, and cannotbe attributed to any delay on the part of the British  Purchasing Organisation.    The purchase  of  the  extra  67,000 tons of bacon  above the  normal demand,recently sanctioned, is being concluded, but at present no arrangements for immediateshipment are complete.    Mr.  Owen Smith states,  however, that he will be able to fill all  the refrigeratedspace, 29,000 tons, put  at his disposal for February with refrigerated meat and thathe  hopes to be  able  to conclude  contracts for.  40,000 tons&apos; delivery  before theloth March.    A meeting  of  the Inter-Allied Meat and Fats  Executive, at which the Ministryof Shipping, the Board  of Trade,  and the War Office were  represented, was held- todiscuss the allocation of the  frozen meat available from the United States between theAllies.  No definite conclusion was reached, as further figures are being prepared, butit seems  probable that some  additional allocation must be made to Italy.    Bacon, Hams, a.nd Lard. As anticipated in the last Report it has been foundnecessary to postpone the scheme  for the distribution  of imported bacon, hams, and;lard which Vas originally intended  to come into  force on the 1st  February, 1918.A notice announcing the postponement appeared in the Press  on the 28th January, 1918.    The question of transport has been discussed with the Branch concerned, and itis hoped to effect some  improvement in removing goods from the quay.  The provisionof cold storage has also been discussed and it is anticipated that there will be sufficientspace for this Ministry  s requirements in regard to these commodities.    A proposal to stop the purchase of unrefined lard in  the United  States is underconsideration on the ground that it would be cheaper to  buy refined  lard than to paythe English refiners.     The proposals for the  amendment of the  Bacon,  Ham, and Lard  (Provisional Prices) Order, 1917, are making progress and it should be possible  stilJ further to simplify the Order if unrefined lard from America is eliminated.     The Costings Division  has now reported on  the costs of  and recommended profit for the manufacture and-distribution  of home produced bacon and hams.     Butter.-k further purchase of 57 tons of butter  has been made in the United States of America, the  price being from 43  cents to 45f cents per  lb. f.a.s.  in New York.  In Canada a further 66 tons of butter have been purchased at prices ranging from 37-1 to 47 cents per lb.     On January 23rd  the S.S. &quot; Abadesa &quot;  arrived with 560 tons of  butter from the Argentine, and S.S &quot; Vestris,&quot; with 1,039 tons, arrived on January 27th, also from the Argentine.  Two ships carrying butter have arrived  from the United States of America, S.S.-&quot; Francisco &quot; on January 18th with 225 tons, and S.S. &quot; Valeria &quot;on January 22nd with 27 tons.-                              11                          &apos;&quot;     A (33)4763-5 Pk 1 100  2/18 E &amp; S                                          A
     Cereals.- The Food Controller has, in conjunction with the three Departments ofAgriculture, decided that the prices  of corn harvested in 1918 shall be fixed on abasis somewhat similar to that adopted in 1917, viz., that the maximum prices for-     (1) Wheat and Rye will be based on  an average price of  75s.  per quarter of           504 lbs. ;     (2) Barley will be based on an average price of 65s. per quarter of 448 lbs. ;     (3) Oats will be based on an average price of 46s. 3d. per quarter of 336 lbs. ;and  that an addition to the price  of oats shall  be  allowed -for the better classes soldfor milling purposes.     The export of oats from; Scotland or Ireland is  prohibited, except under licence,or in case of oats purchased by any Government Department.     Cocoa. Committees of Brokers have been formed at London and Liverpool tocarry out the grading of Cocoa  Beans for  the purpose of the Maximum  Prices Orderwhich it is anticipated will be issued in the course of a few d ays. ,;,  Dried Fruits. The  Ministry of  Shipping report  that  the S.S.  &quot; Rooke&quot; isavailable1 and&quot; suitable for the transport of currants, and she has received instructionsto load 1,000 tons at Patras.- ;    Allocations of. the currants  ex  S.S.  &quot;Oonfield&quot; have  been made to the WarOffice, the Navy and Army Canteen Board, and  the Admiralty.  The balance of thecurrants will be retained for the purpose of general distribution when further arrivalsof currants or sultanas are secured. ,    The S.S. &quot; Kurmark,&quot; with 7,000 tons of dates,  has arrived, and is  unloading inthe London Docks.  . .     Feeding Stuffs. The Food Controller has taken a further step in the direction ofcompleting the machinery for the rationing  of  cattle and other  animals by the issueof the Cattle Feeding Stuffs (Licensing)  Order following  on the  recent  issue by theDepartment of  the Maximum Prices Order, the  Committees  Order,  and the PriorityOrder, the latter giving priority to cows in milk.     The Port Committees recently set up under the Committees Order are five innumber, and to these Committees all those requiring licences as tirst-hand. sellers andwholesale dealers, i.e.,  importers, crushers, and sellers by wholesale, should at onceapply.   In each of these  cases  one licence will be sufficient to enable the licensee totrade in any part of Great Britain. -  &quot;The ^Provincial Committees  also set up  under  the  Committees  Order for thepurpose  of distribution of feeding  stuffs throughout the  country cover the wholeof Great Britain, and  to these Committees all distributing  dealers should apply  forlicences to deal.   It is not  necessary for millers to -apply individually for licences, asthe Flour Mills;Control Committee will put in the necessary application for all millersat  controlled mills, and the necessary licences will be forwarded by that Committee. -   Jam.-  -The Jam  (Prices)  Order, 1918,  dated 24 January 1918, embodies  freshschedules of prices as from 1st February.  The existing prices of jams and  jelliesremain as in the previous Order, but maximum prices have been fixed for marmalade.which was not previously included.  A new  schedule  is added giving the maximumprices to be charged for jam or  jelly sold without a container in  quantities Of lessthan 1 lb.     Meat.-The shortage of supplies is still serious,.but  the supplies of home-killedcattle and sheep coming into the markets is steadily though slowly increasing.  Inorder to keep up  supplies as far  as possible reliance is being placed more and moreon imported meat; the amount of imported. meat available for civilian  consumptionhas been increased by  arrivals from the United States ,of  America and by the releaseof considerable supplies held  by the Board of Trade for  the Army.  It is. necessaryfor the/present to  put all  imported meat  arriving from America on to the market atonce, do that it is not  yet possible to  begin  accummulating a reserve of stocks.Emergency measures  have been taken  to  satisfy to some extent the demands ofmining, munition and  industrial areas ; these measures are  temporary, and will ceasewhen compulsory meat rationing is enforced, which it is hoped will do aw ay with the-difficulty.&apos;  &apos;      v...-.:.:.-.:.                                          7p .     By a general licence under the.Live Stock (Restriction of Slaughter)  Order, 1917,the sale and supply of meat derived from male lambs bred from the Dorset Horn Eweis authorised until 1st  March 1918,     Miscellaneous ^ Food Stuffs. The attention of  the  Branch has been drawn toprofiteering in desiccated cocoanut, and  as Sir Henry Thompson reports that  the food
value of this  article is very high, a meeting of those interested in tire trade has  beencalled for Friday to consider a draft Order fixing maximum prices cx warehouse, andmaximum retail prices.                  -  ..,   .  .  . :   .X     &apos;-..V              -V    Oils and Fats. Every effort is. being made to increase the output of  margarine-Sufficient  machinery to  produce a further .300 tons a week has been completed, andthis will be further increased so as to  provide for an output of 400 tons a week in. theimmediate future.  Large margarine-making plants  are in course of erection and.willbe completed during the: next three months. . The  difficulty in the future will be. toget in enough raw material to keep manufacturers  working full-time.  There-isconsiderable  delay in the shipments of oleo oil from North America so  that oursupplies of raw material are reduced.                     ^    .    Endeavour is being made to prevent the use of material^ which might be madeedible, for purposes of manufacture.   When the use of linseed oil for the manufactureOf linoleum was stopped, it was decided  by the Cabinet that  the  stocks held  by themanufacturing companies was to be left  at their disposal, so  that  the actual closing-down of the works might be prevented.   Since this  decision was arrived at, a processhas been  discovered whereby linoleum  can  be  made out of  linseed oil  fatty  acid,that is to say, out of the  linseed  oil residue after about 10 per cent, of glycerinehas been extracted, and placed at the disposal of  the Ministry of Munitions.  Theinventor of this process has placed it at the disposal of the linoleum manufacturingindustry under guidance with the Board of Trade, and it would now be quite possiblete take over the linoleum manufacturer^ stocks of linseed oil and replace these witha corresponding quantity of fatty acids  without in any way injuring  the linoleummanufacturing industry ; it would, moreover, release about 6,000 tons of valuable foodproduct.                                             *                 .    The negotiations regarding the  purchase  of  Argentine linseed  are  still  insuspense, as the financial arrangements are not yet completed.    Potatoes. Arrangements have been  made for  the regular shipment  of potatoesfrom Ireland, in sufficient quantities  to cover  the total requirements of South Walesfrom February onwards.  If and when  the quantities available for shipment  fromIreland become sufficient  to provide  for the needs of other districts, correspondingarrangements will be made to  deal  with importations and distribution in  such  otherdistricts.    Sugar. A cargo of 7,500 tons of Java sugar was lost  during the week in theMediterranean through enemy submarines.    Attention is being given to the question of  providing sugar for jam making byprivate growers of fruit, which, however, presents very considerable difficulties.    Tea. This  Ministry has made arrangements  with Messrs. Matheson &amp;  Co., tobuy through that firm&apos;s  China house&apos;3,000,000 lbs.  of China  tea  on account of theFood Controller.  The tea  is to be bought c.i.f.  London, tonnage being arranged bythe seller.    A meeting has been held with the Sub-Committee  of the Tea Control Committeeon the subject of the proposed scheme for the distribution of National  Control Tea.The scheme found general approval,     Owing to delays in. arrival of  ships, a considerable quantity of tea  to  be soldunder the existing scheme is awaiting disposal, and it is not, therefore, possible toput National Control  Tea  on the  market immediately.  The machinery of the newscheme is  being prepared, and the required Orders and Regulations are being drafted.     Almost normal quantities of tea should be available in the near future, and it ishoped that the necessity for any general rationing will be avoided.                             LOCAL  ADMINISTRATION.    Labour Representation. The question of Labour Representation on Food ControlCommittees is assuming greater importance, and numerous representations are beingreceived from local labour organisations, no doubt influenced by the unrest prevailingowing to the shortage of food and the suspicion of unequal distribution.   The policyoutlined by Lord Rhondda of increasing the numbers of the committees  to allow of - amore adequate representation of labour is being followed.  Some of the Commis-sioners. have expressed the opinion that the additions  will materially strengthen theCommittees.            ,              t                        .  .   - . .:   Rationing Schemes. During January rationing schemes  have been inauguratedor the.machinery set in motion for  their inauguration in  all the principal industrial
centres.  Apart from the London and Home Counties Scheme the most far-reaching isthe Scottish arrangement, which will embrace the whole industrial area of Scotland, andextend into other parts  of that country as far as  practicable.   In the South MidlandDivision and  in  South Wales the London Scheme is being followed, and it is  hopedthat  it:may be introduced  in the former division  early in March.   The  only  largecentres outside  the movement last week were. Liverpool and Leeds, and both thesecities have now  submitted proposals that will extend to :the  neighbouring districts.In bott these,^c^HCs it is proposed, to include the  rationing of meat in the scheme.With the exception of  Southport and Brighton,  no seaside  health resort has yetsubmitted a scheme, but the greater part of  industrial England will,  it is anticipated,be under a rationing scheme for butter and margarine, and possibly for tea and meat,early in March.   -     From  the  provincial  reports  it is clear that the most serious complaints anddifficulties in regard to food stuffs relate to the shortage  of meat, though the positionis aggravated by shortages of other  articles, and may, it is apprehended, lead tostrikes and riots.     Sugar.-Yery few  complaints have been received  regarding  sugar,  and theworking of the ration card system would appear, therefore, to have given satisfaction.From the North-West  of England a report comes that there is considerable discontentbecause the soldiers employed in national industrial occupations, or on the  land, or inpay and record  offices, obtain a ration of. 14 ozs. a week as compared with the 8 ozs.allowed to civilians.     Potatoes-The Commissioner  for  the North-West of England reports  that a firmat Liverpool  has, led  the way in  establishing plant for  the production of &quot;potato-mash &quot; bread.  ,     The works have been in operation less than a week, and orders have already beenreceived  from  bakers for  the maximum  output,  which is  estimated  at  20  tonsper&apos; day,         ./v   ....     Enforcement. Returns of  prosecutions are now being  received regularly fromFood Control Committees.   In the week ending the 18th January there  were in all498 prosecutions in England and Wales, out  of which 464 resulted in  convictions.     Nearly half the cases, viz., 234, were in  the London  district:   .             62 prosecutions were in connection with  Meat.             52--::-       &apos;    .   ,,                   Milk..                     -             65      ,,          ,,         ,, &apos;        Flour  and Bread.             43      ,,          ,,         ,,         Butter.             39      ,,          ,,         ,,         Sugar.             28                  n         ,,   .      Jam.   -     There were  6 prosecutions for  hoarding, of which 3 only were successful.     The following cases may be noted :-          . At Lambeth Police Court E. Millborow was  fined 50L, or three months,       for selling meat at a price exceeding the maximum.           At Old Street, for a similar offence, a Jewish butcher was fined 50Z.   The       butcher attempted to  excuse himself on the ground that he was unde&apos;r the       impression that he could charge the prices of the Jewish Butchers&apos; Association.       The Magistrate described the case as one of gross profiteering.           At North London Police Court,  on January 18th, the Alliance Dairy Co.,       Ltd., were fined 40Z. and 10L 10s. costs for selling milk at  a  price exceeding       the maximum.  Their roundsman, who actually delivered the milk, was fined       201.   It was a first offence.           At &quot;Lambeth Police  Court, J.  H. Edwards  was  fined  351. for selling       margarine at a price above the  maximum.                              *           At Carnarvon, Mrs. Haigh was  fined  751. and costs for using bread to       feed 17 dogs.           At Manchester City Court,  on 18th January, James Dougherty was  fined       20Z. and  51. costs  for selling butter  above ,the maximum price,  and for       neglecting to exhibit a price list.              *v        ....           At, Congleton County Police Court, on  9th, January, Joe Cross, /farmer,       was fined 15l for neglecting to  thatch a stack  of wheat gathered in September       1916, and so exposing it  to  bad weather that it was rendered  unfit  for human      food.:  Evidence Was given that had the stack been properly attended to it      would  have produced. 15 bags of sound grain-equal to 2,250 2-lb. loaves.  .   .)
      At Warrington- Police Court, on January 16th, the Burtonwood Brewery1 Co., Ltd.j were fined 2001. and 101. 10s. costs for brewing 155 barrels of beer;&apos; in excess of the maximum.     -   &quot;    -      At Aberga venny, on 23rd January, Messrs. Facey &amp; Son were fined 1001. and101. 10s. costs for a similar offence.      At Peterhead, on 11th January, Robert Boggie, grocer, was  fined. 10L for selling  damson jam at  a price above the inaximum.  The defendant was, a I member of  the  Local Food. Control  Committee  and had  four shops in Peterhead.      At Halstead,  on 22nd January, Alfred Bloomfield, J.P., was fined 251. and 51. costs for feeding pigs with barley.             PART  II.-SUMMARY  OF THE  FOOD POSITION.    The continuance of low imports  in  cereals calls for careful consideration.  Theposition is rendered  more acute by  the present meat  shortage, arising  from  adeficiency alike in home supplies and imports, which  tends  to  increase the  demandfor bread.  Consequently it is a matter  of  grave moment that the use of cereals&apos; forany other purpose than human consumption  should be watched and that any wastein consumption should be prevented.  Against the moderately good stocks of  wheatand  other  cereals held  at  the present moment must  be placed  the  rapid rate ofdepletion of stock during  the  past weeks and the heavy engagements of tonnage inother directions.                                   IMPORTS.    The aggregate weight of imports  of principal foods was 96,700 tons last week,an increase of 26,700 tons over the week before (Table A).   In the corresponding-week last year the aggregate was over 239,000 tons.    The increase over last week is mainly attributable to the arrival  of. 31,600 tonsof sugar, as compared with 10,400 tons the previous week.    Wheat and flour are at the same very low level as the previous week.  Of othercereals a decrease of maize is balanced by an  increase  of barley and oats.    Meat fell from 4,800 to 1,700 tons,&apos;and  bacon and hams  from 4,500 to 2,000tons.    The imports of tea were 7,275 tons, the largest amount  in  any week  for severalmonths.                                CONSUMPTION.    Meat. The supplies of home-fed meat entering the Central Market, London, andManchester, Glasgow, and Liverpool markets  was, in the week  ended January 19th,8 per cent, below the previous week, and only equalled 64 per cent, of  the supply inthe corresponding week last year (Table B).  There was a further fall of 21 per cent.at the Central Market in the week ended January 26th.     The supplies  of fat cattle at 59 markets in  Great  Britain were better in the weekJanuary 17th-23rd than in any other week since Christmas, but  were still only 38 percent, of last years supplies (Table C).  While there were 790 more head of cattle thanthe week before, the number of sheep fell 25,200 and  the  supply-was the lowest asyet recorded.     There was some improvement in the supply of pigs.     Twenty-four per cent, less foreign meat was sold at the four markets (Table B) inthe week ended January 19th  than in  the  previous week. There was some improve-meht at the Central Market in the week ended January 26th.     Provisions.
