I THIS nOCOMEKT IS THE PR0P3BTY Off HIS ERITAIfiHC KAJBSTY&apos;S SOVBHifiCffiT.)   WAR CABINET.ELECTRICAL WORKERS.Memorandum &quot;by Sir A. Hond. .        In reference to the Memorandum of the 7th. inst.submitted by the Home Secretary, on the question of a possiblestrike of Electrical Trade Union Workers, (G,T.3%4) thisquestion affects a large number of employees.in.-my Department,who may become involved in a strike owing to the disputebetween the Electrical Companies and the Unions.   I think,therefore, it only right to give my views on the position.The Office of Works employe about four hundred electricians ofvarious grades.   It is impossible to state how many of theseare members of the Union,  but probably a large majority aremembers.   The Office of Works has no means of knowing theexact number, and, cf course, makes a practice of not enquiringof employees whether they are members of Unions, Or not.   Itie obviously of the greatest importance to keep the electricalservices going in case of a strike, an occurrence, which, Iunderstand is at present somewhat problematical.   I aminformed that there.is no immediate possibility of a strikeoccurring owing to the demand that all the personnel shouldjoin Unions.        The substitution of the men who strike by men of theNaval and Military Forces oould obviously be justified incase of necessity, but this must be avoided if it possiblycan be, as it might raise a much wider field of labouragitation in the country than the relative local issue indispute between the Companies and the men.        I understand some of the largest Generating Stationsin the hands of the Municipal authorities were apparently hotrepresented at tho Conference of which Sir Edward Henryreports.   I think it would be advisable to ascertain fromthem direct whether or not they support the view of theCompanies regarding certain grades joining the ElectricalTrade Union.        I suppose in case a strike should occur that thisOffice can rely on some assistance regarding electricalstokers, etc., from the Admiralty and Army Council, tocarry on in Government Offices, in the same way as it ieproposed to be gi\3n to the Companies referred to in theMemorandum.
