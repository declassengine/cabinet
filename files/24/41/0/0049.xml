CIRCULATED TO THE KING AND WAR CABINET.-      I circulate to the Cabinet a short statement explaining an arrangement which has been come to between the foreign Office and the Department of Information,.      Tile  &quot;Intelligence Branch&quot; of the Department of Information has hot been concerned in any way with propaganda;  its function has been simply to compile, principally from the Foreign Office telegrams and despatches, periodical  summaries Of the political situation in the more important countries..  Both Departments are agreed that this should more properly be performed by the Foreign Office.  The change was fully approved Isy Sir E, Cars on,  who, I understand,, had intended to ask the formal sanction of the&quot; War Cabinet, with whose approval  the Propaganda Branch ofthe Department  of Information,&apos; who are now-preparingto leave the Foreign Office,  were originally installed in it,  -      In view of the previous  ruling of the Cabinet,the suggested transfer ought  to receive their formalconcurrenceoA.J.3,FOHLIGN OFFICE,     5th February 1918 ;Colonel,
                                                           1 I                                                           i                                                           i&apos;      Colonel Buchan suggested in November last that  .the  Intelligence Division of the Department of Informa-tlon should be taken over by the Foreign Office ontho  ground that it performed a function which reallybelonged  to this Office,, and that such a transfer         jwould secure-a more cordial cooperation with theIntelligence Departments under the Admiralty andWar  Office,      Lord Hardinge quite agreed in the view that thework  which had hitherto been done by tho Bureau ofInformation really appertained to the Foreign Office,and  it would have been performed there if the necessarystaff had been available for the purpose  He alsothought that the- persons who would bo most competent,by their training and knowledge,  to superintend thecollection and appreciation of information.were thosewhose daily task it was to deal with foreign affairs *He also was of opinion that,  in order to secure thegreatest efficiency in the output of work,  the bestplan would be for the Fore fen Office entirely toabsorb tho Intelligence Division by turning  it Intoa branch of the Foreign Office.   This arrangementwould also secure a considerable  reduction of thepresent staff, with resultant  economy,  whilst itwould at the same time ensure greater coordinationthan at present exists by preventing overlapping.   Inorder to give effect ,to these views it  was decided  thatthe new Department should be  housed in the Fore fenOff ice 0                                       Both
     Both Sir Edward Carson and Mi%. BalfouT entirely concurred in the proposed transfer.     As it would have been impossible for the Foreign&apos;Office, owing to lack of space,  to take over the Intelligence Branch,  which has hitherto been quartered in Victoria Street,  so long as it continued to housethe foreign&apos; Propaganda Branch,  arrangements have beenmade for the latter&apos;s accommodation b^ securing otherpremises,  in which Sir K.Carson is understood to havewished to concentrate also other outlying Branches ofthe Department of Information.   The transfer isexpected to take place within the next fortnight.     It is hcped that the new scheme will secure thatall political material which is  collected by the-various Intelligence  Departments shall be placed atthe disposal of the Political Intelligence Divisionof the Foreign Office.,  and that  the unavoidable over-lapping which has hitherto prevailed will be reducedto a minimum *
