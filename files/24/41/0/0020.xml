With r of a rone G tb War- Cabinet  337, Minute  (2)on the subject of the strike of Sheet Metalworkers whichwas considered by the Cabinet on the lot. Pobruary,  andsubsequently referred to me for examination, I attach adraft instruction to Departments, which should,  I think,be issued without delay, under the authority of  the  Cabinet,                                GT- Ne BARNES,2, Whitehall Gardens,44rh Pebruary 1913.
7DRAFT IflSTRUGTIOI TO DEPARTirjSTTS       REGARDING WAGES.        * * * * * * * Attention lias recently &quot;been directed to the practice among the Departments of competing against one another for Labour and of th evil results which arise thereftom.    In illustra- tion of this, a letter may be quoted written on the  19th December by a Department  to a firm which was under contract to it. The essential portions of the letter are as follows:-  &quot;Purther to your letter  of the  13th. December,  something   must  be done immediately to increase  the  output of the  (Government) work from your works.   As we have before suggested, sufficient financial  induce-   ments must be offered to  your  men to  enable you to  retain   those you have and to obtain others to the  necessary number.  &apos;Your  statement that, you cannot fix dates  for deliveries   is a  position which (this Department)  cannot tolerate.   Unless something can be done at  once  to remedy the  condit-   ions  which moved you to make that  statement, it may be nec-   essary for the (Department)  to take over  the management  of   your  works under the Defence of  the Realm Act,&quot; This letter was transmitted to the Ministry of Labour by the firm to which it was addressed and advice asked  upon it, This is only one of many  instances that  have  come to the knowledge of the Government during the  last  few  months. There have been many cases  of Departments enticing Labour away from one place to go to  others  and paying as much as  2d. per hour more for such labour -  the  result  of course being a  demand for increased wages  in  all  the  area  adjacent- a demand  that has in most cases been conceded.   But no sooner is  the  new rate established,  than  attempts  are made to start a  cycle. This is all absolutely contrary  to the  principles  agreed upon in  1915,  namely that wage rates  should  remain as  they were,-exceptthat in any area where  a shop  or  firm was  paying less than themwagesiin that area,  it  was  to  be brought  up to  the rate current, Increase of, wages  has  been  regulated on  the whole  throughout the country in  other than munitions  work  by that  agreement Bonuses have been paid on the basis  of  increased  cost of living. Some munition tradesmen have  now,  however,  in  consequence  of the fact to which allusion  has already been made,  been re- ceiving increases  in wages  and bonuses approximating, if not actually equivalent  to  100^ The practice still  goes on, and  as it has been found by leaders of  workmen to be  so  fruitful, it is being pursued with more                                             vigour/
 It  is therefore necessary to point out to Departments that this is altogether against the national interest. Certain Departments may also ba reminded of the provisions of  the Munitions of War Acts, which give them power to standardise wages and to prosacuto employers for unduly increasing them. The Cabinet desire all &quot;the Departments to have due -&quot;-regard to  their powers and to the larger interest of the nation; and in particular they feel that they must impress upon thorn that such letters as that quoted above must not be sent out in  future. Strict attantion must be directed to keeping employers working for tha Department, within the limits of wage adjust-ments already sanctioned.Tha Cabinet also desire to remind Departments of Minuta 317undar which the Ministry of Labour was given power to dealwith all applications for increases in war advances andDepartments were directed to refer any such applications tcthe Ministry of Labour,THIS MIxTUTE MUST 32 RIGIDLY ADHERED TO IS THE FUTURE,2 Whitehall Gdns.             S.W.1
