Despatched 9.15 p.m. 6th February 1918.       Received   8. 0. .a,m, 8th February 1918.     Following from Lockhert.     &quot;I have had long conversation with Petroff and  ChichirinInspecting -formers proposed visit to England.   They have  agreedlot to press question until I have communicated with  you.     Petroff is not at all a dangerous influence  from our  pointif vie?/ and it should be realised that both he  and Chichirin arefar more ^nglo-phil than majority of Bolshoviks.   They are  bothfenuine and sincere and should be regarded as possible asset.     Petroff states thst his detention in England was.due  mainlyto old REGIME In Russia and to.enti-Russian propaganda rather than o peace propaganda.   Object of his visit which will only  last hreo weeks is to explain not only to Labour party but to all arties and especially to those members of His  Majesty&apos;8  Govern- ont who consent to see him position of Bolsheviks and their action n Russia.   His mission will be confined to explanation  of ussian affairs and we need have no fear of his attempting  to nclte our workmen to strike (?and) he will naturally observe the awa of our country.     In spite of difficulties which must confront His.-Majestyfs lovernmont in granting visa to a man who has previously been -etained in Sngland I beg most earnestly to recommend that  Petroffs Isa should be granted without delay.     If, as I fervently hope,  we recognise Bolshevik Government, efussl of Petroffs visa will create most painful impressionpre.   Vie cannot expect Bolshevik to give up their attacks on jspituliats and extreme militarists as reward for recognition. in fact, as Trotzky has told Colonel iiobbins privately, such an ttitude would ruin their whole case In the eyes of German people. Us is proved by recent  tterapts of German official press to srsuade German Socialists that Bolsheviks are paid agents of gland.     If we recognise Bolsheviks it would be impossible to tfuse their emissaries admittance.  I am satisfied that at resent Bolsheviks have no intention of sending army of ropagandists to England and a conciliatory attitude towards stroffs visit would greatly strengthen our position with fgard to &apos;dny subsequent refusal of further emissaries.  I pubt if it is possible to persuade Boisheviks to send sorae- ie else instead of Pstroff and in any case this would be most desirable as of (? all his Russian Colleagues), here he is the   man who above all things would be the most suitable.   Our &quot;use in this country .is badly in need of a &quot;Beau Seste&quot; on the *rt of His ME testy1s Government.  This could best be done by [cognising Bolshevik Government giving them some promise   -&apos;e will)&apos; receive Petroff graciously, letting him see Prime
 Minister and so arranging his  visit  in co-operation with Mr,  Henderson as to  mice  any unpleasantness practically impossible.       My position here  is growing stronger  every day but i  it is to produce any real  result  our (?whole)  attitude towards* Russia must  undergo  radical change and it  is  high timo that people at home should rid themselves of the idea that Bolshevik movement in  Hussia and  labour  troubles in Austria and Germany had  been staged by German Government for express benefit of British Labour party.  Chichirin told me that in his opinion the &quot;Times&quot; wes  best pro-German propaganda in Hussia at present moment in Russia.       In my  opinion  Russia is  even at this  moment more powerful Ally to us that she  has yet been owing to  influence Bolsheviks are  exercising in Germany.   She  is probably the enemy Gerrasny fears most.     If we recognise Bolskeviks we  can help them to make Russia  more redoubtable still.       Policy of understanding  with Bolsheviks is last card we have to play in Russia.   Even if  it should fail as a policy it can in no  way make our position worse than it will soon be at present rate of progress.   If properly handled it may  yield far reaching  results.       There  is however  no time to lose and  I  venture to plead most earnestly that  immediate  consideration be  given to policy I advocate.
