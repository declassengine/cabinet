                                   Intelligence Bureau,   SECRET                          Department OF Information.          WEEKLY REPORT ON GERMANY  XXXVIII.                    (PEB.6, 1918)     It would be misleading to regard!the German strikes of thepast week in precisely the same light as the Austrian ones OF afortnight before or to draw the conclusion that they must exeroisean immediate effect upon the war and peaoe policy of the GermanGovernment or the military leaders.   On the other hand the strikesdomand special attention in regard to their origin, their realsignificance and the more important movements OF which they maybe the beginning.     The Vienna strikes were the direct outcome of the situationat Brest-Litovsk and the unfavourable prospeots OF peace withRussia In consequence of the German annexationist policy and theattitude and utterances of the Gorman military representativeGeneral von Hoffmann.   With this situation coincided the reductionin the bread ration.   The cry of the strikers when they marchedthrough Vienna was &quot;Give us bread and peace5&apos;.   Count Czernin wascompelled to take account of the attitude of the masses in hisdeclaration of policy and he even announced that he would notallow himself to be influenced by the agitation of the Pan-Germans.The people who took part in the street demonstrations, he had doubt-less noticed had been so incensed against Germany that&apos; they utteredcries against the German Emperor.     The Berlin Government was evidently gravely concerned at whathad taken place in Vienna.   They - or tho military authorities -took the extreme step of trying to prevent the publication of theaccounts of these events which were sent BY the Vienna Correspond-ents of the Frankfurter Zeitunfo the Berliner Tageolatt and the
                              ** 2 **Vorwaerts.    But this policy could not be maintained for more thana couple of days.   When the papers were allowed to publish theirVienna despatches - which,  by the way, were admirably written -these despatches were universally read with an eagerness due in partto the attempt which had been made to suppress them.     Count  Czerninfs declarations on peace-terms, so markedly moreconciliatory than those of  Count Hertling, could not fail to beattributed  to the influence of the popular demonstrations in Vienna.Count Hertlingfs speech, on the other hand, was received by theSooialist and by part of the Radical Press in a way that showed howlittle confidence he had succeeded in inspiring.   The working-olasseswere confronted with the prospect of the indefinite prolongation ofthe war for objects of which they do not approve.   Even the promiseof fresh victories had no longer any attractions.     Speaking in the Main Committee of the Reichstag on SaturdayJanuary 26  Dr Naumann, author of&quot;Mittel-EuropaJ who as a ChristianSocialist Is in close touch with a considerable section of theworking-classes, explained the disastrous effects of the agitationfor territorial oonquests and the consequent prolongation of the warupon working-olass opinion.   He mentioned that  &quot;Handbills had just been distributed calling for the overthrow of  the Government, the destruction of the bourgeoisie, revolution and  the establishment of a republic.   The handbills rejected the  idea of a separate peace  (with Russia) and recommended wholesale  strikes in the course of  the next few days, particularly in the  munition works and among the transport workers.1&apos;     The Imperial Secretary of State for the Interior, Herr V/allraf,subsequently referred to Naumann fs statement and said that he hadobtained a copy of this handbill.     v/e now know that handbills of this character were widelydistributed not only in Berlin but also in other industrial centres,at Bochum in tho v/estphalian,country for example.   Whence did thehandbills come ?   According to one statement an anonymous Bolshevik
leaflet entitled &quot;Declaration of the foreign representatives of theBolsneviks ta the International&quot; was found in one of the Berlinfactories.   It recalled the viotory of the soldiers1 and workmens&apos;revolution over tho Petrograd Government last November 7, pointedout that the&quot; defeat of the Russian revolution would mean the defeatof the German revolutionary movement and invited the German proletariatto strike for peace without annexations or indemnities.     Beyond this little has been said about direct Bolshevikinfluence.   On the other hand we have a oategorioal statementmade by the Berlin Correspondent of a South Gorman journal whiohis not open to a reactionary inspiration, the Munich NeuesteNaohrichten, to the following effect:-  &quot;The Independent Socialists. (Haase, Berate in and Dlttmann^  Party) in Greater Berlin and the extreme Socialist Section  (Liebkneeht&apos;B seotion) which is akin to them are planning for  today, Monday January 28, a demonstration in the form of a strike  for which they have been agitating by means of leaflets and  handbills during the last few weeks.   Referenoe was made to theco  leaflets in the Reichstag on Saturday&quot;,   (Naumann and Wallraf).     It does not appear that the Majority Socialists, led byScheidemann, had taken any active part in the preparations for thestrikes.   But they must have known that such preparations were in handand how receptive the mind of the masses would be for the agitation.In the Reichstag Main Committee on January 24, the day of Hertlingfsbig speech, Schoidemann spoke of the breakdown of the Brest-Litovsknegotiations in consequence of the German attitude on December 27as a &quot;diplomatic catastrophe&apos;1 and added  &quot;If you cannot make peace with Russia, then go, before you are  swept away.   Stop this policy of ambiguity and concealment!  /aid referring to General Hoffmann&apos;s outburst at Brest-Litovskabout Germany^ military might:  &quot;In our own country militarism (&quot;die militarisohe Horrsohaft)  has the effect of exasperating all political differences to an  extreme point.,.,. Bear in mind that the feeling among the masses  is very serious... Y;e Social Democrats (of the Majority) will do  all we can for our nation and our country.   But we do not dream  of risking our skins for a Government cf which we may have to con  -elude that it is not doing its duty by the people.&quot;
2.   The strike broke out on Monday January 28.   The Germanofficial accounts stated that not more ihan 90,000 persons leftwork in Berlin , but the leading Socialist paper (Vorwaerts) wasprobably nearer the truth when it spoke1 of 500, 000.   Among theBerlin firms&quot; In whose works strikes took place were Ludwig Loewe(the small-arms factory), Borsig (the great locomotive engineers)and Daimler1s automobile works.   The Allgemeine ElektricitatsWerke, the largest electrical works In Europe, were also affected.In a good many works no strikes took place.   V/e have no informationas to the attitude of the munition-makers at Spandau, but there isinferential evidence that some of those engaged on munitionsstruok whether in Spandau or elsewhere.   The strike speedilyspread over many parts of industrial Germany affecting placesas far distant from one another as Kiel and Munich, Mannheim andNuremberg .   Two of the most important works affected were theVulkan Shipbuilding Yards at Hamburg and Kruppfs Germania Yardsat Kiel, both engaged in wo k for the Navy.   At Kiel, where thestrike became general, and at Hamburg, martial law was proclaimedat an early stage.   In &quot;both places food difficulties appear tohave played a part in the strike.   At Kiel the bakers shops wereplaced under police protection.   At Leipzig the extent of thestrike is said to have been small, at Cassel it was larger.     Information as to the places which were affected by the strikeand the number of people who t*ok part in it is incomplete and,owing doubtless to the interference of the German censorship,conflicting or misleading.   We do not yet know, for example, towhat extent Bremen was affected, but it is reported that martiallaw was proclaimed there.   There also appear to have been partialstrikes at Breslau, Magdeburg and Dusseldorf.   Most of Saxonyremained quiet, and work was not interrupted.   At Essen therewere only 200 strikers, according to other accounts 400.   Krup$aworkmen are better fed than most of the others.                                  i           ft
5.   Regarding the behaviour of the strikers Information is like-wise imperfect.   There appear to have been no serious demonstrationsin Berlin at first, and tho city wore its wonted appearance.   Suchdisturbances as subsequently took place began in the quarter,  Moabit,where the most turbulent elements among the working-olasses andalso many of the criminal classes live.   In peace-time there  haveonce and again been collisions between riotous crowds and thepolice In Moabit and sometimes bloodshed.   The police are allarmed with sabres and revolvers.   They first use the flat of thesabre, and then, if the rioters become more menacing,, they hack andhew.   The revolvers are only used when individuals in the crowdbegin to discharge firearms.   In peace-time it was usuallyunnecessary to call in the aid of the military.   When it wasinvoked, it was mainly for the purpose of impressing enormous  thoughpeaceable crowds, such as took part in the Prussian Franchisedemonstrations in 1907,   In these casea cavalry is always employed.     There Is so far no reason to doubt the official accounts  whichrepresent the disturbers of the peace as mostly youths, perhapswhat is called in Berlin the&quot;Jahnhagel&quot; l,e, hooligans.  Stories ofbarricades were current.   What seems to have happened was thatsome tramway-cars were stopped and derailed or &quot;overturned.&quot;, and thanthe mob esoonsed Itself bohind them and pelted the police withmissiles.   Moabit Is in the North West of Berlin,   In the Northand also in the East similar disturbances took place, youths andtheir girl friends participating.   These disturbances apparentlytook place on Thursday  an9 31st, the fourth day of the strike, andwere resumed on the following day.   About 160 arrests in all weremade.   A sergeant of police was shot dead in Charlottenburg andanother wounded.   Some 30 or 40 persons were treated at the hospitaldressing-stations for sabre wounds.   The statement in some of the
                             m : 6Berlin papers that &quot;all parts of greater Berlin with the exceptionof Unter don Linden and the Sohlossplaa (Castle Square)  wereinvolved in the disturbances&quot; Is probably an exaggeration.    Berlincovers a vast area and there must have been miles of streets inthe West end where net a single striker was visible.   Some bandsof people bent upon demonstrations may have penetrated to the innerparts of the city near Unter den Linden, but they  would easily bedispersed.   Thero are no reports of oonflicta in these quartersof the town.4C   The attitude of the natural leaders of the working-classes -the Trades Union office-bearers1 and the Socialist members ofParliament - towards the strikes Is now on the whole clear.   Thereare three main types of Trade Unions, (1) the Geworksohaften,highly organized representatives of the different Trades, resemblingour own Trade - Unions j  (2) the Hirsoh-IXinbkcrsche Gewerkvereine ,Societies named after their founders, associated in their originwith the Radical Party (Progressives), and interested in variousspheres of working-class activity, particularly industrial anddistributive co-operation,  (5) the Christian Gewerkvereine,Protestant and Catholic Workmen3r Associations.   The last twoclasses of Sooieties end also (according to semi-official state-ments)the Polish organizations condemned the strikes.   TheSocialist Gewerks chart en remained neutral.   Some weeks ago theyhad already discussed the movement In the direction of a strikeand had come to the conclusion &quot;that it has arisen out of politicalcausos and that it was therefore a political not a Trades Unionaffair.   This has always been the attitude of the SocialistGewerkschaften towards purely political movements among the working-classes.   Thus, in Bebel&apos;s time, these Societies, although doubtlessSocialist to a man, refused to countenance the movement for a
mgeneral strike Intended to  apply  pressure to the Government onpolitical questions,  such as the  prevention of war.   On thepresent occasion the  Gewerksohaften are nevertheless described asbeing unanimous in the opinion that tho political discontent isintelligible and that the best way to deal with it is to meet thewishes of the working-classes.     The attitude of  the Catholic Societies would account for the factthat the strike did not.attain any considerable dimensions inCatholio Westphalia or the  Rhineland,   There were neverthelesssporadic outbreaks at Bielefeld&apos;.  Bechum, and Cologne.     The Socialist Members  of Parliament of both sections have latelybeen warning the Government regarding the imminence of Labourmanifestations,   Soneidemannts speech in the Main Committee of theRelohstag on January  24 has already been quoted,   Herr Hofer,Minority Socialist, spoke still more strongly on Thursday January 22,He said:     &quot;Labour is indignant at the  mismanagement of its affairs.  Yovu (on the Right)  ha.ve no idea how the masses are seething with  discontent.   It. is you who are paving the road for a revolution.  The German workmen  look at Austria, and they are now ready.&quot;     V/hen the strike  broke  cut both the Majority and the Minority(Independent ) Socialists took steps to put themselves in touch withthe leaders of the movement in Berlin.   The Deputies of the Majorityheaded by Scheidemann, did  this because they wished to guide thestrike into peaceful  channels and to obviate any pretext forviolent intervention  bvj the authorities civil or military.The Independent Socialists, headed by Haase, acted beoause theywere in full sympathy with the strike.   The attitude of theIndependents finally  (as usual) determined the behaviour of the
Majority,  particularly as it was manifested in tho Majoritynewspape r organ,  the yj^waerts, which more and  more,  until it wassuppressed, manifested its sympathy and was finally accused by theauthorities of inciting the workmen to strike en masse,     A Strike Committee was formed consisting of strike  leadersand three  leading members of each of the two parliamentary sectionsof the Socialists.   It included both Sell eidemann and HaaseThis Committee endeavoured to obtain an interview with the ImperialSecretary of State for the Interior, Herr von Wallraf, who deolinedto see them as a body and intimated that he could have no communicationwith the spokesmen of the strikers.   Subsequently tho Socialistdeputies of both eclours were received by the Chancellor, (onSaturday February 2,) the Vioo-Chanoollor (Herr  von Payer) theImperial Secretary of State for tho Interior (Herr von Wallraf) andthe Prussian Minister of the Interior, Herr Drews.   Tho Chancellorrefused either to receive workmen who were strike-leaders or toallow groups of strikers to aeet privately and deliberate on thesituation.   His reason was that they might resolve on unlawfulactions.   He could not entertain the idea of such a meeting, untilthere was a guarantee that it would have for its object  the end ofthe strike, and until It was agreed that a L general politicaldesires of the strikers 3hould reach the Government through theconstitutional Channel, i,e. through the parliamentary repreaent-atives of the people.     The conferences with the Chancellor were to bo resumed lastSunday, but the Minority Socialist deputies have resolved no longerto participate in them in oonsequence of the refusal of  theirdemand that representatives of the strikers should be reooived.This action of the Minority will increase their  influence with thomasses, and is already determining the attitude  of the MajoritySocialists, who cannot afford to lag behind.
     Both the Majority and the Minority leaders went down amongthe strikers in the street ostensibly with the object of guidingthem into peaoeable paths.   Soheidemann narrowly escaped arrest inMoabit and was told by the police  to no home.     Dittmann (Minority)  was arrested when addressing a meeting atTreptow, a south-eastern  suburb.  His trial took place on MondayFebruary 4th, before a Oourt Martial, a State c$ Siege having beenproclaimed by the Chief Commander  in Brandenburg (General ven ICossel)on the previous day.   Dittmann  was  sentenced to five yearsconfinement in a fortress for &quot;attempted high treason&quot; and trans-gression of the provisions of the  State of Siege Law and to twomonths imprisonment for &quot;resistance  ts public authority&quot;.     Dittmann denied that he had promoted the strike, which wasreally a demonstration against an&quot;annexation peace&quot;  and for apeace by understanding and had been  directly provoked by themaintenance of the state  of siege  and by the machinations of theFatherland Party and the  Pan-Germans, especially Tirpitz.(Dittmann it will be remembered, was the Independent SocialistDeputy who was denounced  by the  late Chancellor Michaelis in thedebate last October on the Naval Mutiny).   The appearance ofScheidemann as a witness  was noteworthy and shows how events areCompelling the Majority Socialists to identify themselves more andmore with the attitude of the Minority.   Scheidemann said that the ccauses of the strike were to be  found in the discontent of theworkers owing to insufficient food,  the abolition of public meetingsthe Impossibility of publishing  their complaints on account of thecensorship, and their anxiety lest the war should continueindefinitely if the Government did,not accept the most unequivocalX This gentleman was described by one of his own officers to theBritish Military Attache  several years ago as &quot;Falsoh wio die Naoht&quot;(false as the night) .
Attitude towards peace negotiations!5.    It would &quot;be premature  to attempt a final verdiot upon the nowsituation which the  strikes, the measures of tho military authoities and the attitude  of the (tovememnt have created.   But *^his muchwould seem to emergesI,    Hertling!s age, his string instincts for law  and orders and     his want of training in practical statesmanship have led him     to expose the loyalty  of the Majority  Socialists to too severea test.   Ho has driven them into opposition.II.   Their situation is altogether to the  mind of the Fatherland      Party, the Conservatives, the Prussian Junkrrs, the Pan-Germans,the militarists and  the extreme annexation!sts  of  all political  colours,      They hope that Germany will now be governed  as before the  war      without the  support of the Socialists and that the Conservative      Right, the Centre and the National Liborala  will secure a      policy of repression  at home and of annexation abroad.III.  As regards the Internal situation , everything will now      depend upon  what happens in Austria,  upon the suooess of the .      Armies on the  Western, inoluding the  Italian, front and upon      the issue of the negotiations with the Bolsheviks and the      Ukraine.  Tho Gorman strikes are said to he ending everywhere      They were probably never intended to  be prolonged but rather      to serve as  a  kind of preliminary warning.     It ought to be  added that the action of the Conservative,Catholic and National Liberal majority in tho Prussian Chamber withregard to the Franchise Bill has excited the greatest bitternessamong the Prussian working-classes.   The determination of thoreactionary Prussian Majority to take the Bill  for the reocmstruotionof the Upper House first and thus to postpone the  Franchise Billfor months is regarded as a meokery of the  working-classes1 demands
     As the Prussian Franchise is  really now as ever a Germanquestion in its wider political-bearings, the obstruction of thePrussian reactionaries is exciting resentment in other German -States,In tho Baden and in the Bavarian Chambers there have been outbreaksof indignation against the high-handed methods of Prussia, and aBavarian Socialist Deputy predicted strikes over the whole countryif these methods were persisted in.   What Germany most urgentlyneeded, he said was peace and food.   Germany had already lost1,5000,000 dead in the war and there was an equal number of menwho were wholly or partially incapacitated for work.   In theBaden Chamber Clericals and Liberals Joined in the protests againstthe method of recruiting Prussian regiments with men from Baden.     There is no reason to doubt the sincerity of the MajoritySocialists when they say that  their great object is to secure asafety-valve for popular discontent and to guide strikes anddemonstrations into the path ef peaceful political endeavour.The establishment of martial law,  the militarise of industrialproduction and the frequent suppression *f newspapers make themethod of helpful criticism impossible.   Domestic dissensiensare bound to become far more acutca. it remains to be seen whatwill be their influence upon the men at the fr*nt.   The Springoampalgn will doubtless furnish evidence *n this point.
