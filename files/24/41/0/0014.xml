The total     number of acres ploughed is nowi-          Richmond Park - 70  ploughed 20 sown with wheat.          Bushy Park    - 73  ploughed 27 sown   &quot;     &quot;               All ploughing  should be completed in good     time for sowing the Spring  crops.   The seed oats and     potatoes are on order from the Board of Agriculture^     Food Productions Committee,  and the other seeds from     Gartons.               The oatstack at Richmond Park has been     threshed and yielded 79  Quarters of oats.  This is a     little over one Quarter  per acre - 75 acres being the     total area ploughed.   It is 9 Quarters in excess of     the estimated yield (70  Quarters)  as reported on the     17th December last.                           (Sd.)  Lionel  Earle.19.
