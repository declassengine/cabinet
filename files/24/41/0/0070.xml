Expedition known as  Scheme. &quot;S&quot;.313IS          The  situation as regards tho Military Force whichwouJjd be  required  for this Expedition is that a Brigs.de isin being  fully  equipped  and up to strength.  Its trainingwill not  have been completed until the  end.of March, butshould  the War  Cabinet&quot;decide that the  Expedition is to sailthe Military  Force can he ready at 96 hours1 notice.          Tho  Haval Forces and transports which would berequired  for  tho Expedition are allocated  for the purposeand. although now  employed on other duties,  could be madeavailable  and  ready to leave at 96 hours1 notice.       -   The  squadron could, therefore, be at sea, with thefirst convoy  follovdng after a short interval, in 96 hours $from the  time that the warning telegrams are despatchedfrom the  War  Office and  tho Admiralty.                    ,                                                         *          It must be recognised, however, that so far as theNavy is concerned, this  Expedition could only be carriedout at  tho price of very great strain and  Inconvenienceboth to the Naval  Forces and the Transport Service.  Wehave now  arrived at a Stage where there is no surplus ofNaval Officers,-and any  further expeditionary forae involvesa diminution  of Officers at present under  training invarious specialising courses and also of Officers carryingout transport work. The transports that would berequired  are  now engaged chiefly in the transport of storesto France.          The  military force oar-marked  for(the expeditionis part o  tho  Home Defence troops and  is  available forHome Defence  if not required for the expedition.^It is rotpossible  to ha-ve tho force ready within the  time/which It maybe required to  embark, if only a nucleus is  kept in readiness.          As far as the Navy is concerned only a smallpermanent nucleus-  force  is detailed for the  purpose ofthis Expedition.   Tho other Officers and men required aredetailed  from amongst those who are undergoing courses ofinstruction,  etc., and therefore are often changing.(signed)    W. R.  ROBERTSON.(signed)    R.  E.
