SFCRFT.K.S.R. 26.              COMPLAINTS OP HARDSHIP INCURRED &quot;WHILST             AWAITING KRDICAL EXAMINATION FOR THE ARHV.           Memorandum by the Minister of National Service,     On the 3rd January la3t Mr. Barnes circulated as aCabinet Paper (G.T.3125) an anonymous complaint of hardshipcaused to a recruit v/hlle awaiting and undergoing medicalexamination by the Brighton National Service Medical Board.On receipt of this Memorandum I immediately instructed SirJames Galloway, the Chief Commissioner of Medical Services, toobtain a full report.  This has now been done; and the reportI think completely disposes of every count in the complaint.As the complaint has been circulated as a Cabinet Paper, Ithink that the report should receive a similar publicity.                                   A. C GISDKES.4. 2. 18.
REPORT BY SIR JAM1VS GALLOWAY, K.B.E., C.B.     Upon receipt of Hr. Barnes&apos; Memorandum (G.T.3125) and yourInstructions I at oncie wrote to the Commissioner of the SouthEastern Region requesting him to investigate the particular casestated to have occurred at Brighton; and In order to be able t* giveassurance that the printed, instructions were being carefullyobserved by all Chairmen of Medical Boards, I sent to the Commission-ers of all Regions the following telegram: -        3-1-1918.  Complaints of hardship whilst awaiting medical    examination have been communicated to National Service    Ministry from authoritative source.  The provisions of N.S.I.    3/17 Duties of D.CM.S. para 5. are evidently not being suf-    ficiently carefully observed.  The organisation of the    arrangements for preparing men for examination by all your    Medical Boards must be immediately overhauled and steps taken    to provide that no man is required to strip so long before his    examination as to result in his remaining for any time insuf-    ficiently clad in the dressing and board rooms.  Special    attention will be given to warming and proper regulation of    ventilation in all dressing and waiting rooms.  Chief Corn-    mi ssioner hopes that it will not again be necessary to draw    particular notice to the importance of carrying out all the    measures designed to secure the comfort of men presenting    themselves for medical examination.  Deputy Commissioners will    be directed to examine daily the working of  their arrangements    in this respect in order to prevent a recurrence of grounds of    complaint.  The matter is one of ele eiitary necessity and cf    greatest public importance.   Acknowledge,,       The complaint in the case of &quot;A.B.&quot; was as follows:-        &quot;On Monday, the 17th inst,, he went to Brighton.  Upon    arriving at the Town Hall, the place appointed, he was directed    to attend at the Town Hall at Hove, 2 miles away, this he did.    Upon his arrival there, it beinp near the lunch hour, the    examination was deferred until the afternoon when he again    attended.   He and seven others were ushered into a large room,    where was a fire; and directed by the N.C.O. Orderly^to strip,    ready for examination.  In this condition, naked excepx, for    their overcoats and waterproofs, they remained for about 2    hour8 before the examination took place.         Ily friend when examined was classed C3, and granted    exemption for 6 months.          The circumstances against which I protest vehemently are    that 8 men some of them worse crocks than A,B, should be    ordered to strip and compelled to remain for 2 long hours    With no other protection than a coat.  If they had been    criminals they could not have been treated in a worse manner.          All the advantages derived by the 5 weeks residence at    Hastings has been undone by this stupidity.
         This, I fear,  ia only  one sample out  of  thousands  which     illustrate the  inaptitude of  some  of the authorities  and  for     which  the Government is blamed.&quot;         I give in  full the report of  the Commissioner  for theSouth Eastern Region, which deals  with  all the  points  raised inthe  complaint.S.E.R./M/25.                                   17th January,  1918.THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OP MEDICAL SERVICES,      Ministry of National Service,          Westminster, S.W.I.Sir,                               SECRET.    With reference to your M/77 of the 4th  inst,  marked  &quot;Secret &apos;/I have the honour to append herewith a report  from the  Chairman ofthe Brighton Medical Board on the subject.    I have, on several occasions, inspected the work of  the BrightonBoard at the Hove premises, and entirely  corroborate the  statementmade by the Chairman as to the care and consideration with which therecruits are dealt,&apos;    \  His explanation is so complete  and convinc-ing that it is unnecessary for me to add  to  it in  any way.    Attention is also directed to the letter  attached  from  theChairman of the Brighton  and West Sussex  Branch of the  National Unionof Journalists, which shews the great care,  consideration and thorough-ncas with which the medical examination of recruits is  conducted atBrighton, and that, also, at the period complained of.   A statement is also appended from the medical  practitioner who  wasIn charge of the dressing and weighing rooms of the Board that day, andwho is surgeon to the Brighton Police, and Medical Officer of thePavilion General Hospital.   I have no hesitation  in characterising the statements regardingthe alleged hardship to recruits as false  and  malicious.   I may add that this is the only complaint  I have received with  re-gard to the work of the Brighton Medical  Board, and that  the Board  isriow working in very suitable premises a very few yards  distant fromthe Brighton Recruiting Office.                        I am, Sir,                                Your obedient Servant,                             (Sd.)   CH, BEDFORD.Ends.                        Commissioner of  Medical Services,                                       S.E. Region.
To.  The Commissioner,        Headquarters,  S.E.R.                    Re:-  S.E.R.M/25 of 7.1.18.                    Subject:-  Complaints by Recruits.Sir,      I have the honour to report according to your instructions.      I have gone into the matter of the alleged hardship as fullyas circumstances will  allow and though I have not completed theevidence to date yet there is ample to shew that the complaint waswithout foundation -      At the time the  complaint was made, the Board was occupying thetemporary premises in Hove pending the arrangements being completedof our present building,      At the time the  Area Headquarters were transferred fromChichester to Brighton the premises required alteration in Brightonand the Board temporarily sat in Hove - The distance separating uswas a source of great inconvenience, and the additional ?/ork neces-sary was accepted as a necessary evil - beyond our control.      My report is largely based on personal knowledge as I have todate been daily on the premises between the hours of 10 a.m. to sixp,m. without leaving the Board.      Sessions were held twice daily, morning 10.30 a.m. to 1.30 p.m.and 2.30 to 4 p.m.       Board-rooms consisted of two rooms separated by a landing - adressing room and examination room - used by the Board during thedaytime and at night by schoolgirls for various classes.                        COPY EXTRACT.          1 *  &quot;ypung^friend of mine we will call A.B.&quot;                    ERNEST R. WATES from Canada.          2.  &quot;On Monday, the 17th instant&quot; (17 Dec.1917)      The day complained of - the afternoon session in particular -      That afternoon the dressing room was in charge of S. Maguire,Surgeon to the Brighton and Boro&apos; Police and Medical Officer to the -Pavilion General Hospital, whose report is attached.       It was a cold day, the snow was on the ground and big fireswere kept going.  An extra examiner wa8 called to expedite the ex-amination though the numbers expected were small.          3.  1;Uponhis arrival there it being near the lunch hour              ^the examination was deferred&quot;until the afternoon.&quot;&apos;        When men arrive late and it is obvious that the man willhave to wait some considerable time before his turn comes round, itJs my custom to make an appointment with him after lunch, and givehim priority at the opening of the afternoon session.  The man isjsualiy grateful for this consideration, while I find it much easier to examine a well-fed man than a hungry one.  This personal arrange- ftent is either made by me or my clerk.  In this Instance WATES was
examined fourth on the afternoon list.      As I take no lunch myself but do  my clerical work during therecess this procedure is not designed for my own personal comfort:but is solely in the interests of the man concerned.      4*  &quot;Ushered into a large room where was a fire.&quot;           Large fires were maintained  in both rooms.   This is em-phasised because half the examination itself was conducted near ordirectly in front of the fire.  In the  present building there aretwo fireplaces and the examination is practically conducted entirelyby the fire.  This is not an accident but a carefully thought outarrangement.  The other half of the examination need  not be conduct-ed near a fire because it consists of a series of physical exerciseswhich keep the blood well warmed and circulated.     5.  &quot;Directed by the N.C.O. Orderly to strip.&quot;         We have no non-commissioned officer or orderly of any rankwhatever on our staff.         The two clerks working under the direction of medical manin charge of the room, consisted of an  old gentleman  with v/hite hairand a white beard and a very small and  unassuming ex-greengrocerwhose one fault is his shy and gentle manners *         I am therefore at a loss to explain the above statement.     6.  &quot;Naked except for th3ir overcoats and waterproofs.&quot;         There is a large printed notice which I made out myselfinstructing men to wear their coats, into&apos;which they  are also re-quested to keep their valuables;  Dressing-gowns loaned from aneighbouring Hospital were supplied with slippers for their feet.If they wore coats and waterproofs as stated these additional arti-cleB were provided for their comfort, but were apparently consideredunnecessary.         This complaint is therefore not understood as had the mendesired they could have been clothed more warmly than in the streetitself.         Men are always verbally instructed to wear overcoats inaddition to coats and dressing-gowns.      7*  &quot;They remained for about two  hours, before  the          examination took -cOaoe,&quot;         This period would be more than the time the  whole sessionactually lasted, so that the session would have been  over before itactually started I  and yet his name appears fourth on&quot;&quot;a list offourteen examined.  If the examination  of the night in questionwere so delayed it is difficult to conceive what happened to theremainder.          It is difficult to understand how two hours  waiting can bereconciled to the man&apos;s own statement - without consulting evenfacts of the case - Mr. Wates states he arrived near  lunch time - hereturned in the afternoon and waited two hours - but  the 1st sessiondldn*t- end until 1.30 and the second concluded at 4 p.m. when the
                          -t 5 **texaminwtMrent away, though the men were finished before then -fourteen in number.  The above statement is a deliberate untruth.        8.  &quot;Classed C3 and granted exemption for six months.&quot;            Passed Grade III (three).        9&quot;Eight men, some of them worse crocks than A*B.            &quot;&quot;&quot;IKouId be compelled to remain two long hours with            &quot;no other protection than a coat.  If they had been            &quot;criminals they could not have been treated in a            &quot;worse manner.       &quot;          In this connection the letter from the Chairman wfBrighton Branch of National Union of Journalists is appended.  Hisname appears next to the young gentleman from Canada on the after-noon of the 17th December 15*17.  The mature professional opinion ofthis gentleman appeared a few days later in the paper before thiscomplaint was voiced.  The coincidence is to be remarked.          Special arrangements are made to prevent the undressingand examination of obviously unfit men.  It is comparatively commonfor such men to appear often with the ob^ecjt of obtaining the day*spay.  Such men are picked out and dealt with forthwith by the Dr.in charge and the clerks are instructed to draw our attention to allsuch cases.          When, therefore, the statement is made that so many&quot;crocks&quot; were present, it requires sifting.  Of the fourteen ex-amined, half were Grade 1 (one) or two.  One only was rejected.Three were deferred for certificates of past disease or for somespecial investigation.  The remaining three were passed into GradeIII (three), of whom Mr. Wates was one.His particulars are now detailed for information:-           WATES, E.R.     Age 31.

           I hereby certify that I attended the Medical Board onthe 17th December, 1917, at 2,30 p.m.           On that day I was in charge of the dressing andWeighing room, where, to avoid any unnecessary standing or waiting,the men were screened from the rest of the room and weighed andmeasured by me personally, near the fireplace.           As the number of men examined was small, there was noundue waiting, and the men were quickly disposed of.           I left the Board at 4 p.m.                         (Signed)  ERNEST C.

January,1918.To The Chairman,    National Service Medical Board,          BRIGHTON.Dear Sir,            In the course of my experience as a journalist,  I havefound that people are ready enough to voice complaints,  but  areslow to express gratitude.  I do not wish to be counted among suchroutine - &quot;Have you anything to complain of?&quot;.          It is significant that in this complaint no mention ismade of the time occupied in clerical work.  Yet, the man had togive many particulars to be entered by the clerks and verified bythem - sign his full name at least five times and produce the neces-sary authority for the examination - a lengthy process to completeall these details accurately.          Many letters of appreciation and thanks have been receivedby this Board, not directly applicable to this date, and are there-fore merely retained for future reference if any case similar to thepresent one should arise.                    I have the honour to be,                            Sir,                                Your obedient Servant,                                   (Sd)  E.

people, and, though I can well imagine that you carry out yourwork without regard to praise or censure,  I feel that it is my duty,as it certainly is my pleasure, to let you know, on behalf ofmyself and certain colleagues of mine who have spoken to me on thesubject, that we have a very lively sense of gratitude for thekindness and courtesy we experienced when examined by the NationalService Medical Board at Brighton.  Speaking for myself, may I saythat, when I went before the Board for examination on December 17thlast, I did so with much trepidation.  To the lay mind such an ex-amination presents itself as an ordeal.  I was agreeably surprised.        The circumstances were such that when the batch of men in-cluding me arrived, many other men were waiting, and, with personalknowledge of examinations where men were waiting, standing inqueues for hours, I looked forward to the prospect with much dismay.Consequently, I was much relieved when, after some little waiting,the Clerk told certain men, including me,  that we could not beexamined until two o&apos;clock, and advising us to return then.  Thiswas a consideration I did not expect.        In the afternoon, I was called upon much sooner than I haddared to expect.  Under examination, I was much impressed by thequiet and kindly methods employed by the Doctors, as well as bythe pains-taking thoroughness of their examination.  I took parti-cular note of the fact that the other men being examined at thesame time were being treated with a like kindness and thoroughness.We were in fact treated with humanity.  I noticed this particularlywhen I came before the Chairman, a complete stranger to me, fornothing could have been more courteous than his manner, and, indirecting me to undergo a special eye-test, he very thoughtfullymade arrangements to enable me to do so with a minimum ofinconvenience.  This was in very agreeable contrast with what I hadbeen led to expect.        Quite spontaneously, I made comment to this effect toanother man who had been waiting with me,  and he cordially agreed.        On the strength of this experience, I advised a friend, whowas very nervous of harshness should he present himself for re-examination, that he need have no fears on that score, for hewould be treated with every consideration; and in a para, which Iwrote for the Brighton Herald I felt constrained to add, withoutthe slightest prompting from anyone:^                 &quot;For the peace of mind of Readers who may                 have to go before this Board, the HERALD can                 testify, from the personal experience of a                 member of the staff, that the examination                 is carried out in the most painstaking and                 considerate manner, with every regard to the                 feelings of the subject.&quot;        I should like to make it quite clear that I wrote thispurely as an item of news, and with no other consideration.        Since then, one or two friends of  mine have spoken to meexpressing their appreciation of the trouble taken over them, andthe courtesy they experienced, and it is with their consideredapproval that I now write this letter to express to you our senseof appreciation.                        Believe me gentlemen,                                 Yours sincerely,                              (Signed)  GEORGE AITCHISON.
