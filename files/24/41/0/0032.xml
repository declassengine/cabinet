Document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.                RECONSTRUCTION.Memorandum by the Minis ter of Ree-onstriurbi cxx*(1)   There are tv.ro passages in Sir Edward Carson5 smemorandum (G.190) to vhich I should like to oxpress mycordial adherence.&quot;The - questions  of Economic Defence and Development form a part - perhaps the most important part - of the problem of reconstruction.             &quot;In order to carry out a policy of Economic              Defence and Development,  a Minis ter of              Reconstruction is quite as essential as a              Cabinet Committeej  but in a Ministry of              Reconstruction there are certain obvious              dangers v.hich must be carefully guarded              against, in order to prevent those              misunderstandings and delays r-hich are              inevitable if the same work is  undertaken              by two different sets of authorities.&quot;(2)    I am equally in agreement with him as to theconclusion he draws, arguing from the special circumstancesand history of the Economic Offensive Committee, Viz.-&quot;That the  special sphere  of the Minister of Reconstruction should include that of the &quot;Economic Offensive Committee&quot; (or the &quot;Committee of Economic Defence and Development.&quot;)&quot;That the  Minister of Reconstruction cannot hope to exercise the influence which it is absolutely essential he  should exercise, for the purpose of performing his special functions in this particular sphere,  unless he works  through, and is supported by, a Cabinet Committee representative of the various Departments which are concerned in the task of Economic Defence and Development.&quot;
133(3^   Exit I should like to take this opportunity ofenforclns the second of his conclusions in a larger sphere.The experience of five months has convinced ms thatvhsther ue look at Production, Labour&apos;, Pinar.ce,Agriculture, Social Development as a whole, or at anyof the subordinate problem which group themselvesunder these heads, we constantly run the risk of gravedelay even in virgent matters if the work of reconstrtictionhas to be carried cut, through a sequence of individualnegotiations between all the Departments severally on theone hand, and a s-ingle Department on the other.(4)   I believe that the best and most practical course forthe Cabinet to follow is to establish a small IlinisterialCouncil on Reconstruction for which the Ministry ofReconstruction \roiild furnish the Secretariat.   The businessof the Council would be to review in an orderly andprogressive- manner, the Reconstruction Programme submittedto them item by item from the Ministry  to recommend to the7.7ar Cabinet proposals for action and the allocation ofexecutive duties folio ing thereon;  to receive reports asto fthe progress of measures on which they had decided; and,of course, to initiate proposals of their own which havingbeen examined by the Minister of Reconstruction in theirbearings on the general programme, would be returned tothem for consideration as substantive projects.   For allthese purposes the Council would be reinforced by theattendance on any question of all the Ministers -concerned.
(.50   ri&apos;here remains the question of the- financialprovision that rill have to be made for Reconstruction -and the question of ways and means.   It is clear thatevery proposal put forward in the v/ay of Reconstruction.must be considered in its financial aspects and thatultimately-something in the nature of a ReconstructionBudget will have, to be produced.   Some of theexpenditure involved would be universally recognised asinevitable.   Some of it will require to be justified asbeing in the nature of an investment intended to securean ultimate increase of productive capacity.   These arethe questions vrhich must be very carefully considered andon uhich it is desirable that any recommendations: whichreach the ^ar Cabinet should have behind them theauthority of more than a single Department,&quot;Christopher Addis on.
