Stqre Cattle. ,      The Question  of the  supply  of store cattle was raised  during the week at  a meeting of  Forfarshire  farmers attended by a representative  of  the Board.   The  meeting was strongly of the opinion that, in view of  the  fixed prices of fat  cattle,  the price of store cattle should  also be controlled so that feeders might not be faced by practically inevitable loos. 3.  Land Drainage.      The Board  have  had under consideration the question of the utilisation of  mechanical power  for executing land drainage, and, with a view to  stimulating an interest in the subjeot,  they have agreed to  offer a  su:^ of   100 as a premium  for the best mechanical invention  suitable for  executing such drainage, on condition that: the Highland and  Agricultural Society are prepared to contribute an et3.ua!  sum for the purpose.    4.

The quantity returned as consumed or delivered during December,    viz. 53,650  tons, is greater than that returned as consumed  or    delivered during November by 15,910 tens.
