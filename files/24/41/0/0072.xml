Germany is to supplymedicines, and to receive rubber, platinum, nickel  and leather.      Finland is in a state of famine.   The potato-stocks areexhausted, and the Government is preparing to  distribute the ryewhich had been reserved for seed.      Salt meat and dried  fishare the only other foodstuffs  available.  Finnish  importers areprepared to buy any quantity a&amp;d kind of foodstuffs that Denmarkand Scandinavia can supply.   Two cargoes of maize  and oats havebeen licenced for Finland by the United States far  Trade Board fbut have not yet been despatched.    We are prepared to grant  allfacilities to these cargoes, if we receive effective  guaranteesthat they will not fall into the hands of the  Germans or theBolsheviks.   For the moment there is no authority  in f inlandwhich  appears to be capable of giving such guarantees.Owing to the dearth of fodders tuffs  the Danish exportsIof cattle to Germany reached,  in December and  January, the highweekly average 0 f 11,000 head.   Itbis now reported  that  the Germany Iare to receive an additional 3,000 head a week,  in  compensation    j                                                                  mfor supplies of mineral oil.   The United States War Trade Boarclinsist, as a condition of their proposed agreement  with  Denmark,   jthat the exports of cattle to Germany shall  not  exceed a weeklyaverage of 6,000 head.   They will demand  that anyexceas over this gfigure, as from Jan. 1, shall be balanced by a corresponding reduc-tion of the exports after the agr cement is  signed.  If Denmarkreally desires to come to terms with the United  States,  it shouldbe possible to find a market for the surplus Danish (tattle in
                                                       -     316  1                                                             t.  -  Finland and in Sweden.     The Danish Government have alrea3jy re-  moved all restrictions on the export of cattle to Finland, and  extensive purchases of meat have been effected in Denmnrk for  Finnish accounts.   The Swedish Government are negotiating at  Copenhagen for supplies of Banish beef to the value of 5,000,000  kronen.      The  exports of Danish produce to Germany are still enormous f  In the  four weeks  ending Jan. 16, the average weekly consignments  of pork and bacon were 180 tons; of fresh meat, 136 tons; of  butter,   36  tons;  of  eggs, 102 tons;    The re we also smaller,  but still considerable ex ports of salt end preserved meat, milk  and vegetables.        The principal item of  food which Denmark  is sending to the  United  Kingdom  is  bacon, of  which we receive on an average 60 tons:  a week.    We  have  also been  offered large quantities of Danish  butter under  the Agricultural&apos; Agreement,  but at a price which H.H.  Government regard  as  prohibitive.   This butter cannot be sent to  Germany without a  breach of  the  agreement;    it will probably be  sold in Sweden, Norway and Finland.SWEDEN.     The  modus Vivendi   with Sweden was signed in London, on   Han,  29, by  the  representatives of Italy, the  United States and   Great Britain.  We are  requiring the Swedish Government  to give   a guarantee  that  neither the goods imported under the modus Vivendi   nor their products,  shall be escorted from Sweden;  and that no   similar articles  shall be exported within a period of three months,NORWAY.      The Norwegian Government tare now replied to  ISie proposals   of the United  States War Trade  Boar&amp;fc  they would agree not  to ex-   port more than 48,000 tons  per annum of  fish and fish products to   the enemy;   but  they ask to be left at liberty to s\ipply Germany   with large quantities of calcium carbide, calcium nitrate, ferro-

This counter-proposal is re-     gar ded  by the German Minister as unsatisfactory;  but it will     not  satisfy  the United States.   The  first four commodities in     the  Hor^egian list are materials used in the manufacture of     munitions,  and pyrites is  chiefly valuable to the enfrmy as a     source  of sulphuric aoid. KSTHEEIIAKPS.      The if ether lands Bank are prepared to find monthly     credits up to 15,250,000 florins a month, for the financing of     British purchases in Holland;   but they ask that the sums ad -     vaneed  shall be  guaranteed either by a joint undertaking on the     part of the  British and United  States Governments, or by the     deposit of first  class British  securities.  They will not accept     the unsupported  guarantee  of H,M, Government,           It appears that the  commanders  of German  submarines have     orders  to sink any Dutch  /essels wMoh carry cargo consigned  to     the H:0.T.    Only  cargoes consigned  to  the Dutch Government  will     be allowed to pass.    This decision m??y be due  to the fict  that     the H.Q.T. are at present  nego tie ting a comprehensive agreement     with the Allies,  and have  signified  their willingness to be res-     posible for the  whole of the Dutch  import and  export trade  with     Norway, Denmark and  Sweden,afflTZaaXuiKP.     In concert with France and  Italy,  R.M. Government     have presented to  the federal  Government  a note demanding a  fur-     ther limitation of  the Swiss exports  of cotton goods to Germany,     since  there is reason to believe that these goods are applied by     our enemies to military ages.    The French and Italian  governments     are prepared to refuse all licences for the  export to Switzerland     of raw cotton, cotton yarn and cotton piece goods, until this     question is satisfactorily settled.   The Swiss Government are     not without a weapon of retaliation.    The agreement under whitish     they supply the French and Italian Goveraments with wood hss  just

But the Allies pro-    pose to insist that the two questions shall be kept distinct.        The Swiss  Government persist in attaching unacceptable con-    ditions to the proposed Anglo-Swiss loan.   H.M. Government ere    intimating that,  unless these conditions are withdrawn, it will    be necessary for them to abandon the project of the loan;  and    to Impose further limitations upon the imports of Swiss luxury    goods Into the United Kingdom.UNITED STATES.    Agreement has  now bean r cached as to the main    lines of a scheme under which H.M. Government will cooperate with    the United States War Trade Board in  controlling United States    exports to the northern neutrals!   The  scheme provides for re-    porting by telegraphnto Loud on all licence applications which re-    late to Important quantities  of goods.   The Board have given an    Informal assurance that they  will not grant any sprdioat ion which,    after consulting with them, we still  desire to veto.          The coal shortage In the United States is still  acute, al-    though the Eastern railroads  are sacrificing their passenger    traffic and neglecting every  other class of freight in order to    distribute coal.  Exports of coal have  been severely  restricted,    and unessential  industries will be required to  reduce  their  con-    sumption of coal, during 1918, by  fifty  million tons.WMAU SUBMABIM BLOCKADE.
