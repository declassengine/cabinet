Activity on both sides has been greater than last week.Enemy raids have been repulsed at several points on the Alliedfront.  On January 20th the Bulgarians attacked West of Dorksafter a fierce bombardment on a five kilometre front and wasbrilliantly repulsed by the Greek Archipelago Division.     The enemy artillery was five times more active than theprevious week.     There has been a considerable increase in the number ofBulgarian desertions; the number has doubled since the begin-ning of January,     False news is a common feature of Bulgarian communiques.     Allied aircraft has carried out a number of bombing raids;a motor convoy was bombed in the Petric region, one of themotors of which according to deserters carried the King ofBulgaria,  Two enemy aeroplanes have been brought down thisweek.     The relief of the Russian Division by the available unitsof the 156th French Division is complete.
