(121/S.W.C./73.)DECISIONS.    1. The record of the Proceedings of the 241st Meeting was confirmed.    2. (i.)  The Army Council have been  informed  by the Secretary of  State  forWar of the Eesolution in regard to the Constitution and Control of a General Eeserve,arrived at by the Supreme War  Council at Versailles on 2nd  February, which wasdiscussed at, and accepted by, the War Cabinet, on the  4th February.    They take note that by this Eesolution  an Executive Committee composed of thePermanent Military Eepresentatives of Great Britain, Italy and  the  United States  ofAmerica, with General  Foch for France, has been created with executive powers overthe troops of the national armies allocated to the General Eeserve.    They further take  note that  General Foch has begn appointed President of thisExecutive Committee.    (ii.)  The Army  Council observe that  inasmuch as this Executive Committee isempowered to determine the strength and composition of the General Eeserve, and thecontribution of each national army thereto, and, further, to issue orders as to the time,place, and period of employment of the  General Eeserve, the Committee will, in fact,exercise the powers of a Generalissimo over the several  Commanders-in-Cbief of thenational armies concerned, for he who controls the reserve controls the whole.    This point  is  further  emphasized  by the  right  conferred  on  the   ExecutiveCommittee of visiting any of the theatres of war.    The effect  of this arrangement will be that the Executive  Committee will  beinvested  with powers, over the  British Forces in France, Italy and the  Balkans,although it  has no  constitutional responsibility for their  safety,  which is directlyaffected by the composition, strength, location and employment of the Eeserves.    (iii.) Constitutionally the Army Council are responsible for the safety and welfareof the British Army.   The powers conferred on the Executive Committee, however,will enable it to disregard the Army Council, in that it is allowed to interpose directlybetween the Council and the Commanders-in-Chief.    (B18/7)  24 2/18 H&amp;S  5530-2wo
    (iv.) In regard  to the position of Commanders-in-Chief, it  must be  rememberedthat they are responsible, through the Army Council, for carrying put the policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government,  while under the-system now established they would be givenorders affecting their operations byTtwodifferent-- authorities, the  Executive Committeeand the  Army Council.   This  system could not fail to cause dangerous confusion andcomplication in the conduct of the operations.    (v.)  The Array  Council therefore consider that the  constitution of the ExecutiveCommittee as it now stands would not only place Commanders-in-Chief in an impossibleposition,  but would  also deprive the  Council of the responsibility entrusted to themunder the Constitution of the Realm, and that any such abrogation of that responsibilitywould be a violation of the trust reposed in them.R. H.  BRADE.
