D. 3rd Feb. 1918.R. 4th Feb. 1918.263. 3rd Job.     Suimmry for week ending Feb. 2nd 1918.POLITICAL.          The present trans-Caucasus Government&quot;will be changedshortly to a diet which will consist of members elected to thenational assembly of Russia which never really assembled.   Itis not expected that this will wake (?) any great change in thepresent constitution, but as members are direct representativesof various nationalities, it will doubtless be stronger thanpresent temporary Government.          Recent peace overtures are to be considered at aConference with South Eastern Union Ukraine Government on 14thFebruary.          There is no serious danger in this so far as can be ascertained.   This and following points I attribute to Turoo-Gerinan propaganda and agitation:-     (1)  Tartar disturbances by small bands, which are partly     against influential (one gr. emitted) landlord; both     Russians and Armenians are partly responsible for this     trouble.     (2)  British territorial aspirations in the Cauoasua.     (3)  Reports from Kuban Government at Ekaterinodar to     trans-Caucasus Government that Germany nas entered into     secret  negotiations with the Allies for the partition of     Russia  from iorth to South amongst Germany, England and     Prance  and Japan in Siberia.   This was reported by Govern-     ment to me and an emphatic  (?) denial was given by me.     (4)  Proposal said to come from Germany that as an     &quot;independent state&apos;1 trans-Caucasus should send one represen-     tative  from all Rationalities to Brest Litovsk negotiations,     if &quot;independent trans-Caucasia&quot; political summary week     January 19th Tartar element is responsible for much of     propaganda engineered by released Turkish and German     prisoners and agents.     Collisions have occurred between Tartars and Armenians atJUizabetapol (130 (1 sr. omitted) killed) and Akstafa,   AtJulfa and Khei between rurds and Armenians.   Certain demands onsupply question have been received from South Eastern Union bytrans-Caucasus Government.   Thi3 effects mobilisation and  \formation of national troops.   Belsheviks in Porthern Caucasushave suffered two defeats by Co3sacks, at the same time they haveseized certain points,MILITARY.          Staff is shortly to be re-organised and a small \7arCouncil under Government is to bo formed to advise on militarymatters.   General Le Vedinski will&apos;be G.G.C. National troops.                                                         Present
 present Caucasus Staff will be ? curtailed; existing districtsstaff will be cut down and finally absorbed into Cauoasus Staff.lTurco-Armenian formations progress well; Divisional Staff and Andronik leaves Tiflis shortly for Erzerum permanently, KAVAL.           On January 8th Commander l.e Page reports Black Sea Jl&amp;et entirely Bolshevik, that all power is vested in revolution- ary ooramittee; there is very little hope of deserters oo-opera- tion or organisation. FIKAffCIAL.           Trans-Caucasus Government have not yet accepted or agreed to financial control of sums for military purposes.   AS they are awaiting the formation of new Diet or local Rational Assembly they have not yet given me their proposals.   our machinery exists for working with military authorities for formation if National troops and at present I (?) am carrying on with this,   Sum3 expended as follows:-   Turkish-Armenian Division one million, Russian Corps one hundred&quot; thousand.   The difficulty in realising money lies in selling drafts on London at not less than 50 roubles to the pound.C.2. copies to K.I.1.A,
