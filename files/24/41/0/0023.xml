BOARD   OF   TRADE.DEPARTMENTAL    COMMITTEE   ON    SHIPPING   AND                              SHIPBUILDING.                                  REPORT.    To the Eight Honourable SIR ALBERT H. STANLEY, M.P.,            President of the Board of Trade.SIR,-    WE were appointed by your predecessor to consider the position of the Shipping and Ship-building industries after the war,  especially in  relation to International Competition,  and toreport what  measures, if any,  are necessary  or  desirable to safeguard that position.   Withcertain important sections of the problem presented to us we dealt in two Interim Reports thefirst on the subject of the German Control Stations and the Atlantic Emigrant Traffic, and thesecond  on the position after the war of  the Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering industries.We have now the honour to submit our final Report  on  Shipping after the war.    2.   The statistical data in this Report are derived, except where otherwise stated, fromReturns published, by the Board of Trade and by  Lloyd&apos;s Register of Shipping.  We sent outforms of enquiry to British Shipbuilders, Marine Engineers, and to Steamship Lines and Ownersof vessels engaged in general trade.  We have also  taken evidence from the industries concerned,and we are  indebted to  them for  a good deal of the information on which our findings  andrecommendations  are  based.  Finally,  we  have  had before us  the valuable Report  of  theCommittee appointed by the Chamber of Shipping of the United Kingdom  and the  LiverpoolSteamship Owners&apos; Association to advise as to the measures requisite  for the maintenance ofthe British  Mercantile Marine; and we desire to record our indebtedness to that Committee,who, by placing before us  the results  of their careful investigation, have materially  facilitatedour task.    In  December, 1916,  Sir Joseph Maclay, on being appointed Shipping Controller, resignedhis membership of this  Committee;  and we were thus deprived of the services of  a memberwh^se  wide  experience-would have been invaluable  in the later  stages of our enquiry.   Wewarmly congratulate Sir Joseph Maclay  on his appointment.    We also wish to record, with deep regret,  the  death in September last of our colleague,Sir Edward  Hain.  The  loss of Sir Edward Hain, which would in any case have been a heavyblow to the  Shipping Industry, was irreparable to us at the stage of our Enquiry then reached.Sir Edward  Hain&apos;s advice and suggestions had been most helpful throughout our investigations.    3.-  Our enquiry has been protracted by the ever-changing character of the maritime situa-tion, which has hitherto  made it difficult, if not  impossible, to frame any estimate of theprobable position  at the  end of the war sufficiently reliable to serve as a basis for the solutionof the  problem under investigation.  Whilst at  present the essential factors underlying thesituation appear to have  assumed a semblance of constancy, there is even now no real guaranteethat some new factor may not arise which will to a certain extent affect  the conclusions reached,    4.  In many ways we should have deemed it more satisfactory to postpone our final Reportuntil such  time as the  end  of the war appeared nearer than  at  present, when the measuresrequisite to assure our  maritime ascendency after the war, and with it  our whole economicposition, could, be indicated without serious risk of error.   We are  aware of the desire ofH.M.  Government to be furnished with all the necessary data on which  the future economicpolicy of the country must be based, and we are, therefore, anxious to render all possible assist- ance in that direction.   To a certain extent the development of  the  submarine menace has facilitated  our task.  The position of the  British Mercantile  Marine  is now compromised to such an extent  that any  change in the general situation is likely to be one of degree rather thanof kind.     5.  So  much stress  has recently been laid on the supreme  importance to this Empire  of a merchant fleet, adequate to the needs alike of peace and of war,  that we regard any enlargement of the  subject  as superfluous.    Suffice it  to say that a predominant mercantile marine  is a necessity, if not only the maintenance  but also the free development of  the Empire is to be assured; if the  United Kingdom is to  continue, as in the past, to import food for her population and raw materials for her industry,.and to export her coal and her finished products; and, lastly, if the hope of reconstruction after the  war for  all  the Allied nations in Europe is not to be frustrated.  Our findings and recommendations are accordingly  based on two  hypotheses, neither of which is likely to be controverted the first,  that the maritime ascendency of the  Empire must  be maintained  at all  costs, and  the second,  that the grave wastage sustained  by the mercantile mar me during the war must, therefore, be repaired without delay.
    6.  In Part I. of this Report we deal with the problem which we regard as the most vital ofall the reconstruction of the Mercantile Marine.   This head embraces virtually all questionsarising out of the war.  In Part II. we pass to questions  of general policy, which, howeverimportant,  are in our view subsidiary to the problem already referred to.   These questions  areconsidered Under the general head of Foreign Competition and Mercantile Policy.    7.  We have throughout endeavoured to avoid trenching upon  current questions of warpolicy, partly because we have regarded such questions as outside our reference, and still morebecause we have no  desire to increase in any way the difficulties of administration in this crisis.Where, however, present policy has  appeared to us gravely to compromise the after:war position,which we were appointed to consider, we have not hesitated to place our views on  record, in  thehope that every effort may be made  to safeguard the future so far as present exigencies permit.PART. I.The Reconstruction of the Mercantile Marine.                                    INTRODUCTION.    8.  In this  part of our Report  we deal with Shipping objectively and analytically,  con-sidering the number, size, speed, age and other characteristics oi the vessels which make up themercantile marine rather than the nature of the trades in which they are engaged.  .  Suchtreatment, though necessarily involving a degree of abstraction,  presents obvious advantagesin that it facilitates the consideration of important aspects of the subject without introducing  atthis  stage  the difficult  and complex trade problems by which the  growth of our  merchantshipping was conditioned.  With those trade problems we shall deal  in the second part of ourReport; but it is necessary to remember that the  two parts of the Report are interdependent,since ships could no more exist without trade than seaborne trade without ships.    9.  This form of treatment, moreover, enables us to form a clear conception of those vitalproblems which  have arisen directly out of the war, and of which the solution after its closemust be a condition of any settled maritime policy.  The enemy&apos;s war on  merchant shippingand  our failure  to  build new tonnage  on  an adequate  scale have combined to bring about asituation which,  in its gravity, appears to us to eclipse all the other problems of Reconstruction.It is this question with which, we are primarily concerned in this part of our Report.    10.  The Resolutions of the Paris Economic Conference contemplated two distinct periodsafter the conclusion of  peace;  the  first a period of  reconstruction, and the second a periodduring which measures of a more permanent character should apply.  As the result of ourEnquiry, we have found it impossible  to draw any hard-and-fast line between the two periods.In the first place, the so-called period of Reconstruction is likely  to  be prolonged, and in thesecond place, the transition to stable conditions is  likely to be very gradual.   Whilst the ques-.tions considered  in the first part of this Report are questions important primarily in the Recon-struction period, and those dealt with in the  second part are of a more general description, thearrangement we have adopted  was made  without reference to the Economic Conference,  andsimply on the grounds above indicated.    11.  We consider below the situation brought  about by the war and the steps which shouldin our opinion be taken to meet it.  Our remarks on these subjects are preceded by a brief survey .of the position of the British Mercantile Marine at the outbreak of war, of its  development upto that date, and of its relation to the other merchant navies of the world.    12.  Finally, we wish to draw special attention to differences in the measurements commonlyadopted as regards the tonnage of merchant shipping.  There are (a) the gross Register tonnage,or the total measurement capacity of the ship; (ft) the net Register tonnage, or the measurementcapacity after deduction for space taken up by engine-room and accommodation for the crew ;and (c) dead-weight capacity, or the weight of cargo and bunkers that the vessel is able to carrywhen fully loaded.  Throughout this Report figures  of tonnage quoted, except where  otherwisestated, represent the NET REGISTER and not the gross register tonnage.  The Official Statistics,on which  we are in the main  dependent,  adopt the net register  tonnage  in many importantinstances; and we have therefore deemed it expedient to adopt the same classification through-out.   In certain cases, -where the only available  statistics represented the  gross  tonnage, wehave converted to net tonnage on the basis of 8 tons gross to 5 tons net.   This basis of conversion,whilst unreliable for individual ships, is sufficiently accurate  where large amounts of tonnageare involved.  To avoid confusion we have taken no  account of dead weight capacity.
     SECTION I.-THE  BRITISH MERCANTILE MARINE BEFORE THE &quot;WAR,    13.  At the outbreak of war the British Mercantile  Marine was the largest, the most np to1date and the most efficient of all the merchant navies of the world.   It comprised nearly onehalf of the world&apos;s steam tonnage (12&apos;4 million tons out of about 26 million tons net), and wasfour times  as large as its nearest and most formidable  rival the German Mercantile Marine.In Appendix D (Table I.)  there is printed a  statement showing the steam tonnage owned bythe principal maritime countries of the world over a period of years.  The tonnage owned bythe principal maritime countries  of the world on June 30th, 1914, is shown below: -                                      STEAM  VESSELS.British Empire :-  United Kingdom  Dominions and Colonies           TotalGermany......*United States  ...Norway  ......FranceJapanNetherlandsItaly    ......Other Countries ...

Nvte. The steam tonnage of the three Scandinavian countries (Norway, Sweden and Denmark) amounted togetheron the 30th June, 1914, to 2,185,000 tons net or to 8-4 per cent, of the worlcTs steam tonuage.                                      General  Character.    14.  The tonnage of the United Kingdom consisted mainly of vessels large enough forocean voyages.  If the dividing line between ocean going and other  vessels is taken at 1,000tons net  (or 1,600 tons gross), it will be found  that  90 per cent, of the  tonnage of the  UnitedKingdom was made up of vessels of the larger type.  The number and net tonnage of steamvessels (a) of less than 1,000 tons and (b) of and above 1,000 tons which were on the Register ofthe United Kingdom at the end of 1913 were as  follows:                                                               No.          Net tons.         (a) Steam vessels  of  less than  1,000 tons net    ...  8,855         1,100,000         (6) Steam vessels  of and above  1,000 tons net    ...  3,747         10,174,00012,60211,274,000    Note. In our more detailed survey of the position of the British Mercantile Marine beforethe war, we have in general confined ourselves to the shipping of the United Kingdom, whichrepresented 93 per cent, of the Empire&apos;s shipping, the reason being that detailed statistics arenot always available for the latter.    15.  It is impossible to lay too much stress on the  above  circumstance, because  it meansthat we are dependent for our supplies and our trade on a small number of vessels of great size.That is the secret both of our success in peace and of our clanger in war.   Vessels of large sizeare generally  more economical than smaller vessels, but  in war their loss is the more severelyfelt proportionately as  their number is limited.  In the present  war, the enemy&apos;s submarinewarfare became vital the moment it began to attack the larger vessels on a great scale.    16.  The  tendency  to build vessels of increasing size must be reckoned with.  Such vesselsare more economical; and in peace the country that can  run its vessels most economically willnecessarily be the predominant carrying power.   Before the war chis country led the way  inmost matters  of shipowning and shipbuilding,  and not least in the building of large vessels.Between the end of  1910 and the end  of 1913 the average size of the  &quot; ocean-going &quot;  vesselson the register of the United Kingdom increased from  2,500 to 2,700 tons net.   The followingtable shows clearly the  directions in which this tendency was  operating:-Steam Vessels on the Register of the U.K. on December 31st.	1910.		1913.		No.	Net Tons.	No.	Net Tons.Of 1,000 and under 2,000 tons net ...... 2,000 ,, ,, 3,000 ,,....... ,. 3.000 ,, ,, 5,000 ,, ...... ., 5.000 tons net and above Total ...........	1,370 1,569 630 148	2,138,000 3,878,000 2,324,000 994,000	1,1.34 1,599 804 210	1,751,000 4,001,000 2,975,000 1,446,000	3,717	9,334,000	3,747	10,173,000
    It is interesting to note that the reduction in the number of ships of less than 2,000 tonsexactly corresponds with the increase in the number of vessels of and above 3,000 tons.    IT.  It is not necessary to make any detailed comparison between  the British and  otherMercantile Marines as regards  the size of vessel employed.   The average size  of steam vesselsof and above 100 tons gross (or about 60 tons net) is a rough index to the kind of trade in whichthe vessels of the respective countries were principally employed; and the average tonnage  ofsuch vessels which were on the Register on -June 30th, 1914, is accordingly shown below:                                                                             Net tons.

This is true also, though in a lesser degree, ofJapan and Holland.  The low average tonnage of Danish,  Norwegian, Russian  and Swedishvessels is equally significant for the converse reason.  The comparison does not, however, do fulljustice to the United  Kingdom, seeing that its ocean-going tonnage  alone was more than threetimes as large as the entire German Mercantile Marine.                                    Liners and Tramps.     18.   The British carrying trade before the war was divided between the Regular Lines with scheduled sailings, which traded on defined routes, and owners of vessels engaged in general trade or &quot;tramp &quot; owners, whose vessels were often chartered to third parties and traded wherever a cargo might be found.  It is impossible, however, to state  how much tonnage was allocated at a given time as between &quot; liners &quot; and &quot; tramps.&quot;  The Lines ran passenger vessels and also cargo vessels generally of a higher type and speed  than ordinary tramp vessels, but there was always a class of vessel on the border line between &quot; liners &quot; and &quot; tramps&apos;&quot;&apos; which might be of service in either capacity, as occasion  required.   The only available  index  of the importance of tramp tonnage is that afforded by the speed of the vessels.  It appears from particulars given in Lloyd&apos;s Register  book  that of the steam  tonnage owned by the British Empire on June  30th, 1914, 35 per cent, was capable of maintaining at  sea a speed of  12 knots or more; and it is probable that all vessels of this speed were liners.   It may be estimated roughly that of our total tonnage before the war  60 per cent, consisted of tramps and 40 per cent, of liners.     .19.   We  wish to emphasize  the  great  importance of the tramp  owner in the Shipping economy of the Empire.   Not only was he responsible for the larger part of our steam tonnage, but we were dependent on him for the import and export especially of what may be termed the rougher class of bulk cargoes which are not  as a rule  suitable  for liner business.  It would be impossible for a country like the United Kingdom, with its  enormous flow  of trade, to depend wholly  on regular lines  with scheduled sailings.  It is essential that  there should be a large amount of &quot;loose&quot; tonnage  capable of supplementing the liner sailings, and prepared to trade at short notice to any part of the world.   Yet, precisely because of his  ubiquitous presence, the tramp owner&apos;s  difficulties are the least easily defined and met,  and he  is peculiarly susceptible to any serious modification of the conditions  under which shipping is carried on.   In an enquiry such  as ours, which is bound to take account of  particular trade routes, there  is a real danger that the interests  of the tramp  owner may not  appear  to receive the  full  weight which they merit.    20.   Particulars of  the  speed  of vessels  of  foreign countries are  printed  in Appendix D (Tables III. (a) and (b) ).  It will be seen that they do not on the whole compare favourably with British vessels in this respect. The proportion of Norwegian vessels of 12  knots and above was insignificant, but it  is known that the number of Norwegian liners was  small.  It  may be noted that only 23 per cent, of  German steam tonnage was capable of maintaining  at  sea a speed of 12  knots  or more, and yet the German trades were pre-eminently  liner trades, their tramp interest being small.    21.  No account is taken in  this Report of Sailing  tonnage.  Its importance is small and will become smaller with the advance of Science.  The disadvantages  of ships dependent on wind  and weather are too  obvious to need  comment.   Already the carrying power of sailing vessels of a given tonnage is incomparably  lower than that  of steam vessels of equivalent tonnage; and the error due to the omission of sailing tonnage from  any estimate of the  world&apos;s carrying power is almost negligible.  In 1890 the United Kingdom possessed 3  million tons of sailing vessels;  by  1900 the amount had declined to a little over 2 million tons, and by 1913 to 850,000 tons.   A similar,  though a somewhat less rapid,  decline, due to the  supersession of sailing craft  by steam and other self-propelled  vessels, is visible in  the  case also of othercountries.
                              Growth of the World&apos;s Shipping.      22.   The quarter of a century or so preceding the war saw  an enormous expansion of the  world&apos;s sea-horne commerce and consequently of the world&apos;s tonnage which trebled in volume.  In the 20 years np to the end of 1913 there were built some 25 million tons of steam shipping,  of which two-thirds was built in the  United Kingdom and over one-half for the British flag.  The world&apos;s shipbuilding, of which particulars will be found in paragraphs 10-14 of our Interim  Report  on  Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering, has increased progressively  from  some  700,000 tons net in 1894 to  an average of about one million tons net a year in the period 1894-  1903, to 1\ million tons net a year in the period 1904-1913  and to 2 million tons net in  1913  itself.    These figures illustrate the growing demand for shipping- that followed the world&apos;s  economic expansion before the war.      23.   In  the period under review the steam tonnage of  the United Kingdom  more  than  doubled; but, even so, its rate of  increase was  proportionately not  so rapid as that of certain  other countries, notably Germany, whose steam  tonnage  increased fourfold.  The fact that the  volume  of British  shipping did not increase at the same relative rate  as that of  some other  countries  is not in itself disquieting and is  explained on  two  grounds:         (1) It was not to be expected that the United Kingdom could maintain its great relative              preponderance  in the world&apos;s  carrying trade in face  of the enormous economic              expansion taking place in such cotm tries as Germany and  the United  States and              the opening up of new markets in all parts of the world.  It is not surprising that              the  smaller  mercantile  marines should have expanded  more  rapidly than  the              powerful mercantile marine of  the United  Kingdom,  more especially  in view of              the maritime efforts of most countries in the period under review.  It is noteworthy              that, if actual as opposed to relative growth is considered, no foreign country even              approximated to the United Kingdom.  From statements appended to this Report*              it will be seen  that the growth of  Germany&apos;s mercantile marine was  much more              rapid in proportion than that of the United Kingdom; but whilst between 1900              and June, 1914, the United Kingdom added  4&apos;3  million tons to its steam tonnage,             Germany added only If million tons.       (2)  Great as  was the  expansion of the world&apos;s  tonnage in the 25  years before the war,             the expansion of the  world&apos;s power of transportation  was  even greater owing  to             the superiority first of steam over sailing ships and  then  of improved types  of             steamships over the older types.   The  carrying power of the United Kingdom             proportionately to the tonnage  on the Register increased  more rapidly than that             of other countries.  In any appreciation of  the maritime position of this country             before the war, this factor  cannot  be overlooked.                    Relative Efficiency of the British Mercantile Marine.     24.   The world&apos;s  shipping was undergoing a continual process of renewal and replacement. Not only were existing ships repaired and even  renovated so far as might be necessary,  but new ships were continually being built which, on completion, were added to the Register of the several countries and went either to replace older vessels wrecked or  broken up  or to swell the tonnage at the world&apos;s disposal.   For the world&apos;s tonnage taken as  a whole, the increase in  the volume on the Register  in&apos; one year, as compared with a previous  year, represented the amount of new tonnage added to the Register loss the  proportion  of that tonnage  needed to replace old vessels wrecked, broken up  or otherwise destroyed.  Thus, immediately before the war the average annual rate  of expansion of the world&apos;s steam tonnage as a whole was rather less than 5 per cent, of the tonnage  on  the Register.  The output of new tonnage amounted to rather over 7  per cent, of the tonnage  on the Register: and it may therefore be inferred that about 2 per cent, of the world&apos;s shipping was every year lost or broken up.     25.  Nearly  one-half of  the world&apos;s shipping, as has been above indicated, was on  the Register  of the United Kingdom.  If the mercantile marine of the United Kingdom is taken by  itself,  it will be  seen that the process of development  in its case  was  widely different.  In the years  immediately before the war the steam  tonnage of the United Kingdom increased by not more than 2\ per cent,  annually.  But, on the other hand, some 600,000 tons net, or nearly b\  per cent, of the total tonnage was every year  removed  from the  Register for one reason or another.   Two-thirds, or 400,000 tons, was sold to foreign flags,  the amount accounted for by vessels lost or broken  up  averaging only 150,000 tons.  On the other hand,  additions  to the Register of the United Kingdom in the years 1911-1913 averaged about 863,000 tons a year,  of which 93  per  cent, comprised vessels newly built.  In Appendix  D  (Tables IV. (a)  and (6) ) are printed Statements, showing in  detail the number  and net tonnage of steam vessels added to and deducted from the Register of the United Kingdom  during the years 1909-1915.     26.   This fact of the transfer of large numbers of our older vessels to foreign flags was of great importance in connexion with the development of our mercantile marine, and  it cannot be overlooked in the consideration of future policy.  It means that  our shipowners were afforded a ready market for the disposal of  vessels no longer satisfactory to  them as a preliminary tothe purchase of new vessels better suited  to their purpose, and that the  merchant tonnage of foreign countries as a whole was older and therefore less efficient than the tonnage of the British mercantile  marine.  It illustrates the process  of growth  which  continually kept the Britishmercantile  marine ahead of its rivals and, being the result of a  spontaneous development,  isSee Appendix D, Tables II (a) and (6),
more conclusive&apos; evidence of high  efficiency than could be afforded by any amount of writtentestimony.  If further evidence on the subject is desired, it may be found in Tables No. 8 andNo.  3A of Lloyd&apos;s Register  Book,&apos;showing the number and gross  tonnage of vessels added toand  deducted from the merchant navies  of  the United  Kingdom,  France, Germany, Italy,Norway and Sweden in the twelve  months  ended June 30th, 1914.  It should be borne in mindthat a high percentage of new vessels in  additions to the Register and a low percentage of newvessels lost and broken up in deductions  from the Register are signs  of efficiency, whilst a lowpercentage in the former case and a high percentage  in the latter may be indications of  thereverse.   The &quot;broad results of  the  tables  in question are summarised below, the gross tonnagebeing converted to net tonnage for convenience.Tonnage added.Proportion of new vessels.Tonnage deducted.Proportion of lost,  broken up, &amp;c.United KingdomGermany  ...FranceItalyNorwaySwedenTons net. 955,000 387,000 137,000 137,000 152,000  66,000Per cent.   97   85   61   12   59   62Tons net.621,000 86,000 38,000 32,000 37,000 17,000Per cent.   24   33   5S   66   - 1  49   53     Whilst the United Kingdom replaced about 5\  per  cent,  of  its tonnage in the year  inquestion,  Germany  replaced less than 3  per cent., and the  other countries  concerned about3J per  cent.  This  fact explains in some measure the reason for the apparently  more rapidrate  of development of  foreign merchant navies.     27.   As a result of the process referred to it is not surprising to find that 85 per cent, of thetonnage on the Register of the United Kingdom at the  end of 1913 had been  built since 1895,including 68 per cent,  built since 1900 and 44 per cent, built  since 1905.

In  the preceding survey no account  has been taken of those personal factors which,whilst an indispensable element of success, are the nost difficult to appraise.  The  initiative andenterprise  of shipowners and. shipbuilders  were a  vital  element in the building up of thegreatest  carrying  trade that the world has ever seen.   A further element of success,  on whichit is impossible to lay too much stress, was the skill,  efficiency and seamanship of the officersand men who manned  and navigated  our vessels in peace,  and who during the  war have bytheir courage and  devotion ensured the maintenance of our seaborne trade.       SECTION II. THE  EFFECT OF  THE WAR  ON BRITISH  SHIPPING.    29.  The future position of the mercantile marine is bound up so vitally with developmentsthat have taken place during the war that we are  obliged to indicate their principal features inbroad outline.   Only by a proper appreciation of  our maritime position before the war and  thechanges that have  set in during the war, is it possible  to  advise as to the measures  necessaryfor the restoration of our position after the  war.    30.  At the outbreak of war the distribution of the world&apos;s steam tonnage among belligerentsand neutrals was approximately as follows :  British EmpireAllied Countries* ...United  States  and  RepublicsfOther NeutralsEnemy Countries ...              Totalother  AmericanMillion Tons Net.12- 4- 1- 3- 3-26-0Per Cent.4817 71414100    * For convenience  the following countries are included  under this head :- France, Russia, Italy,  Belgium,Portugal, Roumania, Gr eece. Japan, and China.  It has been  thought advisable for a number of reasons to includethe Shipping of all the American Republics (some of which are now Allies) under  a separate heading.    f U.S. Shipping on the Northern Lakes is not included.    16698                                                                                 R
    Thus the Allies had at their  disposal over 60 per cent, of. the world&apos;s shipping,  whilst.afurther 20 per cent, was under Neutral flags.    31   In addition there is gradually being impressed into service, with the progress of the warand the breach of relations  between countries hitherto neutral and the Central Powers,  a  con-fiiderable proportion of enemy shipping laid up in Allied and Neutral ports.  Although preciseinformation is not  available it is  probable that over one-half  of  the  total enemy shipping, orabout two million tons net, was not able to reach enemy ports at the outbreak of war.  Ihe basisof this estimate is given below : -  -  (l\ According  to Lloyd&apos;s  Register of  Shipping,  the steam tonnage owned by the  enemycountries on June 30th,  1914, was  as follows:                                                                   Tons Net.

On the other hand, a certain, though small, amount of British and Allied Shipping wasin enemy ports  at  the  outbreak of  war and a further amount was immobilised  for the  timebeing in the Baltic or Black Sea.    33.  The  withdrawal  from the- world&apos;s carrying trade of the greater part  of  the  enemymercantile marines as well as of such Allied Shipping as found itself in enemy ports or in theBaltio-or Black  Sea at  the outbreak  of war would not have sufficed to  bring about  the  serioustonnage stringency subsequently experienced.  For  it must be remembered that the  demandsmade on tonnage by the enemy countries were much reduced, whilst better use was made of theactual carrying capacity of the  merchant shipping available&apos;.  Three principal causes lay at theroot of the tonnage difficulty, with each of which we deal in turn below      . (1) The withdrawal, for direct or auxiliary War Services, of a large proportion of Allied             Shipping;       (2) The enemy&apos;s  War on Merchant Shipping; and       (3) The failure of this country to realise the situation and meet it by the full development             of  its shipbuilding resources.                          The Withdrawal of Shipping from Trade.    34.  Heavy demands  have  been  made on Allied Merchant Shipping, and especially on theBritish Mercantile Marine, for the1 provision of auxiliary vessels for the Allied Navies, whethercruisers, patrol  vessels, mine sweepers or  supply ships.  It has, moreover, been necessary tomaintain  vast oversea  expeditions, with the enormous equipment of modern war,  in  France,Gallipoli, Macedonia, Egypt, Mesopotamia  and East  and West Africa, whilst ensuring adequate-supplies of all kinds for the United  Kingdom and  the other Allied countries.   It is  difficulteven  now to appreciate the magnitude of this achievement, which would have been impossible1but for the size and efficiency of the British Mercantile Marine.  But the strain has been severe;only about one-half our shipping has been available for the provisioning of this country and forour oversea trade, and our dependence on Neutral shipping increased up to the end of 1916.    The following figures of the net tonnage of vessels which entered and cleared with cargoesand in ballast at the ports of the United Kingdom show that whilst the relative proportion ofBritish tonnage declined and that of Allied tonnage remained  steady, the proportion of Neutraltonnage increased from 28 per cent, to 38 per cent, between 1914 and 1916 :  Flag.	1913	1914	1915	1916 1	1913	1914	1915	1916British tAllied ......

The enemy&apos;s war on merchant shipping has been marked by three distinct phases.  Thefirst was that lasting till the opening of the first submarine campaign in February, 1915.  Itwas characterised by reliance primarily on commerce destruction by cruisers on the trade routes,and it virtually came to an end in December,  1914, with the sinking of most of these cruisers.The damage caused was comparatively trifling, our total war losses up to the end of 1914 havingamounted to  only about 150,000 tons net.    37.  The second phase of the  war on shipping opened after  the failure  of the  enemy&apos;scruisers  to interrupt seriously the trade of  the Allies.   It  may  be said to have  continuedthroughout 1915 and 1916 with increasing intensity towards its close, and it effected the destruc-tion of some  T3 million tons of British shipping in those years.  This phase was  characterisedby the gradual  development of the submarine into a vessel which could operate on the traderoutes, and it foreshadowed  the final decision of the enemy to risk the entry of the United Statesand other  countries into the war  against him in a supreme effort to destroy  the  Allies&apos; seacommunications.    38.  The third period began in February, 1917.  From that date the war on  shipping wasprosecuted with complete ruthlessness and with alarming success.   The enemy seized on thetwo chief weaknesses in the Allied position: (1) dependence on a  limited number  of ocean-going vessels (at the close of  1916 there were  on the register of the  United  Kingdom  only3,475 steamers* of and above 1,000 tons net,&quot; of which probably not&apos;more than one-half wereavailable for the supply of the Allied countries);  and (2) dependence in large measure  onNeutral Shipping.    39.  Up to the end of August, 1917, we had lost from the beginning  of the year over 600of the larger vessels, and the rate of loss per month since February has averaged about 80 largevessels.  The tonnage lost in the eight months was, therefore, about T7 million  tons net.  Ifthe average monthly losses  remain at about 80 large vessels, it would be necessary  to contem-plate  the annual loss of about 2&quot;7 million tons  net of shipping,  or 27 per cent, of  our ocean-going tonnage  as it existed at the beginning of the year 1917.  It will thus be seen that theNew Submarine  Campaign  has succeeded in multiplying fourfold  the  rate of loss previous &quot;toits inception.    40.  The1 three phases  of  the  enemy&apos;s attack on shipping had thus resulted in  a loss  ofover 3 million  tons net of British  tonnage.  The amount of- Allied Shipping destroyed in thesame period may be estimated at over 1 million tons.    41.. The effects1 of the enemy&apos;s attack on shipping  cannot,  however, be determined  fromthe point of view  solely of the  losses inflicted  on British  and Allied tonnage.  In order  toachieve his aim of destroying the sea communications of the Allies, the enemy was obliged toundertake  a no  less ruthless attack on neutral shipping,  in order, by a policy of  intimidation,Of 9,910,000 tons net.15698B2 V During 1917 the position lias greatly changed, Neutral shipping having largely disappearedfrom the United Kingdom trade on account of the enemy&apos;s unrestricted submarine campaign, asthe following figures show :  Statem-nt showing the proportion of British and Foreign Vessels which entered with cargoes in the  *  Foreign trade at ports of the  United Kingdom daring the years 1915 and 191b and in each month    of 1917 from January to September.
 to prevent neutrals from trading for the benefit of the countries at war with him.  The losses of neutrals since  the outbreak  of war have probably exceeded  one million  tons net, of which over 50  per  cent, was destroyed since  the  beginning of 1917.   Up to the end  of  August last, Norway appears to have lost nearly one-half of the tonnage she possessed at the beginning of the  war.     42.   The enemy has, therefore, been  responsible for the  loss since the beginning of the war up to the end of August,  1917, of over 5 million tons net, or about 20 per cent., of the world&apos;s  shipping.   To this  extent  he has impaired  the world&apos;s  carrying  power, and he has reduced  proportionately the ability of the  whole world to recover from the devastating effects of the present conflagration.                               Shipbuilding during  the  War.     43.   It  is easy to see,  in  the  light of war experience, that  the unrivalled  shipbuilding resources of  this country should at the outset have been developed to the utmost limit of their capacity.  Had this been done, not  only  would  the  tonnage  situation have been  materially relieved,  but we should have been  able to view the  enemy&apos;s efforts with greater equanimity. As it was, the enormous demands made on the resources of this country in respect of men, guns, munitions and ships of war have caused the needs of the mercantile marine to  be  neglected to such an  extent that the tonnage of merchant vessels launched.in the United Kingdom declined from over one million tons net in  1914, which was almost a normal year,  to 430,000 tons net in 1915,  and to 340,000 tons net in 1916 virtually the lowest point reached in half a century.* We  were thus deprived of about 1\ million tons net of shipping at the time  of  our greatest need.  The  efforts  made during 1917 will not succeed in producing more than about twice the amount produced  in 1916 an output utterly insufficient in view of war losses.     44.   We Caniiot but regret a sacrifice fraught with such grave consequences to our position as an Island Power.t   In  war the Mercantile  Marine and  the  Fighting  Navy  are eomple- mentary, and provision ought to be made  for the maintenance of both, whether in respect of men or in respect of steel, no matter how great the demand for other purposes.   We are aware that steps have  been taken to increase the  output of British yards,  but those stejis are, in our opinion, still inadequate to meet the needs  of the situation.  We see little prospect of the rate of output in  this country even approximating in the near future to the current rate of war losses, apart altogether from the normal replacements for which  some provision  ought to  be made; and, as a result,  we view the future maritime position of this country with the gravest misgiving.     45.   We have not  been  able to obtain  detailed information with regard to  the progress of shipbuilding abroad.  It is  probable, however, that the decline which took place on the out- break of war has now been more than compensated by the efforts notably of  the United States, Japan and  also  Holland.  In  the  years  1911-1913 the  output of countries, other than the United Kingdom and the enemy countries and the tonnage built on the North American Lakes, averaged  annually about 420,000 tons net.  The  output in 1914 was normal,  but  in 1915 it declined to  some 330,000  tons.   The  output appears to have risen  again  in 1916, and if the estimates are realised,  the normal will be considerably exceeded in 1917,  though  not by an amount sufficient to counterbalance war losses.   There seems, however, good reason to believe that in 1918  the oxitput of tonnage in American yards may exceed that of this country, and tothat extent further compromise our position as the Shipbuilders  and the Carriers  of the World.                                       Other Factors.     46.   Other factors have contributed to the general decline of our mercantile marine.  They are  of considerable importance  though  perhaps less fundamental than the  factors  considered above.  We deal shortly with these below.     47.   Repairs. Great  difficiilty has been  experienced as  a result of war conditions,  in securing  timely repairs and  overhauls  for  British vessels.  In many instances surveys andrepairs have been  neglected for long  perious. with  the consequences  inseparable from  such neglect.   These consequences, which would be serious under  normal conditions, have been aggravated as a  result of the hard usage to which shipping has been subjected during the war. Whilst unable to  form any  estimate of the probable effect of this  factor on the position, we are  bound to point out that an appreciable part of our tonnage will be laid up for deferred repairs at the end of the war.     48.   Restriction of Transfer. Owing to the tonnage stringency and the necessity of retain- ing under British Control  as many ships as possible, the building  of ships in British yards for foreigners and the  sales of  vessels to foreign  flags have been virtually suspended since the outbreak  of  war.   By virtue of the British&quot; Ships Transfer Restriction Acts, the transfer  of    * Between 18G8 and 1916.  The lowest point actually reached in this period was in 1886 when the output oftonnage in the United Kingdom declined to 332,000 tons.    f We print  in Appendix C. a statement showing  the growth of the British  Mercantile Marine during theNapoleonic Wars and after.  The destruct-on wrought by French Privateers after the Battle off Trafalgar is notorious.Yet during the wars our merchant tonnage increased by about 40 per cent.
 vessels to  foreign flags cannot be  effected except by licence of the Board of Trade, and such licence, we understand, is only given in rare and exceptional circumstances.  The results may be summarised under  three  heads:  (a) an important source of tonnage has  been closed to foreign  countries, which have felt with additional severity the effects of the enemy&apos;s war on shipping;  (6)  foreign countries have received an additional stimulus to develop shipbuilding resources of their own; whilst (c) the general  efficiency of the British  mercantile marine has suffered through the retention on the  Register  of tonnage which  would&apos; ordinarily have been replaced;     49.  Type of  New Tonnage. In  view  of the heavy demand for  tonnage,  it has Been decided to  concentrate for a time on  quantity  of  output; and there is little  doubt that the tonnage produced recently in British  yards has not maintained the same proportion  of high class vessels as obtained before the war.  We fear that much of the tonnage on our Register at the  end of  the war may be found inefficient from the  point of view of international corn- petition and will have to  be replaced by better class vessels and above  all by vessels of types more suited to particular  trades.     50.  Requisition. Ships actually  requisitioned  by the Government for war purposes have in many cases been rendered unsuitable for the trades in  which they were formerly engaged. They have suffered  severely as a result  of particularly hard  usage sustained in the course of their war employment, and in many cases valuable fittings have been sacrificed.  Before these vessels can resume their former trades they will have to undergo extensive repairs and altera--tions; and  a considerable time will elapse  before they are again available  for the Empire&apos;s carrying trade.                              Loss of Trade During the War.     51.  The  growing shortage of tonnage resulting from the foregoing factors has produced the most serious consequences on  our carrying trade all over the world, and more  particularly on the Eastern trades.  Vessels  of a high class built for  specialised trades have been  lost or utilised for other purposes, and it has  been necessary to withdraw  ships in increasing numbers from the more distant trades and to concentrate them on the trades nearer home in order that the populations of  the Allied  countries might continue  to  be  fed and that  raw  materials,; whether for warlike or industrial purposes, might be supplied for their use.     52.  The following illustrations, which are by no means exceptional, show how the  position of  individual  companies  has been affected.  Three  of the best known Companies  have  lost respectively  160,000, 124.000 and  62,000 tons gross, including a large number of high class passenger and  cargo  liners which it will not be easy to replace.   Other Companies have lost from one-third to  over one-half of their pre-war fleets.  Many anticipate serious competition, especially in the West Indian and Central and South American trades from tbe United States, and are apprehensive that it may be difficult, if not impossible, to recover their position.   A Company trading to America, Africa and the East has lost nearly 100,000 tons of shipping and anticipates  Teat difficulty in recovering its  trade  owing to foreign competition.  In certain cases vessels built for highly specialised purposes  have been lost, particularly those with  refrigerated space for tbe Meat and Fruit trades.   On all sides  we have received  evidence of services  greatly reduced  or even abandoned altogether.   These illustrations  could be multiplied indefinitely..  .    53.  The stress  of  war has been felt with  extreme severity  by Companies trading to the East, where the withdrawal of shipping for the Atlantic trades has led to the encroachment of the Japanese Lines.  One Company  trading to China and Japan states that its sailings have been  reduced from five to one per month and fears serious difficulty after the war owing to Japanese competition.  The services of  another Company  have been reduced by two-thirds. The fleet of yet another Company,  comprising specially built cargo liners, has been so depleted that the resumption of its fortnightly  service to the East would be impossible.   In the case of another  Company, loss of tonnage and the necessity of deviation via the Cape haAre reduced sailings by 60 per cent.  A very important firm anticipate the greatest difficulty in  the resump- tion of trades  carried on for  over half a century which they fear will  have  to be abandoned or reduced  drastically through lack of tonnage.   Only one firm, who appear to have been morefortunate than  their neighbours in securing  new tonnage, do not anticipate serious difficulties in the future,  but even here  there is apprehension as to Japanese competition.  Here,  again, instances could be multiplied indefinitely; they  illustrate the inevitable consequences of with- drawing high class vessels from long established trades for which  those vessels were speciallybuilt, and  the  danger of thus leaving the door open to foreign enterprise  which it may bedifficult hereafter to combat with success.    54.  Similar conditions  apply to the Companies which trade in home waters, where  theincreased competition of Dutch and Scandinavian vessels is already in  evidence.    55.  We shall have occasion in the Second Part of  this Report to refer again to  theposition of  the  carrying trade in view of the above facts.  They cannot be altogether  neglectedhere because of their  important bearing on the more immediate problems of reconstruction, tuthe solution of which our  shipbuilding activity  should be directed after the war  in the bestinterests of the Nation.  In this connexion  we desire to call attention  to a Memorandum on &quot;Liner Services, War  Wastage  and Replacement&apos;&apos;  which has been  presented  to us  by theLiverpool Steamship Owners&apos; Association and is printed as Appendix B to this Report.
                            Control of Shipping during the War. -     56.  Finally a factor, full of grave possibilities, lias been introduced into&apos;^&quot;situation alreadysufficiently  complex.   The pivotal position of shipping during the war and the great rise infreights  consequent on the tonnage stringency have been put forward as the  reason for thecomplete control of British Shipping by the Government.  A measure of control was undoubtedlynecessary in the  circumstances  brought  about by the war, but it is  well to realise that suchcontrol has  involved the abandonment of that freedom and elasticity which are the essence ofenterprise.     57.  Moreover, the necessity  of financing the  war has subjected British Shipping alongwith other industries to heavy financial  burdens from which its neutral competitors have beenimmune; and neutral shipowners have thus been enabled to amass enormous profits which willenable them after the war to build and run  their ships in severe comrjetition with ourselves.Latterly, the position of the British shipowner has been further  prejudiced by the general systemof  control instituted in the  shape of operation on  Government account,  whilst,  under theFinance  Act of 1917, his liabilities for excess profits duty have been made more onerous thanthose of any other trader.     58.  There is one direction  in particular in which the policy  of the Government is alreadyproducing consequences that appear to us full of danger.  A number of important tramp ownersare disposing  of their tonnage to liner companies, since the former inducement  to retain theirinvestment in  shipping no longer  exists.  While a  liner company cannot go out  of  businesswithout sacrificing  the goodwill of services built up over a lorg  period of years, no such  eon-sideration applies in the case of the tramp owner.   A considerable part of his investment inshipping has  probably already been liquidated by war losses; there  is no inducement in thepresent rates of hire  paid  by the Government to retain  what is  left if an attractive price isoffered; and he is,  moreover,  uncertain as  to the use or disposal  of Government owned vesselsafter the war.  The liner company, as it cannot build, may be compelled to buy  tramp tonnagein order to have steamers of some sort to  carry on its services after the war.  The tramp owner,however, will not re-invest his money  in shipping property until he believes that he  will geta return  commensurate with the risks of the business.  The  confidence which is necessary topromote this belief is now unfortunately lacking,  and there is, therefore, grave danger that,unless  present  conditions are  radically transformed, many owners may  go out of business.  Alarge consequent  shrinkage in the tonnage at the countiVs disposal would thus occur; whilstthe nation would suffer the loss of the knowledge acquired by the^e men as  a result of manyyears of experiment and experience.    59.  We regard this whole  question of control  as fundamental and vital, and as far  out-weighing in importance any  other single question affecting Shipping  after the war.  We dealwith it fully in paragraphs 70-75 below.               SECTION   III.--THE  POSITION  AFTER  THE  WAR,     60.  Whilst the shortcomings of other important industries have attracted a good  deal ofattention,  the  great  preponderance and high  efficiency  of  our Shipping and  Shipbuildingindustries  have passed almost unnoticed.   Till  recently the needs  of  the mercantile  marinewere neglected; and no effort was made either to  maintain its  pre-war standard or to make goodthe continually growing losses caused  by the enemy, who from the  first realised the vital -im-portance of merchant shipping to the Allies.   Yet the British  Mercantile Marine  has beenthe pivot of Allied resistance throughout the war: it has enabled&apos;us not only to carry on the-.struggle, but gradually to  mobilise the world&apos;s  resources against the Central  Powers surelya great achievement for private enterprise.     61.  The grave situation which has now resulted the outcome of factors already  described needs the most careful handling if the worst consequences  are to be averted.  There is awidespread fear in the Shipping and  Shipbuilding industries that victory  in the war may befollowed by the maritime decline  of  this&quot; country, unless steps  are taken at  once to  restoreconfidence  among Shipowners.  Before considering the  measures  that should, in our opinion,be adopted, it may be desirable to summarise, so far as this  is possible, the position likely toobtain at the end of the war.     62.  To frame any estimate of the probable  position of British Shipping in  relation tothe workl&apos;s shipping is a matter of great  difficulty, in  view  of the  uncertainty, still affectingvital., factors which it would be necessary to take into account, such  as the  duration of the waritself,  the  future progress of  the enemy&apos;s  submarine campaign, and of our counter measures,and  the success of Shipbuilding efforts  here and  elsewhere.  As regards the duration of thewar, it is possible only to take specific dates in the future, e.g., the end of 1917 or 1918, andto base an estimate on the  hypothesis that,the war will be  over at some  time  between thosedates., The uncertainty affecting the other factors makes it sufficiently  difficult  to base  anestimate on the end of 1918:  to  go beyond 1918 would  be  impossible.  In Appendix A weprint van estimate of the probable position at the  end of  1917  and  1918 of the world&apos;s shippingand  also of British Shipping.   In  many  respects  such an estimate must  be  guess work;  but wela&amp;vs&apos; endeavoured to make it as reasonable as possible.
     63.  Despite all the existing restriction  on building, for foreign owners, and on transfersfrom the British Register, and despite the addition to our Register of a considerable amountof enemy and other tonnage, the Mercantile Marine of the. United Kingdom will  have declinedby the end of the year 1917 by nearly 2 million tons net j or about 17 per cent.  The world&apos;sshipping as a whole will probably have declined by about b\ million tons net.     64.  Figures of tonnage actually lost represent, however, only one, though  probably, themost important aspect of the  matter.  Not all the  world&apos;s shipping is ocean-going, and thesum total of &quot;the &quot;world&apos;s available tonnage cannot be relied upon for the world&apos;s trade as awhole.   It is an unfortunate fact that the destructive efforts of the enemy have fallen withgreat severity oh vessels  of 1,000 tons net and upwards, and that the  position  as regards theworld&apos;s trade is in reality far more serious  than  is indicated  even by the  foregoing figures.It is improbable that more than about 80  per  cent, of the  world&apos;s steam tonnage as a  whole(90 per cent,  in the  case of the United Kingdom) was ocean-going-or some 21 million tonsnet in all.   If, as is the case, the worldss ocean tonnage has sustained practically the wholeof the ioss indicated, then it is  necessary  to deduct the 5J million tons not from 26 millionbut from only 21 million tons net available for the world&apos;s trade at the outbreak of war.  -     65.  Further, it cannot be assumed that during the years that the war has been in progressthe world&apos;s tonnage  would have remained  stationary at 26 million tons net.  On the  contrary,at the normal rate of expansion, it wrould have amounted to at least  30 million tons  net bythe end of 1917 and to 31 million tons net by the end of 1918.  Tke expansion in progress  beforethe war was due to the growing needs of the world&apos;s trade, and it is not possible, therefore, toassume that the amount of tonnage which would have sufficed in 1914 would still be adequate in1917  or 1918.     It is probable that the demand on tonnage may be greater immediately after the  war thanit would have been  had  there been no war.   The exigencies of war  demands have  virtuallybrought about an industrial revolution in the  United Kingdom, and to a certain extent in othercountries; the United States have developed  a  large export trade which  is not  likely to ceasealtogether with the close of hostilities; the demand for foodstuffs and raw materials to  replenishstocks in all the belligerent countries will be very great; the needs of the devastated districts, sofar as they are not inade  good from enemy resources, will require the transport across the seas oflarge quantities of materials; and, finally, the repairs and renewals necessary for the railways andindustries of  the belligerent countries  which have been reduced to a minimum during the war,will  undoubtedly entail  great industrial activity for some time after the war.   To meet these.enormous demands theTe will certainly be  available less  than 20 million tons of shipping, ofwhich probably 75 per cent, only will be ocean-going, instead of the 30 million tons which mightin the normal course of development have been looked for: and of the available shipping a largeproportion  will be engaged for a considerable time  in the homeward  transportation  of  troopsand  stores of all kinds.     66.  In the case of certain foreign countries, anxious to develop their merchant fleets, theevils  of the tonnage  situation have not been unmixed.  Neutral shipowners, who have not beensubject to the restrictions imposed on British  shipowners, have been able to amass large  profitswhich will enable them  to engage in severe competition with the latter after the war.   Therelias been great shipbuilding activity in foreign  countries, notably in the United  States,  Japanand  Holland.  Japanese  encroachment in our  Eastern trades is already serious and will becomemore serious.  Competition of the most  formidable character  is to  be anticipated  from theUnited States, where marine enterprise has received  a great stimulus  during the  war  from theacute tonnage stringency prevalent throughout the world and from orders on a large scale  placedin American yards by foreign countries and not least by this country.     67.  The result  of the factors described above will be that the lead of this country  in theworld&apos;s carrying trade will, by  the end of the war, have been diminished, if not lost; and  unlessBritish shipping is enabled at  the outset of the Reconstruction  period  to take full advantage.of the new situation,  it may fall behind in the competitive race and definitely lose the asceivd-ency which lias been  the  keystone oi the Empire and a condition of our industrial existence.     68.  For these reasons we cannot agree  with those  who hold that in the Reconstructionperiod the interests of shipping must be subordinated to those of industry on the ground  that astrong industrial position has been the basis in large measure of our maritime strength. Thelatter proposition we do not challenge; in fact, in the second part of this Report,  we emphasiseits importance from  the  standpoint of a permanent commercial policy.   But conditions  at theend of the war will be wholly abnormal.  Our  industrial position will be  potentially very strong,whereas we shall be  left with  a mercantile marine quite inadequate to meet our needs or torecover its former share of the world&apos;s  carrying trade. It will be necessary to make the restora-tion  of the mercantile marine the first charge  on the national resources unless our industry andour export trade are to be seriously crippled,  and we are  to suffer the consequences that  wouldattend our decline to the level of a second-rate  maritime power.    69.  It is on considerations such as these that our recommendations for the reconstructionof the Mercantile  Marine are  based.    We  cannot  insist too  strongly on the  overwhelmingimportance of this  problem, which,  in our  opinion, far transcends every  other problem  ofReconstruction.
                 .   SECTION  IV.-GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS.                                  The Control of Shipping.     70-:   The first and fundamental condition  of  Reconstruction is  the early  removal from Shipping of Government operation and control.  Such control is not only alien  to the British genius but always tends to paralyse individual effort.  Especially  is this so in an industry like Shipping which is  everywhere exposed to international competition  and depends for success on elasticity  and freedom from restrictions.  Private enterprise,  which has  often  saved  the country  in the past, built up the splendid mercantile marine without which this  war could not have been carried on; and it is our conviction that any  departure from a principle which  has been of such material value to us, would be a dangerous experiment and a blunder of the worst kind.     71.   We believe that the continuance of Government operation  and control is bound to extinguish private enterprise and  lead  to State ownership.  It is inconceivable  that if  State ownership be substituted for private  enterprise, the State should continue the carrying trade between  one foreign country and another.  It would inevitably have  to confine its activities to regular services between different parts of the Empire and between the Empire and foreign countries; and the world&apos;s carrying trade in a wider sense, especially as typified  by the world- wide operations of the tramp steamer, which  has formed  an integral part, if not  the  backbone,. of British marine enterprise, would  be  lost  to this country.     72.   We  are far from suggesting that there should not be  some means  of  adjusting differences between  shippers  and  shipowners when these differences touch vital questions  of national policy.  Such an arrangement,  which would be quite distinct from Government control in any form, would  be advantageous to  all concerned/&quot;&quot; but a condition of its success would  be the  recognition  that there  exists competition  of services as well as of commodities, and that success: in the former may be just as important to the nation as success in the latter.     73.   The foregoing considerations have a most  important bearing on the position likely to arise immediately on the conclusion of peace.  There will be  a  world-wide shortage of tonnage, and the  difficulties under such conditions will be very great.   On the other hand, commercial and maritime influence  will be in  a state of fluidity; and that country will  emerge strongest from the reconstruction period which has been able to make  the deepest impress on trade con- ditions not  yet  crystallised.  It is improbable that We shall at the end of the  war maintain the lead  in merchant shipping that we had at the beginning.  The  United States of America, formerly a great maritime nation,  may  possess a mercantile marine as great as, if not greater, than our own; whilst in the East Japan is  making considerable  progress.   It   is  not  right that we should disguise our apprehensions on this subject.  The prospect, after our unparalleled exertions, is deplorable; but it need not cause dismayso long as the hands of British shipowners are: not tied in competition with other flags.  .     74.   It is essential that British shipping  should- be enabled to  take full financial advantage of the period of trade activity which will certainly  follow the conclusion of peace, and should not be set free only when the inevitable depression has set in and made trade impossible save at a loss.   In the latter case we fear that British shipping would not recover its old  ascendency over other flags.    75.  Our recommendations on this subject are as follows :        (1)  The release  of privately-owned shipping  from Government operation   and  control            should take place when the war comes to  an  end; vessels still required for Govern-            ment purposes of any kind should be chartered either  at market rates or  at agreed            rates, based on market conditions.       (2)-Any advantage enjoyed by foreign shipowners as regards rates should cease  when the            war comes to an end,  if  not earlier; and  every effort  should be  made by the            Government to see that, so far as possible, British Shipowners are not placed at a            disadvantage with  their foreign  competitors in this respect..      (3).;Since large sums will be  necessary for the restoration of  the Mercantile  Marine,            the shipping industry should, for  the remainder of the war, be placed on the            same footing  as regards profits  and financial  control as other  industries, and            special  provisions with regard to Shipping, such as those contained in the Finance            Act of  1917, should be repealed.       (4) Immediate steps should be taken to bring the rates of hire paid by the Government            to  British  Shipowners up  to a  level which  will  ensure  a reasonable return  on            vessels  built at present prices.   For example, it  is essential that the tramp owner            should  be in a position to obtain as good a return by retaining his investment            in  shipping as by selling out and investing  in Government Securities.       (5) The  Standard  Ships  built by  the Government  during  the war  and any  other            merchant vessels owned by  the State should be sold under conditions of open  corn-            petition to British Shipowners as they cease  to be required for direct Government            Services arising out of the war.* This question is more germane to the Second Part of this Kepcrt, where it is fully considered.  (See pars.   .)
                        The Release of Shipping from War Service.    76.  The- release of shipping from  Government control may be materially facilitated bya wise policy in regard to  demobilisation.   It  is difficult to do more than outline the broadprinciples which should govern this policy:        (I) The release of shipping from war service should be  rapid but also economical.  It             is of the utmost  importance that as large a proportion as possible  of  the  wOrld&apos;s             shipping engaged in trade should be under the British flag  at an early date after             the war.      (2) To  hasten  the process, Government-owned ships, including enemy ships,  or even             chartered  Neutral ships,  should, wherever possible, be substituted for privately-             owned British tonnage1 in the conveyance of troops,  stores  and so forth.   Alter-             natively, Government-owned vessels should  be chartered or sold to British  Ship-             owners whose vessels cannot be released.      (3) In view of the severe depletion of high-class tonnage, vessels  of the  greatest value             to trade should, so far as possible, be released first.                            The Surrender of Enemy Shipping.    77.  In a memorandum, dated November 8th,  1916, on the position of the Shipping andShipbuilding Industries during the period of Economic Reconstruction, this Committee  deemedit essential that war  losses must be niade  good  from  the Merchant Fleets of  the Enemy, andthat this must be made a condition of peace a policy clearly contemplated in Resolution B (I)of the Paris  Economic Conference.  We see no reason to modify in any way this conclusion,which has, on the contrary,  been reinforced by subsequent events and is supported  by theunanimous opinion of the  industries we represent.  We  would go further, and insist that nopeace would   be  satisfactory  which did not enforce this condition  and inflict  drastic andexemplary punishment for  the  enemy&apos;s crimes at sea.    78.  The post-war aspect  of the  enemy&apos;s attack on Merchant Shipping cannot be over-looked,  since the crippling of  the world&apos;s power of  transportation must impede Reconstructionfor all countries alike.&quot;  If, under such circumstances, the enemy  were  allowed to retain hisships, his submarine warfare, whatever its  effect on the war, would have achieved an importantpost-war aim, by giving the enemy countries a great advantage over other countries, includingourselves, in  the provision  of tonnage  for the needs of Reconstruction.    79.  It is therefore, in our  opinion, absolutely essential that the enemy countries shouldbe required,  as  a condition of peace,  to surrender  to the Allies  all their merchant shipping,whether in enemy ports at the close of  hostilities or in ports of countries still neutral; to forfeitall ships laid up since the outbreak of hostilities in ports of countries that have become involvedin war or have broken off diplomatic relations with them; and to  restore to  the Allies allAllied shipping that  may have come into  their possession since the outbreak  of hostilities.    80.  We  recommend further,  that  shipping taken over  in this manner  from the enemyshould be utilised, so far  as possible, to assist the general process of demobilisation,  and torelease for purposes of trade a proportion of the Allied Shipping absorbed in transport work.This is a bare measure of  justice to those countries which have devoted a great part of theirMaritime resources to the prosecution of the  common struggle oversea.  AVhen Allied Shippingcannot for any reason be released, the shipowners concerned should be given the opportunityof chartering at the equivalent of market rates  enemy tonnage which would temporarilyreplace their own.    81.  As  and when demobilisation  is completed, all enemy  vessels not already  sold shouldbe sold by auction in the various countries.  The proceeds of the sales  should be treated as partof the common war indemnity paid by the enemy  countries and should  not be  retained byindividual Allied  countries.  Money so  realised should be used, in common  with  other sumsrealised from the enemy, for meeting Allied claims in  general in accordance with their urgencyor the priority agreed upon by the Allied Governments.    82.  We  attach  less importance  to the actual distribiition of  enemy tonnage among theAllies than to its removal  from  the enemy; and we should view with regret  any inter-Alliedjealousies on this subject which might impede the execution of measures so vital to all of them.We doubt for instance whether it would  be possible  in all cases  to induce those countries whichhave made use of interned enemy tonnage during the war to forego their rights  to such tonnage;and the utmost  that  could be achieved would probably be to take account of tonnage  so heldin any allocation of further amounts of tonnage seized from the enemy.  Subject to this reserva-tion, a scheme of distribution which would secure the allocation of enemy tonnage among thedifferent Allied flags in some rough proportion to the losses sustained by them would offer manyadvantages.   If, however,  this  course should not prove practicable, we think that the enemyvessels should be sold by auction in the various countries to the  highest bidder, so long as he isof Allied nationality and is able to furnish satisfactory proof that he is  acting on behalf ofAllied interests.    83.  Neutrals and  enemies should not be admitted to purchase; and some  condition shouldbe attached to the sales to  prevent the retransfer of vessels to  enemy interests  or to interests   J56,;8                                                                               U
  controlled by tbe enemy for such period as restrictions may be imposed on enemy ships, shipping  and trade in general.  After the expiration of this period we see no reason why vessels formerly  under the enemy flags should be treated differently from other vessels as regards transfer to other  flags.   It is no more objectionable that a former  German vessel should  be  resold to  German  owners  than that a British or French vessel should be transferred to the German flag.  We deal  with the question o: Transfer to foreign flags in a subsequent section of this  Report.     84.   It will be seen that we have not recommended any special allocation of enemy tonnage  to individual British owners whose vessels have been destroj^ed by the enemy.   We are convinced  that any attempt so to distribute a quota assigned to a particular flag would present insuperable  difficulties.   Vessels lost have been insured and the owners have therefore received some conipen-  sation for their loss, even if inadequate to defray the cost of building at  enhanced prices.  In  other  cases owners  may have secured new tonnage and  may not desire to  utilise German ships which are perhaps unsuitable for their trades.     85.   Naturally the  foregoing recommendations are conditional on the attainment of com- plete victory in the war.   But the seizure of enemy shipping is, in our view, just as vital to this country as is the recovery of Alsace-Lorraine to France.  For,  if after the  war we are faced with German marine competition as  well as with the intense competition of other countries, the restoration of our maritime position,  which will in any  circumstance be  difficult, may prove impossible.                                Shipbuilding after  the  War.     86.   The actual reconstruction  of the  mercantile  marine must ceteris paribus  depend ultimately on the efforts of our own shipyards  and  engine shops.   As the  efficiency of  our mercantile marine has greatly deterioriated during the war for the reasons already set out, the process of reconstruction cannot be unduly prolonged without risk of disaster.  It  is therefore essential that we should be prepared immediately on the conclusion of peace  to complete annually not less than 2 million tons net of merchant shipping.     87.   For the  purposes of this  shipbuilding programme it  is  most  important that the requisite preliminary measures should be taken not when the war comes to an end, but imme- diately.   We indicate their nature below and we recommend that steps be taken at once to devise the necessary machinery :         (1)  It  should be arranged that yards engaged on Admiralty  work should be in a position              to  resume merchant work immediately the war is over;       (2)  Skilled workers drawn from the shipbuilding and  marine engineering industries for              military, naval or  auxiliary  purposes  should  be  returned to  the industries              immediately on the conclusion of peace; and       (3)  Shipbuilders  and  marine  engineers  must be  free to obtain the  supplies of  steel              required by paying the necessary price without being handicapped by any system             of  priority certificates.*     88.   In  connection with the  reconstruction of  the mercantile  marine it is most important to restore the high standard of pre-war efficiency; and attention will therefore have to he paid to quality at least as much as to actual volume of output.  For this reason  Government control over the construction of vessels should cease immediately the war ends and the initiative as to the type  of vessel to be built should be left to the shipowner in consultation with  the shipbuilder, t Only the shipowner  can determine the type of vessel that will suit  his trade, as on him lies the responsibility of making that trade remunerative.    89.  In particular we would call  urgent attention to the necessity of building vessels suitable for the liner  trades,  which, owing to their specialised character, are far less  easily replaced than general tramp vessels.  The  depletion of our  liner tonnage during  the  war  has been dispropor- tionately severe, and it will be literally impossible  to resume our great  carrying trade unless determined efforts are made immediately on  the conclusion of peace to  repair this wastage without  prejudice to the  actual quantity of output deemed necessary.  It  would be a mistake to make  mere volume of  output after  the war the  only consideration.  The  prosperity of the carrying trade has depended in large measure on quality and efciency, and nothing hut harm could ultimately result from the neglect of all factors but quantity.    90.  We attach so much weight to  the early provision of  high class  tonnage for the purpose of restoring our  carrying trade that  we strongly urge that even during the war some facilities should  be  afforded, as part of the  shipbuilding programme, for the  production of liner tonnage to the owner&apos;s own design, with such limitations with regard to  speed and passenger accommodation as may be necessary to ensure rapid output and large carrying  capacity.    Wbilst reluctant to hamper the difficult  task of the Administrative Departments by anvpositive recommendations  with regard to war policy,  however closely allied to post-war considera-tions, we would  suggest that these observations be  brought  to the  notice of the Ministry of&apos;- Shipping and the Admiralty.   * It is anticipated that when the war comes to an end, the steel required for all commercial purposes will beavailable because the present great demand for shells and other munitions of war will then cease.   f In this connexion we desire to call attention  to pars. 103-109 of our Interim Report on Shipbuilding andMarine Engineering.
     91.   We now pass to certain subsidiary but important questions which are closely bound up with other measures for the reconstruction of the Mercantile Marine.  These questions are as follows:         (1) The extent to which shipbuilding for foreign flags should be allowed in British yards             after the war;       (2) The extent to which it is advisable to allow the transfer of British vessels to foreign             flags afteT the war; and       (3) The policy which should be adopted with regard to the enemy countries on these1 two             questions.                                    The Foreign Market.                           (1) Shipbuilding for Foreign Owners.     92.   It has been suggested that in view of the enormous requirements of our own mercantile marine,  it may be advisable to continue in force for a period after the war the existing restric- tion on  the building in British yards of ships on foreign account.  There is  undoubtedly con- siderable apprehension among British shipowners that Neutral  owners may  after the war be in a position to outbid them in the placing of orders and  so frustrate their endeavours to secure the new tonnage essential to them. In response to an enquiry on the subject made by this committee, shipowners have1 expressed themselves with few  exceptions in favour  of restriction, the majority recommending that no ships should be built for  foreign  flags until the requirements of the British  mercantile  marine are  satisfied.   Many  suggest  a specific period  of restriction  of 2, 3, 5  or even 7 years  after the  war.  On the other hand many  shipowners recognised the necessity of considering the matter also  from the standpoint of the shipbuilding industry.     93.   Shipbuilders, from whom we received  evidence in connection with  our Interim Report on Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering,  were on the whole opposed to any Governmental restriction after the war on the building of ships for Allies  and Neutrals.  They feared that the only result would be to encourage foreign countries, such as the United States, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Holland to  set up yards of their own.*  Though time and labour were required for this purpose, experience tended to show that once a yard was set up, work was found to keep it occupied even at unremunerative rates.  Ultimately therefore the foreigner would undercut the British builder and  take  away work from  him.   It was pointed out  that the importance of the foreign connexion lay  not only  in securing the  ascendency of this country in shipbuilding and marine engineering, but even  more in providing a  valuable  source of revenue  in  times  of depression when orders from  British Shipowners were scarce.  In this  way  the British Ship- owner was assured of the maintenance  of the shipbuilding industry; and it was  moreover of great advantage to him that the turn-over of British 3^ards  should be as large as possible,  since only so could the class of work supplied be maintained at the highest level and at the lowest price.    94.  Nevertheless, there  was a  general feeling  among shipbuilders that  some  kind  of spontaneous priority should be given to British Shipowners in view of the heavy losses which they had suffered.  It  was thought that  such priority would in practice be  assured by the ultimate dependence of British Shipbuilding on British Shipping for the bulk of its trade.  So great was the interdependence of the two industries that in the long run the decline of British Shipping, would react with disastrous effect on British Shipbuilding.  Shipbuilders were generally of opinion that an amount of building on foreign  account  in excess of the  pre-war level of  20 to 25 per cent, would be unsatisfactory from their own point of view, but they were of opinion that it would in fact be found to fall short of this level.     95.  It will  be  seen  that there is  some divergence of view between shipowners  and  ship- builders on a matter of considerable importance to both industries.  We believe, however, that this divergence arises from a failure to realise that the interests  of the two  industries in this matter are really  identical and from a tendency,  natural  enough after three years of wholly artificial conditions, to treat the symptom  rather than to attack the root  cause of the disease.     96.  The magnitude  of our shipbuilding effort after the war has a very important bearing on this particular question.  If we are able, once warship construction has either ceased or fallen off considerably, to increase  materially the  output  of merchant tonnage  in this country  as compared with pre-war standards, it is evident that the use of a small  percentage of our resources for foreign building could not prejudice the reconstruction of our own mercantile marine.  Not only would  the British Shipbuilder benefit from the high  prices Neutrals will be prepared to pay, but the foreign shipowner will  again  look to British yards for new tonnage.  Moreover, so far from pursuing a purely  selfish policy,  we  should, whilst safeguarding  our own  require- ments, assist not only our Allies but also Nexitrals whose losses have in many cases been due directly  to their unwillingness to compound with the enemy.  We  cannot  help thinking that in this matter, the broader our policy,  the greater will be the ultimate benefit to this country. In the  period  of depression, perhaps of great severity, which  will almost certainly follow an outburst of  prosperity at the  end of the war, British shipbuilders will again welcome foreign orders, and  the maintenance of the  foreign connexion may once more be of inestimable benefit to the industry.   &apos;* Since this evidence was taken, the entry of the United States into the war has led to increased shipbuildingin that country.
     97.  We  do  not  believe  that foreign orders  need cause  alarm, so  long  as  there  issimultaneously a proportionate demand from British shipowners.   We are convinced that sucha demand will arise, if the shipping industry  is assured of  freedom from  Government Controlon the conclusion of peace.  Otherwise the natural demand for new tonnage on a large scalewill probably  be paralysed.  Of this we have had conclusive proof in the course of our investi-gations.  When taking evidence from Shipbuilders  and Marine Engineers  in  the Winter  of1916-17,  we were assured  that there were sufficient British orders to keep yards occupied for aperiod of from  two to three years after  the war,  the estimates being  of  course based on thejire-war  standard  of production.  We understand,  however,  that since  then  the increasedcontrol of shipping and the placing of Government orders for standard  ships have led to  graveuncertainty as to the future of the industry and to  the withholding of orders by British owners.The post-war market is thus left more open to foreign, and especially neutral, competition, which,we  understand,  is already causing embarrassment  to  British shipbuilders.  We  are convincedthat the  only  effective measure that can be taken to meet this danger is a  specific assurance  toboth industries as to the early removal of Government control after the  war.     98.  No restriction on the  building  of ships for foreign owners can  possibly  remedy theevil  consequences of a dearth of British orders, if such a dearth is due to the decay, temporaryor permanent, of British  marine enterprise, whether the result  of direct Government actionor of other  circumstances  connected with the  war.  On  the contrary, to prevent building forforeign flags under such conditions, would prejudice still  further our shipbuilding industry andensure its transference to other countries.  At a later date the restoration of British shippingwould be impeded by the absence of a sufficient shipbuilding industry  in this country.     99.  The  relative  importance of  foreign orders after the  war cannot be tested from thebusiness  of individual firms but must be determined from the business of the&apos; whole shipbuildingindustry of this country  in the aggregate.  In other words  the test  should be whether theproportion  of  tonnage under construction in the United  Kingdom as a whole that is intendedfor foreign  owners exceeds a proportion  deemed reasonable, and^not whether  the proportionbeing built  by an individual firm exceeds that ratio.  We have found  that certain firms havea large foreign connection, whereas others build  entirely for British shipowners.  It wouldtherefore be manifestly unfair to expect all shipyards without exception to  confine their foreignbuilding &quot;to-a standard recommended for adoption in the  aggregate; regard must be had  topre-war business and other special circumstances affecting each  individual  case.     100.  Although the relative position  of the British Mercantile Marine will undoubtedlybe determined in large measure,  as in the past, by the efficiency of its units, it does not followthat the interests of individual owners immediately after the  war may not best be served  insome cases  by the retention for a period of older vessels built at pre-war prices rather than bythe purchase of new tonnage built at  the high prices likely to  prevail for some time after thewar.  It is  impossible for  us to advise on this question  which must, in our opinion, be left  tothe discretion of the shipowner, who should be the best judge of his own  business. It would,however, be a mistake to  restrict building for foreign  flags if for the reason indicated  thereshould be any temporary lack of British orders.  Any tendency of this  kind is bound to adjiistitself in  the long run so long as shipping  remains as attractive an investment to British capitalas to foreign capital.     101.  The foregoing  observations have been based  in the  main on an assumed deficit  ofBritish orders.   We have however no reason to fear any  such deficit if the  restrictions onshipping are removed; and it is necessary, therefore, to  consider the possibility of an excess  ofBritish orders accompanied by severe competition for  foreign,  and especially  neutral, ship-cwners who  may be in a position to outbid the British owner owing to profits accumulated duringthe war, and  so to foi^ce up prices to his  detriment.     102.  It is possible that the expansion of our shipbuilding  resources may serve to meet allor most of the demands likely to be made on our yards, always allowing for  the usual practiceof &quot;booking&quot;  orders  which  cannot be executed  immediately.  In  that  case  the  normaldemands of the British Mercantile Marine, accentuated  as they would  be by the war wastagewhich has  fallen on it with exceptional severity, should serve  to maintain approximately theformer balance between British and foreign orders.   It  is true that prices may  be forced up,but it is difficult to see how State action, with its  attendant disadvantages, would prevent thiscontingency; and the competition of foreign yards, which have been much expanded during thewar,  would necessarily operate as a check on the undue inflation  of  prices in this  country.We therefore  deprecate any Government intervention in regard to prices.     103.  It  must on the other hand be recognised  that the  expansion of  the world&apos;s ship-building resources, including  our own, may not suffice to meet the demand for new tonnageduring the  period following immediately on  the  conclusion of  peace.  In that case,  if theBritish shipbuilder were so shortsighted as to make the price offered from any quarter the onlyconsideration  affecting his action, the proportion of tonnage  under construction  for  foreignaccount  might be  abnormally  high.  Shipbuilding  and Marine Engineering  witnesses  were,however, generally agreed that it was in  their own interest  to render all possible assistance  toBritish shipowners in the  restoration of their fleets by voluntarily giving them some measure  ofpriority in the execution of their orders, but that, if British orders were not sufficient to occupyall  the available slips,  there should be no obstacle  to executing  foreign  orders.   They  were,however, strongly of opinion that any priority accorded  by their industries to the British ship-owner should be granted voluntarily and in no circumstances as a result of Government action.
      104.  We are now able to state the conclusions we have reached on this subject:          (1) If the recommendations made in paragraph 75 with regard to release from control are.               carried out,  the demand  for new tonnage by British owners will be  relatively as               great as the demand by foreign owners.        (2) Subject to the same proviso, British shipping will retain its attraction as  an invest-               ment for British capital,  and such new capital will be attracted to the industry as               will be required  to supplement  the profits  and  insurance moneys which would               normally be reinvested.        (3) No restrictions on the  acceptance of  foreign orders should therefore be imposed by the               State on Shipbuilders and Marine Engineers, as such restrictions would be unneces-               sary and could only damage the  Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering  industries              without in the long run benefiting Shipowners.        (4) If at any time  when the demand for shipping is active it should be found that the              amount of  building for foreigners shows a tendency to rise, the deduction must be              that all is not well with the shipping industry.   The  root cause  of  the  disease              should then be discovered  and removed.      105.   We should, however, approve of any measures which the Government  may decide to  take for the purpose of safeguarding the position until the action we have recommended  in par. 75.  has had time to take effect.                  (2)  Sales of Vessels to  Foreign (other  than Enemy) Flags.      106.   It was seen* that the  transfer  of vessels from  the British Register to Foreign Flags  formed an important feature of our maritime development before the war and was  incidentally  an index  to the relative efficiency of the British merchant fleet as compared with those of other  countries.  To the individual shipowner there was thus secured a ready means  of  selling  vessels  no longer serviceable and of assisting the purchase of new vessels in this country.   We consider  it most important that the conditions underlying a process of such value to British Shipping and  shipbuilding should be restored as soon as possible after the war.   These  conditions of course  pre-suppose some kind of equilibrium between tonnage on the Register and the trade to be done,  which  allows the replacement of less efficient  by more efficient  vessels apart from  the  normal  replacement  and  expansion that  took  place in all merchant fleets before the  War.  In view,  however, of the grave  depletion of  tonnage that is still taking place, there is a general  feeling among shipowners that measures  may be necessary to secure the retention on the Register of all vessels under the British Flag.     107.   It is clear from an enquiry made by this Committee that the majority  of the Steam- ship Companies, with, however, a  few important exceptions, favour restrictions on the transfer of British vessels to  foreign flags, for  a period up to five  years after the end of the war.  It has, however,  been suggested that such  restrictions  should  not apply to vessels  more than 20 to 25 years old.  The recommendation of the Joint  Committee of the Chamber  of  Shipping of the United Kingdom and the Liverpool  Steamship  Owners&apos;  Association  on this subject  is as follows:             &quot; In view  of  the  war wastage to  which the  British Mercantile Marine has been       subjected, we are of  opinion that in the national interest the existing prohibition against       the transfer of British ships to foreigners should be continued for a fixed period, which       should not be less than five years after the termination of the war.&quot;     .108.   We have given  careful  attention to these  views but the following  considerations should  not be overlooked :        (1)  If there should be  such a shortage of tonnage as seems to be anticipated, it is most             improbable, at the high rates likely to rule and assuming that our recommendations             with regard to the removal  of Government control are carried into effect, that there             would be any  considerable  transfer of  vessels to foreign flags.   The  British ship-             owner would be anxious not only to retain all vessels actually in his possession  but             also to purchase more ships either at home or abroad.      (2)  If on the other hand the shortage of tonnage should be  less serious and it became clear             that British shipowners were disposing of their old vessels in orcler to secure vessels             more suitable to their trades,  it would be a grave mistake to place any  obstacle in             the way of a  movement so advantageous to the British Mercantile Marine.   It             would be an injustice to the shipbuilder and it would hamper the shipowner in  his             legitimate business.      (3)  If,  however, owing to irksome  restrictions  of  one kind or another, British  ship-             owners showed signs  of wishing to sell their  ships in order to go out of business,             it is  difficult to  see how such a process could be  arrested (and not  merely post-             poned), except by the removal of the restrictions.      (4)  The figures  of the  withdrawal  of  ships from the  British Register  by  sales  to             foreigners, taken together with the figures of additions to the Register,  are the            thermometer by  means of  which  the  health of the  Shipping industry can  be            tested.  If we have fears  for  the  health of the industry in  the future, it  seems            idle to  suppose that we can cure the disease by breaking the thermometer.    109.  By virtue of the  British Ships Transfer Restriction Acts, it will not be possible fora period of three years after the war to transfer any British ship to a foreign flag  without alicence.   Because of the strong views on  this subject  held by many^ Shipowners, we do notrecommend the repeal of this legislation,  especially as the fact of licensing will permit a careful                                   &apos; * See pars.- 25 and 26.                  ...
watch to be maintained over the process-of transfer.  We believe, however, that when the bulkof the privately-owned  British tonnage now employed  on direct Government service has beenreturned to the owners, it will be desirable to relax considerably the stringency  of the licensingsystem, with a view to  the establishment of free licensing as soon as possible.                       (3)  Building for and Sales to Enemy  Owners.     110. Shipbuilding  witnesses who gave  evidence before  this  Committee,  were somewhatdivided in their views as to the attitude which should be adopted after the war as  regards thebuilding of ships  for enemy flags.  A number of witnesses, who were opposed to  restrictionson  building  for  foreign  owners generally,  offered no objection to, and  even favoured, theimposition of such  restrictions  in  the case  of  enemy  owners.  One witness was  inclined toconsider the  question as largely academic; he did  not  think that building for the  enemy wasat all probable for a considerable time after the war,  and that the  matter might well be leftto the discretion of the British shipbuilders.     111.   This question cannot be  separated altogether  from that  respecting  the  transfer ofvessels to the enemy flags.  The view  generally held  in the industry is that,  if restrictions areto be maintained  on the transfer  of British  vessels to  foreign  flags generally, they shouldapply a fortiori to transfers to the  enemy  flags.     112.   Certain articles  in the  German  press have recently betrayed  considerable  appre-hension with regard to Germany&apos;s  maritime future, and legislation has been introduced foraccording State assistance to German shipowners, not only for increased building at home, butalso for extensive  purchases  abroad, in order that the  German mercantile marine  may bereconstituted  as early as  possible.   If our recommendations with regard to enemy ships arecarried  into  effect, we  should see little reason to fear  German Marine competition for  a  con-siderable time after the war.  It is generally our view that the indemnities  in cash and kindthat the enemy countries  should be forced to pay to the Allies should be on a scale sufficientto discourage State enterprise in Germany  for future  aggrandisement.     113.   It  appears to us useless to suggest special restrictions on the building of ships forenemy owners, or  the transfer of ships to the enemy flags, unless all the Allies, including theUnited  States, are prepared to exert pressure on Neutrals to the same end.  If such measuresare decided upon for defence reasons  as part of a larger economic policy directed  against theenemy countries during the early Reconstruction period, the building of ships in  the Empirefor enemy owners and the transfer of vessels to the enemy flags should be prohibited for suchtime  as  these measures are enforced.  Otherwise,  so  far as this country is  concerned, thesame result could  very largely be achieved by British  shipbuilders and shipowners themselvesgiving a preference  to all flags over the enemy flags, both in the building of new tonnage andin the transfer of existing vessels.  We have reason to believe  that such an arrangement wouldaccord with sentiment in  the industries.                                       Conclusion.    114.  It  is es-ential that there should  be the closest  consultation between the Governmentand the industries in any  measures taken during the period of demobilisation.  Such measuresshould be  entrusted, so far as possible, to the  industries themselves,  and the  intervention ofGovernment Departments  should be avoided.  It should be the  primary function of the Govern-ment to  further the reconstruction  process by removing difficulties  and not to inrpede it byimposing  restrictions.    The country&apos;s ability  to recover from the  effects of the  war  willultimately depend on its oversea trade and therefore on its shipping.    115.  It is our profound conviction that the best conceived measures for  the restoration ofthe mercantile marine must fail unless it is freed from Government control when the war comesto an end.   We  have  endeavoured to set out the fundamental principles  on which  in ouropinion the Government will have to base its policy with regard to shipping, if  the  Britishsea carrying trade is to prosper in the future as it has in  the past.  We believe  that an announce-ment by the  Government that it accepts these principles as sound would do much to dispel theparalysmg uncertainty  from which  the industry is now  suffering.  We are fully alive  to thefact that a complete change of policy, such as we recommend,  must be carried out step by stepwith  careful  regard to the actual  conditions which exist  at  every  stage.  Action in  certaindirections could be taken  at once; in  others it will be  necessary to wait until the war is over.The main point is that  these steps should steadily tend  in the right direction.             SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS  AND RECOMMENDATIONS.       The British Mercantile Marine  before the War (Section I., paragraphs 13-28).    At the outbreak of war the British  Mercantile Marine was the largest, the most up to dateJMid the most efficient of all the merchant navies of the world.  It comprised nearly one-half ofthe world&apos;s steam tonnage and was nearly four times as large as its nearest and most formidablerival the  German  Mercantile Marine.   The initiative and enterprise of shipowners and ship-builders, were a vita,!  element in the building up of the greatest carrying trade the world  has
-! ever seen.   A further element of success, on which it is impossible to lay too much stress, was the skill, efficiency, and seamanship of the officers and men who manned and navigated our vessels.         The Effect of the  War on British Shipping  (Section 11,, paragraphs 29-59).     Owing to  the  demands made upon the British Mercantile Marine for direct or auxiliary War Services, only about half our shipping has been available for the provisioning of this country and our allies and for our oversea trade.     From  the  beginning of  the  war  up  to  the end of August, 1917, the enemy had  been responsible for the loss  of over 3 million tons net of British shipping and over 2 million tons net of Foreign shipping (Allied and Neutral).  To this extent he had impaired the world&apos;s carrying power and he  had  reduced proportionately the ability of the  whole  world to recover from the devastating effects of the present conflagration.     It is easy to see in the light  of war experience that the unrivalled shipbuilding resources of this country should  at the  outset have been developed to the utmost limit of their capacity. The needs of the mercantile marine have been neglected  to such an extent that the tonnage of merchant  vessels launched  in the  United Kingdom  declined from over one million tons net in 1914,  which was almost a normal  year, to 430,000 tons net in  1915, and to 340,-000 tons net in 1916.   The efforts made during 1917 will not succeed in producing more than about twice the amount produced in 1916 an output utterly insufficient in view of war losses.     The  growing shortage of  tonnage has produced the  most  serious consequences on our carrying trade all over the world.  It has been necessary to withdraw.ships in increasing numbets from the more distant trades and to concentrate them on the trades nearer home.   The door has thus been left open  to foreign enterprise which it may be difficult hereafter to combat with success.     The position of the British  shipowner has been further prejudiced by the  system of complete control now exercised by the Government.     At the rates of hire at present paid, the tramp owner has no inducement to maintain or renew his investment in shipping property,  and there is a  grave danger that many firms may go out of business with a large consequent shrinkage in the tonnage at the country&apos;s disposal.                 The Position after the War (Section III., paragraphs 60-69).     To meet the enormous demands  which will arise immediately after the  war  there will be available less than 20 million tons net under all flags, instead of the 30 millions tons net which might in the normal course of development have been looked for.     Neutral shipowners have  been able  to amass large profits which will  enable them  to engage in  severe competition  after the war.  Japanese encroachment  on our Eastern trades is already serious and will become more serious.  Competition of tbe most formidable character is also to be  anticipated from the United States where marine  enterprise has  received a great stimulus during the war.     Unless British  shipping  is enabled at the  outset  of the reconstruction  period  to  take full advantage of the situation, it  may fall behind  in the competitive race and  definitely lose tbe ascendency which has been  the keystone of the Empire and the condition of our industrial existence.                 General Recommendations (Section V.,  paragraphs 70-115).                        The Control of Shipping (paragraphs 70-75).     The first and fundamental condition of Reconstruction  is the early removal  of Govern- ment operation and control  from shipping.  Such control is not only alien to the British genius but always tends to paralyse individual effort.  It is our conviction that any departure from the principle of relying on private enterprise would be a dangerous experiment and a blunder of the worst kind.     Our recommendations are accordingly as follows :-         (1) The  release of privately owned  shipping  from Government operation  and control             should take place  when the war ends; vessels still required &quot;for  Government pur-             poses of any &quot;kind should be chartered at market rates or at agreed rates based  on             market conditions.       (2) Anv advantage-enjoyed  by foreign  shipowners as  regards  rates should cease  when             the war comes to an  end, if not earlier; and every effort should be made by the             Government to see that, so far as possible, British shipowners are not placed at a:.             disadvantage with their foreign competitors in this  respect.       (3) Since large sums will be necessary for the restoration of the mercantile marine, the             shipping industry  should, for the remainder of the war, be placed on the same             footing  as  regards profits and financial-control , as other industries,  and special             provisions with regard to shipping,  such asdhose  cqntainedin the Finance. Act of;         11917, should be repealed.! t.(. ., .
       (4) Immediate steps should be taken to bring tbe rates of hire paid by the Government              to British shipowners up to a level which will ensure a reasonable return on vessels              built at present prices.       (5) The standard ships built by the Government during the war and any other merchant              vessels owned by tbe State should be sold under conditions of open competition to              British shipowners as they  cease to be  required for  direct Government  services              arising out of tbe war.                The Release of Shipping from War Service.   (Paragraph 76.)     The following principles, which  will facilitate the release  of  shipping from Government control, should govern the policy of H.M. Government in regard  to demobilisation:-       (1) The release of shipping from war  service should be rapid but also  economical.   It              is of the utmost importance that as large a proportion as possible of the world&apos;s              shipping engaged in trade should be under the British flag at an  early date after             the war.       (2) To hasten tbe process, Government owned  ships, including  enemy ships, or  even              chartered neutral ships,  should,  wherever possible, be  substituted  for privately              owned British  tonnage in the  conveyance of troops, stores, and so  forth.  Alter-              natively, Government owned vessels  should  be chartered or sold  to British ship-             owners whose vessels cannot be  released.       (3) In view of the  severe depletion of  high class tonnage, vessels of the greatest value              to trade should, so far as possible, be released  first.                     Surrender of  Enemy Shipping.   (Paragraphs 77-85.)     We  consider that no  peace would be satisfactory which did not enforce the surrender  of enemy shipping and inflict drastic and exemplary punishment for the enemy&apos;s crimes at sea.       (1) Enemy countries should be required as a condition of  peace:               (a) To  surrender  to the  Allies  all their merchant shipping whether in enemy                   ports at the close of hostilities or in ports of countries still neutral ;             (6) To forfeit all ships laid up  since the outbreak of  hostilities in ports of countries                   that have become involved in  war  or have broken off diplomatic relations                   with them; and             (c)  To restore to the Allies all  Allied  shipping  that  may have come into  their                   possession since the outbreak of hostilities.       (2) Shipping thus taken over from the enemy should be  utilised, so  far as possible,  to             assist demobilisation and to release for purposes of trade a proportion of the Allied             shipping absorbed  in  transport  work.    When Allied shipping cannot  for  any             reason be released,  the owners  concerned should be given the opportunity of  char-             tering at the equivalent  of market rates enemy tonnage which would temporarily             replace their  own.       (3) As and when demobilisation is completed, all enemy vessels not already sold should             be sold by auction in  the various countries, the proceeds of the sales to be treated             as part of the common war indemnity paid by the enemy countries.       (4) Provided such  an  arrangement is possible,  we think  that a  scheme  of distribution             which would  secure the  allocation of enemy tonnage  among  the  Allies  in  some             rough proportion to the losses sustained by individual Allied countries would offer             many advantages.   Otherwise,  the enemy vessels should be sold by auction in the             various  countries to the highest bidder, so long as he is of Allied nationality and             is able to furnish satisfactory proof that he is acting  on behalf of Allied interests.       (5) Neutrals and enemies should not be  admitted to purchase, and a condition should be             attached to the sales to prevent the  re-transfer of  vessels to enemy interests or             interests  controlled by the enemy for such period as restrictions may be imposed             on enemy ships, shipping and trade in  general.                      Shipbuilding after the War.   (Paragraphs  86-91.)     It is essential that we  should be prepared, immediately  on  the conclusion of peace, to  com-plete annually not less than 2 million tons net of merchant shipping.  The necessary preliminarymeasures should be taken not when the war comes to an end,  but immediately.  We indicatetheir nature below, and recommend that steps be taken at once to devise the necessary machinery.       (1) It should be arranged that yards engaged on Admiralty work should be in  a position             to resume merchant work immediately the war is over.       (2) Skilled  workers  drawn from  the shipbuilding and marine engineering industries for             military, naval  or auxiliary purposes  should be  returned to  those  industries             immediately on  the conclusion of peace.       (3) Shipbuilders and  marine engineers  must be free  to  obtain the supplies of steel             required by paying the necessary price without being handicapped  by any system             of priority certificates.     Government  control over the  construction of vessels should cease immediately the  warends, and the initiative as to the type  of vessel to be built  should be left to the shipowner inconsultation with the shipbuilder.     We  strongly urge that even during the war facilities  should be afforded  as part of theshipbuilding programme for the production of  liner tonnage to owners&apos; own design, with suchlimitations with regard to  speed and passenger accommodation as may be necessary  to ensurerapid output and large carrying capacity.
                  Shipbuilding for Foreign Owners.   (Paragraphs 92-105.)           We do not believe that foreign orders  need cause  alarm so  long  as there is simul-      taneonsly a proportionate demand from British shipowners.  If the  recommendations which      we have summarised above, under the heading Control  of  Shipping, are  carried out,      we are  convinced  that British shipping will retain its attraction as an investment for      British  capital,  and the demand for new tonnage by British owners will be  relatively as      great as the demand by foreign owners.  No restrictions should therefore be imposed \tj      the  State  on  Shipbuilders  and  Marine Engineers, as  such restrictions would  be un-      necessary and could  only damage  the  Shipbuilding and Marine  Engineering industries      without in the long run benefiting shipowners.  We should, however, approve  of  any      measures which  the Government may decide to take for the purpose of safeguarding th      position until the  action recommended  under the heading Control of Shipping has  hac&apos;      time to take effect.       Sales of Vessels to Foreign (other than Enemy) Flags.  (Paragraphs 106-109.)           The transfer of  vessels  from the  British Register to Foreign Flags formed  an im-      portant  feature  of our maritime development before the war,  and was  incidentally an      index of the relative efficiency of the British  merchant fleet as compared with the fleets of      other countries.  W^e consider  it  most important  that the  conditions underlying this     . process should be restored as soon as possible after the war.  If, owing  to irksome  restric-      tions of one kind  or another,  British shipowners showed signs of wishing  to sell their      ships in order to go out of the business, it is difficult to see how such a process could be      averted, and not merely postponed, except by the removal of the restrictions.  We believe      that when the bulk of the privately owned British, tonnage on direct Government  service      has been returned to  the owners, it will be desirable to relax considerably the stringency      of the licensing  system, imposed by the British  Ships Transfer Restriction Acts,  with a      view to the establishment of free licensing as soon as possible.              Building for and Sales to Enemy Oioners.   (Paragraphs 110-113.)      ;(1) Special restrictions on the building of ships for German owners or the transfer of            :ships to the German  flag would be useless,  unless all the Allies, including the            United  States, take&apos; similar  action and are further prepared to  exert pressure on            neutrals to the same end.      (2) If the  Allies  decide to  take  such  measures, as part of a larger economic  policy            directed against the enemy  countries  during the early reconstruction period, the            building of  ships in the Empire  for enemy owners and the transfer of vessels to            the enemy flags should be prohibited for such time as these measures  are enforced      (3) The same  result,  so far as this country is concerned, could very largely be attained            by British shipbuilders and shipowners themselves  giving preference to all  flags            over enemy flags both in respect of building and in respect of transfers.                           Conclusion.   (Paragraphs 114-115.)      (1) There should be the closest consultation between the Government and the industries            in any  measures taken during the period of  demobilisation,  such measures to be            entrusted so far as possible  to the industries  themselves; the primary function of            the  Government  should be  to further the  reconstruction process by removing            difficulties.      (2) An announcement by the Government that it accepts as sound the principles outlined            in this Report would  do much to dispel the uncertainty from which the industries            are suffering.      (3) We  recognise that the change  of policy recommended must  be carried  out step  by           step, with careful regard to  the actual conditions existing at  every stage.    In view of the vital importance and the  pressing urgency  of the questions considered inthis Part of our Report,  we have decided not to delay its presentation pending the completionof the Second Part, which, however, we hope to submit at an early date.

APPENDICES.                  APPENDIX A.THE TONNAGE  POSITION AT  THE  END  OF                   THE WAR.  1.  An estimate is made below of the amount of steamtonnage that will  be left (a) to the world  as a wholeand  (6) to the United Kingdom at the end of 1917 and1918 respectively.   In  the  nature of the case suchestimates must be  largely conjectural.             I. The World&apos;8 Tonnage.                  (o) Shipbuilding.  2.  Particulars of the gross  tonnage of merchantvessels of 100 tons gross and upwards launched in allcountries of the world are contained in returns issuedby Lloyd&apos;s  Register of  Shipping.   According to theseReturns the average annual output of merchant ship-ping during the years 1911-13 in the United Kingdom,in enemy  countries and in other  countries  was asfollows:                                       Tons net.    United  Kingdom.........  1,140,000    Enemy countries    .........   260,000    Other countries     .........   450,000Total    ...   1,850,000  These figures  include sailing  vessels and shippingbuilt  for  the North  American  Lakes, and  a slightallowance is necessary on this account.  3. The following has been the world&apos;s output of newtonnage in the  years 1914, 1915, 1916 and 1917,* sofar as information is available:  1,000 tons net.-	1914.	1915.	1916.	1917.*United Kingdom Enemy Countries Other Countries Total......	1,050 260 470	430 340	340 ?400	700 ?600	1,780	750	?740	? 1,300  It will  be seen that the  year  1914  was normal  inrespect of shipbuilding, that there was a sharp fall inthe years 1915 and  1916  and that 1917 is still veryunsatisfactory so far as regards the United Kingdom.In view of the shipbuilding  activity abroad, it is pro-bable that there will be a considerable  increase in theoutput of foreign countries.  4.  Excluding the enemy countries,  it is probable,therefore, that there will  have been built in the world,outside the enemy countries, about 2-8  million tons ofshipping between December 31st, 1914, and December31st, 1917.  If the proportion  of sailing and lake ton-nage included in this total be placed at roughly 10 percent., there  would remain little over 2i million tons ofsteam shipping of a sea-going character.  5.  Inasmuch, however,  as enemy shipping,  whethertaken over  by the Allies or not,  will be available  forthe  carrying trade  as a whole, some account mustbe taken  of building in  the enemy countries duringthe war.  Our information on this  subject is unfor-tunately very imperfect.  Few particulars are  avail-able as  to  ships  built  in Germany,  and  none  asregards  building   in  Austria-Hungary.   But  theoutput  of  the latter   country   is not  sufficientlyimportant to affect a broad estimate.  According to the Scandinavian  paper  &quot;  Politiken &quot;there were  actually  completed in  Germany  during1915, 180,000 tons  gross of Merchant Shipping, andaccording to an estimate of  the  War Trade Intelli-gence Department,  about  110,000 tons  gross duringthe first six months of 1916.   It is improbable thatthis  amount was exceeded  in  the  latter  half of 1916,and in  view of the heavy drain  on enemy  resources* Figures for 1917 are estimated.for other  purposes  it is  doubtful  whether more than250,000 tons for 1917  should be  allowed.  On  thisbasis  there would  have been  completed  in  the 3years:                          Tons Gross.    1915   .........  180,000    1916   .........  220,000    1917   ..........250,000650,000 = 400,000 tons net.  6.  We have, therefore, on  the credit  side  of  theaccount some 3-2 million tons  of  shipping, or deduct-ing sailing and lake tonnage 2-9 million tons net.                  (b)  War Losses.  7.  On  the debit side f of the  account it may  beestimated that by the end of 1917 War Losses willhave been approximately as follows:                                        Tons Net.    British       ............  3,800,000    Foreign      ............  2,700,000                                      6,500,000  Of this tonnage a small percentage would comprisesailing vessels.               (c) Marine Bisk,  etc.  8.  In aiddition  to  actual war losses allowance mustbe made for  losses  by ordinary marine risks and theinevitable breaking  up of vessels  too old for service.Even if, in view  of  the tonnage stringency, removalsfrom  the Register on  the latter account  are reducedto a minimum, the  retention of  these  vessels  is pro-bably more than  counterbalanced  by additional lossesthrough  marine risk due to the removal of lights andother circumstances arising  out  of the war.  More-over,  no account is taken  under the head of warlosses of vessels badly damaged by  the enemy whichmanaged to reach port.  A proportion of such vesselswill necessarily pass off the Register.  Before the war  the rate  of  replacement  of  theworld&apos;s  steam  tonnage  was  about  2   per  cent.annually.  In  the   years  1915-1917 losses  on  thisaccount may  therefore be estimated at about 2 milliontons net of  steam  tonnage. The  estimate may  betoo low.                    Conclusion.&apos;  9.  It may therefore be estimated  that additions toand reductions from the steam tonnage of  the worldin the years  1915-1917 have  been  as follows:                                      Tons Net.    Deducted       War Losses -   ......     ...  6,500,000      Losses  by Marine Risk, etc....  2,000,000                                 8,500,000Added-      .  New Construction, say      ...   3,000,000Loss on Balance      ......  5,500,000  10.  The above figures cover the years 1915-1917 ex-cept  for war losses,  which  are  estimated from  theoutbreak of  war.   The  losses  were  small  in 1914,whilst shipbuilding in that year  was normal.  11.  On June 30th, 1914, the Steam tonnage of  theworld, excluding  vessels  engaged in trade on  theNorth American  Lakes amounted to 26 million tonsnet.  At the normal rate  of  progress  this figurewould have been increased  by December  31st, 1914,to about 26-5 million tons.  By  December 31st, 1917,the world&apos;s steam  tonnage  will, therefore,  have de-clined to 21-5 million tons a decrease of over 17 percent.  12.  It  should  be noted that  on June 30th, 1916,the world&apos;s  tonnage still amounted to 25-9  milliontons  or  very little less  than on  June  30th, 1914,and only 600,000 tons less than  the estimated figurefor December 31st, 1914.  The  great proportion ofthe net  loss will  thus  have been incurred  in  the18 months  ended December 31st, 1917, or during the
 period of intensified submarine warfare,  which really began in the second half of 1916, when neutral losses were exceptionally severe.   13. This, however,  is not  all.  In the  ordinary course, the world&apos;s tonnage would have  expanded to meet  the requirements  of  expanding  trade.  The normal  rate  of  expansion was nearly  5  per cent. Allowing only 4 per cent., the  growth of the  world&apos;s steam tonnage would  have been  as follows:   On the  Register on              Million Tons Net.

Estimates for 1918 must be guess-work.  If the submarine campaign  maintains  anything  like  its present  intensity and it  would  be foolish  to make any other assumption war losses  during the  year may amount to 4 million  tons  net.  At  the  best, it does not seem possible to allow for less than 2 million tons neb of British losses and  1J million tons net of foreign losses.   15.  If,  as seems highly  improbable,  the Shipping4Controllers building programme of 3 million tons gross is realised during  1918 and a proportionate effort is made elsewhere, then the  following amounts of new tonnage the estimate, of course,  is very rough will be forthcoming during 1918 :                                        Tons Net.    -United Kingdom  .........  1,900,000    -Abroad     ............  1,100,000                                      3,000,000  It would thus scarcely be possible, with  the unitedefforts of the whole  world  to  make good war lossesapart  from other losses,  and  we shall be fortunateif at the end of 1918 we  are left on balance  with  20million tons net of shipping.       II. TONNAGE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM.  16. The  Steam  tonnage  on the  Register   of theUnited Kingdom on the 31st December of each of theyears 1913-1916 is  shown below:                                        Tons Net.    1913       ............  11,270,000    1914       ............  11,620,000    1915       ......    ......  11,650,000    1916.........    ...  11,040,000  It will be  seen  that the  decline up to the  end  of1916 was insignificant, the  reasons being that trans-fers to foreign flags were restricted, and that a cer-tain amount  of tonnage, including vessels taken overfrom the enemy,  was added otherwise than  by newconstruction.  17. Since  1916,  however,  the position has  becomeworse.  By the end of June,  1917,  the tonnage onthe  Register  of  the United Kingdom  declined byabout  1  million tons net,  and  by the end   of theyear there will have  been a further decline,  so thatthere  will remain on the  Register only  about 9jmillion tons net.  18. Before  the.  war  the  Steam  toDnage  of theUnited Kingdom was growing by about 2J per cent.annually, not allowing  for  replacements  on  a large6cale.  At a rate of growth  of only 2 per cent., therewould have been on the Register of the United King-dom about 12 million tons  net at the end of 1916, and12-2 million tons  net at the end of 1917.  The lossin  actual tonnage  will,  therefore, probably haveamounted to  not  less than 3 million tons  net, or25  per cent.  The loss in efficiency cannot be  esti-mated.  19. The  tonnage of  the  British  Dominions  andColonies  has,  for  statistical reasons,  been includedwith that of  &quot; other countries,&quot; except as  regards&quot; War losses,&apos;1  wnere the  losses of the whole  Empireare included  under the head of  British.   The losseshave, however, fallen almost exclusively on the Mer-eantile Marine of the United Kingdom  itself,  andany error in  the  calculation is  small.  At the endof June, 1916, the British Empire (outside the UnitedKingdom)  owned about  900,000  tons  net of steamshipping.  There has probably been  a  small  decline.  20. For  the purposes  of the  Empire&apos;s  carryingtrade  the  tonnage  of the British  Dominions  andColonies may be included  with  that of the UnitedKingdom.  On this  assumption, the distribution  oftonnage at  the  end  of  1917 would   be  approxi-mately:                                         Tons Net.

LINER SERVICES.  WAR  WASTAGE.  REPLACEMENT.                    War Services.   1. The Liner Services have played,  and are playing, an all important part in  the War.  They have  pro- vided the ships needed for Auxiliary Cruisers, Trans- ports,  Supply Ships, and Hospital Ships.  By the carrying capacity and speed of their ships they have carried,  and  are carrying,  the greater  part of our oversea supplies of food and  munitions of war.  These Services had been steadily developed year after year, whether trade was  good or  bad, by the energy  and enterprise and at the cost of the Regular Lines,  and they were at the disposal of the Nation on  the  out- break of War.  Without these Services the War could never have been  fought.                      Export.   2. Under Peace conditions the  great  bulk of  the exports of the United Kingdom, apart from coal, are carried by the Regular Lines.  This  is especially the case in regard  to the manufactures of the United Kingdom which consist so largely  of fine cotton  and woollen goods and steel manufactures.  In  bulk the coal exports  are large,  but  in value  the exports carried by the Lines represent considerably more than 75 per cent, of the total exports.   To distribute these high valued exports,  not only have ships to be  specially designed for  the different trades,  but constant  and regular services  must be maintained from our Ports.                      Imports,   3. In  the carriage of  imports into  the United Kingdom  the general trading  ships play a greater part,  but here again ships  have to  be specially de- signed to carry successfully such articles as provisions, tea, cotton, &amp;c,  whilst the frozen meat trade is  a trade which can only be  carried by the regular Lines. And in the import trade both in food supplies and in raw materials, the constancy of regular ocean service is of the first importance.   4. The ship which can carry outwards  a full dead- weight cargo of coal and bring homewards a  full dead weight cargo  of wheat  or ore,  cannot  be made an efficient carrier of either manufactured goods of high- value,  or  of raw  materials which occupy  considerable space in proportion to their weight.    Re-establishment of Manufacturing Industry.  5. The  experience  of  the War has  shown  how limited  is  the  storage accommodation  in the ports, and in  the country  at  large.  Large stocks cannot be  accumulated,  and  the  first  step  towards   there-establishment  of  manufacturing  industry,  and therefore  the  first step  towards getting  the Armies back to civil employment, must be the re-establish-ment of the organised ocean services to bring in  the imports of raw  materials,  and  to  distribute the  ex-ports of manufactured articles.15698E
                  Liner Tonnage.  6.  Under Peace conditions it is estimated that theLiner tonnage of the  United Kingdom was  repre-sented by about 1,200 vessels of about 7,000,000 tonsgross.  7.  Of this Liner Tonnage there were  employed:-                                       Tonnage                             Vessels.    Gross.

Of the above Liner  Tonnage  there  was on  the5th August, 1914, entered in the Liverpool &amp; LondonWar  Risks  Association   908  vessels  representing5,921,575 tons gross.  The  vessels entered in that Association, therefore,represented about 75 per cent,  in numbers and 84per oent. in tonnage of the total Liner Tonnage.                   Liner LJOSSCS.  9.  Since  the  5th August, 1914, of the above LinerTonnage entered  in the above Association, there  hasbeen withdrawn:                                         Tonnage                             Number.

The total  replacements represent  13  per  crot.Therefore the net  loss  in  Liner Tonnage  since the5th August, 1914, has been 20 per cent.  11.  Under  Peace conditions,  the Liner  Tonnage,to keep  pace  with the normal growth in  overseatrade,  should have  increased during  the three  yearssince 5th August, 1914,  by not less than 10 per cent.                Liner Tonnage Shortage.  12.  From the above considerations it will  be  seenthat if Peace is re-established next year, the finerTonnage of the  United Kingdom must be insufficientto meet  the  demands that  will be made upon  it toenable the overseas  communications of  the UnitedKingdom  to  be  re-established-probably the shortagewill not be less than  30 per  cent.

In 1913, the  approximate first cost of buildingLiner Tonnage was as under:                                           Per  ton  gross. 30 to  35 20 to  30 12 to  15Fast Mail and Passenger LinersPassenger and Cargo Liners   ......Cargo  Liners      ......    ......The  average  first  cost of  the Liner  Tonnage entered  in the Liverpool &amp;  London War Risks Insurance Associa-  tion  in August, 1914, had been    ...     18  0  0The  average value  of this Liner Ton-  nage  in August,  1914,  calculated on  the basis of  first cost less depreciation  %t the rate of 4 per cent, per  annum,.  /&apos;as       -   -     ......    ...     11 12  0                                         Per  ton                                          gross.The  average value of this Liner  Ton-  nage as now agreed with the Ministry  of  Shipping  for  the purposes of in-  surance under the  Liner Requisition  Scheme is about.......... 30   0   0It is not possible under existing condi-  tions  to estimate the  present cost of  the replacement  of the Lost  Liner  Tonnage.

On the  above estimates the replaee-  ment  cost, at present prices, of one-  third  of the  Liner  Tonnage 7,000,000  tons  gross = 2,300,000 tons gross  at   45 per ton gross would amount to ...  103,500,000As  against such estimated  cost  of  re-  placement the Lines  have recovered  under   their  insurance  policies,  or  from  the State as  ascertained  values  under   the  Terms   of  Requisition,  about two-thirds of such cost......   69,000,000Leaving a balance to be provided of ...   34.500,000               Re-conditioning Cost.15.  In addition to the cost  of  replace-  merit,  there  must  be a  very heavy  outlay  incurred in  re-conditioning  the Liner Fleets as they  exist when  Peace is restored.  Overhauls, repairs,  and  renewals have  been  postponed.  The wear  and tear  of  continuous ser-  vice  under War conditions has been  abnormal.  The cost of  re-condition-  ing will be at practically  War prices.  It is  difficult  to assess this outlay,  but (having regard to War prices) it  will not be less than 15 per cent, on  the original  cost of  the  vessels still  left  in  the   Liner  Fleets,  say  on   84,600,000 -   ............   12,690,000              Loss to be Made Good.16.  In the result, provided the whole of  the money collected in respect of War  losses is re-invested in shipping, the  Lines will have to find  out of  earn-  ings,  out  of  further  capital,  or  on  credit, in order to bring  back their  Fleets to  the  state  cf  efficiency  in  which they  were when War was de-  clared, about    ..............   47,190,000                     Trade Losses.  And even after the Liner Fleets have been restored,most  serious  War losses and War wastage in  otherdirections  will  have to  be made  good.  To  meetnational needs ships have been withdrawn, and longestablished trades. have had to be abandoned in allparts of the world, and the place of the British  Linoshas, in great measure, been taken by vessels underAllied or Neutral flags.  It  will be years  before thetebroken connections can be re-established.               Liner War Earnings.  17.  It is not yet possible to assess the actual earn-ings of Liner  Tonnage  under  War  conditions;  butthe following estimate is prepared from a comparisonof the summaries of  the annual accounts  of 22 of -theprincipal  Liner Companies  published  in  Fairplay inDecember, 1915 and  1916.
99  The  accounts dealt  with represent,  in the main,the position of the Companies at the end of 1914 and1915, and  their  earnings  during those  years, as  asteamship  company&apos;s  accounts  cannot be  presenteduntil some  months after the close of the year to whichthey relate; therefore, for the purposes of the presentestimate the  accounts summarised  in Fairplay  aretreated as  those relating to 1914 and 1915.  The Companies whose accounts are summarised:  (A)  Owned  upwards of 70 per  cent, of the total Liner    Tonnage, the figures being:                             Vessels.    1914      .........  888    1915      .........  865    Average, 2 years      ...  876(B)  The  paid  up  share capital of    was:      1914      .........     ...    31,159,709    1915      ...     ...    ......    32,152,703 Tons Gross.  5,012,236  4,877,333  4,944,784the  CompaniesIncrease 992,994            Average       .;......   31,656,206(c) The book  value of  the.Fleets  of  the  Companies   was:     1914   56,841,909 equalling  11   6 9 per ton gross   1915   62,321,782      ,,     12 15 6      ,,Increase ... 18 9(D)  The  amount  distributed  in  dividends  by  the    Companies was:      1914       ............ 2,530,283    1915       ........,    ...   3,840,526            Average for 2 years  ...   3,185,404    The average distribution equalled 10 per cent, on    the paid up share capital or  5  per cent, on  the    book value of the Fleets.(E)  The amount due from the  Companies on  account    of  debenture capital, loans and  sundry creditors,    as  compared with the amount  due to  the  Com-    panies  from sundry  debtors  and  the value  of    their investments and cash, was as under:  Debenture Capital.Loani and SundryCreditors.

It will be seen from the above comparisons:                   Liner Dividends.  First. That the dividends distributed  by the&apos;  22Companies in  respect of the years 1914 and 1915 re-presented, on the average, a return of 10 per cent,  onthe paid up share1  capital,  or of  5 per cent, on thebook value of  the Fleets.            Liner  Undivided Earnings.  Second. That  out  of the earnings  from the years1914 and 1915 which  have been  retained in the busi-nosses :  i         ; ; 1  The average book value of  the  Fletets  has  been   in-  creased by ...     ...     ...

The figures relating to the years 1916 and 1917  are not yet available.  During  those  years the num-  ber of Liners coming under Requisition Rates steadily  increased, until by the Spring  of 1917 they were  all  under such Rates.    Further, the Excess Profit Tax  was increased.  The average&apos; rate of dividend paid has  not increased.    The amount accumulated from  un-  divided  earnings in  1916 and 1917  can now be only  conjectured, hut from such information as is available  it is not probable that it will equal theaccumulations  made  from the undivided earnings of 1914 and 1915.    It would not be prudent to estimate  the total of the  accumulations made by the Lines  from the undivided  earnings  of 1914, 1915, 1916 and 1917 at more than   3  10-s. Od. per ton gross.    20. If the above estimates be accepted, and if  the  accounts  of the 22 companies (owning upwards of  70  per cent, of the total Liner Tonnage)  be taken as re-  presentative,  then there will have&apos; been accumulated  out of the  undivided  earnings of the  diminishing  Liner  Tonnage in the years 1914, 1915, 1916 and 1917  about   20,000,000.                     Liner Credit.    21. The above considerations emphasise the impera-  tive necessity for maintaining the credit of the Liner  Companies, and not oniy the credit which will enable  them to finance their building  programme, but also  the&apos; credit with their own shareholders  so as to enable  them to  retain  the  capital at  present  entrusted  to  their care.   As has  been stated,  the Lines have  already  re-  covered under  their  insurance policies,  or from the  State  as  ascertained values  under the Terms of Re-  quisition, about  69,000,000.   Withdrawn  from ship-  ping and invested in Government Loans at 5 per cent.,  this sum alone would produce an income nearly equal  to  the total dividends distributed annually  by  the  Lines.                  State Competition.   22. The  credit of the Lines can only be maintained  if the future  of their  businesses be  assured.  That  future can only be assured if the Lines are allowed  to  proceed as rapidly as possible with the  replacement  of  their Fleets, and if  they are guaranteed  that  their  businesses  will be restored to them  immediately the  war demands  on their ships have been met.   28. If the State embarks on the building of Liner  Tonnage,  the future of the Lines must be gravely im-  perilled.    The Shipbuilding  Yard facilities for the  building of such Tonnage are limited, and if the slips  are  occupied by  State ships it will be impossible for  the Lines to replace their losses.  But above all else,  if the  State is  building ships to compete with  the  Lines,  their credit with  their shareholders will be de-  stroyed, and such capital as they  have available will  be  withdrawn to find  more secure employment.           Replacement  of Liner Tannage.   24. The questions raised in this Memorandum are of  pressing importance, as it has recently been announced  that the State  is starting on the building of Liner  Tonnage.   Plans are  already  in  existence  for vessels  to carry about 10,600 tons dead  weight at  a speed of  14 knots.   25. As the result of  most careful enquiry, the Asso-  ciation is satisfied that:         First Ton for  ton, the Lines can build vessels     of  this type to meet the requirements  of their     trades as quickly as  any other type can be built.       Second. Ton for  ton, no  more  steel would  be     used by the Lines.       Third Ton for ton, the  steel required would     not take longer to produce.       Fourth. Ton for ton, no more labour would be     required in the production of the steel, or in the     building of  the ships.      Fifth. Ton. for ton,  the ships &quot;would cany as     much dead weight cargo and more  bulk cargo.   26. Many of the Liner types have been standardised for years,  and there are; Shipbuilding Yards which are organised  for this production,  and are in a position to proceed at once onplans, patterns, and,specifications, to which they have been accustomed to work for years.---27-.-The-Liners-are-ready to build&quot;ships of ilietypes &apos; which^thejrNationrmust  have  to  re-establish both its15698
Export and Import Trades, and  in  the building  ofsuch ships  they are prepared to defer until peace isrestored such provision as they have been in the habitof making for passengers.  They are prepared to buildprimarily to meet  the  immediate War  needs  of  theNation, but the ships they do build will be adaptableto the Nation&apos;s needs in peace.                  Tramp Tonnage.  28. The Association has  dealt in this Memorandumwith the Liner Services, as the  tonnage  controlled  byits members is  almost all Liner  Tonnage; but the As-soeiation fully  realizes the important part played  byTramp Tonnage in  the carriage of the coal exports ofthis  country,  and  in  the bringing  in  of the deadweight imports used in national industries, and  inmaintaining the position of this country  as the greatocean  carrier  of  the world.   The losses  amongst  theTram]) Tonnage have been as heavy, if  not heavier,than the losses amongst  the Liner Tonnage.  The  in-ciease&apos; in the  cost  of building  is proportionately  asgreat in the case  of the  Tramp  Tonnage as  of  theLiner  Tonnage,  and the  amount recovered by  theowners of the  lost  Tramp Tonnage under their WarRisks Insurance policies or from the  State under theterms  of  Requisition  will  not  nearly   cover  suchbuilding cost.    Therefore, the  position  in regard tothe  replacement  of Tramp  Tonnage is  of pressingimportance.                     Proposals.  29.
