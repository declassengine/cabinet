SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.         BAW/026.WeeklyReport on Austria-Hungary *   XXVI.(2nd February,  1918.)     The great Austrian strike is over and is already rolegatedto the background by similar events in Germany.    It is by nowabundantly established that the movement was almost equallypolitical and economic: the exact extent to which it was in-fluenced by Bolshevist doctrine it is of course almost im-possible to estimate, but that influence Was unquestionably verygreat.   That the infection has now spread from Austria to Germanywould 3eem to be due on the one hand to resentment at what maybe described as the Hofmann attitude - so typical of the wholePrussian Junker outlook - and on the other to the fact that theAustrian workmen1s success is a plain encouragement to go and dolikewise.   It is true that that success is merely on paper andrepresented by fair promises.   But the Austrian proletariat hasfor the first time felt its strength and is certain to insist upona fulfilment of those pledges.   It is also safe to assume that theGerman vorking class and its leaders, who are well aware of theirsuperiority to their&apos;Austrian colleagues, are not a little jealousat the latter having stolen a march upon them and inclined toassume that they themselves ought to be able to obtain much more     There is also not much doubt  that  anything like repression  inGermany would in its turn react  upon Austria-Hungary,  where  it  isalmost openly admitted that repression  is out  of the question.   Inthis connection it is worth quoting the views  of the leading Germanunder similar circumstances.
118aorree^oadent-B in Vienna.   Herr lederer, after expressing a doubtas to whether the SocJAlist-JLeaders really have the movement undercontrol, say8 that &quot;the idea of fighting it down hardly comes inquestion&quot;: the reasons for this, he adds, &quot;ou,-ht not to be dis-cussed&quot;.  Herr Ganz, of the Frankfurter Zeitung, whose opinion isworth more than any of the others, tries to reassure his readers onthe ground that in Austria there is no very firm adherence toprinciples and a general tendency to give way before the finalpoint has been reached.   But he wipes out the effect of theseremarks by confessing that the Austrian workmen are beginning torealise their own power.   &quot;Very wisely,&quot; he says, &quot;it was notallowed to come to a trial of strength, such as in view of thefeeling of the whole population, including the troops, wouldnot have ended in favour of the State power.&quot;     For three days there were no newspapers in Vienna and the realnews is only gradually trickling through.   As during the greatuniversal suffrage demonstrations of 1905, it is evident that theauthorities did nothing to check the movement, and that it wasorganised with the same admirable discipline and lack of dis-turbances as on that occasion.   In its first stages it undoubtedlysuited the Government as a warning to the war party in Germany:                1but the elementary force with which it spread quickly alarmedthem and seems to some extent to have made them lose their nerve.Indeed the Government showed so little grasp of the situation, sostrong an inclination to wait upon events that even the Fremdenblattcomplained that &quot;the Cabinet seemed to have brought to its tasknothing save mere goodwill&quot;.   &quot;Moreover from certain allusions inthe press it is clear that the promises made to the strikers (eeelast report) are regarded with a certain suspicion on all sides.Count Toggenburg, the Minister of the Interior, appears to havemade a specially bad impression and the correspondent of theVossische Zeitung went so far as to remark that &quot;in so great a
)struggle of world principles nothing is to &quot;be gained by weak-kneedness and Jesuitical tendencies&apos;.&apos;.    This spiteful remarkmay be due to the fact that Count Toggenburg, who is an ultra-montane and was before, accepting office Statthalter of theultra-Clerical province of Tirol, has beem mentioned as apossible successor to the present Premier, Dr. von Seidler.While however the more Radical wing of the workmen is suspiciousof the good faith of the Government, there is also greatindignation among the German bourgeois parties,&apos; especially theChristian Socialists of Vienna, at the pledges given.   Thereason for this is obvious enough.   The introduction ofuniversal suffrage in the municipalities would mean the stormingof the Christian Socialist stronghold and the acquisition ofhundreds, if not thousands, of the petty administrative poststhroughout the capital by Socialist candidates.   The bourgeoisparties are thus frightened for their class privileges and arecoming more together again after their break-up of last summer.They were apparently only restrained with some difficulty fromvoting non-confidence in the Government when Parliament re-opened.   The prevalence of this feeling of fronde is probablylargely responsible for the stiff anti-Slav line adopted by thePremier v/hen Parliament met after the strikes and obviouslyintended as playing to the gallery.     For the moment there is a respite.   The fall of the FoodMinister in Hungary is clearly connected with the diversion of acertain amount of food from Hungary to Austria: while the GermanGovernment is believed to have placed a certain number of truck-loads of grain from its own limited supplies at the disposal ofAustria.   But the reduced flour ration remains, and hardly lessserious, the shortage of tobacco as an additional irritant on thepopulation.   Hor is it in the least obvious where food is tobe obtained.   The entire surplus of Galicia is used up by the
                                                                 120  Iarmy.   The Czechs by their passive resistanve and their minuteOrganisation have been able to prevent Bohemia from being drainedof its food for the sake of their German enemies.    Prom Serbia acertain amount of pigs have been imported,  but the condition oflive stock in that country   far too unfavourable  to offer muchresult.   Moreover transport difficulties interfere more and moregravely with the import of food from either Serbia or Roumania,while the severe winter still prevents any use being made of theDanube.   The natural quarter from which to replenish is Hungary:but the Hungarian Government is in too weak a political positionto be able to risk the unpopularity which would result fromrequisitions on behalf of the detested Austrians.    Besides it isquite possible that the Government has been actually encouragingthe recent Magyar press polemics against Austria (which have beenof a peculiarly virulent nature) with a view to using them as areason for refusing help.     Meanwhile it is only natural that the question should beasked on all sides HOW it becomes necessary, less  than five monthsafterthe harvest, to fcalve the flour ration throughout Austria.How desperate a situation this reveals can best be imagined whenwe consider that Austria-Hungary captured from Italy during therecent disasters the Italian army&apos;s food supplies  for six months.(Count Barbo in the Reichsrat also spoke of &quot;the colossal amountof coffee, rice, oil and wine&quot; captured itj, Italy.)     Austro-German Relations.  On the very eve of  the great strikea profound sensation was caused by an article in the Fremdenblattwhich declared in the most emphatic xaannsT the cosrplete confidencenot only of the Austro-Hungarian Government, but also of thepeoples of the Monarchy in Herr von KiHhlmann and his policy!&quot;anddeprecated the attacks of the Pan-Germans and the  intrigues bywhich it was sought to undermine his position as Foreign Secretary.It then went on to declare that Prince Mlow on the other hand,
121whose name was being mentioned as a possible successor or at  anyrate as a German peace delegate, definitely did not possess theconfidence of Austria-Hungary, and that most circles in theMonarchy regarded his action during the unsuccessful negotiationswhich he conducted in Rome before the entry of Italy into the waras proving him to be the very reverse of a &quot;brilliant second&quot;.Only those who know the Viennese milieu can appreciate the fullflavour of this reversion by the Ballplatz organ to the famousphrase which William II addressed to the Austro-Hungarian ForeignMinister after the Conference of Algeciras.   This article, whichnaturally kindled, and was probably intended to kindle, the fury                        Ikr 1 it)of the Pan-Germans in Parliament was widely treated throughoutthe German press as an official Austrian hint that the returnof Bttlow to power would be unacceptable to the Dual Mqnarchy.A few days later, however, it was suggested that the Fremdenblatthad severed its connection with the Ballplatz  on 1st January:but this was obviously an after-thought on the part of the manywell-informed persons who had accepted the other interpretationas a matter of course.   Meanwhile the Fremdenblatt has been  veryoutspoken, not to say indiscreet, in its criticisms of both theHungarian and the Austrian Governments, the latter in connectionwith the great strike.   The latest stage in the incident isrepresented by an official communique issued to the pressdeclaring that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs &quot;refrains fromexercising any influence on affairs outside its constitutionalcompetence&quot; and therefore does not interfere in internal Austrianor Hungarian affairs.   &quot;That the Fremdenblatt has repeatedlygiven expression to the point of view of the Foreign Office inmatters of purely external policy in an obviously recognisableofficial form, is a matter of general knowledge.   For any otherpolitical pronouncements of that paper, and especially for thosedealing with internal policy, the Foreign Office categorically
                                                                 122.2*18.rejects all responsibility.&quot;   This statement,  while of courseextricating the Ballplatz from any blame as regards--the stricturesupon the Seidler and Wekerle Cabinets,  only serves to lay furtheremphasis and importance upon the article on Prince BvHow, sincethe only possible inference is that the Ballplatz does notdisapprove of the paper&apos;s attitude on a point which is sopreeminently a matter of foreign policy.   Though of course noproof is forthcoming, it is extremely probably  that the wholeaffair rests upon an arrangement between Count  Czernin and Herrvon Kflhlmann, who are equally affected by and equally hostile tothe intrigues of Prince Bfllow and his friends.
