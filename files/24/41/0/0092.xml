                     WAR   CABINS T*-3590.            ITALJ^, LABOUR  FOR  .THS  WESTERN  FRONT..] fiv^rn^tium by Lord Hilner.(Circulated with, reference  to  IIar_Cabj.net 322.  Hinute I.)     On the 15th January the Cabinet discussed the question ofobtaining help from Italy in the shape of labour to ee usedbehind our lines in France,  and I was instructed to look intothe matter on behalf of the Government.  It was thought thatwe might justly base something like a claim for this assistancefrom Italy on the great amount of help, which we are giving herin money, shipping, munitions, coal, and other supplies  notto mention the&quot; considerable army which we have senu to takepart in the defence of her northern frontier.  At the same timeit was suggested that the demand made upon Italy for Labourmight be accompanied by a proposal on our pert to supplement thevery inadequate pay and separation allowances - especiallyseparation allowances - given to the rank and file of the ItalianArmy.  This might be regarded as an additional quid pro quo asagaanst our demand for labour.     To deal first with the latter suggestion, I may say that,regarded as a quid pro quo,  it seems zo me superfluous.  Onany general review of the services rendered by us to Italy andby Italy to us respectively, there is such an enormous balanceto our credit,  that whatever we may ask of Italy in the way oflabour ^ it will not go near to exhausting that balance.  Onthe otner hand,  looking aU ihe matter from a broader pointof view,  not as a question of debit rnd credit between us andItaly, out in the general interests of the Alliance, there isno doubt that even a large sum spent in augmenting the pay andallowances of the Italian Army would be money well spent.     There is.  however, a difficulty about making a proposal onthis subject to Italy at the present time, which I do not quitesee how to get over.  In any case the offer to supplement thepay and allowances of an allied army is a delicate offer to makeand might offend Italian susceptibilities.  But there is anotherreason why the present moment might not be a good one for mailingit.     The Italians  as we know, are in desperate straits forwheat and coal,   iiiero has certainly not been one day since thoCabinet discussion above referred to,  on which one or moremembers of the Italian Government,  or the Italian Ambassador,have not. by letter, telegram, or interview,  been urging upon usthe absolute- necessity of our taking prompt and drastic measuresto relieve their wants in these respects, and to help to suoplyItaly with what have long since been admitted to be her minimumrequirements of food stuffs and fuel.  Unfortunately,  despitethe great and continuous efforts maxlo on our side to give satis-faction to these Italian demands,  we have not hitherto been ableto meet them.     Tho grain situation indeed,  which has been the subjectof repeated discussions both here and in Paris during thelast three weeks,  is now somewhat better.  It is true that thedeliveries of wheat from overseas,  which Italy was entitled toexpect during the present cereal year - i,e,  from tho 1stSeptember 1917 to the 30th August 1918 - arc.  UP to date,  greatlyin arrears.  But so are the corresponding deliveries to France
and Great Britain.  All the Allies-are in equallyHjad case, cvdto the inland transport and other difficulties which &quot;haveMelsdshipments from the United States , although Italy feels the pinrimore severely than the others , owing to the fact that she startthe year with the lowest stocks , and lost a good portion of evdthese through the invasion of Verietia*  Still, as a result of idiscussions between Signer Crespi and the Wheat Executive, Iunderstand that something like a tolerable settlement has now  !been arrived at, which, if it can be carried out, - in other wdif the United States does not let us down again - will enableItaly to receive an average cf 300,000 tons a month duringFebruary and March, which, if less than she ought to receiveshould enable her just to pull through..     On the other hand, the supply of coal to Italy is still  ia pretty desperate condition.  I do not go into details aboutthis, as It is certain to come before the Cabinet again In the Inext day or two, -when all the figures-: can--.be given.  Suffice itto say that, unless some very drastic emergency measure is.adopby us, Italy may very well break down altogether in the coursethe next six weeks for want of fuel .     It will thus be seen that we have failed., and are failing Jthough through no fault of our own, to provide Italy with herminimum requirements of food and-fuel ..  These are the two poinflon which she has always all along insisted with tho. greatesturgency - -the two. things which aha has constantly represented TLus as absolutely vital to her -var efficiency and even existenceOn the other hand, she has never asked us for financial help tqmaintain her Army.,-  It is our idea and not hers , that her.soldiqought to be paid better .  What she feels she wants is more foodand fuel for her people.  To offer her something,-. which She doe)not ask for when we are unable to give her what she asks forceaselessly, seems something like a mockery .  Besides it mightsaid that it Is not much use giving people money when we cahnoflgive them almost the only things they would want to buy. with ii     I do not regard these considerations as disposing of the  Jproposal that we should do. something to supplement the pay andallowances of the Italian soldier. -   On the contrary I stillthink it would be a very good thing to &quot;do.., though the cost, ifwe were to do anything effective, would he very considerable.But it is. not the form of relief to. Italy which Is most urgentat the present moment.  Beyond all doubt or question, more coalis v/hat is most urgent .     While it is thus doubtful whether ?/e&apos;: should attempt-todeal now with the pay and allowances of.&apos;the Italian soldier,&apos;there can be no doubt that we have abundant justification forasking Italy to give us some immediate relief in the matter- of Ilabour.  The need  as we all knew ,&apos;is extremely urgent, and theItalians have readily responded to a similar appeal on the partof the French.   Yet .the French are not really in as greatstraits as we are for such assistance. &apos;  For they have not doi.as much fighting, as our men- in the last-few months; and are notso urgently In need of rest and of time&apos;for training..  Thequestion really Is not whether we need Italian labour, orwhetiwe have good justification for asking for it.&apos;  The only questiworth considering is by what sort of appeal we are most likelyto get it.  In the. French case, it was a personal visit fromGeneral Foch&quot;to Rome, which obtained the promise of 90 labour-battalions from the Italian Government.  I am afraid that an
- 3 -e5 J U opportunity of bringing similar personal influence to bear on the Italians was lost during the Sgitent discussions at Versailles.  But the reason, as far as I know, why this was not done, ia that at Versailles we were prosing the Italians hard to send a number of combatant troops 10 Prance.  Impor- tant as it is to get the labour battalions,  it is even more important to get Italian fighting divisions either to take over a portion of the line in France or to help in building up the General Reserve.  By trying to drive the two coaches abreast we might have failed to get either of them through the gate.        And we have not even now got a definite answer from the Italians about the fighting troops, though I gather from General Wilson that he has little doubt that they will send them,  But as soon as that question is settled,  I think we should ask for the labour battalions without any delay.  And in some respects our request for them would be strengthened and not weakened by having first got the fighting troops. It might well offend Italian pride if v/e were to appear to want Italians onljr as labourers.  As one of their Ministershas told me,  they would net like their men merely to play the part of coolies.  But once Italian troops share with theFrench and British the honours of the fighting line on theWestern Front,  there would, be no disparagement in asking for Italian labour battalions to share the work behind the lines,  on which French ang British soldiers are also engaged. If, however,  an appeal for such help is to be successful, I think it must be a personal appeal.  It is probably notpossible to send anyone to Rome, as- the French sent GeneralFoch,  to make the request.  Failing that/ I think the bestmethod of approach;.would be.a personal message from1the PrimeMinister:, to - Signer Orlando.,  To save: time I append, to thismemorandum,  as- a cock-shy,:.a draft of th^kind of telegramwhich I suggest should be sent.  If some^/message could be.  - approved,  it might be despatched as soon as the question, of sending Italian Divisions to; Frence ha3 been settled, --r -                         -.  (initialled) :M. &apos;2,Whitehall Gardens,  S.T.   10th February,  191:-:.
        There is a question of great urgency, which I wishedto oring before your notice during our recent conferences, butthe number of important matters which we had to discuss didnot leave time for it*  I refer to the shortage of militarylabour for the great amount of,work,, which has still to be donein strengthening our defensive lines in Northern France *  As yoknow, the British troops have been engaged in very heavy andcontinuous fighting on that front for months paste   They arethreatened with a heevy&apos; attack by the enemy in the near future,and under these circumstances it is not possible to detach aslarge a number for work behind the lines as is urgently requireto make the necessary preparations,    I would therefore make avery earnest appeal to you to assist us during the next few montwith as many labour battalions; as you can possibly spare.   I amaware that you are already generously assisting the French for asimilar purpose.  Our need is no less great than theirs and,having regard to the exceptional efforts we are being called upoto make, and gladly&quot; make to the extreme extent of our powers, toassist Italy in supplying her imperative wants in grain and coalI feel justified in begging you to help us in respect of our noless urgent want of labour.   Vie should, of course,, be-preparedto pay whatever you consider right in the way of wages and tomake ample provision for their rations and all other require-men ts .  The matter is very pressing and I hope you may be ableto give it early and favourable consideration.-
