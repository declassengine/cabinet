J^oo be inadequate for the supply indented for.   If the tonnage  necessary had been supplied for the quantities  specified^ln the  statement of the Minimum Food Requirements prepared by the Ministry  of Pood, the Commission on 31st March would have a stock sufficient  for  10 weeks.  The stock in fact will be only sufficient for 4-J weeks.  In the considered opinion of the Commission a stock sufficient at  least for two months is essential for safety.     The Representatives of the Commission in America after veryserious difficulty have secured 650,000 tons of the new Cuban cropof which 85,000 tons are for January loading.  Of this 85,000 tonsshipping has been provided for no more than 5,000 tons or only 6%of the January indent.  The demand for sugar in the United Stateshas been so acute and has given rise to such difficulty that it isvery probable that if the Commission cannot carry out its obligationto lift this sugar at the contract dates it will be diverted to theUnited States and so lost to the United Kingdom.     If the import png^ramme cannot be carried out it will not bepossible to continue/$ugar rationing scheme unless the ration isreduced, and as smaller supplies are correspondingly more difficultto distribute over the Country the danger of local shortages andof a breakdown in the distribution is seriously increased and thesuccess of the first official rationing system will be jeopardisedalmost at the outset.     The need for sugar, moreover, has become greater than ever byreason cf the/Shortage of butter and margarine, as a substitutefor which jam is of increasing importance.     Sugar is essential if the home-grown fruit crop is not to bepermitted to go to waste.     The present position is especially serious with regard to r*wsugar.  It has already been found necessary to reduce the Refiners1output by 20% aa the stocks would have been entirely exhausted by31st March.  As it is the stocks on 31st March will not exceed afortnights supply, and a stoppage of work will therefore result inmoat of the Refineries,  Such small stocks cannot, on account ofdeviations rendered necessary by Naval action be evenly distributedamongst the Refiners, situated as they are at three ports, and astoppage of work is in consequence inevitable.     If such a stoppage is prolonged the workmen will disperse anddrift  into other employment, in which case the Refining capacity ofthe Country which is vital to the maintenance both of the supply andof the arrangements for distribution, will be permanently lost forthe period of the V?ar.
