yw^nt IS THE PROPERTY^LVCIHOUIATED TO THE WAR CABINET,DRAFT,FOREIGN OFFICE,      TELEGRAIR TOMR, LINDLEY (PETROGRAD)FEBRUARY1918.     FOLLOWING FOR MR, LOCKHART:-   -  THERE PREVAILS, I THINK, SOME slightMISCONCEPTION WITH REGARD TO OUR POLICY INREGARD TO THE GOVERNMENT IN PETROGRAD*YOU ARE IN ERROR IN SUPPOSING THAT WE ARE&quot;UNWILLING TO ADOPT A POLICY OF PARTIALRECOGNITION  (OF THE BOLSHEVIKS)&quot;, AND YOUARE ALSO IN  ERROR IN SUPPOSING THAT, INCOMING TO THIS DECISION, WE ARE AFFECTED BY&quot;FEAR OF THE HARM SUCH A COURSE MIGHT CAUSEUS WITH THE  BOURGEOIS ELEMENT IN RUSSIA&quot;.ON THIS SECOND POINT, LET ME SAY CLEARLYAND EMPHATICALLY THAT THE INTERNAL AFFAIRSOF RUSSIA ARE NO CONCERN OF OURS.  . WE ONLYCONSIDER THEM IN SO FAR AS THEY AFFECT THEWAR.   IF AT THIS MOMENT LARGE PARTS OFTHE COUNTRY  ACCEPT THE PARTICULAR TYPE OFSOCIALISM, FAVOURED BY THE BOLSHEVIKS, ORIF, AS YOU ANTICIPATE, THEY WILL SOON RE*-JECT BOLSHEVISM, IN FAVOUR OF ANARCHY, THISIS THE AFFAIR OF RUSSIA, NOT OF BRITAIN,AND IT APPEARS TO US QUITE IRRELEVANT&quot;TOTHE PROBLEM,  OF DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION,ON
     On. this latter subject, it seems to methat, so far as the form of recognition isconcerned, there is no essential differencebetween the views expressed in your tele-grair- and those held by Hiis Majesty&apos;s Gov-ernment.   It is common ground that fulland complete recognition is at present im-possible, and also that a complete ruptureis very undesirable *   The only questionis as to the exact character of the middlecourse.which ought to be adopted.    (Solong as it is understood that our diploma-tic relations remain semi-official and in-formal, we see no reason why you should notact as the representative of the BritishEmbassy)*     The lines, however, on which you shouldconduct your conversation with MonsieurTrotsky present greater difficulties.   Wedo not of course desire at this moment togo back on the past - the&apos; broken treatiesjthe repudiated debts, the abandoned mili-tary storesj the declaration of war againstRoumania, and so forth.   But, confiningourselves to the present and future, it isnot-very easy to see what it is that wewant of ttft*e Bolshevists (with the very im-portant.exception of the refusal to make aseparate peace), which they can grant9 orwhat the Bolsheviks want of us that we cangrant.   We-want them to abstain from Bol*                                shevist
Bolshevist propaganda in Allied territoryies,   They want us to abstain from givingaid or encouragement to any political ormilitary movement In Russia which has nottheir approval.   The first course wouldrequire the Bolsheviks to abandon theirloudly advertised principles, the secondwould require us to abandon our friends andAllies,     There are no doubt many important butless fundamental questions on which judi-  ,cious diplomacy might prove very valuable;and we are therefore most anxious to defera break with the Government at Petrograd.,if break there must be, as long as possible^and in tiie meanwhile to make our sem.i*-of*ficial intercourse with it smooth and ef*.ficiento   We therefore assent to yoursuggestion that your position should hence-forth be that of Political Agent, -
