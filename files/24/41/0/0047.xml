[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.  February 1918.SECRET.G.T.-3545.THE  LABOUR  SITUATION.Report from the Ministry of Labour for the week ending the 6th February, 1918.                                  SUMMARY. Part I:  General Remarks.     The question of man-power is discussed with special reference to the A.S.E. Part II: Press Comments.     The opinions of the Labour press on the Labour Party Conference at Nottingham, on  man-power and the A.S.E., on  the  food  problem, on  peace and war, and on oo-operators in politics are summarised. Part III: District Reports.     The food situation is everywhere the subject of much comment, and in  some places, especially in the London area and the Midlands, of serious unrest.  The Man- Power Bill  is everywhere discussed.  Generally, an improvement  in the  attitude adopted towards it is  evident. Part IV: Disputes.     (a.)  Involving a Stoppage of Work. The most serious cases of stoppage  have been  in the black  bolt and nut  industry, which  has subsided,  and  at  Messrs.Beardmore&apos;s, Parkhead, where a lock-out has occurred.     (b.)  Not involving&apos;a Stoppage of Work. The most serious cases are among themunicipal employees at  Birmingham and Bradford.                            I. GENERAL REMARKS.Man-Power and the Amalgamated  Society of Engineers.    Information received during the past week indicates a considerable increase inthe expression of support of the Government  in the  matter  of  the  man-powerproposals, and this not only from quarters where support might have been expected,but also from some where  opposition has hitherto been most pronounced.  FromCoventry a report has been received of a meeting of employees of the Humber Works,at which a resolution to resort to drastic action in opposition to the proposals wasdefeated by a majority of 4,000 to 43.   In Glasgow, where hitherto the  pacifistrevolutionary section has had matters all its  own  way, meetings have now beenheld at which opposition to the Government on this question  has been  forciblydenounced.  From Leeds and Sheffield reports have been received which  indicatethat the dictation of the revolutionary section of the shop stewards will not, betolerated much longer.  Perhaps the most significant feature, however, has been theresolution of the Administrative Council of the Shop Stewards to the effect that theyare not the body to  deal with technical grievances  arising out of cancellation ofoccupational exemptions from military service embodied in the Man-Power Bill, andthat they  must therefore  leave  such grievances to be dealt with by the officialorganisations concerned.  In view of the previous attitude of the shop stewards andof their consistent assumption of omnipotence in the past, this is perhaps the most      [1100-15]                                                  &quot;   B
 important indication of.the strength of loyal support to the Government, hitherto unexpressed, and of the far-reaching results  of the feud between the A.S.E.  and the other unions.  It is incredible that the National Shop Stewards&apos; Executive would have adopted  this attitude had they anticipated any possibility of success from drastic action against the man-power proposals.  The same conclusion can be  drawn from the reluctance to take drastic action in individual cases.   The date fixed to &quot; down, tools &quot; on the Clyde has been postponed at least twice, and this hesitation is clearly due to a suspicion that a call for  drastic action would not be generally supported.  A similar hesitation, doubtless due to similar causes, has been observed at Barrow, while at Manchester prospects of success in a policy of drastic opposition are now exceedingly doubtful.   On the  North-East Coast the Government proposals will be supported by the general body of workers.     The  position has in fact  materially  changed.    As has been pointed out in many of the leading journals the quarrel is now recognised as being, not one between the Government and Labour, but  one between one trade union and the rest  of the engineering trade.  The  claim of the A.S.E. for exclusive and preferential treatment, though supported possibly  by their experience last May when  the trade card  was withdrawn, has aroused the most  intense hostility on  the part of the other unions. and, apart altogether from any sense of loyalty to the Government or to the nation, on the part of other unions, the action of the A.S.E. has rallied them to the support of the Government.  Should the A.S.E. proceed to extremes they could  not  expect any other result  than  signal  defeat, which would  be welcomed by  the  other organisations.     That this position is realised  both by the executive and  by the rank  and  file of this society is clear from the shifting of the  ground on which they take their  stand. The attitude of &quot; peace  at any price &quot;  which was commonly expressed three  weeks ago Jias changed.  Now, at all branch meetings from which resolutions are submitted, insistence is placed on the principle of  the conscription of dilutees in preference to skilled men.   In many quarters,  and  some  of them (as  for   instance London) exceedingly important quarters, resolutions have been passed assuring the  Govern- nient of the entire support of the society in the prosecution of the war, if it can be demonstrated that continuance of the war  is essential  to the overthrow of Prussian militarism.    These symptoms combined  indicate that  the A.S.E. would welcome any  loophole of escape from the position in which it has placed itself.  Failure to escape from that position might even produce an actual cleavage  in the A.S.E.  itself.    From Sheffield,  for instance, a rumour is reported that  in the event of a strike the older members of the A.S.E. would  combine  with dilutees  to form   a new  society  in opposition to the A.S.E., and this rumour receives a certain amount of support from the fact that the shop  stewards  of Sheffield appear  adverse  to a strike on  the man-power question, as they anticipate that  it would be unsuccessful.    The opinions of the Labour press on the present position are dealt  with in Part  II of this; report.    The daily  press which, especially  after  Mr.  Arthur Henderson&apos;s statement which was  published  in &quot; The Times,&quot; on the 1st February, was inclined to put the blame for the position upon the Government, has been much impressed by the official communique published next day.  There is, however, a very largely expressed and proper opinion, that it would be wise to afford the A.S.E. an opportunity of retreating,  without excessive sacrifice of dignity, from the position which it has adopted.  This opportunity has now been afforded in the announcement contained in to-day&apos;s press.    It is difficult to reconcile the present position  with the blatant and enthusiastic revolutionary atmosphere, which characterised the first session  of the Nottingham Conference. Experienced and impartial observers present at that Conference werevery seriously impressed with the importance  of that display.    The reception ofM. Litvinoff and M. Longuet by the Conference, and the enthusiasm of the responseto the wilder and more daring ebullitions of their oratory, justified an impressionthat representative Labour  was tinged  with pacifism  and national disloyalty to a much larger  extent than  is disclosed  by the present position.    It is probablylegitimate to conclude that the Conference was not truly representative of organisedlabour, of which the overwhelming bulk is; loyal and temperamentally conservative. The result of the Prestwich election is  a  further  proof that the new ambitions ofthe Labour Party have  not yet inspired  all those^ whom it hopes to attract, andthat it will require a national not a class programme, if it is to succeed.   It requiresa serious position affecting the  well-being  of the nation as a  whole to stir the loyal
majority to the effort of articulation.   The  man-power  question  is a  nationalquestion  of this nature, and  organised  Labour has  consequently  been  roused toexpress its real opinion.  It must also be remembered  that, on the present, occasion,support of the. Government and of national policy has been very largely stimulatedby the hostility to the pretensions of the  engineers.  Nor must it be concluded thatthe undoubted support of the  majority will remove all  difficulties  in carrying outthe Government programme.   It is  so probable as to be  practically certain thathostility  will  in certain places take the form  of strikes, perhaps, of serious strikes.The Government has,  however, now the advantage of  a clear-cut issue, and on thatissue has the undoubted support of the nation as a whole.   One obvious lesson fromthe history of the past four weeks is the value to the Government of a strong andconsistent&apos; policy.  Such a policy rallies the nation to the support of the Governmentin cases  where any  weakening  would probably result in defeat,  and somethisgapproaching disaster.                             II -PEESS COMMENTS.The Labour Party Conference.     The Labour  and Socialist press is  far from re-echoing the comment of thedaily press as to the ineffective character of the Labour Party Conference.     Almost ail the papers are agreed that the peace aspect of the Conference wasmost marked.   The  &quot;pacifist &quot;  section is quite jubilant,  and the more  moderatesection apparently of the opinion  that it marks a milestone on the road to peace.Mr. Ramsay MacDonald in  &quot;Forward,&quot; seems  doubtful  whether it was as  goodas it might have  been, but admits it was &quot; far beyond &quot; last year&apos;s Conference atManchester, and  this latter view  is supported in almost identical words by the&quot;Labour Leader,&quot;   Herald,&quot; &quot; Call,&quot; South Wales &quot; Pioneer,&quot;  and other papers.The reception of the foreign delegates is  regarded as particularly significant of thefuture.   Mr. Purdy&apos;s speech  is treated  merely as the opinion  of  an individual,and as being very much behind the general spirit of the Conference.  Mr. Hender-son  is regarded as the  outstanding  figure, even  by those  papers which are indisagreement with him, and  his &quot; rapprochement &quot; to Mr. MacDonald is held tobe particularly significant.   In this connection Mr. Lansbury in the &quot;Herald&quot;takes the lead,  but he is also  very desirous  of  avoiding attacks on Labour leaderswhose views on the war  do not coincide with his own. Unity for the struggle  afterthe war  he regards  as  essential, and  the &quot;Woolwich Pioneer &quot; thinks  that thisdesire for &quot;unity of purpose&quot; was  the  most important aspect of the Conference.     &quot;Justice &quot;  is rather gloomy, and,  while averring that the affair was more ofa demonstration than a conference, more or less admits that the Independent LabourParty captured it.   The &quot; British Citizen &quot; is mainly concerned with the attackwhich was made on the  &quot; British Workers&apos; League,&quot; an aspect which receives  someattention from  other papers.   The &quot; New Statesman &apos;&apos; thinks that the Conferencewas sound  on the war,  but regrets the reference back of the proposed new consti-tution for the. Labour Party,  an attitude which is that of the others, with a fewexceptions, such as &quot;Justice,&quot; and the &quot;New  Witness.&quot;Man-Power and the A.S.E.     This subject  continues to  attract a considerable  share of attention.     The iu.transigeant policy of the A.S.E. meets with a surprisingly large measureof support, but as far  as the &quot;pacifist &quot; press is concerned the affair is judgedentirely in the light of its probable effects on that movement.   The  &quot;  Herald,&quot;for example, talks quite openly about  its connection with u the people&apos;s  push forpeace.&quot;   The question is  now entirely &quot; the Governments War  Policy &quot; and notthe precedence of one union over another.     The more bourgeois group,  whether pacifist  or  not, is united in advising theGovernment to consult the A.S.E. separately.   They think that Sir Auckland Geddeshas not displayed that ability in politics  which he has displayed in administration.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; thinks  that the executive of the A.S.E. has taken  up  aposition less advanced than the feeling of its  members- would warrant, and  is ofopinion that the officials of the other engineering unions do not represent their  rankand file.
    The &quot;Clarion&quot;  continues its argument that the A.S.E. are destroying theessential principles of democracy, but ascribes the trouble to a set of &quot; boys,&quot; whilethe &quot; British Citizen &quot;  says it is  pure &quot; Bolshevikism.&quot;The Food Problem.    The volume of comment on the food situation has declined somewhat, thoughthe queues continue to be a subject of bitter comment.   The &quot; Herald &quot; and &quot; Call &quot;have now definitely left the  realm of criticism for that of rhetorical condemnation,but other papers begin to acknowledge that the Ministry  of Food, if not uniformlysuccessful, have done a great deal of useful work.  In this connection recent speechesby Mr. dynes-are  quoted with approval, even by such a paper as &quot;Justice.&quot;Peace and War.    This subject is  this week  dealt with  chiefly as  an aspect of  the NottinghamConference, but apart from that there is some comment on the recent declarationsby  Count Hertling and  Count Czernin.    The &quot; Call &quot; devotes a leading article to this subject, and while admitting thatthe Chancellor&apos;s speech  was unsatisfactory, asks whether Mr. Lloyd George wasany better. it  is  still &quot; diplomats against  diplomats.&quot;   The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot;on  the other hand, thinks that the &quot; prospects of peace are certainly brightened bythe speeches,&quot;  which were  &quot;intended to follow up  the  more pacific declarationsrecently made by Mr. Lloyd  George and President Wilson.&quot;Go-operators and  Politics.     The advent of the Co-operative Societies  into politics has not been receivingmuch attention recently,  but during the past week various of the provincial Labourpapers  have contained references  to propaganda meetings which  do  not appear tohave been a great success.     There are signs that the  mass of co-operators are  uneasy&quot; as to the positionwhich has  been taken  up,  and  the  &quot; Co-operative  News,&quot;  which represents theadvanced section,  complains bitterly of an unscrupulous  campaign to discredit themovement.                           III.-DISTRICT REPORTS.London.    The most serious discontent in this district is at present occasioned by the foodshortage, which has again caused threats of strikes.   Thus at a meeting of GreatEastern Railway workers at Stratford a  resolution was passed favouring a down-tools policy to gain more equitable distribution of food.   At Croydon the munitionworkers determined to cease work on the 2nd, but later this strike, which would haveinvolved 10,000 workers, was abandoned.   At Messrs.  Vickers&apos; works at Crayforddemonstrations, which were finally dispersed by the police, were held on the questionof food shortage by a large number of workmen.  Similar  riotous proceedings  aresaid to have taken place in other parts, and it is feared the food situation is leadingto a marked increase in lawlessness.    Apart from this cause of discontent, the danger  of a  strike of the ElectricalTrades Union is prominent, which, if it should  take  place, would be  followed byserious consequences.   At a meeting in the Holborn Hall on the 28th a resolution infavour of a strike was passed unless the  12^ per cent, bonus were conceded to all;while a further resolution pledged the union to strike in sympathy with the Clydeupon the man-power question.    The temper of the leaders of this union^ which is a new and ambitious organisa-tion, is generally bad, and their policy will probably be dictated by opportunism.    No improvement has been reported from Hendon, where  the aircraft workers arestill somewhat restless.West Midlands.    The application of the 12-^ per cent, bonus seems to be causing considerable difii-culty in this area, and has resulted  in strikes at Smethwick and Darlaston.
[1100-15]C     Reports received from the Ministry of Munitions suggest that the rank and file among the engineers are likely to take a stronger line than their executive.  They are determined to oppose by every means the calling up of their members before dilutees.     During the last week the meat  shortage has been producing much discontent, and in Birmingham several butchers&apos; shops were raided by munition workers, though the general food situation is said to be much better here than in neighbouring towns in the district which have  not introduced rationing schemes.  A meeting at Wed- nesbury was attended by about 2,000 workers, and a protest made against the present system of distribution.   A further meeting was arranged for Saturday last. Yorkshire and East Midlands,     A prominent position appears to be occupied  in this district by the  question of man-power,  and opinion seems on the whole to be in opposition to the Government upon this point.   The A.S.E. are receiving strong support from the British Socialist Party and I.L.P., who are reported to have  carried unanimous votes in support of the Russian terms of peace,  and various branch meetings of joiners, electricians, &amp;c, have agreed that a fight to the death is no longer the best policy.   It is thought locally that the best way of dealing with the situation would be to take the men at their word as regards diluted labour, which may otherwise become the rallying cry for a general strike among the engineers.     In Halifax and Peterborough the constitution  of the  Food  Committees has caused discontent, and in the case of the former the discontent has been accompanied by a threat of refusal to work overtime,  At Nottingham drastic action is threatened unless equal distribution is at once introduced. North-Western.    The Man-Power Bill and the question  of food both cause a considerable feeling of unrest in  this district.  As regards the former, prominence seems largely to be given to the position of dilutees;  thus the Lancashire and  Cheshire miners require that these  shall be taken from the mines before  they will consent to consider the recruiting question with the Government.  In the Alkali Co.&apos;s  works much discon- tent is being caused by the employment of Irishmen of military age, and this feeling extends to the women in Dennis&apos;s Copper Works.    An important meeting was held by the Mersey Federation  of Engineering  and Shipbuilding Trades at  Liverpool on Sunday.   While disclaiming that they desired &quot; peace at any price,&quot; the speakers supported the demands which have recently been made for the holding of an international workers&apos;  conference.    The members of the A.S.E. both  at Barrow and in the Manchester district are determined to stand by their leaders, though in neither case have they declared them- selves in favour of resisting the comb-out.    The  representative of the Ministry of Munitions  in this area  states that members of the other unions have been entirely alienated by the attitude which the engineers have adopted.    There appears to have been some improvement  in the food  situation, and at * Barrow a proposal for a  protest strike which had been put forward has been dropped, in order to give the local committee a chance of introducing a rationing scheme.North-Eastern.    The majority of the members of the A.S.E. are reported to  be prepared to sup- port their executive.   It does not, however, appear that there is any serious objection to the  man-power proposals in themselves, though the feeling against the dilutees is in many places very strong.    With regard to the food question, the position in Newcastle seems to have grownworse, and in Sunderland a protest demonstration will probably be organised for the10th February.    The award of the Vl\ per cent, bonus is still causing some difficulty among theironmoulders in relation to piecework.South Wales.    The question of man-power takes prominence in this area, and the decisionsof the miners seem to favour a ballot as to the future action of the Federation. Someindication is  given that the demands of the  Government are not excessive in this
area; for, at the same conference at which the determination to ballot on the man-power question was come to, it was determined to press for a five-day working week,since in the opinion of the conference this would have &quot; no detrimental effect upon thesupply of coal for all purposes.&quot;     At the same conference a  strict system of rationing was demanded immediately,and the Government was urged to commandeer all sources of food.Scotland.     The situation in the Clyde area has improved.    At a number of public worksthroughout the district disapproval of the men who attended Sir A.  Geddes&apos; meetinghas been expressed, and the workers in numerous firms have  passed loyal resolutions.It should be noted that Sir A. Geddes&apos; meeting was practically a packed gathering,as arrangements were not made to secure that all sections got tickets, with the resultthat they nearly all went to supporters of the  C.W.C.   Again,  at an important meet-ing of some 3,000 apprentices on the 31st, which was addressed by John McLean andothers in violent  terms, a considerable lack of enthusiasm was manifest.  Meetingsof the C.W.C., however,  still continue  to be extremely violent  in tone, and at one ofthese it was proposed that every deportee should be nominated as  a Parliamentarycandidate in the Labour interest.     Members of  this body are attempting to carry their   propaganda  elsewhere.Gallacher has been in Belfast, where he received a distinctly  hostile reception, andothers have been attempting  to  persuade the miners to come  into  line  with theengineers.  The West of  Scotland is  reported to have been  divided into fourteendistricts, and a delegate to have been appointed to each one in order that the situationmay be properly  investigated.     Regarding the industrial situation, a serious view is  taken of the  dispute atMessrs. Beardmore&apos;s Works, Parkhead, in view of  the disturbed condition of Labourthroughout the district.                                   IV; DISPUTES. (a.)  Involving a stoppage of work.     The number of workers involved in the short strikes which are occurring all over the country as protests against the food situation is becoming a matter of serious national importance.            On the 29th January practically the whole of the munition workers in Bedford, to the        number of 10,000, held a demonstration against the local Food  Committee.   At Luton a        similar affair took place shortly afterwards, while at Crayford 1,500 engineers employed by        Messrs. Vickers held a demonstration on Saturday last.  Even more serious stoppages have        been narrowly averted, or in some cases are still  threatened.     The Shipyard Labour Department reports nine new cases of stoppage.            These, however, involved only  some 3,000  men,  and together with the 18 old  cases        in progress at the beginning of the week they have been settled, and work has been resumed.            There was a temporary  recurrence of the trouble over  the riveting rates  at Messrs.        Beardmore&apos;s shipyard on the  Clyde, but the strike, after lasting three days, came to an end        on the 31st January.    The Ministry of Munitions reports that a widespread strike in the black bolt andnut industry has taken place in the Midlands, involving all the firms in Darlaston,two in Smethwick, and one in Birmingham.           The strike, which involved between 3,000 and  4,000  workmen, lasted from the 28th        January to the 1st February,  and the men eventually returned to work on being advised by        the Ministry of Labour that a conference would be arranged for the discussion of the difnculty         one arising out of the 12^ per cent, bonus which had occurred.           Six other strikes are reported as having arisen  out of the same question, but in four        cases settlements have been effected.           The strike of bricklayers  in South  &quot;Wales, which had led to the closing down of steel-        works, collapsed on the 4th February.  A strong  line was taken by all the parties concerned        against treating with the men before they resumed  work.  Now  that they have done so a        conference will immediately take place for the discussion of the points at issue.           The trouble at Messrs. Barr and Stroud&apos;s, Glasgow  (incorrectly described as a &quot; lock-        out &quot; in last week&apos;s Beport, though  in reality a  stay-in strike), has not yet been definitely        settled.  The matter in dispute is the  conversion of a premium bonus into a time-rate system,       and arises indirectly out of the 12J per cent, bonus.          Another serious stoppage,  arising  out of the same award, is in progress at Messrs. Beard-       more^, Parkhead.   About 1,500 steelworkers refused to work over the week-end, and have       been  locked out, the firm stating that they cannot keep the furnaces going unless the  men       remain over the week-end.  It is feared locally that unless prompt measures are taken to       deal&quot; with this trouble it may spread to other works.
     The Coal Controller reports six new cases of strike,  involving over 12,000 men, all but one of which have been settled.   In three of the five old cases referred  to resumptions of work have taken place.            The stoppage at the Oakdale Colliery,  South Wales, which involved 1,400  (not 14,000)        men, has come to an end,  and most of the other cases  are one-day demonstrations rather        than serious strikes.   In the Midlands and South Wales  the food problem has been respon-        sible, while in Scotland some 3,000  men in Lanarkshire remained idle for one day as  a        protest against the Man-Power Bill.     The War Office Contracts Department has seven cases of stoppage to report, two of which have arisen during the week.   In one case a settlement has been effected.            The most important of the  new cases is that which involves 400 hands employed  by        Messrs. Myers and Co., London, and has arisen out of delay in referring to arbitration  an        application for a bonus in hat and cap making equivalent to that granted by the Committee        on Production to the clothing trade in October last.            Most of the sheet-metal workers,  who have been on strike in the London district for the        past fortnight, returned to work on the 2nd February on the understanding that  negotiations        in regard to the points at issue should  forthwith take place. (b.) Not involving  a stoppage of work.     Serious disputes are again occurring among municipal  employees and  employees of public utility companies.   The drivers and guards in the service of the Birming- ham and Midland Omnibus Co. were recently refused an increase in wages.           They are  now threatening to strike, and declare that they ought to obtain a proportion        of the pro-fits derived from increases in the fares which have recently taken place.   In spite        of the fact that a  strike would cause serious inconvenience to munition workers, the latter        are encouraging the malcontents in their action.           At  Bradford an  agitation among the employees of the Corporation for an increase  of        wages by a pound a week over pre-war rates has developed during the last few days, and&apos; a        strike which would involve 5,000 workers is possible.   The grants  so- far given amount to        12s. for men and 6s. for women, and the Corporation have offered an increase on this of 5s. to        men and 3s.  to women.  This has been refused by a majority of the workers,  but opinion        seems to incline towards arbitrating the dispute.     The  Shipyard  Labour Department reports 61  controversial  cases as  having. arisen during the past week, making, in conjunction with the old cases still pending, a total of 147; 38 of these cases have, however, been settled.     The Ministry of Munitions reports that further disputes over the 12-1 per cent. advance,  which have not  so far resulted in a stoppage of work, are in progress at nine firms.           Disputes are in progress or are threatened&apos;at three other works.  The most important of       these is  the alleged victimisation of three power loom tenters who took part in the  tenters&apos;       strike in Ulster in  October of last year.   A verbal undertaking was given by the employers       at the conference  at which  this dispute was setlted, and the Ministry of Munitions are       bringing this to the notice of the  firm in question.     No new disputes  are reported  by the Coal Controller, although  eleven  which have been previously referred to are stated to be still in progress.           The Committee on Production have issued an award  embodying an agreement between       the Surface Workers&apos; Federation and the West Yorkshire Coal Owners; the latter are now       applying for sanction to an increase in the price of coal.     The Chief Industrial Commissioner states that about 160 new reports of  differ- ences, apart from those arising out  of  the interpretation  of  awards, have been received by his Department; 72 of these are cases arising out of the 12^  per cent. bonus, and rather more than one-third of  the whole affect the engineering, shipbuild- ing, and metal industries.  The  number, of cases referred  to arbitration is given as 73.    The Committee on Production has heard 28 cases during the past week,  13 inLondon and the others in Scotland.  A number of cases were  also heard by the specialarbitration tribunal which is dealing with cases which have arisen out of the 12^ per cent, and 1\ per cent, advances.  Important awards on  the claim of the shipwrightsand boiler-makers to the  12^ per cent, have been  issued.    Operative bakers are  again very restless in various parts of  the country, andstrikes are threatened in  the near future at Manchester,  Birmingham, and North-ampton.    At  Birmingham the question of  Sunday baking  is again the  cause oftrouble, while in the other centres named the disputes have arisen out of applicationsfor increased wages.
