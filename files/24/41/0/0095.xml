SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,  Department of Information         FIW/027.WEEKLY  REPORT  ON  ITALY, XXVII.     (Feb. 8th,  918)War-alms discussion and the position of Baron Sonnino.   The publication of the official communique concerning the resultsof Signer Orlando1s visit to London, with its assurance that alluncertainties had been removed and a complete unity of view attained,has not entirely allayed Italian apprehensions and suspicions inregard to the intentions of the Allies.   It was however ratfeer againstthe Italian Foreign Office than against the Allies that Italian re-eentment was mainly directed,and it seems probable that, whenParliament meets, the attack of last session on the position ofBaron Sonnino will be renewed^ this time perhaps under circumstancesmore favourable to their success.   On the one hand he is blamed forresisting and delaying an explicit modification  of Italy!s preten-sions, which if it had been made some months ago,  would have rescuedItaly from a false position and prevented recent misunderstandings.On the other, the Oiolittian Stampa suspects that he has allowedhis Minimum&apos; programme to be still further whittled down by theAllies and calls upon Parliament to go closely into the matter andto see that responsibilities are fixed upon the right persons.Meanwhile if we may judge from the language of the Glgrnale d&apos;Italia,Baron Sonnino&apos;s attitude remains quite uncompromising towards any                                                             /further renunciations on the part of Italy.    &quot;The immutable^nationaiprogramme&quot; it says,  will be re-affirmed by Orlando ^vHifan&quot;.   Itseems possible that there may be a difference of ooiWon in thismatter between Sonnino and Orlando and that this may account forthe postponemsnt of the promised declaration.     r-^\
                            - 2 &quot;*   The announcement that no collective formulation of peace-termsand national claims had resulted from the meeting at Versailles ofthe Allied War Council disappointed Italian exoectations.   VEpocaa newly-started journal whose edtUi   is said to be an enthusiasticadmirer of Orlando - tries to allay the disappointment by explainingthat the declaration which, the journal says, will be made by thePresident of Council when Parliament meets (the meeting has beenpostponed from Feb. 7th to Feb. 12th) on the subject of War-aims,coming last in the series of Allied Government pronouncements andafter the Versailles meeting, will necessarily represent the agreementnow reached between the Allies and will have the same value as acollective document.   It is much to be regretted that the Italian oublic is to be.obligedto wait so long for an authoritative statement on the subject ofAllied War-aims such &quot;*s would have out an end to doubts and disquie-tudes and to the exploitation of them by those who are interested inmaking trouble between the Allies.   The effect of Mr. Lloyd George*sand President Wi3json&apos;s recent references to Italy and to Austria hasundoubtedly been to depress the spirit and puzzle the minds of thepatriotic and to delight and strengthen the Clericals and Giolittians,thus making distressingly diffjfccalt the already sufficiently diffi-cult task of our best friends, the Interventionists.   Symptomaticare the remarks on Anglo-British relations recently sent to theSeoolo by  iss London Correspondent, who says that while BarcnSonninoVs speech at the Queen&apos;s Hall marked the zenith of inglo-Italian friendship, there has since been a certain cooling.  &quot;Mr.Lloyd George&quot;, he adds, &quot;returned from Rapallo a changed man so faras Italy was concerned.   He became a critic instead of an enthusiastand his speeches and messages thenceforward lacked cordiality towardsItaly&quot;.
Italo-Slav Entente.   The movement towards an 1 entente oordiale&apos;  between Italy and theSlav another subject races    Austria appears to be gaining ground.It is supported not only by the liberal Corrlere della &amp;era and theRadical Seoclfl  but further by the gazzetta del Popolo of Turin(liberal), the ex-(?iclittian Tribuna and the usually Chauvinisticand Clerical Mattino of Naples, while even Vldea Nazionale, the mostextreme champion of Italian pretensions in all fields and hithertothe bitter enemy of the Jugoslav Committee, shows signs of relaxingits Mstility.,   While holding that all idea of a pact or of a renun^elation on the.part of Italy is for the present out of the question,it thinks that Italians should enter into tentative relations with theforces which are working for the formation of Jugoslavia.   On theSlav side La Serbic\ the organ of the Jugoslav Committee, warmlywelcomes the Italian movement, while Dr. Trumbitch, President of theJugoslav Committee has addressed a letter to the Seoolo in the samesense, dwelling om the intolerable position of the peoples subject toAustro-Hungarian oppression,  the true character of which, he says, isonly understood fully by these who have lived under it or who havelistened, as the Italians have, to the groans of their oppressed kin? -men.   !?hat the movement has at least the good-will -of the ItalianPremier may be gathered from expressions used by him in the course ofan interview with the Paris Temps.   &quot;Italy&quot;,  he&quot; is reported to havesaid, &quot;will hold out the right hand of fellowship to all nations -even such as have got to conquer their independence - who are preparedto take effective action in the common cause of the Allies.   Werecognise no distinction between our particular interests and thecommon interests.nor any incompatibility between our rights and therights of others&quot;.   Signer Orlando also had a long conversation wit))Dr. Trumbitch and ftwth other, representative Slavs in London.   TheCongress of the Interventionist &quot;League of National Defence&quot; he,ld a
 few days ago in Milan is reported to have $pssed a resolution declar- ing that the Austrian question is of no  less international impor- tance for the Balkan peninsula thai, the  German peril,  and that Austria-Hungary&apos;s dismemberment in accord with the wishes of the Danubian and Balkan peoples is indispensable for that  object and to secure their future. Speeches of Hertling and Czernin.    Italian intsrpretations of  the von Hertling and Czernin speeches do not differ from those of Allied Countries ,   Taken together they are regarded as a skilful blending of cajolery with defiance.   Those Italians who are oppesed to any curtailment of Italy&apos;s pretensions5the Consults and the Giclittians) make U3e of the defiance to empha- sise the futility of all modifications and renunoiations as a means of conciliating or dividing the enemy.    Not even the  Clericals can find much peace-value in the speeches, though the jouim&amp;ls of the Catholic Trust are disposed to connect the uncompromising attitude towards Italy of Count Czernin with the  fvagueness 1 of Mr.  Llcyd George&apos;s and President Wilson&apos;s language in reference  to her rights. Internal Affairs.    In $he last week of January. Signor Nitti delivered  at Milan a forcible address in promotion  of the new War Jjoan.   Such touring of the provinces on the part of a Minister  is unusual dm  Italy and is                             down welcomed as tending 4o break/the Governmental tradition of reserve and aloofness and to introduce a habit of closer contact between Government and people.    Signor Nitti spoke very bluntly and threat- ened that if voluntary subscription did  not produce sufficient money, a forced loan would have to be resorted  to.    He named 6 milliards( 240,0^0,000 roughly) as the amount he wanted.   So far rather  more than 2 milliard lire have been subscrioed.   Signor Nitti spoke very warmly of the generous services rendered to Italy by Great Britain.
He exhorted his hearers to be deaf to the insinuations of those whowould depreciate Italy&apos;s Ally.  &quot;When&quot; he said,  &quot;you hear anyoneabusing England, look hira straight in the face and you will seebefore you either a spy or a traitor&quot;.   The Secretary of the Official Socialist party has been arrestedand imprisoned.   He has been denounced on various counts,  one ofwhich is that of organising for a general strike.
