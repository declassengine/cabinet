OP gR AT I 01 s.S B C R E fyroinGeneral de Oandolle.To:-O.X.G.S.Repeated:- Barclay,Received:- 8.45 p.in. 8/2/1O,27.Rostoff February 7th.General situation is still very critical.     It became necessary to abandon retaking of Taganrog owingohiefly to laok of (l group undecipherable) and the League1stroops have now been withdrawn to positions nearer Rostow.  Itis expected they will be able to hold these.     The Military ? situation is considered more dangerous tothe north of Novooheroask, where I am returning today.  The Dontrsops are endeavouring to defend the 2 railway junctions fromthe Bast and West about 60 miles northward of the town.  Thereis however muoh disaffection amongst Cossacks and rather strongBolsheviok foroes are reported to be moving from the Tsaritsindirection.     Bo far Rcstow itself is efficiently controlled by theLeague although at workshops and ? in most of the other servicesof the Yladikafkas railway the strike still continues.  G3jeother strikes duly terminated at the end of 3 days.     A local Bolshevick rising again took place on February 4tharound Ekaterincdar but was successfully overcome.  On the otherhand the main railway line between Tiohoritskaia and Armavirjunctions is in Bolsheviok hands.  This is what causes theoonstant interruptions on the telegraph to Tiflis and Londonour sole remaining means of communication.   -  My cables ? are consecutively numbered.  All those numbered16 to 26 inclusive I trust you have received.
