The weather during the past week was generally  fine,although the land is still wet as a result of recent snow and  rain.Reports from some districts state that ploughing was resumed onselected lands, and the outlook as a whole was encouraging.                  LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION.               Agricultural Executive Committees.Derbyshire *  The Committee have been authorised to take possession   -of 275 acres of Bretby Park.   The; deer on this park have beenkilled off by the owner, and the rabbits are to be entirely destroyedby him.   Of the area taken 225 acres will be cultivated uith cornand potatoes, and 50 acres will be kept for grazing.   It is statedthat the amount of fencing required in this case is not very great.Kent.  Upon a 60 acre farm in Romney Marsh, 55 acres are to beploughed up.   The occupier, who lives 60 miles away, was desirousof sub-letting the farm for the purpose to a large farmeradjoining, but the landlord would not allow him to do so.Accordingly the Committee, have been authorised to take possessionof the farm and to let it to the farmer referred to.Lincolnshire.  The Holland Committee have been authorised to takepossession of a farm of 320 acres at Uyberton,  which is  stated to
have been badly farmed by a nev; tenant.    It will be  let  indifferent portions to neighbouring farmers.Suffolk, \7est.  The Director-General of Lands has arranged,  at tisuggestion of this Department, for the Air Board to relinquish ljacres of land at Lakenheath Warren for cultivation.   Lord Iveaglhas undertaken that the cultivation shall be carried  out  at  hisexpense.   Had the land not been required by the Air  Board,  1,00 acres would have been so taken.   The Committee propose to takepossession of 60 acres of Euston Park and to cultivate for thecrop of 1918, and of another 200 acres to be cleared  for  cropping1919 in addition to the 450 acres referred to in the  weekly  repoifor the week ending 28th November, 1917.Sussex, East.

                  HORTICULTURAL DIVISION.Horticultural Organisation.  The number of HorticulturalRepresentatives is new 794, and considerable progress has been maderecently in the formation of Horticultural Sub-Committees of theCounty /crricultural Executive Committees.   The Horticultural Sub-Committees have elected represenatives of Women&apos;s War AgriculturalCommittees and in many cases also representatives of the EducationCommittee of the County Council.  The following Is a list of countiesin v!hich Horticultural Sub-Committees have been appointed:-  Bucks,Cambridge, Cornwall, Devon, Hereford/ Northampton, Oxford, Salop,rarv?ick, Wilts and Worcester.Preserving; Fruit and Vegetables.  The Section concerned with the house-hold preservation of fruit and vegetables is taking part in exhibitionsin London and at Norwich and Is making arrangements for assistingat an exhibition shortly to be opened in Exeter.   Turin? the pastweek, 53 demonstrations in fruit preservation have been given.Canning  / new pamphlet on the canning of fruit and vegetables isIn course of preparation.Provision of Land for Allotments.  Reports received by the DepartmentshoF that in 1,109 districts 222,835 applications have been made forplots under the Cultivation of Lands Order, and 201,805 plots,containing a total area of 14,687 acres, have been provided.          In practically every district many plots, not included inthese figures, have been provided by private enterprise.          The Board have entered on 10 acres of land at Sutton,  Surrey,for the purpose of providing a field garden for cultivation by  aLabour Battalion.          The Inspectors of the Allotment Section have visited  28centres during the past week, and as a result of their initiative                             -3-
 the  local  authorities  are  taking steos to acquire 626 acres of ?r which  *ould  suffice  to provide  9,106  new allotments,  . At Leeds, 333  acres  are  being  allocated in order to&apos; provide 5,000 allotment (15  to the acre).  The mining districts of the north are. increasi their  allotments.  Consett is taking  an additional 16 acres to pr allotments for 224 applicants,  Blaydon-on-Tyne llf acres for 161/ at Leadgate  2f acres are being  taken/  tfhen this area is allotted over 90f of  the householders *(900.in  1,060) will be provided.with allotments.                       . -    &apos; .. Basket Making,, The more closely the subject of basket making is considered,  the more it appears imperative that every endeavour s be made this year, not only to  make up the shortage of baskets. \ if possible  to supply  a surplus.           /fter protracted negotiations with the Cane and &quot;rillow Workers&apos; Employers&apos;  Federation, a draft agreement has been prepar If ratified, this will result in 25^  of -the labour employed by th Federation being engaged in the manufacture of agricultural baske The  Finistry of Food will  be  advised  to enter into the  agreement the  supply of  baskets  concerns   that  Department even more vitally it does the,Food Production Department.-  -           The  Ministry of  Pensions1. Scheme for training disabled soldiers in  basket making  has been approved and is now  awaiting Treasury sanction.   Ten prisoners of war are to be sent to Persli Co-operative Market  Limited,  and arrangements are under discussio: 7C prisoners of war  to work for the London Salesmen Association. /nnlications -  have been made  for  prisoners (basket makers). to  be to Eve sharp to  work at  basket  making under the Evesham ana:Pi strictMarket Gardeners&apos; /ssociation,    P licence has/been obtained for Association  to import  35,000  baskets  from Holland.                              -4-  .
Marketing.   Progress is being made in the drafting of a scheme ofmarketing the surplus produce of small cultivators.  Progress in thisdirection is necessarily slow, owing in part to the intricacy of thesubject and in part to the necessity of taking into account schemes,as for example those concerning transport, which are being.elaboratedby the Ministry of Food.,   The scheme which it is proposed to putforward for general adoption is one based upon experience gained invarious counties in which, a marketing organisation is already inexistence.Inspection of.Land.   Golf courses  at Fulwell and Park Langley have                                                           IBbeen inspected by one of the Advisory Officers,,  and suggestions madeas to the cultivation of portions  of them for a  crop in 1918,  Theformer course extends to about 190 acres, but only about 30 acres aresuitable for cultivation and this  area the club  are quite willing tosurrender.   The rest of the course will.be grazed by sheep,.          Park Langley Course extends to 110 acres and fxrms  part ofa tuilding estate of between 600 and 7.00&apos; anres,  in the futuredevelopment of which the golf course is regarded as an essentialfactor.   There has been no play on this course  for a year, and thewhole of it, including the greensj is being grazed by cattle  andsheep.   Part of the course is intersected by open ditches and istoo wet for cultivation.   It is studded over with large trees, butabout 50 acres is relatively free  from obstacles and could beprepared for cropping at relatively little expense.Use of Straw as Manure,   Investigations on this subject are  beingpursued in three directions, viz,, (1) the effect -of -directapplications-to field soils;  (2)  methods of fermentation in  bulkprior to application in the field; and (3) special types offermentation.
LABOUR DIVISION.Soldier Labour - Only 13 additional ploughmen from overseasarrived during the week, making a total of 1,416 such mensent home on two months&apos; agricultural furlough.  Of these me215 are out with Government horses, the remainder being withfarmers for ploughing work.   The War Office have informedevery Command that all but 226 of these men who are belowCategory &quot;A&quot; must be returned on the expiration of their furand urgent representations are being received from AgricultuExecutive Committees asking that the leave of these men mayextended as their services are urgently required and nosubstitutes are.at present available.          Exclusive of these men 33,099 soldiers (22,940 &quot;skiand 10,159 unskilled) have been attached to Depots to&apos; date, alof these men 28,624 (21,-366 skilled and 7,258 unskilled) havebeen sent out to farmers.          An additional 24 men were sent out for training astractor drivers during the week, making a total to-date,of 23men sent out for such training.          The supply of further skilled ploughmen is causingserious anxiety, as the Department  are unable to meet theurgent demands  for such men that are being received from theCounty Agricultural Executive Committees.   On the 13thDecember the Cabinet decided that the Department should befurnished with  some 8,000  to 10,000 ploughmen, made up ofGerman prisoners, Schleswig-Holsteiners, and men from theColonial Forces.  - Of these men there are available, or insight, only 4,300  namely  4,000 German  prisoners and 300Colonials.    In addition to these,  however, 2,200 ploughmenare  immediately required.
     (a)  to replace 1,200 soldiers sent home on two months1          agricultural furlough, and due to return to France          within the next two weeks, and     (b)  1,000 to act as gang leaders for prisoner gangs.          The demand for ploughmen is immediate and urgent, and itwill be exceedingly unfortunate if advantage cannot be taken ofthe present favourable weather to push on with the ploughing up ofgrass-land.   Moreover, the delay in the arrival of the Ford tractorsowing to the breakdown of the transport arrangements in America.makes it imperative for the Department to equip as many horse teamsas possible.Horses.  Orders for the issue of 76 additional horses have beensent out during the week, making a total of 5,306 horses to date.Prisoners of :%p.   Eighty prisoner ploughmen .have arrived at two ofthe Depots from which they are to be sent out with the Department&apos;shorses on ploughing work.          One additional prisoner camp for ordinary agriculturalwork was opened during the week, bringing the total number ofprisoners in such camps up to 3*686.   Prisoners employed fromparent camps number 1?008; making a total of 4*777 combatantprisoners now employed in agriculture.   The number of releasedaliens employed on farms is 1,463, the total number of prisoners onfarm work at the present time, therefore, being 6,240.          The additional prisoners for ordinary agricultural workapplied  or in schemes now with the War Office is 1,780, and 93 scheme;for-the employment of batches of prisoner ploughmen are now withthe Military Authorities-.   Information has been received asregards 35. of the. schemes that the premises have been approved, andin 5 cases the men are expected to arrive at thje-Depots- before theend of  the present week.
                     Women18 Branch.          The following are some examples of the closeco-ordination of work between the Agricultural Executive Commiand the foment County Committees.          In East Sussex the women&apos;s  Committee, which is beinp.housed in the offices of the Farmers&apos;  Union, is consulted dailthe Labour Sub-Committee with regard to applications for  soldilabour and for exemption from Military Service.          In this county also a series of annual meetings of tiFarmers1 Union are being held, and the Travelling Inspector ofWomen&apos;s Branch has been invited to attend all these and speakthe work which women are able to undertake.   These have beenhelpful, and a means of putting her in touch with farmers throthe county.          At a recent meeting of the West Suffolk Labour Sub-Committee, the Chairman stated that he would be glad if the WoroBranch would, if possible, substitute three Land Army Volunteer!the place of i. three men who should join the Colours, the posts tfilled being those of milkers.          Another example of such co-operation comes from Wilts!where the Organising Secretary has an arrangement with the MillAuthorities by which she is notified when there is a case ofsubstitution, and the 18 year old farm labourers are taken intoArmy.   Whenever possible women are recommended for employment.          6,970 members of the Land Army are accounted for thisweek as follows:-           In Instruction Centres  ......   ,.,    254           On farm work   . a.      ..........  5,605           Employed by the Forage Dept......,    6G9           Employed by the Timber Supply Dept  ...    172           Waiting to be placed in Training Centres   - 29           Waiting for employment in Depots    ...     63           Waiting in their own homes     ,.....    178                                                    6,970
Women&apos;s Institutesa      One of the WomenVs Institutes fn Oxfordhas started a weekly market for surplus garden produce on verysmall lines.   A Marketing Sub-Committee has been appointedand 15 Institute members in turn have made themselvesresponsible for the work involved each month.   Eleven newInstitutes have been formed this week.                 MECHANICAL CULTIVATION DIVISION.          The following statement shows the position as regardsthe provision of tractors owned by the Department:-          Consigned to County Committees and            Tractor Schools up to and including            28th January..........................    2,020          Consigning Instructions  given during            the week..............................      117          On offer to counties  ....................       63          Consigned to Scotland...................      127              &quot;     &quot;  Ireland  . .,........:..........   _82                                                    .  2,409          The following is  a list  of horse drawn implementssupplied to Agricultural Executive Committees          Ploughs..................................     1,838          Carts and Lorries........................       658          Cultivators.............................       505          Drills, Disc and  Hoe  ,...................        71          Harrows and Drags..................     1,406          Harrows disc...................        96          Potato Diggers . . .. ...,..................         7          Rollers.................................       835          The services  of a  number of  experts  from the  manufacturersof the various tractors now  in operation have  been secured  toact as Travelling Experts.    These men have  detailed  knowledgeboth of the erection of the  machines and field operations,  andare in a position to give advice  as to the care and upkeep  thatwill prove a valuable aid to Engineer  Mechanics in repair workand prevention of serious breakdown.                         .... -. 9  -
          The Travelling Expert, with the Engineer, will visiteach machine and make a short inspection.   The expert will the-point out parts which show undue wear, explain why thisoccurred, and indicate how to prevent it in future.   Repairs t:seem to require immediate attention will be undertaken under hisupervision, if no material delay is caused thereby, but the wowill actually be carried out by the mechanic who would ordinariperform it, so that when he has a similar repair to make, he wi-mow the shortest and quickest way to effect it.                   SUPPLIES DIVISION,Supplies Sub-Committees - Eight counties were visited lastweek and representatives of the Supplies Sub-Committees intervielby Officers of the Division.   In all about 38 counties have nov;been visited this month.Superphosphate - The quantity of Phosphate Rock dealt with bythe firms making Superphosphate under contract with theGovernment, has been gradually rising and amounted to 8,800 tonsin the week ending 12th instant.   This figure represents abouttwo-thirds of the total capacity of the plant available.          In order to save railway transport, makers ofsuperphosphate are required to restrict their deliveries withinsuch a radius of their works that the cost of transport shall no-exceed 15/-.   If they desire to supply customers outside thisradius, the consent of this Department and of the Ministry ofMunitions has to.be obtained.     During the present seasonpermission to deliver outside the radius has been given in anumber of cases, amounting in the aggregate to 24,000 tons.In this way the delivery of superphosphate in Cornwall and Devonand in Scotland and Ireland, has been facilitated.
Lime - The plant which has been erected by the Department forgrinding chalk at Croydon has been run experimentally, butowing to the wet condition of the chalk at the present timeof the year, it has not proved a success.   Arrangements fordrying lump chalk are now being made, and it is hoped that thedifficulty due to the wetness of the chalk will be overcome.Potash - The method of analysis for Flue Dust has now beensettled by the Government Laboratory, and the Fertiliser andFeeding Stuffs Methods of Analysis Regulations will need to beamended.   In the meantime, the Agents who collect this Dustfrom Blast Furnaces are being instructed to test it by the newmethod.Stable Manure - A proposal has been made to the War Officewith a view to the issue of definite instructions as to the charges-to be made for the sale of Stable Manure from Army CampsP   It isproposed that a charge ,of l/- per ton should be made for manurewhen carted by the purchaser, with a moderate addition to covercost of cartage, when undertaken by the Army0   In order toencourage delivery to allotment holders, it has been suggestedthat a small reduction in price should be made for manure soldto theim          The removal of manure from the Eelmoor dump,&apos;nearAldershot, is proceeding satisfactorily.Sunflower SeedIt has been suggested that sunflower growingmight, be encouraged for the seed, which would be crushed forthe oil and also provide cattle feeding cake.   It is felt that
sunflowers are not suitable as a serious crop for this purpose,and the difficulty of marketing the seed to crushing firms addsto the impracticability of the proposal.Seed Wheat.  It has been decided that small quantities of Ko.lNorthern Manitoba &apos;tfheat for sowing should be offered through theDepartment for distribution to farmers.   Professor Biffen hasundertaken to prepare a statement indicating the conditions underwhich this class of wheat may be grown with advantage in England.Seed Oats.       (1) Manx Oats.  Several parcels of these oats have alreadybeen delivered to Agents and growers.   The general quality of thshipment has been somewhat - disappointing and it has been foundnecessary to reject at Liverpool almost 70$ of the consignments ujto the present.   The parcels which have been selected for seed dnot cdmpare favourably with Scotch seed oats purchasable at aboutthe same level, namely, 65/per quarter.       (2) Irish Seed Oats.  The following are the particulars ofcargoes of Irish Seed Oats which have already arrived at Englishports            Cardiff         1,221 tons            Avonmouth         162   &quot;            Liverpool       1,060   &quot;making a total of about 2,445 tons.   Additional cargoes are onpassage.   It has been necessary to reject one of these cargoeswhich appeared to be unsuitable for seed purposes as it was badlycleaned and the difficulties of re-cleaning at the port are veryconsiderable *          Recent advice from Ireland indicates that it ought to b(possible for the Department to secure 10,000 tons, but from thisfigure we must allow a certain amount of rejections.
    (3)  &quot;ooten r.eod Oats.   Negotiations regarding the purchaseof seed oats from Scotland are progressing satisfactorily and it ishoped that actual purchases will he made at the beginning of nextweek.&quot;eed Potatoes,   A definite order has been received from the Armyin France for 5,000 tons to be delivered between the middle of Feb-ruary and the middle of April, at Irish or Scottish ports forshipment to France.         The total quantity of Scottish potatoes for which loadinginstructions have been issued up to the present amounts to 8,923tons, the total quantity delivered to 397 tons, but the smalldeliveries are fully accounted for by the unfavourable weather&apos; con-ditions which prevailed at the beginning of the new year, which madeit quite impossible to load potatoes without grave risk of damage.         Of the potatoes that were on rail during that period, agreat many have unfortunately arrived In an unsatisfactory condition,but the damage in most cases is not extensiveeSeed Barley.    Enquiries have been received for seed barley andsteps have been taken to ascertain whether there.is any realshortage, and, if so, where the shortage is most likely to be felt.Potato .  prayingi- A letter has been received from the Prime Ministerexpressing his opinion that all potato growers should takeadvantage of this year&apos;s facilities for spraying their crops. -         Spraying organisers and sub-organisers have now beenappointed to the following groups of Counties:-          1.   Northumberland and Durham.         2,   Lincolnshire,         3.   Norfolk, Suffolk.         4,   Yorkshire.          5,   Northants, Cambs, Hunts and Beds.             f          6.   Oxford, Bucks, Berks.          7,   Herts, Middlesex, Essex.         8,   Surrey, Sussex and Kent,          9,   ^ilts, Dorset, Hants.         10.   Tomerset, Devon, Cornwall.         11.   Hereford, Dorsetshire, Glos,         12,   &quot;outh Wales, excluding Glamorgan and Konmouth,              N,&apos; v.&apos;ales.
         Lectures have already begun in nearly all the areas,and some lecturers are now giving lectures every night in theweek.   There is a very heavy demand for the new leaflet onpotato disease and 75,000 copies have been dispatched duringthe last fortnight,  a scheme is now being drawn up wherebyspraying demonstrations will be carried out both in schoolgardens and on larg6 farms.Wart lisease in Potatoes.- The Wart Disease Staff is dealing iapplications for the issue of about 15,000 licences to occupielof infected premises and about 15,000 licences tc occupiers oflpremises which are within infected areas:  also with the issuelCertificates to large numbers of d alers and Co-operative Agedwho desire the Board1s authority to supply growers in infected!areas and premises with resistant varieties of seed potatoes.         Many occupiers of infected land are either beingsupplied direct with resistant varieties of seed potatoes bythe Department or are being assisted to secure their seedthrough the usual trade channels,Heed Control.  Four Headquarters Inspectors have been detailedlfor 1 o rk in connection with the Administration of the Testingof Heeds Order.  They will, In.addition to their other duties,lvisit seed firms in order to ascertain whether they understand!and are conforming with the requirements of the &quot;Order.  It isnot proposed to administer the Order in a penal fashion at theloutset, but in cases where breaches of the Order are being comlmitted, or very low quality seed is being offered for sale, an)admonishing letter will be sent to the delinquent, and hisfuture  action closely watched.         A letter La* been addressed by the Department to allthe  principal seed firms in England and &quot;Wales drawing theirattention to the requirements of the Testing of ?eeds Order, at]urging  them loyally to observe its terms in the interests offood  production,
Export of Seeds,  By arrangement with the War Trade Department allexporters of seeds have been asked to submit a statement as to thequantities of seeds which they desire to export during the periodFebruary - March.  These statements have been carefully examined andthe Tfar Trade Department has been recommended to issue exportlicences for such quantities as it is considered safe to allow tube shipped.  Applications for quantities of a number of varietieshave been refused, others have been reduced by 75, 50 and 25 percent, according to the need for retaining them for home use,  Onlythose varieties which are grown exclusively for export, or thesupplies of which are estimated to be ample for home use have beenallowed in full.Importation of Seeds,  Complaints have been received from anumber of seed firms with regard to the difficulties and delaysmet with in importing consignments of seeds into this countryfrom abroad.  These complaints relate more particularly to seedscoming from France and the United States of America.         The matter has been taken up with the Authorities In bothcountries, and it is understood that steps are now being taken whichshould expedite shipments so far as is possible under presentconditions of transport, which are responsible for most of the delays.2ilaZiL.L^^                             Complaints have been receivedfrom English purchasers of Grass Seed /as to their difficulty ingetting shipment from Ireland.  In response to representations bythe Department the Ministry of Shipping have arranged to clear theaccumulated consignments at Belfast, and about 500 - 600 tons ofseeds will be shipped shortly,                   I am.
