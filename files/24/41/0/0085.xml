INTERNAL CONDITION.. Political situation  remains  unchanged.   Twoor throe absconding Bengali revolutionaries  of  a  desperate character  werecaptured.    Prices  continue high almost everywhere, and further  looting  of bazaarsand; shops.has  occurred, chiefly in Bengal, but price of salt has eased a little.In Bombay city same  causes led  to somewhat  serious rioting,  which  waspromptly suppressed.
