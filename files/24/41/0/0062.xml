In April 1917 the above-mentioned Committees wereinformed that the War Cabinet had given the followinginstructions:-           &quot;The Port &amp; Transit Executive Committee to be advised           &quot;that the men of the Transport Workers&apos; Battalions           &quot;are available for work in private sidings and on           &quot;Railway premises, provided that the Battalion be           &quot;used only on Railway premises with the concurrence           &quot;of the Railway Executive Committee&quot;.           In pursuance of these instructions the TransportWorkers&apos; Battalion Scheme was applied experimentally in theBradford and Sheffield areas.    To enable this to be done theWar Office nominated representatives to serve on the LocalCommittees established for those areasy who v-ere made responsiblefor ascertaining and certifying whether there was in fact sucha deficiency in civilian labour as to warrant in the nationalinterests the withdrawal o... men from their military duties &apos;inthe Home Defence Army.           The experiment in both the above-named areas has beencompletely successful.   By the employment of a very limitednumber of men from the Battalions, blocks have been avoided andthe flow of traffic has been maintained.           In addition to the work at Bradford and Sheffield,the men of the battalions, at the request of the \,!ar Office,were at one time employed in considerable numbers on therailway at Steventon.           The experiment at Bradford and Sheffield havingproved completely successful, the l-nr Office was asked inAugust 1917 to nominate representatives to serve on the LocalCommittees, that were bein^ established, to cover the whole ofthe Railways.   The representatives of the Railway Executive
Committee and of the national Union of Railw&amp;ymen have beenappointed for each of theso Locel Committees, but the WarOffice has refused to appoint its representatives and inconsequence it has not been oossible to apply the TransportWorkers&apos; Battalion Scheme to the -Railways outside the Bradfordand Sheffield areasB           On the loth January 1918 the War Office informed theRailway Executive Committee that &quot;authority cannot be givenfor tr.e employment of menon rs i 1 way w ork&quot; ,of tho Transport &quot;orders1 Battalions ierevtttis                    urgent,and increasing necessity for helpfrom the Transport Workers  Battalions on the railways.  Thedemands for wagons can only be met by avoiding detentionsunder load, ;.-.nd it is most important that such civilian labouras is available should be supplemented as occasion  rises bymobile labour.           Until the&apos; Hallway 3xG0utive Committee snd the Port &amp;Transit Executive Committee are advised as to the decision ofthe War Cabinet on the points rcised in this letter, the men ofthe Battalions will continue to be used in the Bradford andSheffield areas notwithstanding the T/ar Office letter of the18th Janusry 1918.                               Yours faithfully,                      (Signed)   H. A.
