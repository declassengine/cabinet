                     (This  Document is the Property of            -      3$t                     His Sritannic IViajesty&apos;s Government;               ^  j                      :   ELECTRICAL,WORKERS.\ s *   y^^ubWfc a memorandum by the Commissioner of Police on the subject  of aJL-^ttZ&amp;x&amp;z  strike  of Electrical Trades Union Workers.;H1TE?L           I understand that the Admiralty and Army Council are prepared in case  of      a strike  to provide the necessary eleotrioians and stokers etc  at the request      of the Commissioner of Police, subject to the War Cabinet approving this      oourse.           It is of the utmost importance that the electrioal industry should not      be paralysed by  a strike, and I recommend that the necessary authority be given.                                            GE0.  CAVE.7th February,  1918.        The Eleotrioal Trades Union is a new Organisation that is particularly    aotive at  the present time.   Their Exeoutive  are endeavouring to  compel the    whqle personnel of every power station and every individual worker in the    industry to  join their Union.   They insist that the  Officers, viz., Shift    Engineers, Eleotrioians in charge, Switoh-board Attendants, etc.,  shall join    the Union.   The result of this would be the capture  of the eleotrioal industry    as a whole and, in consequence, the control of the whole of London industry,    it8 transport, and its food, all of whioh are  ultimately bound up  with elec-    trioity supply.        The Companies on the other hand feel that they must make a  sta.nd and pre-    vent their responsible officials from joining  the same Union as  the men because    in their view this would break down the discipline whioh is essential for    effective  working.   They are not opposed to Unions as suoh but  they consider    that the polioy off requiring the superior grades to beltng to the  same organisa-    tion as the  lower grades would make it impossible to  carry on work satisfactor*-    ily and might at any time result in a public service  being thrown  out of    working gear.        The Directors have oomplied with the Award of the Industrial  Commissioner    for the 121-  per cent, increase of pay, and the Companies are voluntarily paying    an extra War Bonus, making the War Bonus up to  1* in addition to  the 12J per    cent, increase on wages,        Having  agreed to give the above increases in salary and bonus they are    now making a stand as regards permitting the supervising personnel and higher    offibials  to join the same Union as the men;  in faot the largest  Companies    have definitely determined that they will not  agree to this.        The Uniok has as yet not put forward a formal demand that the whole    personnel  must jfin their Union.   If&quot; they put it forward, and if  the Directors    maintain their deoision, a strike may result.
       At any time, and with little or no notice,  the  Electrical  Trades Union  could oall out a considerable proportion of  the  Staff of the various Elec-  trioity Undertakings in the Metropolis.       The number affeoted would not be relatively large.    It would include  Stokers, Trimmers, Coal-hands. Dynamo Attendants,  Switoh-board  hands, etc.       If a strike took place and work could not be  carried on by voluntary  substitutes, there would be paralysis in the eoonomio life of London, for  this is essentially a key industry.   Public lighting, and the  lighting of  all public offices, faotories, etc., the working of  tramways, Underground  and other railways and the supply of electrio power  for  all purposes would  be brought to a standstill.       The maintenance of refrigeration in Cold Storages would be at once  affected, as would many Munition Factories,  the  manufacture of  aeroplanes,  the filling of shells, etc   It may be added, that  the  power required  for  search-lights would also, to a limited extent, be  affected.       The danger in connection with the Electrical  Workers is two fold.       They may strike upon the issue between  themselves and the  Directors of  the Companies as regards the whole personnel of  undertakings joining the  Eleotrical Trades Union.       If this difficulty is got over, they might, and probably would, declare  a sympathetic strike if the Amalgamated Society  of Engineers decided upon  that oourse of aotion.     &quot;  In the ciroumstanoes it becomes neoessary to  oonsider whether it is not  practicable by means of volunteer labour to  keep the more important Eleo-  trioal Undertakings in the Metropolis at work, and having regard to the  relatively small number affected this should present no  insuperable difficulty.       It is estimated that the minimum number of  persons  employed as competent  Stokers that would have to be supplied in the event  of a strike to enable the  several Undertakings to carry on work on a reduced soale but on a scalesufficiently large to avert serious dislocation of eoonomio oonditions would  be  about 400   exclusive of the Tubes, Underground, and other electric Railways.  If these are made available, the other work  could  be oarried cut by volunteer   workers.       These Stokers oould not be got together,  it i3  thought,  without the  help of the Admiralty.       If they oould be got together,  and if the Police would undertake to pro-  teot Generating and Sub-Stations, those whom I have  consulted,  and who  repre-  sent the Institute of Eleetrioal Engineers,  the  Chief Officials of the  .   :   London  Electric Supply, the London County  Counoil  Tramways  and the Office  of Works, are of opinion that, work oould be  oarried  on for a  few days at any  rate, and this might bring about a oessation of  the  Strike.
      I may add  that the Companies would find it neoessary to arrange for thexfeeding and  housing of their Staff upon the premises and for this purpose would require an adequate  supply of food.   They lay stress upon this beeause they fear  that  if their workers ventured to return home their families would be  terrorised by emissaries of the strikers, as has happened in past strikes.      The Tramway Service oould be maintained however only to a limited extent.                                                  E. R, H.4124-6.
