M7hmmBis Britannic  Majesty?s Government)&apos; &quot;-&quot;his  Document is the Property of  233/6&quot;SECRET.Intelligence 3ureau,Department of Information,0/6IT E I.: 0 R \ N D U I.&apos;onTHE  DANISH  SOCIALIST  PA.RTY  AND  ITS  GERKM?  CONTROLLERS.   In the last Report on Denmark (No.  IV of Jan.16)  a brief mentionwas made of the connection between the German and Danish Socialistsand the foundation of the &quot;Danish Workers&apos;  Fish Supply Co.&quot;  Fromfurther information which has come to  hand it appears that the saleof coal on this account from Germany did not begin till early In1917.   By the end of the year the turnover was about  3,300,000,and it was then stated by the Directorate of the Company &quot;that itwas a falsehood that large sums of money had gone out to Germany,for all the money earned remained in Denmark,  tb help the labourorganisations in their struggle against Caoitalisn&quot;.    The DanishState bought coal of the Company at cost price and it is statedsaved &amp; large sum for the t&amp;x payers I    The nett earnings of thisCompeny in 1917 are said to have been   350,000 and this, with acapital of  1200, of which only  600 was paid inJ   Under thesecircumstances the following somwehat unnecessary condition was madein tbe Rules of the Association,  &quot;the  sheres cannot  be transferredwithout the permission of the Board of Directors&quot;.   The Board of Directors consisted practically entirely oi well-known Danish Socialist leaders, prominent among whom are theMinister, Thomas Stauning, Herr Carl Madsen, Herr J.A.Hansen, HerrBorgbjerg ond others.  The German element consisted  of the promotorand Chairman of the Company, Parvus, alias Dr. Hslph:,nd, his(Feb.  4th,  1918)
secretary Kiefer, Schlarz, Albrecht etc.,   It would appear that theGerman authorities i.e. the German Government, stood as guarantors                           Iof the agreement with a Danish political party, therefore, thanks tothe leadars of this party, Germany has b  this method brought Danishpublic opinion, in so far as it is influenced by Social Democracy,under her direct control in Denmark.   The coal negotiations are not the only ones of the same kind, fcrin a professional sheet issued by the &quot;Danish Sweet, Chocolate andBiscuit Union&quot; it appeared that the Executive of the Co-operativeTrade Dnions had been in ffequent and intimate negotiations with theGerman &quot;Kriegs Arbeits Amt&quot; about the employment of Danish workersin Germany.   Dr. Helphandf&quot;Parvus&quot;) has characterised the chargesbrought againsthim as mere slanders and calumny, and appeals to the &quot;Candour andchivalry&quot; of the Danish public I   In reply the paper &quot;Kjflbenhavn&quot;suggests that if he thinks himself libelled he had better submit thecase to the test of a Danish Court of Justice, and adds a few ques-tions for Dr. Helphand to answer such as 1.  What is the explanationof Dr. Helphand&apos;s propaganda war literature issued through a dis-credited body of Danish Socialists?  8.  As Ptlratenberg alias Ganeckiwas paid by him,  Dr. Helphand cannot deny that Fllrstenberg smuggleddrugs and chemicals made in Germany out of Denmark and sold them atusurious prices to the Russian Red Cross, that the profits went toHelphand,  and that when Ftirstenberg was caught the Minister stauningwas used to try and help him out.  3.  That although Ftlrstenberg wasexpelled from Denmark has not Helphand met him in Copenhagen since ththat date?   One paper &quot;Vort land&quot; (Dec.29. &apos;17) sums up the case as follows:-           &quot;Danish farmers send butter,  pork rnd eggs to Germany        and thereby help the Socialists to earn millions.    The        Danish oublic is put on pork and butter rations in order        that Messrs. Kiefer and Co.  may earn millions.   A t)olitical        party earns millions which the whole rest of the party psys&quot;.
One of Dr.  Helfc)hand&apos;s chief assistants is one Schlarz of doubtfulnationality.    He is a -Jew,  born in Russia,  acclimatised in Germanybut not naturalised there,  has settled in Copenhagen since the warand has mode  a large fortune by &quot;war business&quot;   such as the exportof drugs etc.,  which would  seem to indicate  that he was in this alsoa partner of  Helphand (Parvus) and Ftlrstenberg (Ganeeki).    4n offshoot of the &quot;Danish Workers&apos;  Fuel Supply Co.,&quot; came intoexistence in  January 1917,  under the name of the &apos;*Danish Trade endIndustry Co.  ltd.&quot;   The Capital is about  3000.  Of which Hwlphandsupplied four fifths.    About November 1917  it was agreed to increasethe Capital to about  12,000.   Originally Helphand,  J.^.Hansen,  andWalther,  a  well-known Danish Socialist wase^the only Directors, but onAugust 17th,  1917 Kiefer of the &quot;Fuel Supply Co.&quot; came in, and the meetings of  the Company were held at the Fuel Supply Offices, afterhe was made a Director.   The business  of the &quot;Danish Trade Co.&quot; is said to be to buy cao-tured automobiles-in Germany and to store them in Copenhagen in thespacious buildings of one of the Socialist Unions (the Smiths andEngineers Union) of which the Directors are  again the same as thoseof the &quot;Fuel  Supply Co.&quot; -    The object of the &quot;Trade Co.&quot; which isan essentially German business,  is to keep out possible Danish corn-petition by underselling or &quot;dumping&quot;.   Helphand alias Parvus is in fact,  the superintendent of the Danishbranch of the German Imperial Socialists,  of which Dr. Scheiaermannis the head.   The &quot;KJflbenhsVE&quot;  newspaper recently stated that taking it all inall the separate peace brought about by the  Bolshevi&amp;s was the resultof the work of Borgbjerg, editor of the &quot;Social Democrat&quot; and head ofthe Danish  Socialists,  and  Stauning,  the above mentioned DanishMinister with their assistants Helphand alias Parvus. Ftirstenbergalias Ganecki of Warsaw,  now a member of the 3olshevik Committee in
                       -    - 4 - Stockholm, and who was expelled from Denmark by the police, Sklalz, a Russian, wanted by the Danish police but who is frequently in Copenhagen with his above mentioned friends, and Xolowski, who is at present Chief Justice of the Bolshevik Tribunal at Petrograd.  The whole movement, it added, was organised and directed by Dr.Scheider- mann, the head of the German Socialists.   It is stated that Mr. Christensen, the Danish Minister and leader of the Liberal party in the Cabinet, who has just resigned, was acquainted with the connection between the Danish and German Socialists at the time coal was : bought from the &quot;Fuel Co.&quot;.   Abortive attempts have been made to establish in Norway a counter- part of the &quot;Danish Pood Supply Co.&quot;.  Two German Socialists, Wilhelm Jansson and Baake, a newspaper editor, oame to Christiania with the object of inviting the Norwegian Socialists to sign an agreement about the delivery of German coal,  about 40,000 tons to the Norwegian Trade Unions.    In return,  the Norwegian Socialist press should pejl]dge itself to &quot;write favourably&quot; about the German Government, and the Socialist group in the Stofcting lend its assistance to repeal or modify the fish agreement with England.   These conditions were considered unaaceptable.    Later on Herr Baake again approaohed the Norwegian Socialists on the subject, and an agreement was suggested without conditions.   To  the credit of the Norwegian Sosialssfcs this proposal was also refused.    The Agent employed in Norway was the Norwegian Socialist Sverre Iversen.   It is reported that the firm Hoffman - Bang and Boutard of Copenhagen is a regular office for German espionage.    it employs the name of &quot;International Patent Bureau, or &quot;InternationalBureau&quot;.
