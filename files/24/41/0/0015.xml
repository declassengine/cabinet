I7H.                      (Jan. 31st, 1918)   The situation in Spain has certainly not improved during thelast three weeks.    As in other countries,  the food question in-        icreasingly occupies all minds and there, as elsewhere, it is onewhich interests everybody:   and that is more than can be said of anypolitical situation in any country.   So in  Spain even the recentDissolution and the forthcoming Elections,  muoh more the variousprojects of reform, Regionalism,  Constituent Cortes,and the rest,so much talked of in the summer and autumn, all fall into the back-ground behind the spectre of famine.   The industries of Spain arenartly paralysed for lack of fuel and transport, and the shortageof food has become very serious;  - so serious tlyat in Barcelona ithas lod to riots and looting and to the proclamation of a state ofsiege;  and British witnesses of unquestionable authority describethe destitution in Madrid as terrible.   Thefts are growing frequentin both towns, and side streets of Madrid are described as not safeafter dark, especially when the lighting has been cut off.   Mostobservers expect things will get worse unless the Government canprovide food.   This state -of things has two sides to it.   It may be regardedfrom the international point or view and from that of the homesituation.   Will it affect the foreign, oolicy of Spain?   No doubtthe Germans will try to use it as they use everything else, fortheir own purposes:  and it is orobably not very difficult for themto persuade a certain number of ignorant people that the lack of food is due  to exports to the Allies or to the obstinacy of theAllies in not going into a Peace Conference.   They are doing this
at Barcelona; it is said:  and no doubt they will take this and allother means to excite disturbances in Spain and interfere with itseconomic life the existence of which, as things are, can only be use-ful to the Allies.    An epoch of Bolshevism in Spain would serve theirpurposes there as it has elsewhere,  with the difference that in Spainit is not the Army but commerce which it is needed to destroy.   Thereis evidence drawn from men of great influence in the Spanish Labourworld that the Germans,  though nominally and publicly of course thefriends of the Church, the Honarchy and all order and authority, areready in secret to oay for the breaking of windows in Seville.   Andother evidence shows them subsidizing Bolshevist newspapers, hiringSocialist writers for their press and Socialists and Radicals astheir candidated in the forthcoming elections,  on which rumour,probably exaggerating as usual ,says they mean to spend  1.000.000.Senor Alcala 2amora,  a member of the Cabinet,  is said to be theorganising head of their newspaper and commercial interests:  and isalleged to have once more shown his German bias by an unfair setion of the ships to be taken over by the Government.  All thesestories need not be literally accurate:  but there is no doubt thhtthe Germans are straining every nerve to work up ill-feeling againstthe Allies and in particular at this moment to  prevent the signatureof other commercial agreements similar to that  recently concluded withEngland,and . to oppose the Allied negotiations  for the regulation of &quot;the exchange, which they describe as negotiations for the deprecia-tion of the peseta.   They have evidently too of late been gettinghold of the Zing and using him to represent to  important Englishmenthe Tiew they wish the world to take of the strength of their militarynoeition. and the moderation of the  pease terms th*-y are prep:rea  to.cceot.   What will come cf all these efforts?  It seems difficult to fce-lieve, in vie^ of the strength of the carfs held by the Allies in
                                                            -      60                            -  3 -Spain and the undoubted pro-Ally feelings of the Liberal elements inthe country,  that anything of  serious importance will result.   It istrue that some Englishmen in a good position to judge do reportalarmist views and allege the  imminence of a Military Dictatorship,which might place troops on  the French frontier and so compel Franceto divert some of her strength from the German front.   But iae% on-Ly                          -tois-the attitude of the Army.very doubtful:   many officers say it islargely pro-Ally,  and all evidence goes to show it is very disinclinedto fight:  and in any case it  seems innrediblve that a MilitaryDictatorship,  if it established itself, should begin by committingsuicide.   After all,  as has often been pointed out in these Reports,the Allies have a crushing argument to which Germany can make noreply.    They command the supplies of coal,  cotton and other thingswhich Spain must have if she is to continue her oommeroial life;and they would almost certainly use this argument if Spain contentplated such an unfriendly act  as th&amp;t suggested.  Besides, they haveplenty of less drastic arguments,    They can and do point to thecontinued sinking of Spanish ships - another of which has just beentorpedoed in circumstances of  unusual brutality - as, what one papsrcalls it, an open attempt to destroy the economic life of Spain.Even pro-German papers now occasionally show considerable impatienceat these outrages and demand that  the Government should protectSpanish interests.   On the whole then the Germans are not likely to be able to turnthe food difficulty or anything else so far to their own uses as toproduce any serious alteration in  Spanish foreign policy.   EvenCount Hertling&apos;s allusion to Gibraltar, which will no doubt give acertain amount of pleasure to  Spaniards,  was from a Spanish point ofview very clumsily done.   For Spaniards will scarcely appreciatehis putting the question of  Gibraltar quite out of practical politics
by being mixed up with Malta,  Aden, Hongkong end the Falkland Islands.After all,  though it is a long time ago,. Gibraltar was once a part ofSpain,  while Malta never was a part of Italy and Hongkong is a purelyBritish creation,   V/hat will be the effect of the food difficulties at home?   Thatis a question much more difficult to answer.   A General Electionheld among a hungry people is not an inviting prospect.   And if thefood-supplies further decrease and, if as is prophesied, the lack ofcotton soon causes an enormous increase in the number of unemployed,the situation mayibecome very grave indeed.    Indeed wh^n an officerattached to the Court tells an English friend that he considers re-volution certain though not necessarily imminent,  it is obvious thatthere are people in high places who think it very grave already.whatever may be the true meaning of the movement among the non-oommissioned officers,  the suppression of which was described in thelast Report, it was not a good sign.   The dismissed sergeants,  whowere apparently not nearly so numerous as was universally asserted atfirst,  have been giving their views to the press and pointing outwith justice that the Memorial,  which they were not allowed to presentto the Minister of War but which they have since published,  was ofa respeotful and moderate character very different to the arrogantthreats used by the Officers&apos;  Committees.  And their protest isgenerally sympathetically received.   The whole incident seems to have weakened the position of theofficers, and there hrs been talk of their Committees agreeing todissolve.   Their arrogance has aroused great indignation especially,but by no means merely,  among the Left parties and the masses of thepeople.   The distinguished Conservative statesman,  Senor Sanchezde Toca, who was formerly President of the Senate  and is the father-in-law of the Marquis of Lema,  the late pro-Ally Minister of Foreign
Affairs, has lately &quot;been making a very strong attack upon  them in  thePress, describing them as having been prepared last June to overthrowall the civia-1 and military authorities of the Kingdom, and as  beinga form of Syndicalism which however justifiable in the unions  ofworkmen, is utterly unjustifiable among the servants of the Stateand especially among soldiers.   His view is thpt if the Governmentcould not suppress them it should have made them undertake theresponsibility of governing themselves.   But what is perhaps more significant than his denunciations  is  hisassertion that public opinion has recovered from its first attitudeof dazed helplessness before the officers, and that the officers areno longer able to ley down the law to the nation with the.,confidencethey showed a flew months ago.    These views are warmly supported inthe Press except by the reactionary and German newspapers.    Thegeneral ampression seems to be that the current is now running againstthe Committees, which are said to be divided amongst themselves.But the whole situation behind the scenes is too obscure to admit  ofany confident interpretation.    Some Soanish officers privately re-present the Mole business of the sergeants as an affair got up bythe officers to nip in the bud any attempt at political propagandain the Army and to strengthen the position of the officers  among theprivates who generally hate the sergeants.   They declare that theofficers work entirely in conjunction with Senor Cierva,  who cer-tainly always flatters them in public.    But there are other ob-servers who think that he privately intends to use the affair of thesergeants a3 a weapon for getting rid of the Committees which it isscarcely possible that any Government can like.   Little can be said as to the prospects  of parties  at the eleo-tions.    The only outstanding  fact is that Regionalism and  its chief,Senor Cambo, seem to  have lost ground.    They were defeated at theirvery centre, Barcelona,  in the election of a Mayor a  month  ago;   and
other elections in their own Catalonia have gone against them.   Thefirst result of the system of electing ITayors has been to giveRepublican Mayors to such important towns as Barcelona and Valencia.But most of the Mayors elected belonged to the old parties:  and anesperienced &quot;old Parliamentary hand&quot; of moderate views, has recentlyin a forecast privately given to an English friend, put down the oldparties as securing about 300 members in the next Parliament out ofthe total of about 400.    He gives 150 seats to the Prime Minister&apos;sDarty,  36 to the Liberals who follow Count Romanones, and 10 to thocwho follow Senor Alba:  -while he expects Senor Dato, the officialConservative leader, to come back with 75 followers, Senor Maurawith 10 and Senor La Oierva with SO.   To the Regionalists he assign45 Deputies and- the Republicans and Socialists 40.   English exper-ience shows the fallibility of the majority of such forecasts:  butit will be interesting to compare these figures with the results ofthe election when they are known.   They at least show that one-competent observer believes that either from conviction or from thevarious influences that will be employed upon them, including thatof cmney, which is apparently being spent much more freely thanusual in Spain, the electors will not make any revolutionary changes,in the composition of the Cortes.   The significance of the 40Republicans if they are elected will depend entirely on whether thei:Republicanism is of a new kind or of the rather nominal order pro-feased by the present Reformist  party.   And v/ill their Socialismbe academic or militant?   We must wait and see.
