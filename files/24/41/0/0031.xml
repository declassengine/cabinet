January 29th, 1918.

My dear Hankey,

When you were here with General Smuts you said you would like to have some figures regarding Salvage Work.   I enclose a brief summary of the principal items which were ?ved by IV Army during November and December last which, as you see, represent considerable  sums of money.  The work is still continuing and there are several more millions of money to be dug out of the mud and brought in.

I hope you are having a satisfactory meeting in Paris and that you will succeed  in introducing the American Army into the line in their proper place.

We have had  extraordinary successes in the air on the IV Army front during the past fine weather, and in four days ?ir battles we have brought down 46 German machines with a loss of only 6 to opurselves.

Yours sincerely,

(Signed). H.S.RAWLINSON.
