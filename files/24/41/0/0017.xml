Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1918.SECRET.NAVAL  WEEKLY APPRECIATION-No.  36.Week ended 26ih January, 1918.                            NAVAL  OPERATIONS.    Mines have been laid in the Heligoland Bight and off the Belgian Coast.            North Sea.    Two German torpedo boats have been sunk by mines in the North Sea.    On January 25th R.N.A.S. machines from Dunkirk carried out a raid on Varssenaere Mandeisaerodrome, when 1,120 lbs.  of bombs were dropped ; the aerodrome was well straddled area-and direct hits  were  observed.    A number of patrols have been carried out by Dunkirk machines in which two enemymachines were  destroyed and two shot  down out of control.  One of  our machines ismissing.    On  January 20th, at 5.20 a.m., just before sunrise, in misty weather, the &quot; Breslau,&quot; Mediter-with the &quot; Goeben &quot;  about  a mile astern, was sighted by H.M.S. &quot; Lizard,&quot; steering in a raneannortherly direction, just clear of Cape Kephalo (Imbros).  The &quot; Goeben &quot; and &quot; Breslau &quot;engaged H.M.S. &quot;Lizard&quot;  at 11,000 yards, straddling but without hitting her.  In themeantime  the  &quot;Goeben&quot;  sighted  the  monitors &quot;Raglan&quot;  and M.28 in Kusu Bay(Imbros), and engaged them, the &quot; Breslau &quot; continuing to engage &quot; Lizard &quot; and preventingher from closing to torpedo range.  At 6.10 a.m. &quot; Lizard &quot; and &quot; Tigress &quot; (who had joinedup) attempted to form a smoke screen for the monitors, but were prevented from doing soby  the accurate fire  of the &quot; Goeben.&quot;  At about this time the  enemy ceased fire andaltered course to the southward.  H.M.S. &quot; Raglan &quot; had been sunk and M.28 was on fireand blew up shortly afterwards, 122  officers and men being lost from &quot;Raglan &quot; and 11from M.28.    At 7 a.m. the &quot; Breslau,&quot; when about 12,000 yards south of Cape Kephalo apparentlyran into the British minefield, and four explosions occurred;  she  was seen to sink  10minutes later.  Of the &quot; Breslau&apos;s &quot; complement of 370 there were 167 German and 5Turkish survivors. The &quot; Goeben &quot; then turned and after circling the &quot; Breslau &quot; continuedon her southerly course, and ten minutes later four enemy destroyers were sighted coming outof the Dardanelles, apparently supported by a Turkish cruiser (probably the &quot; Hamidieh&quot;).The &quot; Lizard &quot;  and &quot; Tigress &quot; engaged the destroyers, which immediately retired up theStraits,  one of  the  enemy  destroyers  having  been hit repeatedly and set on fire aft.At 7.40 a.m. the &quot; Goeben,&quot; which was being attacked by aircraft,  turned and headed forthe Dardanelles, and whilst turning she appeared to strike a.mine and was. then seen tosettle down aft with a list of 10o to 15c.  She steamed slowly up the Dardanelles and thoughescorted by seaplanes and the four destroyers which had returned to her assistance, wasrepeatedly, attacked by our aircraft, two bombs being dropped on her when off Chanak andtwo more after she was beached at. Nagara Point on a sandy bottom within a ship&apos;slength off  the lighthouse.   (0 932) Wt.    55 2/18 H*S
2               At 8 a.m. shore batteries at Cape Helles opened accurate fire on our destroyers which           were following the &quot; Goeben &quot; and forced them to retire, and at 2.30 p.m. an enemy mine-           layer laid mines at the entrance to the Straits.               During the past week, when  weather conditions have permitted, the &quot; Goeben &quot; has           been subjected day and night to heavy bombing by aircraft.               On January  21st, a  ship of about 400 tons was observed alongside the &quot; Goeben/&apos;           apparently engaged in lightening the ship.  At 11 a.m. on 22nd a direct hit was obtained on           the &quot; Goeben &quot; amidships, a volume of smoke and steam being observed immediately after,           while in the afternoon a  tug working on the &quot; Goeben &quot; was hit by a 112 lb. bomb.   A           Turkish cruiser was sighted in the vicinity but was seen returning up the Straits some hours           later.               On the  night of January 22nd-23rd, four direct hits were obtained  on the &quot; Goeben,&quot;           but  on the 23rd heavy anti-aircraft fire was encountered, machines being frequently hit           at 10,000 feet.   The stern of the &quot; Goeben &quot; now appeared much lower, the deck aft being          partially covered with water, and the same evening three more direct hits with heavy bombs          were obtained, and the following morning a small ship was sunk alongside.               On January 24th, no small craft were observed near the  &quot;  Goeben,&quot; which was still          in the same position but a little more down by the stern.  One direct hit was obtained.               At 8 p.m. a 9.2-in. monitor fired 10 rounds (indirect fire) from a position 3^ miles west-          ward of Gaba Tepe,&apos;but further spotting by aircraft was prevented by haze.   During this          operation the monitor was engaged by the  shore batteries.   Air  raids continued until the          afternoon of January 25th, since when the weather has prevented further operations.          Smoke was seen coming out of one funnel on the 25th.Casualties,      On January 20th, the armed boarding steamer &quot; Lou vain &quot; was torpedoed and sunk          in the Zea Channel (iEgean), and about 185 officers  and men were lost.                              ATTACK UPON  ENEMY  SUBMARINES.Submarines     During the week 14 large enemy submarines have been located, of which about eightoperating,  have been operating in Home  Waters  and the Bay of Biscay, the chief area of activity          having been the entrance to the English Channel.  Four of the other vessels were of the          converted Deutschland type, two of these operating in the vicinity of the Canary Islands          and off the African Coast  to the south of those Islands, one off the coast of Portugal and          the other being on passage out.              A report  has come to  hand this week that two hospital ships  were recently stopped          in the iEgean  Sea at night by a submarine, and after examination were allowed to proceed.Actions        The following  Table shows the number, of actions with  enemy submarines  in Homewith enemy Waters during recent weeks, and the nature  of the craft which  have been engaged, andsubmarines, also the number of submarines destroyed :  yNature of Craft.

The losses of British vessels this week show a considerable increase on the figures forthe two previous weeks, and the  Allied and Neutral losses are also considerably higherthan last week. -    The table in Appendix I shows in detail the numbers and tonnage of sailings and of Losses oflosses by enemy action, and the percentage of losses to sailings of British Merchant Steam- Britishships of over 500 tons gross register ;  and the table in Appendix II shows by trades as ^^^j^regards such ships the percentage  of tonnage sunk by enemy action to tonnage sailing toand from United Kingdom ports during the last/four weeks.    The percentage of losses to sailings this week, as  regards British  tonnage  employedin Overseas trades, is 1.51 as against .39 last week. The losses in these trades are doublein number and represent more than five times the tonnage of those in the previous week,but the total tonnage afloat which was this week engaged in these trades  is also increasedby more than one-third.   The percentage of losses in  Coasting and Cross-Channel trafficis .24 as against  .09 the previous  week,  and the total  percentage  of losses to sailings asregards all United Kingdom traffic is .72 as against .19  the previous week.vessels lost.    The table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all British. Merchant Vessels Areas insunk, damaged or molested, and of all Allied and Neutral Merchant Vessels sunk in thelast two weeks by enemy craft, and by mine, classified according to areas.   , Submarine  activity has  been  experienced  in the Channel,  and the  enemy hasresumed operations off the north-east coast.  There has also been the usual activity inthe Mediterranean, but  the Atlantic routes have  been immune except  for one vesselsunk and one other attacked by the submarine cruisers operating fin the  neighbourhoodof the Canary Islands.                               . ENEMY  MINES.    Minelaying activity on the part of the enemy has this week been experienced in the Minelaying.Firth of Forth, off the  south-east coast of England, in the Portsmouth area, and off thesouth  and south-west coasts of Ireland.  The increasingly wide area  in which a singleminelaying submarine is able to operate is very marked and has latterly been particularlyevident in the English  Channel.(C 932)

MOVEMENTS  OF &apos; ENEMY  SHIPS.Merchant      Nine enemy merchant ships have  this week arrived at, and six have sailed from,men.      Norwegian ports outside the Cattegat.  None have entered or left Rotterdam.                     FOREIGN NAVAL  INTELLIGENCE.                                     RUSSIA.    The Russian C.-in-C. at Murmansk was arrested on the 22nd by order from Petrograd,but was subsequently released.    The enemy have now agreed  to shift the line of demarcation in the Black Sea to apoint between the Russian and Turkish troops on the Anatolian coast; but up to the presentthe exact situation  of this point has not been defined.  The lines of demarcation in theBaltic and White Sea are still under consideration.    The Union of Black Sea Sailors have seized the shipping offices in Odessa, and threatento seize also the Banks and Municipal buildings in that City.

There appears to be little doubt that the sortie of the &quot; Goeben &quot; and &quot; Breslau &quot;had as  its objective a  raid on  Imbros, and  that nothing  further was contemplated.Filiations between the Turks and Germans have become very strained, as the former aredissatisfied with the Palestine campaign, and this necessitated a naval demonstration torestore German prestige.    The survivors of the &quot; Breslau &quot; complain of the conduct of the four Turkish destroyerswith them, as on one of their number being hit by &quot; Lizard &quot; they all immediately withdrewfrom action.                                      JAPAN.    The Japanese Cruiser &quot; Kasuga &quot; is still aground in the Banka Straits, with &quot; Manshu &quot;(Despatch Vessel) standing by.   The Netherlands authorities appear  to  have raised noobjection to  British and Japanese ships proceeding to her assistance, but  the question of&quot; Kasuga&apos;s &quot; presence in alleged territorial waters remains to be raised.  Another cruiseris being sent from Japan to replace &quot; Kasuga.&quot;NAVAL STAFF,    31M January, 1918.I                                * APPENDICES.
