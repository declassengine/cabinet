&quot;This Document is the Property of His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government.]AB/A/Printed for the War Cabinet.   February 1918.ENTIAL.    I CIRCULATE the following  Memorandum,  which  has been prepared in theMinistry of Munitions.                                                  WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.    February 12, 1918.MINERAL  OIL  FROM  CANNEL COAL.    THE attached  results of some large-scale tests, carried  out  at the BirminghamGasworks,  show that the utilisation  of the existing vertical  retorts  in gasworksfor the carbonisation of cannel coal and the  production of fuel oil  possesses greatpossibilities.    The utilisation of existing  gasworks  for this  purpose has  beenconsistently advocated in preference to  the erection  of completely new installationsand plants at collieries, &amp;c, which would involve  a great waste of labour, material,and money, and there is no doubt that this policy has now been proved, and that itwill be possible to utilise the existing gasworks  on a large scale  with comparativelylittle additional plant.    The figures show that at a temperature of 1,100&quot; C. with  superheated steam, theyields both of gas and fuel  oil  are satisfactory,  while  the production of other bye-products is excellent.    These satisfactory results  mean that quite  considerable quantities of fuel oil canbe made available at relatively early  dates, provided good priority is given for theplant involved,  and provided a sufficient supply of cannel coal is made available by theCoal Controller.   It is  confidently  expected that,  as soon  as the  necessary andrelatively unimportant plant can be provided at the gasworks,  a yield of crude oil upto the quantity of  50,000 gallons a day will  be produced, and this amount can befurther increased as cannel supplies become available.    While this new source of supply cannot  be expected to produce sufficient quantitiesof fuel oil to  in any way meet the demands, yet it should prove a welcome addition tothe existing supplies.    In order to ensure early supplies of oil from this  source, it  is necessary     1. That good priority for the small amount  of  construction and material involved           should be granted.    2. That the Coal Controller  should  be  instructed to make available all possible           supplies of cannel coal.    February 8, 1918.[246][P.T.O.
