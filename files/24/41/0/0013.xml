(This Document is the Property ofColonel jtsm3His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)SUilM^I OF BLQOiL&amp;DB IMOMkTlQUtitJaiie 25 - 31, 1918. ^IfeMJ.    ^e Swedes Ila^e  accepted our offer,  noted last wee , t.   supply them with limited quantities of fodderstuffs (1,800 torn   mineral oil (1,500 tons), phosphate rock (25,000 tons), coffee,   dried fruit and cocoa in return for a provisional shipping   agreement.  A general economic settlement with Sweden ie thereby   postponed, but such a settlement was in no ease likely to be   reached for some considerable  time.  Meanwhile, under the pro-   posed modus Vivendi, at  least  100,000 tons of Swedish shipping   will be chartered for services in the war zone, 80,000 tons immeor   iately and 20,000 tons within  sis weeks of the signing of the   Agreement,   he United States  obtain for four months the use   of the Swedish ships in  United States ports, while the Swedish   ships in European ports  will be put at the disposal of the Inter-   Allied iixecutive.  Swedish vessels in Swedish ports will resume   their sailings;  Swedish vessels in Allied trades are guaranteed   against interference from the  Swedish Government;  and the cwedish   shipowners are to be free to charter their vessels to the Belgian   relief Commission.aOiiTOf    The Storting has  debated in secret session the proposals   of the United States War Board for a general economic agreement.   As a result of this debate Mr. Ihlen has submitted to Washington   counter proposals in which he  agrees to  limit to  48,000 tons per   annum the export of Norwegian  fish to Germany, but reserves the   right of exporting to the enemy limited  quantities of carbide,   ferro-silicon, molybdenum and  nitrate of lime.I&amp;Miiig   The Danes seem less  disposed than  ever to reduce their  exports of agricultural  produce  to  Oemuny or to put  additional  tonnage at the  disposal  of the Allies,.  Sir E. Paget  is informedJ 1  H  IS
   that  the  D&amp;nish  Government  have  agreed with the  German Govern-   ment  not  to  lower the  percentage of the surplus  Danish agri- j  cultural  produce whioh Germany now  receives.   ri&apos;he  German   Government have  informed the  Banish Government that  they will .   regard as an unnoutral act  any further surrender to  the Allies   of Danish shipping and that they will retaliate  by sinking   Danish shipping  indiscriminately.  These threats are the more   likely to prevail, as  Denmark is less in need of imported com-   modities  than her neighbours,  he  Danes appear  to be well-   clothed and  well fed,  and the shops in Copenhagen  are relative-   ly well stocked  both with luxuries  and necessaries,    here is   an acute  shortage of coal and mineral oil;  but during the last   twelve months we have  put more coal at the  disposal  of the   Danes in the United kingdom than they have  cared to  fetch, xhe   root  crops  for 1917 are estimated to be 10$ better than in   1916, and are better tjaaa in any of the four  years before the   war.   The 1917 sugar beet harvest is 20$ better  than in 1916   and the potato crop shows an increase of 200*000 tons.StflT&amp;EhLAilD  The ijwlss have submitted a scheme  for furnishing   us with a monthly credit of Fr,10,000,000,  but they  desire im-   portont concessions in return.   They  propose  that  their month-   ly advances  should be  proportionate to the  amount  of imported   goods actually delivered in Switzerland. In return  for the   full  Fr.10,000,000 they would expect at least 70,000 tons of   imported goods monthly, exclusive of 14*000 tons required for   interned prisoners. We cannot be responsible for  the transit   of Swiss  goods through France and Italy and we cannot therefore   allow our advances to  depend on  the actual  arrival of supplies   in Switzerland.   We would however agree to the Swiss advances   being made proportionate to the  deadweight tonnage allotted for  the carriage of Swiss goods  from  overseas.
            The Swiss also ask. to be allowed to import certain supplies      from the British Empire, to increase their transit trade with      Holland through Germany, to receive one-fifth of the Dutch agri-      cu;tural produce secured to the United Kingdom under the ^nglo-      Dutch agricultural agreement, to reserve cargo space on British      ships for miscellaneous Swiss consignments, and, within limits,      to make their own chartering arrangements.   SPAIB.  The Spanish Government are apparently not disposed to      allow us the credits we require for financing our Spanish pur-      chases unless they obtain substantial concessions in return. Thej?      refuse to accept a monthly allotment of British exchequer bonds      on the ground that it would be unneutral for them to make a direct      financial arrangement with a belligerent Government.  &apos;fhey will      allow a group of Spanish banks to arrange advances with a group      of British banks, but they demand that the Anglo-Spanish commer-      cial agreement of December last should first be modified appre-      ciably to their advantage.  They ask that British coal may be      loaded not only on Spanish vessels (as provided in the Agreement)      but upon any vessels calling for Spanish account in the United      Kingdom.  They desire to obtain unrestricted supplies of various      important commodities from the British Empire, including cotton      from Egypt and Jute from India, and they submit a list of Spanish      products which they desire to export to the United kingdom not-      withstanding the British import prohibitions now in force.^6e MSilA-     are trying to ascertain how far the Government of      the Ukraine are likely to go in their negotiations for an econo-      mie agreement with tb8 Central Empires.   They are undoubtedly  x  :^      beiaai hard pressed by the Germans and Austrians to resume eeonom-      10/ relations on an extensive scale.   The French Minister at      JOtejff/is informed that the Ukraine Government do not feel com-
   petent to resist this pressure, but that they intent to res-   triot their trade with Germany and Austria within the smallest   possible limits.gGYPg?  Sir iu Wiagate is against granting any new concessions to   private companies for exploiting the Egyptian oilfields., Aooord-   int to sXpert opinion those concessions are of such value that   the terms of any new contract made with a private company should   be moat carefully considered.  An immediate increase in our sup-   plies of oil from Egypt can best be obtained by assisting the   Anglo-Egyptian Oilfields to develop their concession at Hurrgha&amp;a   the output of which has so far been equal to thai of the best   oilfields in the worlds  Fourteen wells * drilled within an area   of 500 acres, are yielding at the rate of 15,000 tons a month.   Owing to lack of transport snd machinery large quantities of   this oil are overflowing and running to waste.
