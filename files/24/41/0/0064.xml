4GOVERNMENT;^ 3&apos;7lo/G.N./78fWAR  CABIMT.t,33)               Draft Bill to amend the Law with respect to the     qualifications of Deputy Lieutenants,              Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.               Under the Militia Act,1882 (45 and 46 Viet cap 49) the     Lord Lieutenant may appoint euoh persons as he thinks fit,living     within the county, provided that they possess &amp;ne of the following     qualif 1 oat ions;          (a)  He shall be a peer of the realm or the heir apparent of                such a peer, and have a place of residence within the                oounty for which he is appointed; or          (b)  He shall be in possession for his own benefit of an                estate for the life of himself or another or of some                greater estate, in land in the United Kingdom of the                yearly value of not less than two hundred pounds; or          (c)  He shall &quot;be the heir apparent of some person who is in                possession for his own benefit of such an estate as                above mentioned; or          (d)  He shall be possessed or entitled, at law or in equity,                in possession for his own benefit, for the life of                himself or another, or for some greater interest, of or                to a clear yearly income arising from personal estate                within the United Kingdom of not less amount than the                yearly value of an estate in land above mentioned; and                the clear yearly income arising from any suoh personal                estate shall be admitted in whole or in part of a                qualification arising from the possession of an estate                in land*130(3)           The Act further provides that a Lord Lieutenant shall not     grant a commission as Deputy Lieutenant until informed by a     Secretary of State that the Sovereign does not disapprove.               Under the power thus vested in the Crown to withhold     approval of appointment certain additional qualifications have been     imposed, by the Sovereigns command, as a condition of appointment^     Provision was made, under the territorial and Reserve Foroea Act,     1907, for oonsitutuing Lords Lieutenant Presidents of their County     Associations, and in November 1907, with the object of stimulating     active interest in the Territorial tforoe organization, and providing     $he Lord Lieutenant with deputies able to assist him in discharging     his functions in connection with the County Assooiation, the King     commanded that no person should &quot;be appointed Deputy Lieutenant w&amp;o     had not either held a commission for not less than 10 years in His     Majesty&apos;e Porces or rendered eminent service as a member of his     County Association.               During the present war it was found that these^estric-     tions precluded the appointment of gentlemen, not possessing the     above qualifications, who had in other ways rendered exceptionally     valuable services to the Military tforees of the Crown in connection     with Recruiting, Red Cross work, the promotion of the Volunteer     movement, and in other important spheres directly connected with     the prosecution of the war.  Accordingly in April 1015, the King     commanded that existing qualifications should be extended in order     to provide for the recognition of such special services,                                                               ThemI
          The foregoing measures secure the nomination ofsuitable candidates for the appointment of Deputy Lieutenant,butit appears that there is difficulty in rendering them effectiveowing to the fact that gentlemen who are otherwise eminentlyqualified do not always possess the statutory t^alification as toproperty *  In sueh a category are found many officers of the $avaland Military Poroes and officials whose incomes are derived fromsalary, pay or pension, and members of the professional classeswhose incomes are dependent on their earnings.  It is with a viewto remove this barrier to appointment that the present Draft Billis submitted,  (it may be stated that the property qualificationfor appointment of a Deputy Lieutenant is of very old standing.It was in force as early as 1757 (Militia Act George II cap. SB),at Which time the control of the Militia rested with the HomeOffice - the responsibility not being transferred to the War Officeuntil 1852.)          The inception of the proposed legislation is as follows:In the House of Lords on 23rd October 191% Lord St Davids askedthe Government whether they would introduce or support legislationfor the abolition of the property qualification in the appointmentof Deputy Lieutenants.  In the debate which followed, the proposalwas supported *y Viseount Hal dan e, the Marquess of Orewe and the *larl of Dartmouth, and there were no dissentients.  The Secretary^of State for War expressed concurrence and undertook to consult -with Lords Lieutenant as to the form whieh the proposed Bill shouldtake,  The subject was then dieeussed at a special meeting of th VAssociation of Lieutenantw of Caunties.   The Duke of Bedford, whois Chairman of this Association, states that only about 17 of the&apos;96 Lords Lieutenant in Great Britain are not membere thereof-, butthat a good many in Ireland do not belong to the Association.  Ma result of this meeting the Duke of Bedford was requested to    1inform the Secretary of State that in view of the Association itwas desirable that the Office of a Deputy Lieutenant should bedealt with on the following lines :-     (l)  That the property qualifications should be abolished^     (2)  That the residential sualifinations should be retained     but that the conditions at present applicable to County     Justiees, namely residence either within the County or within     seven miles thereof, should be applied to Deputy Lieutenants,     subject to the qualification that a Deputy Lieutenant should     not necessarily forfeit his Offlee by ceasing to reside     within the prescribed limits,      2)  That appointments of Deputy Lieutenants should be      on-political.     (i)  That the gentlemen appointed should have rendered     worthy servioe either of a civil or military character on      ehalf of the Army, Havy or Auxiliary Forces.&apos;     )*The Deputy Lieutenants Act, l&amp;ie&quot; has been drafted to amend     the existing Law in such manner as to give effect to these     principles.      f   $he secretary of State for War oommunioated theraoomroendatiens of the Association of Lieutenants of Counties to&apos;  .&quot;ihe Chief Secretary for Ireland and raised the question whether-ihe Draft Bill should apply to Ireland or not.  He pointed out rhat the property qualification in Ireland might be found usefulIn resisting claims which it was not wished to entertain, and thatthe
tho qualification of haying rendered sexvloe to the Foroes slightunduly restrict the field of eeleotion.  The Chief Seoretszy, i$reply, stated that he did not think it advisable to extend toIreland the provisions of the Bill *  S)n his opinion the abolitionof the property qualification would remove a useful cheok onapplications and would moreover tend in Ireland to lower thestatus of Deputy Lieutenants.  He agreed that,  as the Territorialand F.eserve Forces Act, 1907, does not apply to  Ireland, theprovision that appointees should have rendered service to theForoes would unduly restrict the field of selection,          It should be explained that,  under Section 53 (4) ofthe Militia Act,  1882, the powers relating to the appointment ofDeputy Lieutenant are vested in the Lord Lieutenant of Irelandand the Chief Secretary,  and the qualification  cf having renderedservices to the Foroes of the Crown has never been extended toIreland.          The Bill as now drafted applies only  to Great Britain,7th February,19184
