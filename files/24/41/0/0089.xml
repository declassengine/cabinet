CIRCULATED TO THE KING mD THE nM CABINET.. TViis Document is the Property ofBritannic Wl3jesty&apos;s Governme- &apos;.-Home OfficeWhitehall,S.VJ.1.9th February 1918, Dear&apos;Mr,  Gregory,      I have just had a telegram from the Home Secretary about the question of allowing Petroff to return to England.   He  asks  me to let  the Foreign Office know that his  judgment  is  against admitting him to this country in the present conditions.  He  was interned because he was actively  engaged -in encouraging strikes among workmen engaged in work  essential to the  War,  and  he  now proposes to come as an emissary  to the proletariat, that  is,  to foment strikes and  revolutions.   His  activities  would speedily  lead to his  re-internment or  exclusionj  and this would cause a worse  quarrel  than  the  refusal  to  allow him to come over.now,     Sir George Cave adds that  if the Smolny  Government proposed to send petroff as  their own emissary and we could then insist on his observing the laws, the  casemight be different.  He adds that his opinion againstallowing him to come is strengthened by the Paris (&quot;Petit parisieh&quot;)  disclosures.Yours sincerely,(signed) Edward Troup.J.* D0 Gregory, Esq.
