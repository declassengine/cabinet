War Cabinet,, Sir,      I  am commanded &quot;by the Army Council to inform you that a sudden  and very urgent demand for timber to allow deep dug-outs to &quot;be made &quot;before any heavy attack can be made on us has been received from General Headquarters, France.     Lord Lovat, the Director of Forestry, was sent from France to this country to see if, in addition to all current supplies, 7,000   standards could be provided in February, and another 7,000 standards in llarch, total 14,000 standards, or about 42,000  tons deadweight.  After consulting the War Office , the Timber Control, and the Ministry of Shipping, he was convinced that it would be difficult to get more than 4,000 standards, say 12,000  tons, for each month, and advised General Headquarters, France, accordingly,\     General Headquarters, France, accepted his advice and after diverting to defence work material that it was intended to reserve for possible counter-attacks and the advances that might follow successful counter-attacks,  reduced the special demand to a total of 8,000 standards for the two months.     The position of timber shipments to France is now:-                                           (Tons deadweight)     Arrears on ordinary programme  ........   4,000     Ordinary programme for two months             (February and March)...........  10,000     Required to replace timber sent  )     from us in France to our forces  1     in Italy, on promise of replace- j*              .     ment from England. ,              J     New additional urgent demand  .........  24,000                        Total for two months                       (February &amp; March)     42,500.     The utmost that can be taken via     Richborough during these two     months is       ,,.;..................   20,500     leaving shipping to be provided for  ..   22,000     Ah unofficial communication haD been received from theMinistry of Shipping to the effeot that this shipping can beprovided only if the War Cabinet will authorise it in view, of the urgency of the case,  and suggesting that the Army Council should state the case for the information of the War Cabinet.     I am,  therefore,  to enquire if the necessary sanction maybe given                         I am                           Sir,                           Your obedient  Servant,                             (Signed)  B.B.  CUBIT?..P.S.  To avoid complication,  no reference  has  been made to  theshipments of pitch-pine from the Gulf  of Mexico.  Nothing hasoccurred to justify any change in these shipments.
