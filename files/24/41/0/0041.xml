his Document isment Is the Property ofic ftftaje?ty&apos;s Government.)1     9\SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,WEEKLY REPORT ON RUSSIA. XXXVIII.(5th February,  1918).Department of Information.CRW/058.     Trotski has again returned to Brest Litovsk, feeling that hisposition in Petrograd is sufficiently strong for the present.The trouble caused by the dissolution of the Constituent Assemblyappears to have blown over.   It is true that there may lingerfeelings of deep resentment in many districts at the unceremonioustreatment of their representatives?  at the same time the Sovyetsare there to take their place, and the Sovyets are a far betterorganised body than would have been the Constituent Assembly.Moreover the Sovyets are more likely to get things done, and thatin itself will be welcomed.  It must be admitted that if it werenot for the Sovyets both local and central  there would be noorganised force to prevent the spread of sheer anarchy, and thecollapse of such an organisation at the present moment would benothing short of a disaster to Russia.     The Bolsheviks by their energy and audacity have madethemselves complete masters of the greater part of Russia, andtheir influence has latterly been on the increase.   Their formerpolitical rivals, both Social Revolutionaries and Cadets, arecompletely in the background, and it is hardly to them that theBolsheviks would have to yield place in case of failure.   Untilpeace has been concluded and normal conditions are restored nomoderate parliamentary party is likely to control the situation;the fall of the Bolsheviks would see the rise of something farmore extreme and chaotic - the Anarchists.    The Anarchists inRussia form a regular political party.   They have their ownpress and their separate organisation.   Before the Bolsheviks
came into porcer they worked with them, but during the last twomonths the cleavage has been growing steadily wider.  Leninrecently denounced them at a public meeting in Petrograd for theirrefusal to recognise the State, for the Bolsheviks, in spite oftheir destructive influence, are essentially centralist.   To theAnarchists on the other hand there must be no limit todecentralisation;  self-determination must be applied not only tonations but to every village1 community should it so desire.The Russian State would be replaced by a Federation of FreeCommunes.  Such a Russia would fall an easy prey to its neighboursor to any autocrat who had the ability to assert himself.  It isthis against which the Bolsheviks are fighting, and it is theSAvyet  organisation with its army of Red Guards that stands in theway of complete anarchy setting in.The Bolsheviks and their Neighbours.     The Bolsheviks appear to have gained an easy victory overthe Ukrainian Rada.   This is due to the fact that the power of theRada was altogether artificial.  It declared itself the representati/eof a distinct nationality, but with the peasantry Ukrainiannationalism made little or no appeal.  They thought of themselvesas peasants rather than as Ukrainians, and were only willing tofollow the Rada in so far as the latter supported their claim to theland.  The Rada Government realised this, and in its &quot;Universal&quot;of November 20 transferred the land to the peasantry.  This was abid for the support of the peasants against the spread of Bolshevism.At first it seemed successful, and reports from the Ukraine toldof the steady increase of the Rada&apos;s influence.  But it soon becameapparent how weak was their position.  In the eastern part of theterritory claimed by them they succumbed to the Bolsheviks withouta struggle, and a new Bolshevik Government in Kharkov disputed the.
authority of the Rada in Kiev.   The leaders of the Rada, realisingtheir danger, looked for support elsewhere.   They courted theRussian Monarchists in Kiev and the Polish landowners, andendeavoured to explain away their land programme to suit theirnew allies.   They also hastened to come to terms with theCentral Powers at Brest Litovsk.  It was this action which madethe Bolsheviks strike at once.    The Ukrainian troops, of whosesupport the Rada had boasted, seem to have offered little resistance,end it seems probable that the peasantry took the side of theBolsheviks.   The Ukrainian movement as a national separatistmovement has collapsed for the time being.  It may be revivedlater, but for the present the Rada Is likely to be replaced bya central Sovyet controlling a number of local Sovyets as inPetrograd.     News from the Cossack territory is very scanty.  The OrenburgCossacks, who were never a strong force, seem to have been defeatedby the Bolsheviks, who are said to have occupied Orenburg.   In theDon the Cossacks are stronger and better organised, but according toBolshevik reports the Socialist movement is spreading there too,Cossack regiments have for some time past been infected byBolshevism and this infection appears to be on the increase.If the Cossacks under Kaledin succeed in holding out it will onlybe with extreme difficulty.     Outside Russia proper the Bolsheviks have involved themselvesIn war with two neighbours of quite different nationality, viz.the Finns and the Rumanians,  In these two countries they areconfronted with a problem they have not yet had to encounter.In Finland, for example, not only is there a strong nationalfeeling which demands complete independence of Russia and to whichthe internationalism of the Bolsheviks makes little appeal, but the
class antagonism is not so acute.  The Finns are socially one of the.most advanced people in Europe, and there is not the same sharpcleavage between peasantry and bourgeoisie as in Russia.   Henceextreme Bolshevism is likely to meet with much stronger oppositionin Finland, aid the chances of the Finnish Government gaining theupper hand are much better than were those of the ProvisionalGovernment in Russia.     The Rumanian question is also one which the Bolsheviks willfind very much more difficult than that of the Ukraine,  Rumaniannationalism is strong and deep-rooted among the peasant soldiers,while a Rumanian proletariat can scarcely be said to exist.Hence internationalism will make very little appeal to the Rumaniansoldiers, and as the Rumanian army Is certainly stronger Andbetter organised than any force in Russia it is probable thatthe Bolsheviks will find difficulties in overcoming it which theydo not themselves fully realise.   (This subject is being dealtwith more fully in the Weekly Report on Rumania .JTrotski and Bgegt Litovsk.     Before going to Brest Litovsk Trotski delivered a speechwhich seemSd to indicate that he felt a separate peace inevitable.It is too soon as yet to interpret this speech, which was taken upby Germany as meaning a climb-down on the part of Russia.   ItBeems curious, however, that Trotski should choose this momentof all others to give way to the Germans when so much is stirringbeneath the surface both in Germany and Austria-Hungary.   Trotski&apos;sspeeches, it must be remembered, are also meant for home con-sumption and he may have felt it wiser to give the impression thatpeace was not far distant.  When he has organised his Red Army andcan rely upon it, he may perhaps change his tone.
*                            5.Food Supplies in the Ukraine.     Stores of food in any considerable quantities can be foundonly on the big landed estates.  The peasant holdings In the Ukrainevillage;  on the whole do not yield any considerable surplus offood.  The peasants live on the produce of their own small holdingsor allotments and get the cash which they require for the paymentof taxes and for buying industrial products (in the past vodkatook a very important place among them) by working as hiredlabourers on the big estates.  The stores of food on these estatesare considerable, but the peasant revolt which is spreadingthroughout the Ukraine has done a great deal to reduce them.Wherever a manor was attacked the stores were looted and the cattledriven away, and in most cases looting was accompanied by aconsiderable amount of destruction.  Moreover the peasants will                        dprobably be afraid of seeling loot to any organised Government orforce.     It is, of course, impossible to estimate even in rough figureswhat percentage of manors has already been destroyed - moreoverdestruction is still spreading.   It was stated in a Polish paperfrom the Ukraine printed about six weeks ago that hitherto threehundred Polish manors have been looted (the average of landrepresented by a manor house^might be taken to be something abouttwelve hundred acres, though It is dangerous to attempt anygeneral estimates).   The figure of thsee hundred is not likely tobe In any way exaggerated, judging from lists giving the names oflooted manors in several districts well-known to the writer.     Lastly, it must be marked that the pogroms of manor housesare most numerous west of the Dnieper and their number increases thenearer one draws to the front - largely because marauders or even
5.2,18.whole regiments which have broken loose,  have  frequently taken thelead in those pogroms, or even effected them by themselves.Thus, for instance,  in the districts  of Lityn  and Latichev inPodolia,  and in the  surroundings  of Ostrorog in Volynia  probablymore than half the manors have been destroyed.
