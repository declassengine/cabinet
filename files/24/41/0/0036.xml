Colonel ZoomDOOUMBBT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITATOO M4J3STY!S QOVEENMMT)B 0 3 E !tI.3535.WAR   CABIOI,TONHAGS AND BREOTKS.(Memorandum by the Shipping Controller)   I attach hereto a Memorandum on the relief to the tonnageLtuation which could be effected by the complete prohibition brewing.   The position may be summarised as follows : -       (1)  The direct saving of tonnage for other              imports would be equivalent to 749,000              tons carried in 1918.       (2)  This amount of goods has not only to be              conveyed by rail to the breweries              but also a proportionate amount has              again to be carried when it is dis-              tfibuted as beer to the consumer.  The              elimination of such traffic unpaid be an              enormous relief to the railways, which              are at the present time seriously over-              burdened.   For example, the Ministry of              Shipping hare just been asked for a              further 40,000 tons of shipping to carry              ooal principally to the North of Scotland              for the Havy.   But for the heavy demands              on the railways this coal would go by              rail and so relieve further tonnage at              present employed coastwise.       (3)  In so far as the above Imports for brewing              are reduced, so much the more cotton,              wool and other commodities of prims              importance can be imported.

 NOTE ON THE RELIEF TO  THE TONNAGE  SITUATION WHICH  , WOULD BE EFFECTED BY THE  COMPLETE  PROHIBITION  OF -.: &apos;\ -                  BREWING.      The quantity of beer which  it is  proposed to  brew during 1918 amounts to 14-15,000,000 standard  barrels and the  materials which will  be  consumed In  order  to produce this quantity will; be  about 600,000 tons of barley, 8,000 tons of grits and 60,000.  tons  of sugar.      As regards  the grits , (which  are  for the  most part&quot;maiafte, rice and  other  imported articles) and the sugar,-;these particular materials are substantially all imported, and  as regards barley, part of this is imported and part home grown. But this  Is  of course irrelevant  in considering the  effect  on shipping, as if  the  home grown grain were not used for brewing there would be  a  corresponding reduction in the  amount  of grain imported for other purposes .-      There  would thjLs.be  a total saving  of 668,000 tons of materials during 1918, but oh  the  other  hand there would be a loss of brewers1  grain, malt combings  and dry  yeast produced in the process of brewing.  600,000 tons of barley would give about 150,000 tons of  these foodstuffs which would presumably have to be  replaced- directly or  indirectly by  other imports. ftiey are, however, very.bulky  foodstuffs in proportion to their food  value, and an equivalent amount of food  can be-obtained in maize weighing flve*-,elghths  of&quot; the brewers1 grains,.i.e*- about  94,000 tons, as against  150,000 tons.  ;;   ., A complete  prohibition,of the use df any  further grain or sugar for brewing may, therefore, be  estimated  to resultin -a- saving f o.r  other  purposes of  a carrying capacity of 574,000 tons a year which -is equivalent  to the continuous employment  (at say 4 voyages a year) of  29 ships of 5:,C0O
* s *tons cargo capacity..     This saving would bo incroase^i-a^prtxxiahly if ii-jaaylseassumed that the prohibition would moan tho reload as food-stuffs of suoh portion of tho present stocks of barley, toby brewers as are capable of being  so used.     The stocks in this country at  51st Deccmbor 1917 arestated by the Ministry.of Food to be rs follows     Barley      118:420 tons.-       Haize &amp;o. 17,330 tons.     Malt         97,150 tons.    .  &quot;Sugar     14,250 tons..                         Old Halt 17,070 tons.;     Taking no account of the stocks of Old Malt and BrewingSugar,  as these commodities are, it is understood,  of littlevalue except for browing purposes, the complotc prohibition,in addition to tho saving reforrod to above may bo ostimatod toamount to an addition of about 175,000 tons to the fotd of thecountry,  thus&apos;:-                                  Tons.       Barley                  118,420.       Maize,  say               10,000..       New Malt ( for&apos; eattio)    97,150.225,570J.ess Sstimated amount of     food-stuffs that     would still be      )   50,000     available if brew-     ing continued.175,570.      The  total  saving of  carrying capacity would  in these circumstances be 574,000  plus 175,000 tons, or  749,000 tons,&apos;which is  equivalent to the continuous employment  for tho year 1918  (at  say 4  voyages a  year) of 37 ships of 5,000 tons cargo capacity.      The  above  notes relate only to the diroct  saving in importe food-stuffs which would result from prohibition.  It must bo  - remomberod, however, that there would bo tho further important                                                  advantages
advantages of      ((a) Saving the large man power engaged both in the            breweries, the retail trade and horse and            motor transport.      i&quot;b) Saving the strain on railways which (for the            conveyance of 16,GOO,GOO or so barrels often            for long distances)  is very serious .      (c) Saving in coal and its transport for use in the            breweries .     It Is understood that a very considerable reduction(perhaps to the quantity of ingredients required for a littleover 10,000,000 barrels under present conditions) could beeffected without reducing the quantity of beer supplied byforcing the strong proprietary beers (Bass , Worthington,Guineas &amp;c) to dilute down to the standard of other beer .This would have some positive advantages from the point ofview of the effect on labour, as it would remove the particulargrievance which is now felt by those who.get the weaker beer .which arises from a comparison with the stronger.  If sucha measure were combined with effective steps to  see that eachbrewery supplied the locality nearest to itself, there wouldbe great relief to the railways, as the big proprietary brandsnow travel all over the country and pass and re-pass otherbrands as they do so.  The objection to such a proposal comesnot from the effect on labour but from the immense strength ofthe brewing interests concerned.  Economy, both in railwaytransport and in coal could also be secured by; the closing ofsmall breweries (over 3,000 in number)- which brew in un-economically small quantities .                          , (Sd.)
