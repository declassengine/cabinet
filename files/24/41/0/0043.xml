WAGE IFCREASE,S.                Instruct j or?g to Departments,,      (Circulated with reference to War Cabinet 339.Min.3)*    Attention has recently been  directed  to  the  practice  amongDepartments of competing against  one  another  for  labour  and to  the evil.results that arise therefrom.   Illustrations  of this  might be given inthe form, of instructions to firms  to raise  wages.  Many such instanceshave come to the knowledge of  the Government  during the  last fewmonths.  There have been many  esses of Departments enticing labouraway from one place to  another on payment  of  higher wages  for  suchlabour - the result being of course a demand  for  increased wages inall the area adjacent - a demand  that has-in  most cases  been conceded .But no. sooner is a new  rate established  than  attempts are  made  tostart another cycle.    This is all contrary to the  principles agreed upon  in 191? -namely that wages rates should remain as they were, except that in anyarea where - a shop or firm was  paying  a rate less  than the  wages in thatarea, it was to be brought up  to  the  wages current.    Increases of wages have been regulated on the whole throughoutthe country in other than munitions   works by that  agreement;  Bonuseshave been paid to both  on the  basis of increased  cost of living. Somemunitions workers have  bnow, however, in consequence  of  the  fact towhich allusion has been made,  been receiving  increases in  wages andbonuses approximating if not actually equivalent  to 100  per cent.    The practice still goes on and as it  has been found by leadersof workmen to be fruitful, is  being exploited with more  vigour.    It is therefore necessary to point  out to Departments that thisis altogether against the national interest.   Certain Departmentsnay also be reminded    a.&quot; the  recent  Munitions of War Act  which givesthem power to standardise wages and to prosecute  employers for  undulyincreasing them.    The Cabinet desire all Departments  to have due regard to theirpowers and to the larger interests of the  nation, and in particularthey feel that they must impress  upon them that no letters shouldbe sent out encouraging employers to  grant undue  increases of wages,    Strict attention must be  directed to  keeping employers workingfor a Department within the limits of wage adjustments alreadysanctioned.  The Cabinet also  desire  to  remind Departments ofttinute 317 which states - &quot;All  applications, for an increase in  waradvances and wage disputes arising therefrom  shall be referred  to theministry of Labour for  decision who may  refer- them to the  Committeeon Production,  The Ministry of Labour will have  discretion&apos;  toask the Department concerned to carry on any  necessary negotiationscut the final decision will in all cases  rest with the  Ministry oflabour&quot;.JLJfai teha.ll- Gar dens^^.   6th February, 1918.
