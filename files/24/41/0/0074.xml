(This Document is the Property oHis Britannic  !V1ajesty&apos;s Government.)^Admiralty Memorandum  for the War  Cabinet.The ^necessity tc  bring home tc the workpeople of thefor maximum output - which we certainly have not hadduring the year 1917 and still less during January 1918 -has led the Board of Admiralty to review the policy hithertoadopted-of concealing from the enemy the tonnage losses.      The Admiralty have  hitherto  recommended  this  policy from a desire  tc  keep the  enemy ignorant  cf the-, actual facts, believing  that, generally  speaking, a  suppression cf them must be a hindrance tc the enemy1s plans.   The Admiralty believe that the  enemy has always wanted  tc knew these facts and. that  he has purposely published highly exaggerated reports of  tonnage losses with the idea of goading us into revealing them and  also  cf encouraging his own people in the belief of that  rapid success cf the submarine warfare, with which the inauguration cf the policy was heralded and justified.      The  effect in Germany cf the  publication cf the true figures of tonnage losses would probably be twc-fold:- lo    It would enable the  military  party tc revise their submarine warfare records in the light cf known facts, ifindeed they are net already known  tc  them.

      In the confident belief, therefore, that the publication of these figures will stir the people  of this country to such efforts as will avert this unthinkable disaster and believing, as they do from evidence put before them, that their  publication will have this  effect/the Admiralty strongly recommend this course to the War Cabinet.  .      The  Admiralty make this recommendation in the full belief  that suspicion rather than any lack of good- will lies at the back of the difficulty with the workers. They recognise that their proposal will do no more than remove  one ground for suspicion, and they venture to suggest to the Cabinet that immediate steps be taken in  other  directions which, in conjunction with the publication  of tonnage losses,  will cause the  worker -to devote himself whale-heartedly to his allotted task in the war.      In the hope that the War Cabinet will  agree that the  figures should be made public,  the Board of  Admiralty attach the following memorandum which they  propose shouldbe  laid as a Parliamentary Paper.      It will of course be for the War Cabinet  to con- sider the question of communicatiiig with our Alliesbefore such publication,  if agreed  upon, be made.
     Memorandum which it is proposed should he laid as a               Parliamentary Paper,     The War Cabinet have received a request from theBeard  cf Admiralty that the full facts cf the WcrldTstonnage position should new be published.   They agree tcthis request and have decided tc issue the followingMemorandum prepared by the Beard cf Admiralty :-     Hitherto the p-card cf Admiralty have been averse from anyfurther publication than that contained in the weekly returnof  losses,   although it has been frequently pressed uponthem that the whole tonnage facts should be made public.   Scleng as such publication would encourage the enemy and wouldstimulate his energies in a dangerous direction, they havenet been able tc concur in the proposal.   But the Admiraltyrecognise that the policy cf silence, necessary as theybelieve it tc have been from a naval point of view, hashad this serious defect - that it failed sufficiently toimpress upon the people cf this  country the  vital necessityfor individual and united effort cn their part tc make gocdthe losses caused by enemy submarines.     In the Soring cf 1917 the full menace of  the submarinecampaign was first disclosed:   since that  date we- havesteadily increased cur  knowledge and cur material resourcesfor this novel warfare.     A statement is  attached  shewing in figures  and  in diagramthe marine and war losses  and  the ship-building  output of theWorld, excluding enemy  countries, for the  whole  period
 of the war.      The  situation has been regarded from the standpoint  of World1s tonnage rather than Allied tonnage, as in these  problems the mercantile Navies of the whole World, excluding the enemy, may be regarded as one.      It will be  noticed that this diagram records facts and that nothing has been included in the nature of an estimate.     It would not be correct to assume that the losses by submarine will continue to decrease or that the production of merchant vessels will continue to increase at the same rate of progress as is shewn in the past few quarters, although a rapid and continuous increase in the  output of merchant tonnage vail inevitably follow the  united efforts of all engaged in merchant shipbuilding in this country.      On the subject of losses the Admiralty disclaim any desire  to prophesy about so uncertain a thing as war in its  submarine phase.      The results of the past year have shewn the ability of our seamen to get upon terms with the  submarine menace ,  and gradually to gain the upper hand.     This result has been achieved in spite of an imperfect knowledge of a new and barbarous method ofwarfare and of a scarcity of suitable material.      Our material resources for this warfare are already improved and are being rapidly augmented,  whilst science  is  placing at our disposal means of offence  and defence  of  which wehave been in need.      Subject  to this  technical advice. and to a warning that undue  optimism is fatal, theAdmiralty consider  that  the  facts with  regard to  tonnage losses speak for themselves.
     With regard to the  other great factor- the production of  merchant tonnage - any estimate for the future must depend wholly upon the determination of employers and men in  the shipyards and marine engineering establishments.     Our  production, however, of merchant ships during January - even making the most generous allowance for weather conditions - fell so far below that of each month in  the preceding quarter that, if no improvement is made, the point v/here production balances losses will be postponed to a dangerous extent, and even when that point is  reached we shall still have to make good the losses of  the past.     To produce in the United Kingdom 1,800,000 tons in 1918 and to reach an ultimate production at the rate of 3,000,000 tons per annum is well within the present and prospective capacity of our shipyards and marine engineering sh&amp;ps.     But the ranks of the skilled men must be enlarged without delay by the introduction of men and women at present unskilled.     The education of these newcomers, up-grading, and interchangeability ofwork are essential and must  be pressed on with the good-will of employers, foremen and men.     Further,  the Board of Admirtlty wish to make  it perfectly clear that  these results cannot be obtained .unless maximum output  is continuously given in every shipyard and marine engine shop by every one concerned. If employers hesitate  to play their part,  if men anywhere &quot;down tools&quot; or &quot;go slow&quot; for any reason,  they will  do soin full knowledge of  the grievous  extent  to which they are prejudicing the vital Interests of  the community..
     It is to ensure the vigorous co-operation of allconcerned that the Admiralty have recommended thepublication of the facts.
