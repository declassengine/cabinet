PART  I.-ACTION  TAKEN.    On Thursday, January 31, Lord Rhondda and Mr. Clynes  received a deputationfrom the National Union of Railwaymen, introduced by Mr.  J. H.  Thomas, M.P.Lord Rhondda stated that in any national scheme  of  rationing, the  ration would notbe on a flat rate but that men engaged in exacting manual labour would receive morethan men employed in sedentary  work. Arrangements would further be made tomeet the requirements of those railwaymen who had to sleep away from home.    On Friday, February 1, Lord Rhondda and Mr. Prothero addressed a conferenceof representatives  of the farmers&apos; organisations of England and Wales at Gaxton Hallon the  position with regard to the supply of feeding stuffs and the measures connectedwith, the arrangement of farm stock made necessary by the present dearth.    On Tuesday, February 5, Lord Rhondda,&apos; who was  accompanied by Mr.  Clynesand members of his staff, addressed a meeting of members of Parliament at the  Houseof Commons on  various aspects of the food question.  Mr.  Whitley, Chairman ofCommittees, presided and there was a large attendance.   The Food Controller  gave asummary of the stocks of principal foodstuffs and dealt with the questions of tonnageand of distribution.  He expressed the view that  the food situation would be in itsmost difficult stage during the next two months, and asked those present to give  himall help possible in their constituencies.  A number of questions were answered  anda vote  of thanks was unanimously carried.    Consumers&apos; Council. The first meeting of this Council was held at  the Ministryof Food on Friday, February 1.  Mr. Clynes presided  and there was a full  attendanceof the representatives of the organisations invited to  send delegates, viz.:  the Parlia-mentary  Committee of the Trades Union  Congress, the National War EmergencyCommittee,  the Parliamentary Committee  of  the  Co-operative  Congress, and theWomen&apos;s Industrial Organisation.  Lord Rhondda was present at the  meeting andmade a confidential statement showing the position in regard to cereals, sugar, meat,and fats.  On the proposal of Mr. Hyndman the following resolution was unanimouslypassed :            &quot; The Food Consumers&apos; Council of Great Britain proffers its sincere thanks       to the people of  the  United States of America for their  self-sacrifice and       generosity in curtailing their  own  food  consumption  for the  purpose  of       furnishing a more adequate supply to their friends and allies  in Europe who       are already suffering from scarcity.&quot;     The second meeting was held on Tuesday, February 5, when. Sir Leo ChiozzaMoney addressed  the Council  on the subject of shipping losses, giving confidentialfigures to show the extent to which tonnage had been diminished and the efforts beingmade to  build new ships so as to overtake this diminution.   Mr. Lesley, of the ConvoyDepartment of the Admiralty, showed the effect produced by the system of convoyingmerchantmen.  The meeting adjourned until the following day, when a preliminaryallocation was made of the members among the different divisions of  the Ministry,and Mr.  Wise explained the scheme for the distribution of meat.     The Council expressed the view that the meat coupon to be used for the rationingscheme in London and the  Home  Counties should have a money and not a  weight value.   .; Hoarding o/Food.-Lord Rhondda has  announced&apos;that  he regards  it as more important to secure that foodstuffs. inadvertently acquired in  excess of ordinary and proper requirements should be made available for general distribution than that their holders ^should be prosecuted.  He has accordingly provided that as between the 11th and 18th instant holders  may report their stocks to Local Food Committees with a view to their surrender and sale for the  public  benefit.  Such persons  will obtain exemption from any fresh proceedings in respect of supplies so surrendered and will receive half  the; value of. the surrendered supplies.     4 (33)4987-1*  Pkl 105  2/18 E&amp;S                                         A
                     . I J CPHTROL OF SUPPLIES4 ANJ) PRICES; I  ^     AZM Requirements. The Prime, Ministers          Britain, France, and Italy- have desired the following report from the Inter-Allied Wheat Executive to be cabled in their joint names to the President of the United States in the following terms :         (1) Shipments  of cereals, for bread  from North America  were in December              over 500,000 tons less  than  the programme accepted  by the Paris              Conference in November, and in January will probably be over 400,000              tons less than.that programme.  This deficiency of  900,000 tons was              due to railway  congestion,  car shortage, and  bunkering difficulties,              aggravated by exceptionally severe frost.        (2) These  deficient shipments, following  previous  importation below  the              requirements,  will cause a most serious  situation  throughout Allied              Europe in March, April, and May, and the position can only be relieved  &apos;            by very  large shipments from North America in February, March, and              April.        (3) The Wheat Executive fully realise and appreciate the great efforts which              are being made by Mr. Hoover and the American Food  Administration              to help  them at this grave period.  They are aware that Mr. Hoover              recognises the gravity of -the situation, and is in agreement  with, them              as to the needs of the European Allies, but they point  out that  to ship              an average of. one million tons of bread-stuff cereals, quantities which              they regard  as  a minimum, in February and in March, must involve a              great effort  by the Railway and  Fuel Administrations,  as well as  the              Food Administration, and they beg that instructions may be given so that              this shipment  may be a definite  first charge on American effort until              the period of stress is passed.     We  decided to forward  this Report to you,  and to inform you that, in our opinion, the need of bread cereals in Europe cannot be exaggerated, and to request you to give the instructions asked  for.   Arrangements have been made to  provide the shipping required,  although this has only been possible by a reduction of  the importation of munitions to such an  extent as would not have been contemplated but for the critical character of the food  situation.     It is our deliberate  conviction that  food shortage, with its effect on the moral of the population,  which has been one of the principal causes of the  breakdown  of Russia, is the greatest danger at present threatening each of the European Allies.     Versailles, January 31, 1918.     Owing to the continued congestion  on the American railways it has been im- possible to ship more than a small part of the January programme of  food purchases in the United States.  Mr.  Owen Smith has secured allotments  for  practically  the whole  of  the minimum programme required by the  Ministry of. Food  at a cost, apart from  cereals and sugar,  of about 53,000,000 dollars for January,  but  the actual payments which have fallen due in the month, owing to the above state of things,  are only 19,000,000 dollars.     Butter Earns, and Lard. By a  notice dated the 2nd February 1918, made under the Bacon, Ham,  and Lard (Provisional Prices) Order, 1917, the maximum prices  at which American  or Canadian lard  may be  sold  by an importer of such lard were raised to the following figures:                          152s. Od. per cwt. for refined lard.                         149s. Qd.    ,,     ,, unrefined lard.     The object in raising the  prices was to  avoid all risk  of loss on  the purchases now being made in America.     This Ministry  is in  communication with  the Pharmaceutical  Society of Great Britain and the British Medical Association  on the  question of stopping the use of lard for medical ointments.     It has been decided that Chinese bacon  and  lard should be  taken over by this Ministry on arrival.     The Local Authorities Division is preparing  particulars of the requirements ofv, each  area in order that the scheme of  distribution, the postponement of  which was announced on the 28th January 1918,  may be considerably improved.
 ;::   Butter.-Further purchases have been  maple in U.S.A.,. amounting to 380 tons,at prices varying between 42f and 47 cents per lb.  a.s. in New York,  J[n &quot;Canada afurther 50 tons of ;butter: has^per lb.  The &quot; Belgic &quot;arrived on January 31st from lLS;A:,; carrying 5S7 tons ofbutter, and the &quot; Highland Glen &quot; from the Argentine, with 195 tons.     The total quantity of butter on the water on February 2nd was 16,165 tons.     Cereals. The  French Government  has  appointed  General  Pierrot to  act  asrepresentative in charge of their interests in  connection with the Allied purchases  ofgrain in the Argentine.     In order to lessen the risks of local  shortage  it has been decided to establishflour depots in the Western Islands and Highlands of Scotland.   The reserves wilTbe  ,maintained by the Landed Grain Committee for Scotland, and releases will be made-only oh the order of the Food Commissioner.     An Order  has been  issued revoking Clause 3  (b) of  the  Grain (Prices)  Order,1917.  The effect of the amending  Order  is to abolish the preference given  tomalsters and other licensed manufacturers in purchasing undried home-grown barleyas from the 1st March next,&apos;and to place all  buyers on the same footing  as regardsthe authorised maximum price.               .....:&apos;     Subject to certain  exceptions  therein mentioned, the Rice  (Retail Prices) Order,1918, dated January 2nd, 1918, fixes a.-maximum-retail-price of 4d. a lb. for rice,ground rice, rice flour,  flaked rice,  or any similar rice product.     Cocoa-After prolonged consultation &quot;with  the  Advisory Committee, the draftheads of four Orders approved by them regulating respectively the prices of raw cocoa,the price of cocoa butter,  the manufacture of  cocoa powder, and  the prices  of cocoapowder, have been submitted for  sanction.     Dried  Fruits. The S.S.  &quot; Cedric &quot;  has arrived at  Liverpool with 120 tons ofraisins, and  arrangements have been made to hand  over the quantity  which  theSwedish  Government  placed  at our disposal for  making plum puddings for  thetroops.     The S.S. &quot; Nellore &quot;  has  arrived in London with 280 tons  of Indian  sultanas,which are part  of the 1,000 tons purchased before Christmas.     Meat. There is very little change to be reported in the meat situation.  Theimprovement in the number  of stock coming into the markets is very slow, and  theindustrial areas are still relying to a very large  extent upon imported meat.  Largequantities have been obtained  from the Board of Trade,  and vessels are now arrivingsteadily with our purchases from  the United States.  This latter meat is needed forconsumption almost as fast as it arrives, and there appears  small  prospect at presentof being able to build up any reserve.     Advice  has been  received from Mr.  Owen Smith of the purchase  of some20,000 tons, forming part of the special  order for 40,000 tons in February, and  theintention is that the whole of this quantity shall be. shipped iby, the 15th March.     Strikes  have been threatened  in  several  munition and industrial areas,  theshortage of food being the grievance, but in most cases prompt despatch of a supplyof  meat  has alleviated the situation and prevented the strike, the only exceptionbeing at Stafford where there is a strike at the collieries at the.present time.     Smithfield Market is closed  by order  of the. Food  Controller from Friday toMonday inclusive in each week, on account of the restricted supply of meat.    sMilk.-Th&amp; following prices  of milk to  the  producer have been fixed for  thenext few months :--             Is. 6d. per gallon during April.             Is.                ,,   May and June.               .             Is. 2d.  ,,              July.             Is. 3d.- ,,   ,,      ,,   August and September&apos;.     Oils and Fats. The amount of  oils and fats received in this country during thepast year is much below requirements, and  only represents about one  half of  theamount required ; there; is also considerable delay in supplies coming forward.  Afterallowing for the  quantity  exported,  the imports  in  1917  totalled  380,205 tons,compared with 613,625 tons.in 1916 ; the amount required was 750,000 tons.     Poultry  and Game.-The  Food Controller  has  issued  an Order prohibiting  the; removal without licence of any stocks of poultry or game (including rabbits or hares)held in cold  stores.

Cold store  does  not include any refrigerated  transit  shed or any cold store of aless capacity than 5,000 cubic feet.     Sugar.-For the purpose of securing the fullest co-ordination of  the work of the Sugar Branch of the Ministry and that of the Royal Commission on the Sugar Supply, Sir  Charles Bathurst, chairman  of the  Royal Commission on the Sugar Supply, has consented to act as Director of Sugar Distribution.  The control of and  responsibility for  all matters  of distribution and  retail price of  sugar will be  transferred to Sir  Charles Bathurst,  except  so far as  relates to any question affecting  rationing machinery.     Tea. A conference  has been held with  the India Tea Association.   The draft contract  for the purchase of  tea by this Ministry,  as amended after consultation between the Association and this Ministry&apos;s legal adviser, was  discussed at  length. Some alterations were made, which are being  submitted to the  legal  adviser for approval.     A meeting  with  the Sub-Committee of  the Tea Control Committee has been held to discuss the question of  emergency supplies  to  areas where the  shortage is acute. Satisfactory arrangements were made.     A special Committee of the Tea Brokers&apos;  Association had an interview in regard to the sale conditions in connection with the ballot of National Control Tea.                              LOCAL  ADMINISTRATION.     The  Food  Control Committees (Requisitioning)  Order, 1918, dated  31 January 1918, empowers Food Committees to require any retailer to hold  all foodstuffs in his possession  at the  disposal of such Committees, and to distribute  them as  they may direct.  In their disposal of  any foodstuffs so acquired, the Food Committees shall obey the  directions of the Food Controller.   Provisions are made for the arbitration of disputed  claims, and caterers  are exempted from the  operation of the Order, which does not apply to Ireland.     The  Local  Distribution (Misuse of Documents)  Order, 1918, dated  2  February 1918, prohibits  (a) the making of false statements with a view to obtaining food under distribution arrangements, (6) the  forging or altering of any document relating  to; such  arrangements, (c) false representations in respect of any claim to food there- under, or id) wrongful  retainer of any document,  or failure to comply with any lawful direction in  regard thereto.  It further  prohibits  unauthorised  communication  of confidential information acquired by members  or employees of Food Committees.  &apos; .     Labour Representation. Numerous protests continue  to be received  from labour organisations with regard to the constitution  of  the  Food Control Committees, and local authorities show greater  readiness to  meet  them. 29 applications for sanction to enlarge the committees have been recently received, of  which 9 have been  granted and the - other  20 are  awaiting formal sanction.  In  almost every one of these cases; the applications are for the purpose of giving additional representation to labour.      Rationing Schemes.-Of the 15 divisions into which Great Britain is divided for the purpose of  food administration, eight have now adopted the uniform scheme prepared by  the Ministry, which so far comprises the rationing of butter, margarine, and meat. These divisions are : (1) London, (2)  Home Counties, (3) South Midlands, (4) South Wales, (5) North Wales, (6) Glasgow Division,  (7) Edinburgh Division, (8)  Inverness Division.      Of  the  remaining  Divisions, the  following are now  practically  covered byindividual  rationing  schemes:  (1)  Leeds   Division,  (2)  Manchester  Division, (3)  Nottingham Division,  (4) Birmingham Division,  (5) Newcastle  Division.      The Bristol and Cambridge Divisions, whilst  having a few isolated schemes provisionally approved, have not yet adopted a  uniform scheme for the entire  area, but the Divisional Commissioners are taking steps to that  end.     It is estimated  by the Commissioner for the^ Midland Division that out  of&quot; a population  of three and one-third millions, roughly one million have been  rationed for tea  and margarine since the first of January, and  that by the 18th instant practically three millions will be rationed for those articles.
    Canteens.-- A conference, was held in Glasgow last week- under the chairmanshipof Lord D&apos;Abernon, with a view to increasing facilities for the distribution of foodsupplies in the Clyde area, by the extension of the canteen system.  ...    An Advisory  Committee was formed, including the Director of Munitions inScotland,  and the Divisional  Food  Commissioners  for the Eastern  and Western;Divisions, for the purpose of taking immediate steps  for  the  development of thecanteen system among the shipyards  and other works on the  Clyde-it will subse-quently extend its operations to other parts of Scotland.    Shortage. The situation  both as  regards  the shortage  of supplies and  theirdistribution continues  to be a  source of general complaint throughout the country,more, especially from railwaymen unable to obtain supplies for long journeys ;  canalboatmen ; workers in  the Iron Ore Districts  of Lincolnshire and  Cumberland; coalminers in  the &quot;Leeds  Area and the  Forest  of Dean, and quarrymen  in Leicester.There has also been some unrest near London; for example, at Dartfofd and Crayford.    From the&quot; Midland Division it is reported that there have been several instancesof grocers&apos; and butchers&apos; premises being raided, and that in  one town a lorry con-taining margarine was  turned  over in  the  road, and the boxes broken open, but thatso far no food strikes have occurred within the area.   , B,esolutions  have been received from a number of Representative  Labour Bodies,demanding compulsory rationing and equitable distribution.  In-some cases threatsof strikes are made, if immediate action is not taken.    Exemptions  from  Military  Service. - During  the month  of  January  1918,314 individual applications for exemption, and 72  applications for release from theColours were dealt with.    The question of exempting essential men in the Flour Milling Trade  is  beingconsidered by the  Ministry of  National  Service as  a whole.   Pending a decision, nosuch men are to  be called up before March 31st.                      -. -  i    The labour requirements  of the Margarine  Industry and of  Wholesale Dairiesare being ascertained.                                 ENFORCEMENT.    For the weekending 26th January,  returns have been received  of 413 prosecutionsin England and  Wales of which 384 resulted in convictions.  The returns are not,however, complete.       90 prosecutions were in connection with flour and bread.       61       ,,         ,,         ,,         potatoes.       48       ,,         ,,         ,,         meat.       41       ,,                             jam.           .     ,       40                ,,         ,,         butter and margarine.       19       ,,  -       ,,         ,,         public meals.  ,.

When requirements arc met partly from home sources and partly from imports,deficiencies in the former render necessary an increased importation.     The imports of tea have been sufficient  for several weeks to meet consumption and add to stock.                                  CONSUMPTION.     Meat. Unfortunately, the  position with regard to home supplies in  respect of butchers&apos; meat, bacon and dairy produce shows little improvement.     The supply of home-fed meat in the&apos; week ending January 26th at the Central Market, London, and three provincial  markets was 20 per cent, lower than in the previous week, and little over half the supply in the corresponding week of last  year (Table B).   In London there was no improvement in the week ending February 3rd.     Supplies of  fat stock for the week ended 30th January showed a general improve- ment on those of the preceding  week, which  were very low indeed.     Supplies of  fat cattle at 59  markets were 11 per cent, up, but still 40&apos;3 per cent. below those of  the  corresponding  week  last  year.  The average weekly supply for January was 64&apos;7 per cent, below that of a year ago.   Supplies of fat sheep at these markets for the week were 41 per cent, above those of the preceding week, but 60 * 9 per  cent,  below those of  the same  week last year.   Average weekly  supplies for January were 24*9  per  cent,  below those  of last year.  Supplies of fat pigs  at the  same markets were  7&quot;7 per cent, below those of the  preceding week, while supplies for the month were 70&apos;9 per cent, below those of January 1917.     The disturbance of &quot;the normal trading channels has rendered these 59 markets less reliable than formerly as an index for the whole country.   A return obtained from 208 markets, for the four weeks ended 2nd February, shows  a decrease  of  44:2 per cent, in cattle on the  corresponding weeks  a year ago.   The  real decrease, however, is greater than this, since the  abolition of sales  outside markets makes the comparison unduly favourable to this year.     A return  from 157 markets for the three weeks  ended  2nd February shows a decrease of  60&apos; 1 per cent, compared with the corresponding weeks  of 1917.   Thefirst week in  January when  supplies of  sheep  were  high  is not included  in  thisreturn...........  .              PART II. SUMMARY  OF THE  FOOD POSITION.                                    IMPORTS.    There was a  considerable improvement in imports last  week ;  the aggregateweight of the principal foods imported was 155,000 tons (Table A), a total which hasnot been reached since November 10th, 1917. .    There were increases over the previous week in the cases of  wheat, flour, barley,maize, meat, bacon, cheese, and butter, and decreases in oats, sugar, rice, and tea.    The following table shows that even the higher imports  of last week are belowthose  estimated as required to preserve the  standard of 1916. in the case of cereals orof meat, still less do they compensate for the deficiencies of both in previous weeks, orthe recent grave shortage in home supplies of meat.
    Having regard to these  figures the position  may  be summarised as follows.There has been a slight improvement, in  the week under consideration as comparedwith the preceding week.  On the  other hand, during the past month the averageweekly supplies of home-fed meat as estimated in livestock market returns  points toa decrease when compared with the similar weeks in 1917, amounting to over 50 percent, in cattle and somewhat less in sheep.    There was a very slight  increase in the  supply of  foreign meat in the weekending January 26th (Table B), but there has  been  again a falling off in London inthe subsequent week.    The consumption of all meat in  January, 1916, appears to have been  only one-half that in January,  1917, and  27 per  cent,  below the consumption in December,1917.        -                              WHOLESALE PRICES.    The  price of British oats has risen  2s. to 50s. 2d. per quarter, and wheat andbarley by trifling amounts.  Other prices are unchanged (Table F).A 4987-1
