The s/s &quot;CORK&quot; was torpedoed and sunk on the 26thJanuary.Coal for Italy.         The quantity of coal shipped from this country to Italyin January is not likely to exceed 250,000 tons.   A certain amountof coal is now going from Prance into Italy, hut &quot;by no means insufficient quantities to make up for the very serious drop in thecoal imported from this country.   All possible pressure is beingused with the French to persuade them to increase the directsupplies as this course offers the only possible means of meetingItaly1g needs and is also attended by a minimum of risk.Coal for Greece.         It has been arranged to supply sufficient coal in theMediterranean to meet the requirements of the Greek Naval Forcesengaged with ours in Convoy work.   This supply will be made inBritish tonnage; the amount of tonnage left in the hands of Greecebeing Insufficient to meet this requirement.United States Coal position.         The latest reports are that the bunker position is verymuch improved, and it is hoped the delay, which has amounted insome cases to a fortnight, to ships bringing Wheat will from nowbe reduced.Coal position in South Africa.         The shortage of coal for bunkers and export due tobreakdown of the Railways through floods, has now disappeared andthere is ample coal available to meet all&quot;demands likely to bemade by shipping.
