January 1918.I CIRCULATE a memorandum which has been prepared in the Ministry.                                             WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.January 30, 1918.SUPPLIES OF  RAW  MATERIALS FROM SPAIN.    The  continued rise  in the  outward freights  to Spain has  produced so serious asituation that it is considered necessary to draw the attention of the War Cabinet tothe matter.    When the war broke out, the outward freights from Cardiff to Huelva ruled about6s. per ton.  Towards the  middle of 1915 freights rose gradually to 20s., then to 30s.Early in 1917, as a consequence of the unrestricted submarine warfare, freights jumpedto 70s., and then rose to  about 100s.  Since the middle of 1917 matters  have gonerapidly from bad to worse, until in November freights bad reached 230s., in December300.?., and by  the middle  of January 400s., with every indication that  they will gohig-her..    As soon as outward  freights to Spain had reached 100s., the matter was taken upby  the Ministry  of Munitions  with the Shipping Controller, with a view to  seeingwhether  the rise  could  not  be stopped, as  it was clearly foreseen that an  increase inprice of many pounds. per ton of coal was bound to have a very serious effect, not onlyupon  the  mines themselves, but also  upon  the railways transporting the  ore to theports, as well as on other Spanish industries.    On the 2nd October, 1917, the Shipping Controller wrote a letter to the Ministryof Munitions, from which the following is an extract :          &quot; In the Committee&apos;s view it is important that coal should be transported to    Spain in Soanish ships, otherwise these ships go on to services which - are of no    bpnefit to the Allied cause, and  must  be replaced by British tonnage or neutral    tonnage  under Allied control.   This results,  of course, in a considerable loss of    tonnage available for Allied services.         &quot; The Committee has  therefore recommended to the Inter-Allied Chartering    Executive Committee and to the Ministry of  Shipping that no charters  be allowed    to Spain except at  the full Spanish freight rate, whether the ship to be chartered    is British or neutral.&quot;    On the 16th  November, 1917, the Ministry of Shipping  wrote a further letter tbthe Ministry of Munitions (copy of which is attached).   From these  two letters thefollowing arguments appear :      1. That Spain is the only ship owning neutral country in the world- on  which the           Shipping Controller is unable to use the &quot;big stick,&quot; owing  to the  serious           consequences which  would result to  the  Ministry  of Munitions from any           stoppage, however short,  of  exports from  Spain,  this being  especially the           case with iron ore, of which there are no stocks whatever in the country.     2. The British requisitioned and non-Spanish neutral tOnnage available is  stated           tl\ be  only  barely sufficient to  maintain the  supply of  bunker coal to           Gibraltar.       [202]                                                             B
S     3. It is the policy of the Admiralty and the Shipping Controller not to allowany           non-Spanish neutral to accept  a charter for a  Spanish port, although           controlled neutrals are available at rates about 100s.     4. As Spanish  shipping cannot be  coerced, the only means to  get  it into the           Spanish trade is to bribe the Spanish shipowner, in competition with  other           outside charterers.     5. The policy of making no exception whatever to the rule that the market rate           of freights is to be paid on all cargoes, even if carried in requisitioned ships,           is justified on general grounds, and also upon  the  special ground that the           Cortina Agreement was then  about to be signed, and it was feared  that, if           any exception was made to the general policy and preferential treatment           were accorded to any Spanish industry, difficulties would ensue.     6. At the  time these letters were written, strong  hopes were entertained that, as a           result of the Cortina Agreement Spanish shipping  would  be forced  into the           Spanish  coal trade by the Spanish  Government and that freights  would           accordingly be substantially reduced.     The present position with  regard to the  principal materials for the  supplies ofwhich Great Britain is dependent primarily or largely  upon Spain is as follows :                                 Imported Iron Ore.     Great Britain is dependent upon Spain for 70 percent, of its total imported iron-oresupplies about 500,000 tons per month of which about half is shipped from Bilbaoand  the other northern ports and the remaining  half from the Mediterranean ports.  Acertain quantity of iron ore  is also imported by France and Italy.     The full effect  of  the  Shipping Controllers policy has  not yet been felt by theiron-ore exporters, except in the  case of those exporters who are dependent on the GreatSouthern Railway of Spain, which has actually  ceased to  transport ore on the groundthat it cannot afford to pay the present  prices for coal.   The tonnage of ore involved isover 750,000 tons per annum.     The Compania  Minas del Rif,  which ships about  200,000 tons  per annum atMelilla, a Spanish port in North Africa, has also had trouble.     The Carthagena and Herrerias  Steam Tramway Company (Limited), which trans-ports about 650,000 tons per  annum,  submits  that  the  freights will mean ruin andcompel them  to stop transporting ore.     The northern ports Bilbao, &amp;c. are seriously affected, although not to the sameextent as those in the south, owing  to the fact  that  the  northern mines are near thecoast, and also that for the mining of iron ore comparatively little coal is required ;  andgrave fears are entertained for the future.                                      Lead.     Out of a total requirement for the United  Kingdom  of 250,000 tons per  annum,65,000 tons can be obtained from Spain, together with  an additional 20,000 tons whichwas originally allocated  to Russia.  The advantage  of obtaining supplies  of  lead fromSpain is obvious, seeing that the alternative is to obtain lead from Australia,     It is a term of the contract with the suppliers, the Penarroya Company and others,that the Ministry of Munitions shall provide freight for three-quarters of a, ton of cokefor each ton of  lead purchased, the price of lead  being fixed  at the low figure of 291.per ton.   Any  freights  paid to  neutral  ships in respect of this coke are, therefore, adirect charge upon the taxpayer.     Apart from the difficulty of obtaining freight for the  transport of the coke required,there is great difficulty in shipping the lead  to  the coast, owing to the railway beingshort of coal-the present arrears amounting to  11,000 tons.                                     Copper.     The Rio Tinto  Company produces  about 2,000  tons monthly  of copper  metal,which supplies the Ministry, not only with approximately one-tenth of its requirements,but also with metal of a quality specially suitable for certain classes of war work, e.g.,shell bands.  Any interference with this supply would be a serious matter.
                                 Sulphur&apos;Pyriles.     The position with regard to pyrites is that the United Kingdom is dependentupon Spain for 75,000 tons a month (out of a total British-requirement of 8.0,000 tonsa month), America for 80/100,000 tons a month, and France for 50/fiO.OOO tons a month.The  only other source in  the world of pyrites available for  export is  Norway,  whichcould not in any event produce one-sixth of the total Allied requirements.     It is primarily with pyrites that difficulties have  been  caused by the excessive risein freights.    All the contracts for the  supply of  pyrites  to the United Kingdomexpired at the end of 1917, and as from that date arrangements  had been  undernegotiation  for many  months for  the Ministry  of  Munitions  itself to  purchase  andimport the whole of the pyrites required in the United  Kingdom, and  to resell themat a  flat delivered rate to  sulphuric acid makers.     The quantities of coal used by the pyrites mines are large, as on an  average  1  tonof coal is required to mine 25 tons of pyrites, but this coal  lactor does not apply  to theBio Tinto Company,  the largest producer of all, which, on account of its owning its ownrailway, copper works,  sulphuric acid works, &amp;c, uses 1 ton of coal for every 13 tons ofpyrites mined.     After great difficulty, caused primarily by the  freight  situation,  contracts havebeen arranged with the principal mines,  other than   the Rio Tinto Company, on  thebasis that the British Government agrees to pay the freight in excess of 100s. on  1  tonof coal  for  every 25 tons of pyrites  imported  into this country.   The  Rio  TintoCompany absolutely  refuse to make any such arrangement,  as  it maintains that  it  hasvery large forward contracts in the United  States and  France,  and that accordinglythe increase in cost  due to the  rise in coal freights must be  borne entirely by  theBritish  Government.   The result  is that,  on  the basis of a 400s.  freight,  whilethe pyrites from the other mines costs Government about 30s. per ton f.o.b., if the  HioTinto terms were accepted the pyrites would cost more than 151. per ton f.o.b , assuminga purchase of 150,000 tons during  1918.     Owing to the fact that the Rio Tinto Company is the  largest producer, it is  netpossible,  even if  it  were desirable, not  to make any  contract  at all with it,  andaccordingly some solution  of the present difficulty has got to be found.     It is no doubt  possible that,  if an appeal were made  to  the patriotism of  thedirectors of the Rio Tinto  Company, that company would agree to enter into a contracton the lines of the contracts agreed to by the other mines,  in  which event the pyriteswould cost the Government about 35s.  per ton  f.o.b.,  but  in  this case the Rio  TintoCompany would be obliged to force its American and French  consumers to agree to anincrease in price of some 23s. per ton on the pyrites sold to them, with  all the politicalconsequences which would ensue.     These consequences  are illustrated by the fact  that  in about September  1917,when the freights from  Spain  to America rose  from  about 20s. to about 35s. and  theRio Tinto Company asked its American consumers to  bear  the increase,  the immediateresult was a cable from Mr. Brand stating that this  increase had created serious  alarmin America,  and  that the American Government  were considering, as  a  retaliatorymeasure, prohibiting the  export of sulphur from the United States to this  country.What the effect would be  of a  further rise in price of 23s.  per  ton on  a material  thef.o.b.  price of which is about l:-is. per ton it is difficult  to foresee, but it would certainlycreate a very unfortunate  impression in America and France.     Early in December 1917 this whole question  of the Rio  Tinto Company&apos;s pyritescontracts was laid unofficially before  Mr. Crosby, the Assistant Secretary of the UnitedStates Treasury, for his consideration, and Mr. Crosby was  asked whether he wouldmake representations to the United States Government with a  view to that Governmentarranging with the  Rio Tinto Company&apos;s  consumers to bear the extra cost of thepyrites  so  as to  overcome  the  main  obstacle to a  settlement  with  that  company.Mr. - Crosby  immediately replied  that if  and so long  as  the British Governmentconsidered it desirable, as  a matter of policy, to make  large  profits out of the shippingcontrolled by it, he was not prepared to make any effort to assist the British Government,and that questions  of this nature  were bound to cause  serious difficulties, not onlybetween this ountry and  America, but also between this country, France, and Italy.     Mr. Crosby  stated  that the  impression  that the  British  Government  was&quot; profiteering&quot; prevailed universally, not only in France and Italy, but also in America,and that he considered it practically most desirable that if, in fact, such profiteering werenot taking place, he should  receive perfectly specific assurances on thispoint so as to enable
him to&apos; satisfy his Government, and through  his  Government  the Governments ofFrance and Italy.     As a result of this unofficial conversation with Mr. Crosby a letter was written onthe 22nd December, 1 917, to the Treasury, copy of which is attached.     On  the 14th  January, 1918, the  Treasury sent a reply, copy of which is  alsoattached.  As will  be seen, this reply does not deal with the main question of principle,but  merely refers  to  the letter  of  the  16th  November,  1917, from  the ShippingController, which, as mentioned above, only purports to explain the special circumstancesthen prevailing in connection with the exports of coal to Spain.     While  the Shipping Controller and the Admiralty are, no doubt, in a position tojustify their policy with regard to these Spanish freights, it  is of course clear that nosuch  assurance  as  that  asked for by  Mr. Crosby  can  possibly  be given  as  long as&quot;market&quot; rates are charged,  not only on Spanish vessels, but  also on requisitionedtonnage  which is allowed to supplement the deficiency of Spanish  ships, as the profit ona 400s. freight is, of course enormous.   On the basis of the revised freights which haverecently  been  issued by the Shipping Controller such, for instance, as  85s. to CapeTown it is probable  that a  rate of one eighth of  that figure would still show a goodmargin of profit.     Although  it may be said that the general relations between the British Govern-ment and the Governments of America, France, and Italy do  not directly concern  theMinistry of Munitions, that Ministry is vitally interested  in the matter, not only inconnection with the supplies of pyrites, iron  ore, and lead from  Spain,  but also in thesupplies  of sulphur from Italy and the United States,  all of which are placed in seriousjeopardy by the policy of the Shipping  Controller.  For these reasons it  is submittedfor the consideration of the  War Cabinet that      1. The shipping policy of the Shipping  Controller with  regard to  Spanish traffic           should  be  brought under review  with a view to  seeing  whether the  dis-           advantages of the present policy do not outweigh the  advantages of bribing           a few Spanish shipowners  to put their ships into the Spanish coal traffic.     2. The suggestion made by Mr. Crosby should be adopted, and an official assurance           given him that, if this be the fact, the British Government, apart from  the           particular instance of outward freights to Spain, is not guilty of profiteering           in the manner suggested.The Secretary,    Ministry of Munitions,         6, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1.T. 53153/17.Sir,                                      Ministry of Shipping, November 16, 1917.    I am directed by the Shipping Controller to acknowledge the receipt of your letter(74/HEP/2L6) of the 3rd November relative to the freight on coal to Huelva and otherSpauish ports, and in  reply I am to offer the following observations:     For a long time past it has been the consistent policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government,framed with a  view to maintaining the essential  supplies of the Allies, to secure asgreat a measure of control as possible over the mercantile fleets of the neutral countriesof the world.   So far as those countries  are concerned which are susceptible  to  directpolitical artd economic pressure, this policy has been attended with a considerable degreeof success.    Unfortunately, as  Mr.  Churchill is  fully aware, the  dependence of this countryupon  Spain for supplies of minerals is so complete  that no effective pressure could bebrought to bear to secure any substantial assistance from Spanish shipping.    Spanish owners have therefore been perforce left free to employ their vessels in theroost lucrative trades  which  the world offers, and to select at their will such voyages aswill keep them out of the  danger zone.   The inevitable  consequence has been that,while Spain has tonnage more than sufficient for all her  needs, the  few owners whowere prepared to risk their  vessels to bring the coal supplies  which Spain needed have-found themselves  in  a position to charge  very  high freights, which now range from220s.  to 275s.  per ton,  according to  the port of discharge.   These rates have  notreached this level owing to any action on the part of  the Ministry ; they are the ratescharged in a free market by  Spanish owners to their own compatriots.
The Secretary,    Treasury, S.W. 1.74/H.E.P./216-M.F. 3.Sir.          .                                               December 22, 1917.    I  AM  directed  by the Minister of  Munitions to  refer to your  letter of  the8th December, 1917 (40116/17), on the subject of the general arrangements now underconsideration for the supply of pyrites to sulphuric acid makers in the United Kingdom.I am to state, for the information of their &quot;Lordships, that the negotiations with  themines  are proceeding satisfactorily, with the exception  of those with the Rio TintoCompany, which  are now at  a deadlock, as the Rio Tinto Company (which exports upto one-fifth of its pyrites to this country, and the  balance to  the  United States andFrance) has been much  alarmed by the recent enormous rise in the cost of coal freightto Spain.   . For this  reason  the  company will  not enter  into a contract for the supply ofpyrites to  the British  Government unless the  British  Government  is  prepared  toindemnify it against the cost  of  freight on its  coal  exports to Spain  over 100s.,irrespective of wnether this coal is used to mine the pyrites to be bought by the BritishGovernment or the pyrites already sold to the private buyers in the United States andFrance.  The company has already been offered and refused an indemnity in respect of       [202]                                                              0    Mr.  Churchill is under a misapprehension in thinking that any additional charge of61. 10s. a ton has been imposed in so far as the general supply of British coal to Spainis concerned.  With the exception of a few cargoes for the mines and one or two otherfirms who receive special consideration, no coal has gone to Spain for some  considerabletime in other than Spanish ships.    Mr.  Churchill will appreciate that, to allow British vessels or neutral vessels underthe control of His Majesty&apos;s Government to carry coal to Spain  at^ rates lower thanthose charged by Spanish  owners  must  operate  not only  to relieve  the  Spanishcommunity of the responsibility for providing for its own needs, but also to  encouragethe Spanish shipowner to keep his vessels outside the danger zone  in trades which areof no benefit either to Spain  or to the Allies.    The  importance of attracting Spanish tonnage back to the carriage of coal from theUnited Kingdom to Spain is so great that Sir Joseph Maclay considered it essential todiscontinue the practice hitherto followed of giving special treatment to those  firms inSpain whose activities were  of direct  benefit to the Allies.  This practice, moreover,might prove very embarrassing if it were in operation when the proposed agreementwith Spain  is signed, since  it  might be difficult to justify differentiation in treatmentbetween particular Spanish interests.    Mr.  Churchill will realise that in present circumstances every cargo of coal carriedto a Spanish port in  a  ship whose  employment can be controlled by this  Ministry iscarried at the expense either of the bunker depots at Gibraltar or in the Mediterranean,or of the coal supplies  of  our Allies.   Sir Joseph  Maclay feels that he need notenlarge either upon the vital necessity of maintaining adequate bunker supplies, anyfailure in which would immobilise  the ships  on which the preservation of the Alliesdepends,  nor  upon the  importance  at  the present juncture of sending every availableton of coal to our Italian allies.  -    As Spanish ships cannot be  compelled to  run the risks attendant on  a voyage tothe Mediterranean in  direct Allied interest, but can apparently at a price be inducedto do so in Spanish interests, Sir Joseph Maclay feels  that  the financial considerationsadduced  in  the letter  under reply are of secondary importance  compared with thetonnage considerations involved.    Mr.  Churchill is, of course,  in  a  position to decide whether the financial positionand the contractual obligations of the Pyrites Mines  and the other interests concernedare such as  to  necessitate  any compensation for the increased freights charged, butSir  Joseph  Maclay, after full consideration  of the circumstances,  is convinced that ifsuch compensation  is warranted  it should take the form of a direct payment frompublic funds, or a modification of  existing contracts, rather than the provision of cheapfreight,  which could  only be  secured  at  the expense of other Allied services, theimportance of which cannot be measured in terms of money.                                                 I am, &amp;c.                                          (Signed)      GRAEME  THOMSON.
the coal required for the proportion of its pyrites which the British Government desiresto buy.         &apos;    -     In view of the serious position in which Mr. Churchill is placed by the breakdownof the neaotiations with the Bio Tinto Company, it becomes necessary to consider whatalternatives are open in order to remove the deadlock.     These alternatives appear to be four in number, namely :-     1. For the British Government  to  pay to the  Bio Tinto Company the  excess           freight over 100s. in  respect not only  of  the imports  of coal required to           mine the pyrites to be brought to this country, but also the pyrites already           sold to the United States and France.     2. For the1 various Governments to stand  aside and allow matters to take their           course, by leaving it to the Bio Tinto Company to come  to some arrange-           ment with  the buyers in the United States and France.     3. For the  British,  French, and  United Spates  Government  respectively&apos; to           indemnify the company in respect of so much of its imports  of coal  as is           used to mine the pyrites sold to their respective nationals.     4. For the Governments of the United States and  France to arrange with  their           nationals to pay the excess freight, and in their turn to charge higher prices           for their acid.     With  reference to the first  alternative, Mr. Churchill  feels that  their  Lordshipscannot be expected to sanction such a proposal, as, apart from the political considerationsreferred to below, the price of sulphuric acid in France and the United States is not amatter in which the  British taxpayer is directly interested.     With reference to the  second alternative, this would be the natural alternative forthe British Government to adopt, were it not  for the attitude taken up by the RioTinco Company, which  states that unless a way out of the present impasse can be foundit will have no alternative but to close down its mine altogether.  This is a contingencywhich none of the three Governments can  face, as supplies of pyrites fiom Rio Tintoare vital for the carrying on of the war on the present  scale.  The Rio Tinto Companyis  believed  to have large  forward  contracts at fixed pries in America and France,although it has none in this country.  In addition, some  of these forward contracts areon a c.i.f. basis.   Unless something is done, the Rio Tinto Company is  therefore facedeither with bearing the whole extra cost  of coal  itself, or of demanding a modificationof its contracts with its French and American buyers on the plea that through theaction, or, at any rate, with the  connivance of the British  Government, freights arebeing charged on coal to Spain out of all proportion to  the cost of transport.     A further complicating element is that the freights on the transport of pyrites fromSpain to the United States have recently risen by 50 per cent., and, atter much  difficulty,the Rio Tinto  Company has arranged with its buyers either  to pay the whole  increase,or, at any race, to share it.  The Rio Tinto Company is  unwilling, and has so far refusedabsolutely again to approach its consumers formally with a view to getting the contractsmodified, although it has warned  its buyers that a further big increase in the cost  tothem of pyrites may be expected.   The result is that  the United States Governmenthas threatened, as a  retaliatory measure., to place an embargo upon the export of sulphur,which would have a serious effect on the production of acid by the contact process  inthis country.     With  reference to alternatives 3 and 4,  the whole matter was laid  before theAmerican Board by Sir Keith Price on the.17th September, and-Mr. Austen Chamber-lain  was asked whether he would make representations to the United States Governmentwith a view to that Government either arranging to give  the  Rio  Tinto Company theindemnity referred to or to arrange with its nationals to pay the extra  cost.     After some consideration Mr. Austen Chamberlain  came to the conclusion that thiswas not a matter upon which the American Board could take action, and he suggestedthat  Sir Keith Price  should see Mr. Crosby  on this subject.  In  accordance withMr.  Austen Chamberlain&apos;s suggestion, a meeting was held with Mr. Crosby on the18th instant, and the position explained to him.     After hearing the  facts Mr. Crosby at once stated  that  if, as he believed to be thecase, the British Government had decided as a matter of policy to  make profits out  ofthe British and  neutral tonnage  controlled  by it, questions of this nature were boundto arise, and he could take no action in the matter.  Mr. Crosby went on to  say thatif he was mistaken in his belief he was prepared to make  representations to the UnitedStates Government  on the lines suggested  only when he had satisfied  himself by/
a  personal investigation whether profits were  in  fact  being made  for  the  BritishGovernment by the shipping controlled by it.   Mr. Crosby added that the view thatthese profits were in fact being made prevailed  universally, not  only in America butalso in France and Italy, and he stated that if such profits were not in fact being madehe considered it  to be a matter  of the  most vital and urgent importance that anauthoritative statement to this effect should  be  made  at the earliest moment, seeinghow deeply these countries  resented  being, as they thought, exploited for the benefitof the British taxpayer.    Their Lordships are, no doubt, aware that the circumstances connected with therecent risa in the outward freights  to Spain were very  complicated, and were due inlarge  part to deliberate pressure being  put upon Spain  in order to  persuade theSpanish Government to sign the Cortina Agreement.  As this  agreement has now beensigned it is probable that the freight situation will improve,  but even if freights fall to150s.  or 100s. there still appears to be a very large margin  between these prices andthe actual cost of-transport.   It is not, however,  the facts of this particular case whichappear to Mr.  Churchill to be of such outstanding importance as  the point of generalpolicy involved, namely, whether  this opportunity should not be taken  to  place thewhole freight position before Mr. Crosby with a view to  convincing  him, and throughhim the Government of the United States, that  the British Government is not guiltyof profiteering in the manner suggested, and so dissipate  the feeling of resentmentwhich undoubtedly prevails  not only in  the United States but also in  France andItaly.    In the circumstances Mr. Churchill would be glad if their Lordships could arrangea  meeting  at which Sir  Joseph  Maclay, Lord  Robert  Cecil,  and himself could bepresent, with a view to this whole  matter being considered, and  if thought desirablea full explanation of the position being given to Mr. Crosby.   In conclusion, I  am toask that you will lay this letter before their Lordships  for their consideration as earlyas possible, the matter  being very urgent.                                                    I am, &amp;c.                                           (Signed)       S. DANNREUTHERThe Secretary,       Ministry of Munitions.918/189.Sir,                                       Treasury Chambers, January 11, 1918.    I  HAVE  laid  before  the  Lords Commissioners of  His  Majesty&apos;s  TreasuryMr. Dannreuthers  letter  of the 22nd  ultimo  (74/HEP/216-M.F.3) relative  to thenegotiations with the Rio Tinto Company and the rise in cost of coal freights to Spain.    With regard  to  the views  stated  to  have been expressed by Mr. Crosby at  hisinterview with Sir Keith Price, I am to point out that the allegations that the difficultyis  due to  the British Government making profits  out of  tonnage  controlled  by itappear to be completely disposed of by the  letter of the Ministry of Shipping-  dealincrwith this very subject  of  coal freights to Spain  and  addressed  to the Ministxy  ofMunitions on the 16th. November last (T.53153/17).  A copy of  this letter  had  beencommunicated to this Department in response  to representations made at the instanceof the Ministry.    My Lords  suggest  that it will  be sufficient  that the letter becommunicated to  Mr.  Crosby in  order to remove the misapprehension which hasapparently arisen.   As  their Lordships  have recentty agreed to a lar^e purchase  ofpyrites  in Scandinavia, they trust that the necessity of taking  special measures to-indemnify the Rio Tinto Company may now no  longer be-felt.                                                I am, &amp;c.                                          (Signed)      ROBERT CHALMERS.
