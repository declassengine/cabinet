FOOD PRODUCTION SCHEMES. IRELAND.

Memorandum prepared in compliance with Chief Secretary&apos;s Minute of 17th March, 1917.

Week ended 30th January, 1918.

The following is a brief statement on the work cf the Department during the past week in furtherance of increased Food production in Ireland:-

TILLAGE CAMPAIGN, 1918.

Conference with County Committees of  Agriculture.

On Tuesday and Wednesday 29th and 30th instant a Conference was held in Dublin between the Department and the  Chairmen and Secretaries of County Committees of Agriculture, to discuss tho present position in regard to tillage operations and  other matters affecting the production of food.

The Vice-President of the Department referred to the vital necessity of securing the maximum cultivation in  tho present year in view of tonnage difficulties and the circumstances of the War. He added that a special appea? had quite recently been received from the Government for a further additional tillage in Ireland;  and that after consultation with the Agricultural Board and the Advisery Committee the Department proposed that in addition to the 15% of tillage over that cf 1916 which had already been made compulsory, occupiers of holdings  containing 200 ? or over of arable land should be required by Order to till a further 5%, or 20% in all over the area tilled in 1916; and that smaller holders should be appealed to in every way to till the utmost area  in  their power above the 15% required by existing Orders.

The Vice-President also announced the result of negotiations with the Government in regard to the prices for crops to be  grown in 1918, and the financial provisions which had been made for agricultural schemes.

In the discussion which took place on the various matters before the Conference, the action of the Government in not making the arrangements in respect of the prices of potatoes for the 1917 ?rep applicable in the case of small lots was unfavourably criticised ?y some County Committee representatives.

An unfavourable reception was also given to the announcement of the prices guaranteed for the 1918 potato crop, and the conditions ?rning sale. The following resolution was passed  with a  few ?ssentients (who favoured  the adoption of a stronger resolution:-)

"That the Department be requested to represent to the Food Controller that the form and amount of the guaranteed prices for the encouragement  of the growing of potatoes will not fully attain the object in view, viz., the securing of an abundant supply of potatoes for home consumption and for expert"
The prices of grain and live stock were also discussed at length, especially as to their bearing on the question of increased cultivation in the future.

The Department made important announcements as to arrangements for the supply of seed wheat and flax for the coming season.

Conference with Agricultural Instructors.

On conclusion of the above Conference the Department held on 7Oth inst., a further Conference with the Agricultural Instructors in the various counties to discuss the details connected with the working of the Tillage schemes, and the methods of organisation best calculated to ensure the success of the propaganda for  increased food production.

TILLAGE (IRELAND) GENERAL ORDER, 1918.

A further, small number of applications for ?omption from the provisions of the Order were received during the week.

TILLAGE DEFAULTERS.

Letters on the lines indicated in previous reports have now been issued to about 1,200 occupiers in all, and 890 undertakings have been given that the areas in respect of which the occupiers are in default will be  ploughed up, out of old grass, with? a  specified time.

LAND INSPECTIONS.

Nothing has arisen during the week under this heading calling for special comment. The work of inspecting  holdings is proceeding on the usual lines.

LOANS FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS.

Eighty-three applications for loans for agricultural implements have been received by the Department during  the past week. The total value of machinery ordered from the beginning of the present year to date, under the Scheme, amounts to Â£6,993.

FLAX-GR0WING.

Markets for the purchase of farmers&apos; home saved flaxseed were opened on the 2?th inst. Five markets were hold in different towns in the flax-growing districts on that date. Adequate announcements of the arrangements had previously been made but practically no flaxseed was offered by the farmers for sale. It would accordingly ?pear that farmers in the districts concerned have so far followed the Department&apos;s advice as to the postponement of deseeding operations the retention of their flaxseed for sowings.
