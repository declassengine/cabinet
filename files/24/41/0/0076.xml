The usual fighter patrols have  also been carried out  by Dunkirk machines.enemy machines have been destroyed and five shot down out of control.ThreeOne  of our machines is missing.    Owing to weather conditions further air operations against &quot; Goeben &quot; were not possible Mediter-from the afternoon of January  25th until the morning of January 27th.  A special recon- ranean.naissance flight was then made, and about noon it was reported that  &quot;GoebenV positionwas unchanged.    On the night of January 27th, E.14 went up the Straits with the intention of attacking,as  early as possible, the  following morning.   She has not  returned, and the Turkishauthorities claim to have sunk her, saving 7 men.  ,. On January 28th, our aircraft reported &quot; Goeben &quot; was no  longer at Nagara, and thats earch of the Dardanelles and the Sea of Marmora had failed to locate her.    She appears to have arrived at Constantinople on the  evening  of  the  27th  andsubsequent reconnaissance  showed  that she  was moored  above the   Inner Bridge,Golden Horn..,    There is no certain information of  the extent of the damage sustained by &quot; Goeben,&quot;and in view of the short time she remained aground it is quite possible that her groundingwas accidental.    On January 20th the armed escort vessel &quot; Mechanician &quot; was torpedoed in the English Casualties.Channel, 13 officers and men being lost.    On January 28th the torpedo gunboat &quot; Hazard &quot; was sunk at Portsmouth as theresult of a collision with a hospital transport;  3 men were lost.    On January 30th the special service  vesselWeilholme &quot; was sunk by gunfire by anenemy submarine,  20 miles south of Portland Bill.   Three men were lost.    On January 31st in the North Sea, Submarine  K. 17 collided with H.M.S. &quot; Fearless,&quot;and sank.   About the same  time- submarines K. 4 and K. 6  were also in collision, K. 4being lost.  Five officers and fortyrthree men were lost from K.  17 and five officers  andfifty men from K.  4.    (  948) Wt.    55  2/18  H&amp;S

Four of the vessels operating were of the converted Deutschland type,          2 of these being to the south of the Canary Islands and 2 on voyage out.Actions        The following Table shows the number of actions with enemy submarines in Homewith enemy ^vaters during recent weeks, and the nature of the craft which have been engaged, andsubmarines         mimber 0f submarines destroyed:-Nature of Craft.

The losses of British vessels this week again show an increase in  tonnage but not innumbers, this being mainly attributable to the loss of the &quot; Andania &quot; of over 13,000, tons.The losses of Allied and Neutral  vessels reported  up to the present  are comparativelylow.
    The table in Appendix I shows in detail the. numbers and tonnage of sailings and of jjjjjj^0-losses by enemy action, and the percentage of losses to sailings of British Merchant Steam- sfcga^ip3ships of over 500  tons gross register ;  and the table in Appendix II shows by trades as ^ traaes.regards such ships the percentage of tonnage sunk by enemy action to tonnage sailing toand from United Kingdom ports during the last four weeks.    The percentage of losses to sailings this week,  as regards British tonnage employedin Overseas trades, is 1*92 as against 1*51 last week, and in Coasting and Cross-Channeltraffic is &apos;53 as against &quot;24 the previous week, while the total percentage of losses to sailingsas regards all United Kingdom traffic is 1*03 as against *72 the previous week.    The table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all British Merchant Vessels Areas insunk, damaged or molested, and of  all Allied and Neutral Merchant Vessels sunk in the       ^last two weeks hj enemy craft, and by mine, classified according to areas.       -          &quot;b    Considerable  Submarine activity has  been experienced in the Channel, the Irish Seaand the Mediterranean, but the;.Atlantic routes have been comparatively free, while inthe North Sea no vessel has been sunk, and only one small British vessel was attacked.

The World&apos;s mercantile tonnage, excluding enemy tonnage, amounted on August  1st, Total of1914, to 42,441,000 gross tons, and  on December 31st, 1917, after deducting marine losses Worldsand losses by enemy action, but adding new construction and enemy tonnage which  is Tonnage.now in the control of the Allies, it amounted to 39,622,000 gross tons.  The net loss, there-fore, if tonnage in German ownership be excluded, is  2,819,000 gross tons  or 6.6  per  cent.If ocean-going tonnage only is reckoned, the loss works out at between 8 and 9 per cent.

              It will be seen that of the 164 vessels, which, during 1917,  have been damaged          but not sunk by enemy action, representing over 850,000 tons, only 6, with a toonage of          18,403, or just over 2 per cent., have been abandoned.  The salvage of 12 others, with       .   a tonnage representing 5\ per cent, of the total, is in progress, while the repair  of 142,          with an aggregate tonnage of 764,348, or nearly 90 per pent, of the whole, has either been          completed or commenced.

Most of the mines destroyed          during the week belonged to groups referred to in last week&apos;s Appreciation.

None have entered or left Rotterdam.   - Three enemy vessels are reported as having left Delfzyl with coal, but there were nomovements of enemy vessels with timber during the week.                &quot;  .

The January output, both of warships and merchant vessels, is considerably less thanthe monthly average for last year, the merchant tonnage completed during  the monthbeing less than in any month since January, 1917.   This poor output for January wascaused by extended holidays, strikes, and unusually bad weather, but the combination of        pircumstahces : w^.exce^tional, -and&apos; it-should be borne in mind that during theIf^st-quarter of 1917 the actual&quot; &quot;aefivefies^of&quot; completed merchant tonnage exceeded theforecast&apos;by nearly 40,000 tens gross.              ..  :       -       .  .

The British tonnage sunk by enemy action during Januaryonly slightly exceeded  the figure for the month of November, which was the lowest sincethe commencement of unrestricted submarine warfare,  and  the unsatisfactory positiondisclosed by the month&apos;s balance sheet is  largely  attributable to the  poor  shipbuildingoutput above referred to.

She- cannot be docked as the existing docks are not large enough to take her, but the large cofferdams, which were used for repairing her in 1915 after she struck a mine in the Black Sea, are available for this purpose at Stenia Bay in the Bosphorus.
