Secret.                              Intelligence Bureau,9,2,18.                                 Department of Information.                                                C.18.          Memorandum on the Political Situation in the                           Caucasus.General Situation.     So far as we know the Trans-Caucasian Government is still inexistence.  The tearing up of the railway line between Baku andElizabetpol has, however, prevented the transport of consignmentsof flour from the Kuban district to Tiflis and is thus producing afood crisis which is becoming increasingly acute.  In normal timesGeorgia, for example, imported 50 million poods of grain from theKuban district annually, but cannot get at present even at the rateof a quarter of that amount.  The Ukrainians were prepared tc sendgrain from Odessa by boat, but the Black Sea Fleet, which is in thehands of the Bolsheviks, intimated their intention of preventingthis except on the condition that the TranB-Caucasian Governmentshould become Bolshevik.  It seems probable, therefore, that withina short period the Trans-Caucasian Government will be faced withan acute food crisis which may eventuate in riots and ultimatelyin its overthrow.  In that case it may be expected that the Russianarmy in Persia will get more than ever out of hand and commencepogroms in Persia and Armenia.  It is stated that already thePersian population in Gilan and Mazandaran has been decimated by theRussian soldiery.  If it is the case that the present Trans-Caucasian Government has definitely demanded the withdrawal ofBritish troops from Turkey in Asia on the basis of &quot;no annexations&quot;,this only strengthens the necessity for the Western Powers keepingin direct touch with and placing most reliance on the NationalCouncils, since the Federal Council (Trans-Caucasian Government) istheoretically opposed to the dismemberment of Turkey.   In the case of
a no-annexation policy being adopted Lazistan might be lost to theGeorgians - the actual Bolshevik proposal being that the provinceshould decide by referendum if it wants to remain in Turkey orrejoin Georgia - and Armenia in Turkey being either restored ormade autonomous would result in increased Armenian pressure onthe present Georgian territory.Constituent Assembly Election Results.     Confirmation of some of the possibilities and tendenciesoutlined in the previous paragraph may be further found in theresults of the Constituent Assembly election for the town of Tiflis,the figures of which have just come to hand.   The principal partiespolled as follows:-  Mensheviks 36,755j  Dashnaktsutiun 19,452;Bolsheviks  17,620;  Social Revolutionaries  11,526;  Cadets  9,462;Social Federalists (Georgians)  3,445;  Georgian National Democrats3,262.    Analysis shows that the garrison voted mainly Bolshevikand Social Revolutionary;  the prisons voted Bolshevik almostunanimously.  The outstanding feature, however, is the presenceand growth of a Bolshevik electorate whatever the explanation ofits origin.Declaration by Trans-Caucasian Government.     On December 4 a declaration was made by the Commissionersof the Trans-Caucasian Government to the people of Trans-Caucasia,from which the following extract may be given, in which theirpolicy is outlined.  By inference it also provides a picture of theconditions obtaining at present In Trans-Caucasia.          &quot;Definitely to improve the disorganised finance;  to     save the army and population from impending famine by securing     supplies for them;  to improve means of transport and ways     and communications;  regularly and healthily to demobilise     on conclusion of peace;  to protect public order;  to exercise     control over production and distribution, and by all means     to protect the interests of labour and those of the working
$lasses;  immediately to introduce a democratic Zemstvo;  toreorganise the tribunals and organs of administration;immediately to organise democratic land committees in placesin which they do not exist, so that they should take over themanagement of Appanage, State and Church lands, and alsoprivately-owned lands belonging to large proprietors, thepromulgation of the confiscation of which will follow in theimmediate future, together with a declaration regulating allland questions and to prepare them for the ConstituentAssembly Land Legislative body;  the immediate abolition ofall class privileges and institutions created for the purposeof protecting the interests of privileged classes;  toestablish good neighbourly relations with contiguous peopleson the basis of their recognition of revolutionary principles.     &quot;Adhering to the point of view of complete self-determina-tion of nationalities proclaimed by the Russian Revolution,the Commissioners of Trans-Caucasia will take steps to come toa rapid and equitable solution of the national questions inTrans-Caucasia.     &quot;Regarding the maintenance of unity of the general Russianfront the Trans-Caucasian Government Commissioners will takemost energetic steps towards the immediate conclusion of peace,being guided In this direction by the general conditionsobtaining on the Western front, by the conditions of locallife and in agreement with the v/ishes of the peoplesinhabiting the Caucasus&quot;.The Conclusion of an Armistice.     Conformably with the policy outlined in the preceding paragraphthe Commander-ln-Chief of the Army of the Caucasus intimated onDecember 5 to the Consuls of the Allied Powers in Tiflls hisacceptance of the proposal for an armistice on the whole of theCaucasian front received by him from the Commander-in-Chief of theTurkish Army.  The Russian Commander-in-Chief intimated that hewas &quot;compelled&apos;?&apos;to take this step in consequence of the generalpolitical conditions obtaining in Russia&quot;,  His acceptance ofthe &quot;humane&quot; proposal is further stated to be &quot;in no way directlyagainst the Allies of Russia, their interests being safeguardedby a condition imposed upon the enemy fully and immediately tocease proceeding with all strategic regroupment movements whichmight injuriously affect the English Army in Mesopotamia&quot;,   Aprotest was lodged by the foreign Consuls against &quot;the initiationof proceedings elaborating terms on the basis of which an armisticewas to be concluded without the knowledge of our Governments&quot;.
Georgian Affairs.     The Georgians continue to show enterprise in th$ reorganisationof their national life in all Its aspects.  Latterly the Georgian.National Council has arranged a general registration of its man-power in order to be eble to mobilise their forces for the economicorganisation of the country.  All the available professions arebeing classified, after which each individual will receive a cardand so be ready to undertake specified work of national importancewhen called upsn.     In addition to the re-establishment of the independence of theGeorgian Church, the creation of a national army, the formationof national schools, the opening of a national university andmobilisation of man-pow3r, the Georgians are also taking steps for fueestablishment of their own law courts.   A special Commissioncomposed of Georgian barristers is engaged in working out a schemefor this particular! reform.  During the past hundred years theGeorgian peasantry have suffered untold injustices under theprocedure of the Russian Law Courts, having to plead or defend                                                           tthemselves through Russian interpreters, a system that len/t itselfvery easily to unlimited bribery and abuse;  but with Georgianjudges and the use of the Georgian language some of the moreobvious forms of injustice will be removed.Georgian Manganese Ore Industry and its Importance for the War.     Attention may be drawn to the Importance of the Georgianmanganese ore industry for the war.  In spite of the repeatedattempts of foreign capital, 65% of the entire industry is still inGeorgian hands;  15% has been in the hands of German capitalistsdirectly connected, with Krupps., and in her extension towards theEast, Germany has continuously had her eye upon this Georgianindustry.  During the old regime a Swedish group of capitalists,
which was in close touch with Germany, endeavoured, it is saidthrough Hasputin1 s influence, to preventt the sale of Germanproperty here and desired to secure it for themselves.  But thiseffort was frustrated through a very powerful protest on the partof the Georgian nobility.Georgian-Tatar Relations.     It is now possible to give the decisions reached by theCongress of representatives of West Georgian Mohainmadans held atAkhalzykh for the purpose of establishing complete unity withGeorgian Christians.  They are as follows:-     (1) The establishment in the Western part of Georgia of      Georgianmodern/schools.     (2) The complete elimination of all Turkish influence, as&quot;although we have the Moh^umuadan religion in common with theTurks we are Georgians by race and therefore cannot recogniseTurkish influence&quot;.     The Congress further referred to the &quot;following establishedfacts:  that the Albanians, Egyptians, Arabs, Syrians and Persians,although having a religion in common with the Turks, have separatedthemselves from Turkish political influence\  therefore allattempts of the Turkish leaders to establish a Pan-Islam movementin order religiously to control all Moslems will be frustrated&quot;.Georgian-Tatar-Armenian-Relations.     There is still evidence of considerable feeling against theArmenian national claims in the form of protests from the localinhabitants of the threatened districts.  It may be recollectedthat in the programme drawn up by Dashnaktsutiun claims weremade for (1) the whole of the Erivan Government;  (2) the South-Western part of the Government of Elizabetpol (the Tatars absolutelyrefuse to consent to such claims and are even threatening to eject
the minority inhabiting the above-mentioned parts);  (3) thedistrict of Akhalkhlaki and half of the district of Borchalo (theGeorgians entirely refuse to consent to these claims to theirhistorical territory dsn which, they state, they have a majority of65$, and declare that they will-resist any unjustified attempts ofthis kind with armed force).Anglo-Russian Commission in Petrograd.     The following extract is from the Georgian newspaperSakhartvelo under date November 13:          &quot;The above-mentioned Commission,  besides maintaining a     general propaganda in Russia,  is also  interested in the     Caucasus.  Wtf welcome the activities of the Commission so     far as they are concerned in telling us what Great Britain     is doing in this war, but unfortunately so far as the English     press Is concerned they do not show much interest or knowledge     in the affairs of the Caucasus,  and it will therefore be     desirable that the Anglo-Russian Commission should influence     the British press in that direction.   Needless to say the     German press and leading public  opinion takes an Intense     interest in the Caucasus and is  publishing many works&quot;.9.2.18.
