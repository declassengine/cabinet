IvEMOHAllBUM BY &apos;2K1 S^OHBTA^Y 0? STATE gOg     One of the most urgent demands in connection with  the mobilisation of the Greek Army is for the supply of 10 locomotives an-6 300  railway wagons to increase the capacity of the Piraeus-Plati railway in  Old Greece.   This demand, on which no action was at first  taken owing to the situation in Italy, has now become urgent, and unless immediate steps are taken there /ill be danger of this railway being unequal tp the demands of the Greek Army in addition, to the British and.  French services via Bralo and a  minimum of civil traffic Z.   At a meeting of the Allied Transportation Committee in P;;ris on 17th December 1917 it was agreed between the British and French representatives that the Piraeus-Plati Railway and the  3 Railways running out  of Salonika must be treated as a whole and  that joint action should be ta^en through their respective Governments to get ths  Piraeus-Platl line brought under the control of the Allied Railway Commission at Salonika,  and the Foreign Office have been requested to take the  necessary action.   Independently of this,  it was agreed to arrange that any assistance to be given to the Greek Railways by the  Allies should be rendered through the Allied Railway Commission at Salonika.    The result would be that the above requirement in locomotives  and wag-one would be merged into the demands received, from the  British  and French Commanders-in-Chief; and any locomotives and wagons sent  out by either British or French Governments would be at the  disposal  of the  Allied Railway Commission at Selonika. 3.   The  300  wagons  for  the Greek Hallways added to 500 already on order for the  British Director of Railways at Salonika make a total immediate requirement for the  present  Salonika Front and for the mobilization   of the  Greek Army of 800 wagons../  It was  agreed that these wagons  could  be supplied by Great Britain subject to the pro- vision of necessary shipping. 4.   The  question of  supply of wagons  is primarily one of shipping.- Under present  arrangements by all sea  routes we can only send them out  at  the rate of,  at most,  30 to 40  per month,which  rill be quite inadequate to  meet the requirements of the Salonika Forces, apart from the  Greek mobilization.    In order to  expedite delivery it is proposed they should be  sent  overland via Taranto  and shipped from there to Piraeus through the  Corinth Canal.&apos; 5.   It may be  suggested that  this  question should  be  treated as awhole  along with  other shipping requirements in connection with the Greek mobilization,  but  as  all the  wagons are  to be  sent to the Director  of Railways  Salonika,  and  the  first 500 are to  meet his indents, it is submitted that  this  particular shipping should  be  dealt withseparately, as  the present prospective  shortage of wagons on the  SalonikaFront is  believed to  be  serious,  and it is important to  hasten delivery of the  wagons  at  the  earliest  possible  date.     It is therefore  requested that a  very early decision may be givenfor  the provision of  vessels  .71th  a carrying  capacity  of 100 wagons tofork  between Taranto  and  Piraeus.    In  this&quot;way it  is  estimated that about-200 wagons  a month could  be  sent  cut  by the shortest and  safestsea  route.    Some of  the  500 wagons for  the  Director  of  Hallways arenew  ready for shipment,  and if the  service  wore  commenced in February, tj]s whole could probably be delivered, by  the  end  of  July.     If this  is  agreed to,  it  is  also proposed to  send 10  smalllocomotives from  Prance.
