(Tiiis n^rnmfintjsjt^ Property ofp CABJVc^    -TTInniP M^iftstv^ Government)LMPAMDUM FOR THE WAR CABINET.PRISONER OF WAR LABOUR AND FOOD.r-*itiirriiminm&quot;            There is a branch of the food problem which  calls for immediate settlement by the Cabinet.  We have  German Soldier and Alien Civilian Prisoners working on  the land, the former are fed by the War Office whose  excellent arrangements secure for them full and satis-  factory rations:  the latter have to be fed by their  employers, and it is impossible to get supplies for  thenu  The local working men where these two .cla,sses of  foreign labour are employed are naturally and properly  indignant when they see that those who have fought  against us are so well cared for while.they themselves  find it difficult to obtain the necessaries of life..  There is a very strong feeling that the rule should be  for all to share equally in&apos;the supplies of food.             The civilian aliens are quiet,  well conducted  men and good workers,  and the Home Office do everything  in&apos;.their power to facilitate their employment,  I am  employing some of them and I&apos; could feed them and my own  neighbours if it were  not for the regulations of the  Food Department.  I am doing what seems to me to be  right, and I have no doubt I shall be prosecuted by one  of my colleagues in the Government   of this I must  take my chance;   but I urge that immediate steps should  be taken to  release us from regulations  which only tend  to hamper the food supplies,  and that all  foreigners  employed as  labourers  etc. should be placed on the  same footing as  our own wage earning classes.                                        V.H.L.GOLONISL OFFICE.                    :  5th February,191G.
