WAR CABINET.                   MEMOPJUCTH FOR THE WAR CABINET,                            FOOD CONTROL.             I share the general anxiety in regard to the food     situation, not so much &quot;because I am apprehensive about supplies,     but because I am very doubtful as to the wisdom of the present     methods. &quot; I aa informed by very reliable people that there has     been an actual increase in the size and number of the food queues     during the last fortnight.   The supplies of meat, especially     beef and rabbits, and of butter, have decreased, while on the     other hand I learn that the supplies of tea, sugar, etc. have     been greatly improved..   Now this seems to me to point to the     conclusion that some mistakes have been made for which nobody     can fairly be blamed.   The task of feeding a great population     which has been accustomed to Unlimited supplies of cheap food,     is, in these times, one of supreme difficulty, and no reasonable     person ought to wonder that it has not been possible up to the     present, to meet the immense demand of the British public.   It     is of course impossible to prove to demonstration that certain     causes have led to these results, but if this be true, it is at     least equally true that it is impossible to prove that it is not     a case of cause and effect.   I venture to suggest that if a     somewhat different plan were adopted, great relief would at     once be afforded.             I am satisfied that there is plenty of room for increased     local effort, but if people try to increase the supply of poultry     they cannot buy spoilt corn locally available till it has been     inspected:  if attempts are made to increase supplies of milk,     butter, meat, they are met with serious obstacles in the form     of regulations which prevent slaughter-till there has been     inspection, grading etc*SjJ3 R E T.G.T * - 3509.
        It seems to me that there has been an unfortunate con-fusion between supplies and prices.   If the latter are cutdown in times when production is very costly, it is more thanprobable that the result will be to reduce the supply;especially if at the same time the purchasing power of the greatmasses of the people is increased.   I think it is also essentialthat some of these existing regulations should be withdrawn;one of the most recent to which I have referred above and whichprevents the producer of food from dealing with it to the bestadvantage, is certain to interfere with production.   Thegreater freedom that can be given to markets and individualproducers within certain limits, the greater the prospect ofincreasing supplies, the real object to be kept in view,        I am prepared to make a series of suggestions if it isdesired that I should do so.   If the present system is to becontinued I think we shall have greater shortage and profounddiscontent:  the latter arises not merely from the scarcity orthe price of food but still more from the oonviction widelyheld that many of the difficulties could be avoided if therewere more real devolution and if there were fowerregulations.
