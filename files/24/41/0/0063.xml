Handed in:-11.10 p.m,  4/2/10.                             Received:-   5.50 p.m.  6/2/lG . Rostoff No. 26   4th February.      I  have returned from Novochercask where the political agitation  among  the Cossacks had  on January 28th been partly  allayed by  consenting to an immediate general election for the Krug  or  Cossack Assembly.  There will be a  meeting  of the Assembly  on  February 17th  to  confirm Kaledin or elect another new executive.   The military  outlook had  during my visit undergone  no material  change though the  fighting  by small bodies  had become  more strenuous  to the northwards.  From the outset  considerable success  had in these and previous skirmishes attended the  efforts of an energetic Cossack named  Tchernetsov. Most  unfortunately he has just been; surrounded  and  captured and the military  situation of Novochercask is now  considered very grave.      Skirmishing recently on the west, that is  to  the north of Taganrog, has not.been unfavourable to the League but nevertheless o  rising of local  Bolshevicks  with the help of  the  German and Austrian prisoners led to that town falling into their  power on January 31st.    On the day following at Rostoff on  various pretexts, some of  which were--jus tif led, and some not, a 3 day railway strike which subsequently spread to the tramways and lighting stations  was declared as a protest.  These  obstacles however seemed to  bring out  a  more enterprising spirit  amongst officers and  others here and Ros toff with very It t tie bloodshed has so  far been kept quiet.      The Volunteer Corps in  still being enrolled but to date only 3,000 odd have enlisted and  a  popular resentment has arisen  agai:-.st                                                        Kaledin
                            Page 2.Kaledin for permitting the League to operate within histerritory.   This resentment is at the back of the politicalagitation in Novochercask and also cf the labour unrestinvRos toff.     The Bolshevicks are the only party which acts in aconsistently energetic manner.  In these regions luckily theyhave commanded no large force of determined followers...Otherwise they would have destroyed their opponents here long ago.It is difficult in foot to unde rs tand how importance ever cameto be attached to the Kaledin and similar movements in themselves,and it is only the small numbers and scant organization of theirenemy in the field that has enabled them to live.     I had  sent Pearce to work his way round towards Kieffthrough Kursk but he was obliged to return when only a shortdistance out.  Tamplin is now cut off in Taganrog and anothermessenger who was sent to Tiflis has not returned either.Consequently we are without any reliable news of what is happeningoutside our quite immediate surroundings, nor are we receivingany news by telegraph.  This is unfortunate as the chances of anysuccess being attainable here depend solely on the trend of eventselsewhere.    Please wire me all ? genuine items of war news cMeanwhile the situation is undoubtedly critical and the Leaguestaff is debating whether nx&amp;Kg they will not be compelled toabandon the attempt to retake Taganrog owing to the danger toSovochercask.
