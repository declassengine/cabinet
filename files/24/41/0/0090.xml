Copy of letter No.0631/18  dated 7th February 1918,      TForn&apos;Secretary,  Admiralty to  Secretary,War Cabinet.               (previous Paper G.T.  3532)Sir,    The attention of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty hasbeen called to a letter addressed to the Prime Minister by Mr.Allan M.Smith, Chairman of the Management Committee of the Engin-eering Employers&apos; Federation dated 2nd February 1918,  and circulatedas War Cabinet.document G.T, 3532.    In reference to that letter Their Lordships desired to saythat they are not aware of any conflict whatever between theAdmiralty and the Ministry of Munitions in regard to labourquestions, such as the writer states exists, but,   on the otherhand, are able to point to a very  full and affective machineryproviding for consultation and conjoint action between the twoDepartments,    The Shipyard Labour Department  of the Admiralty is representedat meetings between the Minister of Munitions  and the Minister1aAdvisory Committee of Employers and Trade Unions,  and the LabourDepartment of the Ministry of Munitions is similarly representedat meetings of the Admiralty Advisory Committees of Employers andTrade Unions.   The Staff of the Shipyard Labour Department inprovincial centres is housed in the same building and workstogether with the local labour staff of the Ministry of kunitions.In addition a joint Committee of the two Departments exists forpurposes of arranging for conjoint  action in common labour questionsTheir Lordshipe are,as a result,  able to regard with very consider-able satisfaction the close co-operation which takes place betweenthe two Departments.    As against this, the writer of  the letter  has referred to twoincidents, but,  from the remarks he has made in relation thereto,Their Lordships gather he is not in possession of the facts.    In regard to the first incident to which he alludes,  the factsare these; After the conclusion of  the last New Year holidays onthe Clyde a very large number of shipyard piece workers abstainedfrom returning to work in order to  enforce payment to them ofthe 12%% bonus previously authorised by the Government to be paidto time-workers.  The Ministry of  Labour undertook with the OfficialTrade Unions&apos; representatives of the trades concerned that,  ifthe men returned to work,  facilities would be given them to putup to arbitration by the Committee  on Production their claim forpayment of the 12-fe .  On that undertaking the  men in great partreturned to work, but,  before this  arbitration took place,  theGovernment intimated their intention of conceding a bonus of 7i to (amongst others) all piece-paid shipyard workers.  TheirLordships immediately put themselves in touch  with the Ministeroi Labour wto is the op-trdinating authority in all wages mattersand raised tne question of issuing a request to Admiralty firms topay the 1\% benus,  The Minister sf Labour,  however,  txpresslvrequested Their Lordships,  in view of the arbitration then pending,
                       -2-and of the necessity of keeping faith with the men,  not to sendout any  3uch instruction so that the shipyard piece-workers mixnot be deprived of the right which had been conceded to them ofarguing their claim to 12?-% before the Committee on Production.The arbitration has now been held, and an award of Iffr has beengiven in terms of the War Cabinet decision,  and as the positionnow clear,  Their Lordships have issued  to Admiralty firms therequest to pay the    In regard to paragraph 2 of the letter.  Their Lordships obsethat the writer again a-ppeareto labour under a misapprehension.On the 9th Se:./bmber 1916 an Order was made by the Home Secretaryunder the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901,  prescribing generallyfor all kunition3 factories the hours of work and overtime andnight-shift conditions for female and bey labour.   iiixperienceof the working of this general Order soon demonstrated that, owito the special industrial conditions which prevail in shipyardsand marine engineering works,  modifications of the Order were,iitheir case, necessary; accordingly,  on the 22nd August 1917, tbHome Secretary.&quot;after consultation with the Employers and TradeUnions interested, made a special Order dealing exclusively witlshipyards and marine engineering works, and placing such yards a:works in a different position  from all other munitions factorieso far as female and boy labour was concerned.    Recently, proposals have been made by the Ministry of Hunitiin the direction of promulgating a new general Ordsr applying toall Munitions factories,  restricting&apos;hours,  overtime and night-shift of female and boy labour.  Their Lordships have expressedno views against these proposals, and are in full sympathy withall reasonable and practicable suggestions for improving conditiof employment,  but have intimated to the Ministry of Munitions tbefore any alteration of the present conditions in shipyards andmarine engine works is made;  it is, in their opinion,  necessary,in order to avoid any interference with the vital question ofshipbuilding output.  and, in view of the special conditionsalready found in practice vnd recognised to exist in shipbuildinand marine engine      works,  that the proposals should be sub-mltted for careful consideration to the Shipbuilding Employers&apos;Federation and the other employers concerned,  and al3o to theShipbuilding Trade Unions who arc interested.   The Ministry ofMunitions have,  accordingly submitted to the Engineering EmployeFederation proposals applying to Munitions factories other thanshipyards and marine engine works.  Their Lordships.  pa theirpart,  intend to sennit to their employers and Shipyard, TradeUnions interested in shipbuilding and marine engineering propose,on similar lines.  The position Their Lordships have taken up isthat They should come to no decision on such far-reaching proposas to vary in shipyards and marine engineering works,  the hours,overtime and night-shift conditions of men,  women or boys employtherein,  except after the most careful consideration by andconsultation with the employers and workmen directly affected.I am   Sir,Your obedient Servant,  (Sgd)  0.
