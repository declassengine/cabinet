104f ThisDocument is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,     Department of Information,           FIW/026.ftITOKLY jREPORT  ON  ITALY.XXVI.      (Feb. 1st,  1918)      e Iteilian public  is  awaiting with  some  impatience  the  speech on War-aims  to be  delivered  in Milan by Signor Orlando  on his return from  the meeting of the Allied War  Council  in  Paris   (Feb.  7 is mentioned as the  earliest probable date)  Although newspaper criticism of recent  references to Itoly^  claims by Mr. Lloyd George, President Wilson and M. Pichon has been on the whole  restrained  and courteous in tone, the feeling of doubt and  disillusionment in the mind of the  public is  clearly strong end bitter, even-or rather especially-  in quarters usually most friendly towards the Western&apos;Powers.    The Democratic groups  in  Italian politics - which  have been re- inforced since last  summer by the very  influential body of  moderate Liberal  opinion represented  by the Corriere  della  Sera  - have from the beginning denounced the  claim, set  up  for the  first time in August 1914  by Clerical and  Giolittian  journals and blatantly cham- pioned by the ultra-jingo Nationalists,  to the mainland of  Dalmatia as unjustifiable on  ethical  grounds, unnecessary on grounds of military security and  as  rendering impossible that solidarity between Italy and 1Jugo-Slavia&apos; which they and  otherB regarded  as the one guarantee against the  realisation by the Central Empires of the &quot;Corridor&apos; scheme.   In supporting this line of oolicy  they be- lieved themselves to be bringing Italian aspirations  into harmony with the ethioo-political ideals of the Entente and of  the  Western Allies in particular,  counteracting the &quot;Sacro egoismo&apos; which threat- ened to  rob  Its.ly of the  sympathy of the Western peoples and working for the only settlement of the Balkans  which was consistent- ulike
105                          -    -with the ideals and the  material  interests  of the  Allies generally.The same groups have now definitely identified themselves with apolicy of solidarity between Italy and all  the oppressed subjectraces of Austria-Hungary,  with its corollary of dismemberment of theDual Monarchy.   Unless Signor Orlando in his  forthcoming speech can satisfy thesegroups that no  further curtailment of Italy!s claims is implied thanthat which they themselves have  demanded,  and that they have wronglyinterpreted the references recently made by Entente Ministers toAustria-gungary, results are more than likely to follow which wouldseriously imperil the permanent  solidarity of Italy with the EntentePowers.   It is on the eventual  preponderance of these groups inItalian politics that such permanent solidarity depends, and Alliedmotives for strengthening their  HAND3 must be strong,  and propor-tionate to the  value the Entente attaches to the Italian connectionand support.   If their  sympathies are alienated they may quitelikely be driven into the arms of Oiolitti,  with his ^arecchio&apos; andhos nostalgia for the Triple Alliance.   It has to be remembered that  very influential sections - probablyconstituting a  majority-of the Italian people ff have a strong biasof prejudice against this country (which they have been taught inClerical schools to regard as&apos;the robber of the world&apos;) and in favourof one or the other of the Central Empires.    The  tendencies of theClerical group  are well-known.   It is in close touch with Ciolittiand his followers,  between whom  and the Clerical party a sort ofalliance was established at  the  time of the 1913 Elections from whichthe present Chamber dates.  . Oiolitti&apos;s name is often coupled withthat of Caillaux,  and it is  more than probable that the two statesmenhave been in at least indirect communication during the war.    Some-light is thrown on the leanings  of Giolitti in foreign policy in arecent article  by Prof.Salvemini  in 1&apos;Unita,  where it  is pointed out
                                                                 106that when in December 1912 the Triple Alliance (due  to expire o fuly 8th,  19l4)  was renewed by Giolitti and his colleagues -  SanGiuliani,  De Martino, Bollati, Avarna,  Pollio, Tittoni and others -they silently dropped overboard the complimentary agreements  in re-gard to the Mediterranean and the Balkans concluded  with this countryand with France  in 1902 and the Agreement with Russia regarding theBalkans concluded in 1909, which had been taken cognisance of by theCentral Empires  and had,  as far as Italy was concerned,  rendered theTriple Alliance  a purely defensive instrument compatible with mostfriendly relations between Italj  . and the Entente.    The intentionimplicit in this ommission was, according to Prof.  Salvemini, to someextent revealed  by the Italian occupation of the Dodecanese in April1912 without any protest from her then allies.   Also in some kind ofco-operation with the Giolittian group is the Official SocialistParty, strongly  entrenched in the working-classas, which made commoncause with the Giolittians and Clericals during the  recent Sessionof Parliament in the attacks  on the men who more than any othersrepresents fidelity to the Entente Alliance and tis^fee energetiaprosecution of the war.   A fourth group - the Nationalist Party -not numerous but enjoying a certain intellectual prestige , since itdraws its leading spirits chiefly from the universities^ on which 30years of German  penetration have left their impress, is the uncom-promising enemy  of pooular Government,  has by its violent polemicswith the promoters of Slav unification done excellent service toAustria-Hungary, and would not hesitate to support any policy inwhich it saw a better chance  of promoting the aggrandisement of Italy*   The combination of all these elements, reinforced by adhesionsfrom s disappointed and discredited Democratic and Libernl group,would almost certainly entail a return of Giolitti to power.Giolitti has, it is true, disowned all desire for a  separate peace,(which under the circumstances is out of the question) but that does
                                                               107not exclude the probability of has throwing his weight on the side ofthe Central Empires in peace-negotiations and afterwards doing his&quot;best to realise the policy which he and Caillaux are believed tofavour.     In connection with the movement towards an Italo-Slav Ententemay be noticed (1) the cordial wishes expressed in journals whichsupport the movement for the success of the Rumanian mission which        -                                                 Iis to visit the Entente Capitals and the centres where emigrants  fromAustro-Hungarian lands are collected;  (8) &amp; telegram sent on Janc 17to President Wilson by the Committee of the League of &quot;IrredentistSocial-Democracy&quot; which runs as follows - &quot;The workmen refugees fromTrent, Trieste, Gorizia, Pola, Piume and Zara, cities which have  been        fromItalian/all time, assBmbled at. Milan and encouraged by your noblemessage, beg for a generous word to say that none of the six sistersities will be left to Austrian oppression by the great Americanpeople.   In the presence of a Bohemian Delegate they remind you  thatnear oppressed Italian cities, awaiting liberation,  there live Czechc,Ruthenes,  Rumanians and Slavs united in similar hopes&quot;;   (3) An Order of the Day adopted by the Executive of the ReformSocialist party urging that, as a corollary to the speeches of Mr.Lloyd George,  President Wilson and M. Pichon, a collective declara-tion should be made by the Allies, &quot;which, while following the linesof the agreements already concluded, shall graduate War-aims, givingthe first place to&quot; questions of disarmament, arbitration,  abolitionof Secret Diplomacy and the right of nationalities to self-determina-tion, and that in the formulation of this collective declarationItaly1s voice shall be raised in support of &quot;the democratic princi-ples which were recently so clearly affirmed by Labour and Democracy*in the Entente Countries and which exclude all annexations havingthe character of conquest and forcible domination&quot;;   (4)  An interview with M. Radovic in which the ex-Premier of
                                                                  108Montenegro sets forth the  arguments  in favour  of an understandingbetween all the oppressed  peoples  of Austria-Hungary.jfrral of Army and People.     In spite of the strong patriotic reaction produced by the disas-ter of October, subversive propaganda,  it appears,  is  again veryactive both in the Army -  especially among the second  line troops -and in the Country.    In the  manufacturing cities - the chief of whichare under military control and  where Food supply and distribution arenow fairly well organised  - propaganda of this sort is said to be ma-king less headway.    It is in the  smaller country towns and among thepeasant population - where food conditions are extremely trying - thatit now finds freest scope.   Use  is  made  of the professional letter-writers - whose services are  still in requisition among the illiterateContadini^- to insert in letters  to  the front  depressing and exag-gerated descriptions of the intolerable conditions at  home and hintsthat, if soldiers refused  to  fight?peace  would be brought nearer andat any rate they might save their  lives for the benefit of theirfamilies.   There is evidence that  many  French soldiers are associated with therevolutionary movement at  the front;   while among the  extreme-Social^ists menacing developments are  taking place as a reply to the in-creased activity and bstter organisation  of the War-party,    &apos;RedLegions&apos; on the Bolshevik  model are  being enrolled both from urbanand agrarian classes - which  are intended to act spparately in safe-guarding the economic interests of the  two classes but to unite fornational and international political  purposes.   Internal conditions cannot therefore be regarded as anything butserious.&apos;
