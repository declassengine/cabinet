Hte BritannicIntelligence Bureau,MEMORANDUMon theDepartment of Information.GERMAN  SCHEME  FOR  AN  AFRICAN  EMPIREI,   Mlttel-Afrika, the complementary scheme to Mittel-Europa.     Tho scheme of a big German Empire in Central Africa is one towhich Germany is likely to cling with great tenacity.   Today wefind it most warmly championed in those quarters whioh are opposedto the Pan-German programme of annexations in Europe.   Hans Dslbruokand Paul Rohrbach, who might perhaps be called the two principalpublicists of Germany today, are both stout opponents of Pan-Germanismand both strong advocates of the Mittel-Afika scheme.   The samemay be said of the eminent historian, Hermann Onoken.   A number ofwriters demonstrate the necessity of Mittel-Afrika for Germany inpamphlets or in the press.   The most industrious of these is EmilZimmermann, who writes frequently in the monthly review edited byDelbruck, the Preussische Jahrbucher, and who a few months agoembodied the gospel of Mittel-Afrika in a little book, &quot;Das deutscheKaiserreich Mlttel-Afrlka als Grundlage einer neuen deutschenV/eltpolitik&quot; (The German Empire of Mittel-Afrika as the basis of anew German world-policy&quot;).   The scheme of l;.&apos;ittel-Afrlka i s thus aparallel scheme to that of  the now famous Mittel-Europa scheme.Both are usually held by the same persons, especially by that largebody of people who are for  &quot;no annexations&quot; in Europe.   As thein Europe will not bo possible,  it is  likely that  the  exponents ofX A translation of this book into English is being  prepared byWellington House,XGerman Government has probably come  to  the  conclusion that annexations
of Mittel-Europa and Mittel-Afrika represent, muoh more closely  - ^Kiimri^iinTuii in nnijiiiiii umii mim Immn iTinm &apos;     a wn wmnii iru i* **J r    u . wwathan the annexation!sts  do,  the mind of tha Government.II  *The limits of MlUel^Afrlka.     The German Colonial Empire before the war, we are told by onewriter after another, suffered from the radical defect that itconsisted of detached and soattorod- territories.   The essentialthing is to seeuro a domain which is territorially continuous.This can be found only in Central Africa.   What precisely thefrontiers of German,Mlttel-Afrika are to be is still left undecided.Paul Lout we in, one if the literary- exponents of the idea - the sonof a former Governor of South-West Africa, states that carefulmemoranda have been drawn up on the subject, which must remainconfidential, and that the scheme includes a maximum and aminimum demand, to be put forward according to the issue of thewar ^Mitteleuropa^Mittelafrikay  page 51).     Certain features, however, are constant  n all varieties ofthe scheme.(1) Mittel-Afrika must include the old German East-Africa,(2) Mittel-Afrika must go right across the Continent, from theIndian Ocean to the Atlantic, and this implies(3) that Mittel-Afrika must include at least the greater part ofthe Belgian Congo.     But every form cf the scheme presented to the German publicincludes a great deal more than these essential points:(1) Mittel-ACrika will consist of the Camoroons, Gorman East-Africa,Northern half of South V/est Africa, the Belgian Congo, strips ofterritory from the British, French  and Portuguese possessionsand from British South Africa  Go as to make the whole domainterritorially continuous! (Paul Leutwein):(2) will consist of the Cameroons, German East-Africa, the BelgianCongo, British East-Africa, Uganda, French Equatorial Africa, large
parts of Angola (Emil Zlmmermann):(3) will include the Belgian and the French Congo, Nigeria, Lagos,Uganda, Zanzibar, Madeira,  the Azores,the Cape Verde islands,(Delbruck):(4) will include the main part of the Belgian Congo, and of thePortuguese colonies, and the French West-African districts (Onoken):(5) &quot;An appropriation as extensive as possible of French, EnglishBelgian and Portuguese possessions in Central Africa&quot; (dskar Karstedt).     It will be observed that German South-West Africa is generally-abandoned;  even Paul Loutwein only asks for the Northern half of it.III. Why Germany needs Mittel-AfrikaMittel-Afrlka is said to be essential to Germany(1) as a field of supply for tropical raw-materials;(2) as a basis for German power on the globe:(3) as a field for the settlement of a certain number of Germans.IV.  (1) Mittel-Afrika as a field of supply for raw-materials     It is represented as essential that Germany should be ableto get the raw materials for her industries from her own dominions.Hitherto Great Britain has afforded Germany the Open Door in itstropical possessions, an^.Germany has grown rich in virtue of it.But so long as Germany is dependent upon Great Britain !s goodwillGermany is at Great Britainfs mercy, because Great Britain can shutthe door, whenever it chooses, and reduce Germany to economic ruin.A great deal is talked of the&quot;world-syndicate&quot;formed againstGermany.   The only way Germany can secure itself against thisperil is by having a sufficiently large empire of its own in thetropics, so that it may be absolutely independent of any economicboycott.V.  (2) Mittel-Ajerikaas a &quot;basis fcr world-power.(a) Its^str giigth- for do fore     Mittol-Afr5.ka., it is claimed, viould be practically  unassail-able^   It is pointed out that in the case of tropical territory,
where an invader is confronted with groat natural obstacles, sizeincreases defensibility. (Karstedt).   Even the Cameroons andGerman East-Africa were only conquered in this war with extremedifficulty, although they were poorly prepared for defenoe.   AnAfrican Eimpire inoluding the whole Central part of the Continentfrom sea to sea, furnished with munitions, with its important pointsall linked up by railways and telegraphs, and its black man-powertrained and organized for fighting, could therefore securely defyany attack.   Against the Pan-Germans, who say that,unless theGermans acquire sea-pcv/er, their colonies in any future war willagain fall a prey to England, it is argued that such an Afrloanrealm could maintain itself by its own resources, even if out offfrom all communications with Germany, for an indefinite period.(b)&apos;&apos;jjhe militarization of the native&quot;     One here comes upon the question of the &quot;militarization of theAfrican native&quot;.  &quot;All the writers on Mittel-Afrika mentioned abovetake It for granted that Germany will form a large black army in itsempire.   Zimmermann even anticipates that 50 years hence, when theEmpire contains a population of 50 million blacks and 500, 000Germans it will be possible at any moment to mobilize an army of amillion men.   On the other hand the only official exponent of theviews of the German Government, Dr Self, in his address to theGerman Colonial Society on December 21 last, strongly disclaimedany desire to see the African native militarized:    &quot;There can be no question that the possibility of falling back  upon vast reserves of black man-power for the armies of the future  will constitute a new and menacing danger for the peaoe of Europe.  The European Powers have therefore a common interest in obviating a  new peril which has suddenly risen above the horizon.   The peril  is recognized by our enemies as well as by ourselves.     And here Dr Solf takes occasion to tax the enemy with distortingfacts by attributing to the Germans the design of creating big black
armies in Africa.   He especially censures Sir Harry Johnston forsome statements of his which appeared in the Manchester Guardianof July 4 1917 c   Sir Harry had Btated that German Ministers inoffice had &quot;indirectly &quot;but plainly enough&quot; indicated that theycherished those plans.   Dr Solf replies:     &quot;I am the only German Minister in office who has spoken about  the militarization of Africa - in Leipzig reoently - and what I  said was-exactly the opposite, namely, that we do not desire the  militarization of the &quot;black races of Africa.1   The best way of  preventing such militarization is to agree to the new partitioning  of the Continent which we ask for.   If an equipoise ef power all  round is substituted for tho unequal distribution which  .has  prevailed hitherto, it ceases to be possible for any one colonial  Power to transport black forces to Europe without exposing thecolony to the danger of an attack by the equally strong neighbour  Power.   But the interest which any Power may have in organizing  native armies will be very much diminished, when there can be no  longer any question of employing them in Europe or anywhere outside  the country.   Since however eur attitude to the whole question  is one of principle, we shall be ready to go farther and promote  any limitation by agreement of armaments in Africa.     Dr Solf U argument seems curiously sophistical.   If, by thenew partition of Africa, Germany gets so large a territory that itcan seriously menace the neighbouring Afrioan Powers, then none ofthem will dare to send black troops to Europe, for fear of boingattacked at home by the German African Empire.   If that is sothey will lose interest in forming black armies and we shall havepeaoe by mutual feari1   One would have thought that the resultwould have been rather a continued state of painful tension.There is however no reason to doubt that when Dr Solf proposes alimitation of armaments by agreement in Africa, he is sincere.The only question is whether such an agreement, valid as it might befor peaoe time, would give security to the other African Powers ina long war, if there were opposed to them a German African Empirewith a large native population, from whioh within a certain numberof months armies could always be fashioned.
(o) Influence of Mlttel-Afrika Eastwards.     As a basis for operations in the world at large,  Mlttel-Afrikawould be valuable to the Germans because its ooasts would givethem naval bases which could be fortified and equipped.    This isa point upon whioh all writers insist.   They all talk aboutharbours, coaling-stations,  munition-depots, repairing-docks.    &quot;Think for a moment how far more deadly C in this war j the  work of German cruisers might have been, if Dar-es-ealaam on the  Indian Ocean or Mderitz Bay and Duala on the Atlantic had been  fully fitted out naval bases, in whioh our ships would have had  facilities for getting in fresh supplies or effeoting repairs.1  ( arstedt).     Oncken and Delbruck specially point out how useful such harbourswould be in connection with the operations of the German U-boats,&quot;A certain number of U-boats stationed there would defend the islandsZanzibar t Madeira ? I  and their harbours against English men-of-war&apos;&apos;(Delbruok)     Zimmermann gives the fullest exposition of tho possibilitiesof Mittol-Afrlka for sea-power.   It would oommand the vital linesof communication of the British Empire.    He demonstrates theimportance to Australia of having a safe road for her exports toEurope.   The route by the Red Sea could be absolutely cut fromGerman naval bases in  East Africa.   Even the route round theGape, he contends, would not be safe.     &quot;The policy therefore both of Australia and of India might be  very strongly influenced by pressure from German Mlttel-Afrika -  and British policy too, since England has as strong an Interest  in unimpeded commercial intercourse  with India and Australia as  India and Australia have in unimpeded intercourse with England.  If we have a position of strength In Mlttel-Afrlka with whioh  India and Australia must reckon then we can compel both of them  to respect our wishes in the South Seas and in Eastern Asia, and  we thereby drive the first wedge into the compact front of our  opponents in Eastern Asia... From Mittel-Afrika we oommand the  British connections with South Africa, with India and with  Australia, and compel British policy to take account of us;:.
(d) Its influence Northwards.     By its operation Eastwards then, ^lttel-Afrika would exertan irresistible pressure upon the British Empire.   To the Northof it would be vast regions, between itself and the Mediterraneanpopulated by Mohammedan &quot;Arabs1&apos;.   These regions are now dividedas spheres of influence between France and Italy, but in theMittel-Afrika scheme, as outlined above, they are apparently thoughtof as occupied by independent Mohammedan states.   A great point ismade of the natural alliance between German Central Afriea and NorthAfrican Mohammedanism.   The countries of Northern Africa would riseto new propsperljty and opulence; and since they would belong to thegroup of States friendly to Germany, whilst Mittel-Buropa would haveits harbours on the Northern shores of the Mediterranean, theMediterranean would cease to belong to the Western Powers.   It wouldform the sea-conneotion between Mlttel-Europa and Mittel-Afrika.The direct route from Berlin to Lake Chad would go across theMediterranean to a port in Tripoli;  the direct route from Berlinto Lake Tanganyika through Vienna, Hagusa, and Benghazi(Preusslsohe Jahrbucher 1917)(e) Mlttel-Afrlka and Turkey     Mittel-Afrika would make the connection between Germany and theTurkish Empire secure.   This connection, is of course, part oJ. theMittel-Europa plan, and the line is to maintain that Germany^connection with Turkey would be ver^ valuable, it combined withMittel-Afrika, but would be too preoarious to be worth much i Germany failed to create Mittel-Afrika.   Immediate territorialcontact between Turkey and German Africa does not seem to becontemplated, since it is inevitable that the British should be leftin possession of the Suez Canal and the Red Sea (India should beleft to the British, so that the Russians and Japanese may be keptout of it).
                             at 3 *&quot;But if the British are established in the North-Bast oomer ofAfrica, they can always attack Turkey in Syria, unless they navea strong German Mittel-Afrika  en the other side of them.German Central Africa would thus afford the&quot;flank-protection&quot; toTurkey without which Turkey could not develop securely underGerman influenoe.   Between Turkey and German Mittel-Afrika theBritish in Egypt would be impotent for offence.(f) influence of Mittel-Afrika Westwards:   South America.     We have seen the operation of Mittel-Afrika Eastwards andNorthwards.   Westwards its power would radiate across thoAtlantic and gain South America for the German alliance.   Upon thisconsideration Zimmermann enlarges with great earnestness.   ThoGermans, he says, must wrest South and Central America from theUnited States&apos; sphere of influence and attach it to their own.The raw materials which Mlttel-Europa and Mittel-Afrika togethercould not supply to Germany, or could not supply in sufficientquantity, Germany could procure from Latin America.  Then Germanywould depend upon the Anglo-Saxons&quot; for nothing.   &apos;-e get therefore,as the conclusion of the whole plan, a group of friendly or alliedcountries standing together in complete self-sufficiency againstthe Anglo-Saxons and the V/estern European countries.  The group isconstituted by the countries of Mittel-Europa, the Turkish Empire,Gorman Mittel-Afrika, the North African Mthammedan St ate 3, andSouth and Central America.VI   (3) Mittel-Afrika as a field for German settlement.     It is recognized generally in Germany that Germany has nosurplus population for agricultural colonization.   It is also stilla doubtful question how far a white population could thrive in anypart of Mittel-Afrika.   In any case, there fore tho Germans
resident in the oountry could not form more than a small minorityamong the millions of natives.   But there are two classes of Germansfor whom it is urged that Mittel-Afrika might provide a home.(1) The numbers of educated men, for whom there is no adequateemployment in Germany.   &quot;These are the men whom we must send out,as technical experts, merchants, planters, doctors, inspectors,officers and civil servants to rule over the great masses of thelower races, just as the English rule over India&quot;.. .&quot;What we mustdemand is a German India&quot;  (Dclbruck):(2) Numbers of the Germans who are already abroad in the UnitedStates and the British Colonies.   These arc .      representedas now being savagely persecuted by the Anglo-Saxons, British and  .American, and Germany must therefore immediately after the warinstitute a great campaign for inducing oversea Germans to migratein masses either to Mittol-Afrika or to Latin America.Vil.   &quot;Internationalization1&apos;     With regard to the proposal for internationalizing tropicalAfrica, Zimmermann writes:  &quot;Sir Harry Johnston and his set must not expect that in Germany  one single person in his senses will entertain such a notion.  As for the permission to work alongside of others in Central  Africa - no thank you - As things now are, neither an internation-  alization of all colonial territories nor the famous &quot;freedom of the  seas&quot; are likely to help us much&quot;.Dr Solf expresses himself with more authority and dignity aB follows:  &quot;The idea et a complete internationalization of the tropical regions  with a joint administration by the European proteoting stages is  propagated by certain philanthropic circles in England.  The most  emphatio opponents of such an internationalization are likely to  arise in England itself.   But, quite apart from that, an organ-  ization of this kind would be feasible, only if it were supported  by a feeling of solidarity in the European States.   Such a feeling  of solidarity will no doubt arise in the form of an aspiration  out of the ruins of this war, indeed b* established as a fundamental  demand of the new spirit in international contacts $  but before  one can lay such a stupendous task, as that of ruling overseas  territories in harmonious co-operation,, upon the belligerents of  to-day - one mi^ht say, upon the whole of Europe, as it Is today -
the International consciousness will have to havo boon developed  and confirmed in Europe by the aotual praotice of international  dealings.  We must therefore hold fast to the principle which has hitherto  prevailed in colonization - a partition of tho tropical countries  amongst the civilized Europoan States.   In the treaty of peace  there can only be the question of a fresh partition.&quot;VIII.   The Mittel-Afrika Idea supported by Kuhlmann t     The Mlttel-Afrika plan as now put forward by well known writersas above quoted aoquires additional significance when Oonsidered inconnection with a book whioh appeared anonymously in 1913  &quot;Welt-poll tik und Kein Krieg&quot;.   For this book Is generally reported tohave emanated from the German Embassy in London and is even attributedby many people in Germany to Kuhlmann himself.   If this is so, itproves a very close community of views between the present GermanSocretary for Foreign Affairs and tho champions of Mittel-Afrika.Like them the anonymous work was definitely opposed to the Pan-Germans.Like thenij it put forward, as the true policy for Germany, the acquis-ition of a predominant position In Central Africa.  It laid stress,in torms very parallel to Delbruok1 s, upon the necessity for a fieldof activity overseas for   members of the Gorman educated class, asmerchants, engineers, etc:  Germany did not need colonies foragricultural settlement , btlt colonies as fields for economic supply.The anonymous author again depreciated the potentialities of theTurkish Empire, Just as Emil Zimmcrmann does now.   It was notjlossible In 1913 for someone whose programme purported to be&apos; a oveall else pacific, to suggest that Germany shmild take away theBelgian Congo and the Portuguese colonies fron their actual possessors,but the author urged that Germany should penetrate tho oolonieseconomically, on an understanding with the Belgians and Portuguese,till the countries became de facto German.  One may notice thatalready at that date Emil Zimmermann is the writer cited by thoauthor in support of a policy of close association between Germanyand Belgi\5h in Africa.
- n -IX,  Qcrmany would not be satisfied by a return cf Its former ooloniog*     Dr Solf states very plainly that the mere return to Germany ofthe colonies it possessed in Africa before the war would by no meanscontent it.    So far from that it would be continually tantalizedby being allowed to come so far towards the  realization of thegreat Mittel-Afrika idea and arrested just short of fruition.  nThe existing partition of Africa amongst  European colonizing  State8,lacks any inherent justifications    We see States in  possession of gigantic areas, eighty times the size of the  mother-country,  which they are incapable of developing...  Belgium,  Prance  and Portugal.   On the other hand we Germans  see ourselves confined to territories whioh are considerably  smaller and whioh are far-scattered.    He  who desires a durable  peace, a peace of just contentment,  carrot wish the present  partition of territory in Africa to be maintained,  sinoe it in  no wise corresponds either with the colonising capabilities or  with the relative strength of the nations  oonoarned,&quot;It would seem that the future peace of Africa demands oithor somegratification of the Germansf desire for a larger empire,connecting their old possessions,  or the exclusion of Germanyfrom Africa as a ruling Power altogether]  or else, as has beensuggested - as a third alternative,  the holding in trust ofcertain territories for Germany until she has proved herselfcapable of governing them.
