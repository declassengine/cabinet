This  document is the property of His Britannic  Majesty&apos;s GovernmentSECRET.C.P.  3681.                                THE CABINET.INTERIM  REPORT OF  THE  COMMITTEE  ON  NATIONAL                             EXPENDITURE.Alternative to a Ministry  of Defence.PROPOSAL  TO  TRANSFER  THE MILITARY  FUNCTIONS  OF  THE  AIR                     MINISTRY TO THE WAR  OFFICE.     MEMORANDUM  BY  THE SECRETARY OF  STATE  FOR  WAR.    The Geddes Committee drew attention to the serious overlapping and duplication .in the  services of the  Navy, the Army and the Air Force.   This  duplication  they propose to eliminate by the creation of a Ministry of Defence.    I agree that duplication must be reduced to its narrowest possible limits, but forthe moment I set aside the proposed creation of a Ministry of Defence as a method of achieving this  end.  There is, however, another method by which we could achieve all or nearly all that the Geddes Committee have in mind.    I do not think that the Cabinet realize the great loss of  efficiency that is due to-the duplication of services by the Air Ministry so far as the Air Force is required forco-operation with the Array for defence and offence on and over land.    The war proved in principle  not only that co-operation between the two serviceswas vital, but  that,  in order to  render effective action, the air units without exceptionhave to be under  the  military  Commander-in-Chief.  The so-called Independent AirForce  at Nancy  was not independent ;  it  was under the control of Marshal Foch.Marshal Focli has himself given  his opinion with  regard to the separation of the air and Military Service as follows :          &quot; The principle of the absolute independence of the Air Service is inadmissible.    Similarly  to the other arms  acting in the same theatre of  operations, the Air    Service was placed under the orders of  the  General Officer Commanding-in-Chief.    It is in the choice of the method  of execution that  the  Air Service preserves its    complete independence. ...  In  short, it  is  the  essential principle of unity of    command without which there can be no concentration of effort. . .  . ,   -     &quot; Consequently,  the Marshal is  positively opposed to  the idea  of an Air    Service with complete independence of operations &quot; (C.I.D. 139c).    Sir Douglas Haig was of a similar opinion when the proposal of forming a separateAir Ministry was before the Cabinet in 1917.  By perpetuating a separate Air Ministry,we are acting against the practical experience of  the necessity for unity of  command and directly against the  advice of those  to whom was entrusted  the  conduct of thelate v/ar.    If it were cheaper to keep the Air Force  independent, financial stringency mightjustify  the risks which it involves, but it is not;  we are actually spending millions on increasing our inefficiency and risks we run.    The Air  Ministry has,  or contemplates having, its own Cadet  College,  Staff&apos;College, Electric and Wireless Schools, and Physical Training School.   These schools aresimply  duplicating the  work of  Sandhurst, Woolwich, Camberley, Maresfield andAldershot.   The duplication does not end here.   The creation of a separate force might conceivably justify the maintenance of separate Training Schools, but administration isthe same whether for the Air Force or the Army, yet we find in the Air Force not only eparate combatant units, but separate administrative departments.

    The inevitable result of the development of the departments will be a demand  for separate bases and lines of communication in war, involving  dangerous confusion inthe field.     Of the administrative services the following are the most important:          Intelligence,   Recruiting,  Discipline,  Medical  Services,  Transport,  Supply,     Contracts, Chaplains.     The Air  Ministry Estimates  are cast  in such a way as  to  make it  impossibleto say  clearly  what  these services cost,  but  it  must  amount  to  some millions;I  have  had  a preliminary survey  made,  and  estimate  that were  these  servicestransferred to  the  War  Office,   an  immediate   saving  of   vaA^  would   accrue,while further  savings in future years would be  made.  For  example, the present AirMinistry building scheme involves  large capital  outlay in the next few years, of which some 700,00OZ. could be saved by transferring the administration of the Air Force to theWar Office.   It is noteworthy  that the Air Ministry itself contains 1,411 souls costingsome 500,0007., apart from the  money devoted to civil aviation and research.   1 estimate that  the  work  done by  this Ministry could be  spread over the  War Office  and theAdmiralty at  a cost to the former of  150,OOOZ. and the latter of 20,000/., thus saving330,OO0Z. a year;  this saving takes no account of the saving on rates and maintenanceof the Air Ministry buildings,  the  cost of  which is borne on Civil votes.     The extent to which this duplication.of services may lead  is  almost limitless, andmay be illustrated  by the present situation in Iraq.     The responsibility for the  administration of Iraq lies with the  Colonial  Secretary.Normally,  the responsibility for the defence would  rest with the Army, but  the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff  has  advised that certain lines of communication must hekept open  if croops are to be kept at Baghdad.   This proposal  has  been found by theColonial Secretary to be too expensive, and the Air Force has  offered to take the  riskwith smaller forces, and  therefore  the defence  of  Iraq is  to be transferred to the AirForce.  In matters of defence,  there are thus to  be  two advisers, the Chief of theImperial General Staff and the Chief of the Air Staff.     The  Chief of the  Imperial  General Staff has expressed the  opinion that theretention of Iraq is unnecessary for the safety of the Empire, and to provide adequatelyfor its  defence  would require  more troops,  if the War Office is to find them, than theColonial Office can pay for.     On the other  hand,  the Chief of the Air Staff is prepared to be responsible  for thedefence of Iraq   This responsibility compels the Air Ministry to organize and maintainland forces,   They propose to  organize and maintain units which are indistinguishablefrom units of the Army.   Among  these are armoured car companies, inland water transport  service, guards  for aerodromes,  pack  batteries  with  their  remount  andveterinary services, and a commissariat service.     We consequently have the spectacle of  the.War Office withdrawing military units from Iraq while the Air Ministry is forming military units to send out there.     This precisely illustrates  the  opinion  expressed  by. Marshal Foch that with anindependent Air Ministry there can be no  concentration of effort.     My proposal to secure  this concentration is that  the functions of military advice and administration now performed  by the Air Ministry should be transferred to the WarOffice, and in order to ensure that  the  view of the Air  Service in  all questions ofdefence is adequately  represented, I would propose that  the  Chief of the Air staff should  be a  Deputy  Chief of the Imperial General  Staff with a  seat on the ArmyCouncil.     I understand that the Navy desires a similar transfer to the Admiralty  of thatportion of the administration of the Air Force which concerns Naval Defence.     I do not  deal with the Civil side, but  it should not be impossible to find a  form oforganization which  would do all that a Government can  or  should  do to support civilaviation.     I believe not  only that this transfer would result in the saving, as far as the army is  concerned,  of  anything up to   mil-  a  vear)      that real  progress  in  militaryaviation will be greater if the friction inevitable between the older and newer services is removed by an undivided responsibility and  single control-                                                                      L. W.-E.     THE WAK OFFICE,           Mh February,  1922.
