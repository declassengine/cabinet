[This Document  is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]                Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1922.SECRET.CP. 3692.                            CABINET.REPORT OF COMMITTEE  APPOINTED TO EXAMINE  PART  I    (DEFENCE  DEPARTMENTS)  OF  THE  REPORT OF  THE    GEDDES COMMITTEE  ON NATIONAL EXPENDITURE.       I. TERMS OF REFERENCE A.ND CONSTITUTION OF COMMITTEE.    BY desire  of  the  Prime Minister the following Committee of theCabinet was established to consider the suggestions and recommendations contained in Part I of the Interim  Report  of the Committee on national expenditure, and to report thereon  to the Cabinet:       The  Right Hon. W. S. Churchill, M.P., Secretary of State  for the          Colonies (Chairntaii).      The Right Hon. Viscount Birkenhead, Lord Chancellor.      The Right Hon. E. S. Montagu, M.P., Secretary of State for India.      The Right Hon. Stanley Baldwin, M.P., President  of the Board of          Trade.                      With Sir John Chancellor as Secretari/.                  11. TASK  OF CABINET COMMITTEE.    2.  We  must  at the outset  draw attention  to  the  very late  date atwhich this Cabinet Committee has  been formed.  We are now within afew weeks of the presentation of the Estimates of 1922-23.  Had we beensitting in August, September or even October last, the reductions in menand the savings on the  curtailment  or stoppage of works of various kindscould have been made  much more  effective on the Votes, of 1922-23.Prospective Estimates which are under control in August are very largelybeyond immediate  control  in January.  The figures which we now give ofthe various reductions operative in  1922-23 will in important  respectsentail larger consequential reductions in  1923-24.  These are set out ona special table.   This is particularly important as regards the Admiralty,because  the  charge for  the two  new capital  ships,  for which  only 1,734,000 is taken in the Estimates of 1922-23,  rises to  5,600,000 in theyear 1923-24.    It  is  therefore  of the utmost importance that thereshould be contributory economies from other sources coming to hand inthat year.

                   III. SUMMARY  OF  RECOMMENDATIONS.     3.  We have carefully considered  Part 1  of the Interim Report of  theCommittee on National Expenditure.     If  our recommendations are approved the Estimates to be presented to Parliament by the Admiralty, Army Council and Air Ministry willcompare with those of 1921-22 and with the Sketch Estimates for 1922-23and  with the proposals contained  in  the Interim Report of Sir E. Geddes&apos;sCommittee as shown  in the  following tables :-Table I. Showing Savings proposed as compared with Estimates                           for 1921-22.Services. 1.	Estimates, 1921-22.

Total Estimate,  15,542,000,  less Appropriations-in-   % Revised Estimate, Civil Vote   1,000,000, not   Aid,  2,585,000, less  5,500,000 reduction -  7,457,000.included.                                     5 No reductions have yet been suggested by the                                        Geddes Committee, but a saving of  4J millions is being                                        effected by the Colonial Office.
     A  saving  of   &apos;92i-  millions as  compared  with  1921-22  will thus be   effected  on  the  estimates  for   the   Navy,   Army,  Air   Forceand  Iraq  and  Palestine  (Military),  and  a saving  of  approximately 42$ millions as  compared with the Sketch Estimates for 1922-23 forthe same services.  &quot;We would point out that in dealing with large figuressuch as these, it  will be  prudent  to allow  a  margin of about half amillion each for the Navy and Army Estimates.                     IV. WAR TERMINAL  CHARGES,     4. In  the  estimates for  the three services  for the  current yearconsiderable  sums are  included for non-recurrent  expenditure due todemobilisation  and other war terminal charges. We recommend that suchnon-recurrent expenditure, which is  of  the  nature of  a  capital charge,should  be shown under a separate head in  the annual Estimates for theservices.  It  is for consideration as a matter of general  policy whether such expenditure should not be charged to  loan funds.     We have requested the Departments to  furnish us with particulars of such war terminal  charges.        V. PRINCIPLES ON WHICH LIECOMMENDATIONS ARE  BASED.     5.  In  Jnaking our  recommendations to  the  Cabinet,   we  have endeavoured to adhere to three principles      (1.) That  the  essential   elements  of  fighting   strength  shall  be           maintained  on  such  a scale  as to ensure  that  we  shall           maintain  the national security until we  are able to achieve           victory by bringing  the full mobilised war  power  of the           Empire to bear ;     (2.) That  the peace establishments of  ancillary  services  shall  be           reduced  to a nucleus, and that  the war  establishments of           those services shall be created after a rupture; and     (3.) That adequate provision shall be made for  scientific research           and for the maintenance  of technical  staffs for the design and           manufacture of warships and war material.              VI. DEPRECIATION OF  PURCHASING POWER.     b.  We observe that in  making comparisons  between  pre-war and post-war estimates, Sir Eric  Geddes&apos;s Committee do not  appear to havetaken into consideration the diminution  in the  purchasing  power ofmoney.   A consequence of  that diminution  is that  the amount of theservices withdrawn from the  productive industries of  the country to-day by the expenditure of  a certain sum on the  fighting services is only abouta half of the amount of the services that  would have been so divertedby an equal pre-war expenditure.    For example, to produce to-day a post-war  Navy of the strength ofthe Navy of 1914, the pre-war  Estimates of  51 millions would have to beraised to  115 millions (see paragraph 25).     [7766]                                                     B 2
                VII. PROPOSED MINISTRY OF DEFENCE.    7. We share the view of the Committee that  full economy in thefighting services cannot be realised  until a  co-ordinating authority iscreated, responsible for assigning to each  service  definite responsibilities for the defence of the Empire, and for seeing that  suitable provision ismade to enable each branch to perform  the functions  assigned to it.  Itmay be that the creation  of a Ministry of Defence  will be the ultimate solution of the problem, but We do not  consider that the present time is appropriate for  the  fusion of the  administration of  the three services under one Minister.   The process of amalgamation,  if  approved, must bea gradual  one and no  action can now  be taken  which would affect theestimates for 1922-23.    8. AVe consider that in  the Committee  of Imperial  Defence thereexists a suitable  instrument  for  effecting the co-ordination  of  theactivities  of the three services.   We recommend that the Committee ofImperial Defence  should  be  in  constant session all  the year round inorder to consider and advise on matters of policy affecting the three fighting services.   We further recommend that two technical committees should be  set  up without delay:  the first  to make  detailed proposalsfor the creation of  a Joint Staff  without  addition  to the  existingfunctionaries, and for  the institution of a joint&apos; College  for Officers of medium rank in the  three services;  the second to make definite proposalsfor amalgamating  as far as possible  the  common services of the Army,Navy, and  Air Force, such as the supply, transport, education,  and themedical and chaplains&apos; departments, thereby reducing the cost of thepresent triplication.                       VI. 11. NAVY  ESTIMATES.    9. The Admiralty Estimates for  1921-22 are  83 millions.&apos;4  those for 1922-23 presented to the Geddes  Committee before the washington conference were  81 millions. In respect of these the  Geddes Committeespecified economies  aggregating   141  millions,  and  concluded  with  ageneral recommendation that a reduction of  21 millions should be effected.This, they  said, took  no account  of  any  decisions which might bereached at Washington, which they suggest  should  be additional to the 21 millions above recommended.    As the Committee gave no indication as to the method of  achieving this further  6^ million saving, we have been unable  to examine it; buti&apos;t  is  observed that they said that this took no account of any decisions which might be reached  at Washington, which  they  suggest should be additional  to the  21 millions above recommended.  We have felt that itwould be quite unprofitable to discuss the Navy Estimates on the whollyartificial basis that Washmgton  had not  occurred and that the  results of                     * Including&apos; Supplementary Estimates.
Washington were not available, for we should then have been dealing notwith the actual facts, but with a position which, more fortunate than thoGeddes Committee, it is not necessary for us to assume.    Our recommendations  to the Cabinet, therefore,  are based on  a consideration of the situation as affected by Washington;  and we do notbelieve that so large a reduction in expenditure could possibly have been recommended unless the Washington Conference had taken place.    And further if the Washington Conference had failed, it  is certainthat no reductions  approaching  the ,i&apos;21  millions  could have been effected in British  Naval Estimates.  We  should  have been  confronted with a naval situation of great and growing tension, the last effort to relieve which by conference and agreement  bad definitely failed.    10. It is hardly too much to say that the failure of the washington conference would have brought us within measurable distance of a great war in the  Pacific,  in which, though we  bad stood out  of it, our vital interests would have been deeply involved at every stage and particularly at its  close.  At the very least we should  have been  confronted with  a rapid aggressive development of naval strength by America and  Japan,and this would  have required most rigorous efforts from us  unless wewere definitely to resign  ourselves to the second  or third place  amongnaval Powers.  If this situation bad  arisen, no diminution in our navaleffort would have  been possible.  On the  contrary, it would  probably have required to become intensified, and  only minor economies of an administrative character would have been possible.  We have, therefore,taken  the  current  estimates and the sketch  estimates  submitted tothe Geddes Committee as our foundation, and on this we have  sought to ascertain  what is the minimum expense in the financial year 1922-23,for which, in  the  light  of  the  happy  outcome  of  the washington conference, the one-Power standard can be maintained.  In this task wehave availed ourselves to the full of  the valuable detailed recommenda-tions and enquiries  of the Geddes Committee.    11. From the close of the Napoleonic wars  to  the  beginning  of  thepresent century, it might be said that the British Navy was not onlythe strongest Navy in the world, but was  stronger than all the otherNavies  put together.  Towards the end of  this period we were guided bythe two-Power standard, i.e., the British Navy able to fight with reasonableprospects  of  success a combination  of the two  next  strongest naval powers.  In  1912, in face of the German menace, we adopted the 60 percent, standard over Germany alone to regulate  the new construction ofcapital ships, and the general scale of the  Fleets in being, and we alsoadhered to the  100 per cent, standard in cruisers.  In  fact, however,our strength more  nearly approached 80  per  cent, superiority in  theline  of battle.   This superiority  against  Germany  far  more  thancovered the  potential  case  of America,   and,  having  regard  to  the     [7766]                                                      B S
conditions of distance, we considered that the British pre-war Navy wasin fact at a standard equal to that of  Germany and the United  Statescombined, i.e., that it would not necessarily have been destroyed  by navalmeans even  by that combination.  Far different is the position in  whichwe  find ourselves after the great victories of the late  war.  We have abandoned all idea of naval supremacy, hitherto  the  foundation  of ourgreatness, and have  consented to a  position  of  bare  equality with theUnited States.  Such au equality in  strength is no equality in situation,for the United States is entirely self-contained and  independent of a Navy,while we  are dependent for four-fifths of our food supplies on overseamarkets.  To this melancholy result of the one-Power standard  we havebeen  reduced by force of circumstances.   We  must rely  upon preserving the good  relations  now established with the  United  States  and thecontinuance of a long peace, during which their  naval  effort will perhapswane.    12.  We think it, however, indispensable that the one-Power  standardshould be genuinely  maintained.  By this we do  not  mean  that theBritish  and  United  States Navies  should be exactly matched  in everyparticular, or that a fair allowance  should not  be made  in estimatingpersonnel for the great reserves which these Islands possess  in theirseafaring  population.  But  we consider  that,  not only  in  our own judgement but in that of  foreign   nations, the  standard at which theBritish  Navy is  maintained should not be definitely inferior to that of theUnited  States.   Any  such condition of inferiority would  undoubtedlyaffect our whole position and  influence in the world, and indicate  to ourDominions that a new centre had been created for  the Anglo-Saxon world.We have felt that the Cabinet, and indeed Parliament, would expect  usto regard the maintenance  of  the one-Power standard as an imperativecondition.     13. Apart from  the general standard of naval  strength which weshould  maintain, we have also to   consider  the  most likely  potential enemy.   We consider that the position towards Japan requires  the graveand  urgent  consideration  of  the Committee  of  Imperial  Defence.  Wehave been deeply impressed by all that Lord Beatty has  told us on thissubject.  In the Coal era the British Fleet was mobile to  an extent notapproached by  any  other  Navy in  the  world.  A widespread system ofcoaling stations enabled us  to move our main  naval  power  wherevercircumstances might require.   Reliance upon  Oil,  with all its advantages,has destroyed for the time being that mobility.   The position  of Japanduring  the  next few years  will  be formidable.   The United  States,according  to  Lord  Beatty,  can  do  nothing  against  her  across  the enormous Pacific Ocean.  Obviously we cannot hold  Hong  Kong in theevent of  a  war with Japan.   Unless Singapore is adequately  protected before  it  is attacked,  we cannot  hold Singapore.   Until oil-fuelling stations have been established there a,nd on the route to  the East at
Aden and  Colombo, we  cannot base a  fleet  capable  of  fighting japan on  Singapore.  If  Singapore  fell  in  the first two or three mouths ofa war, the whole of the Pacific would  fall under the complete supremacyof  Japan,  and  many  years  might  elapse  before  either  Britain  orthe  United  States  could re-enter   that  ocean  in   effective strength.India. Burmah, the Straits Settlements, Australia, New Zealand are allat the  present time within  the  scope  of  potential Japanese superioraction.  We  feel that it is necessary to continue the discreet building up  of  the fuelling  stations and  of   the  base  at  Singapore which alone can enable  our  fleet to  offer some  protection to all our interestsin the  Pacific, including Australia and  New  Zealand.   The admiralty have with  great  misgivings made large  reductions in  the provision for developing this  route  during&apos;  the  ensuing  years.   We  share  thesemisgivings, and are only induced  to recommend the reductions proposedto the Cabinet by the expectation that the whole position  will be  speedilyreviewed by the Committee of Imperial Defence.     14. Coming to the Fleet in being, we think there has been justifica-tion for the view  of the Geddes Committee that the shore establishments and the auxiliary services of  the  Fleet are now running on too  lavish a scale; that they  absorb too  large a  proportion of the men and money required by the Navy.  We have procured, very large reductions in thesespheres, which are fully set  out  in  the detailed Admiralty statements(see Appendix I).    The  figure for  Vote  A  presented  to  the  geddes committee was  121,000, including  Coastguard.    From  this  the Com-mittee recommended a reduction of 33,000 to a total of 88,000, presumablyirrespective  of  Washington.    We  are  convinced that  the one-Powerstandard could not be maintained on such a basis.  The latest informa-tion procurable about the United States Navy is that their comparablefigure will stand at 139,000 certainly until July.  We have no knowledge ofwhat will happen then.   The Japanese naval personnel is computed by theAdmiralty  at 82,000.   After assigning the fullest weight to.the reserves of sea-faring personnel, many of whom have been trained in the war, which wepossess in  Great  Britain, we cannot think that it would  be  safe  or  rightto  reduce  Vote A. substantially below 100,000 men, comparable  \i.e.,  in-cluding Coastguard) to the 121,000 presented to the Geddes Committee.     15. This enormous reduction  cannot be achieved in the  compass of asingle year without special retirement schemes, the cost of which  we havenot  yet been  able to ascertain. As four-fifths of the Navy comes from thethree great  naval  districts connected with Chatham, Portsmouth andDevonport, the effect of these wholesale discharges concentrated  in  these areas requires careful consideration in conjunction with the  discharges ofdockyard workmen to be presently referred to.  The exceptional  distressand congestion likely to prevail in these three great ganglion-centres ofour life as  a  State and Empire will require to  be taken into account.      [7766]                                                     B 4
    10.  However, we are prepared  to recommend  to the Cabinet a reduc-i ion  to  this extent.   This  reduction  must  be  achieved without anysubstantial diminution in the sea-going fleet or in the war fleet available on mobilisation.  Enough ships  of  the battleship, battle-cruiser,  light-cruiser,  destroyer and submarine classes must  be  kept in  commission toenable the tactical training  and sea-going efficiency of the  Royal Navyto be maintained.  As  against  forty-nine battleships and nine  battle-cruisers manned  with active service ratings before the war, we  are nowreduced to fifteen battleships and three battle-cruisers in full commission.Less  than this  we cannot  contemplate.  Any  further  diminution of numbers  on  Vote A below the 100,000  can  only he achieved  by thepaying-off of sea-going ships out of this scanty minimum fleet.  Substan-tially the  above is also  true  of cruisers and destroyers.   A light  cruiseror two here and there on foreign stations, a few destroyers  now employedon ancillary services, might in the course of the year  be dispensed with;but  the  resultant  savings  will  not   appreciably   affect the  generalcalculations, and  we are not prepared to make defiuite recommendationsat this moment in regard to them.    17.  The Admiralty have represented to us that, so far as naval needsare  concerned,  the  Coastguard may be  reduced to 345 men, the number required to man certain wireless telegraphy and port war signal  stations.None of the Coastguard  are  now available for service on mobilisation, asthey are all pensioners,  but the Coastguard perform certain duties for theBoard of Customs and Board of Trade, and provision will have to be madefor the  discharge of those duties.  We have  accordingly  requested theBoard of  Customs and  Board of Trade  to report as  to what number  ofCoastguards they would require to be  maintained for the prevention  ofsmuggling and the manning of rocket stations respective^7 and whatwould be their  cost.    18.  The  next great  item is  New Construction, Repairs,  and themaintenance of  the  Royal  Dockyards.   This  must be  considered inrelation to unemployment in  general  and in  the  dockyard towns inparticular.  The dockyard population  is a definite part of our naval strength.   Discharges which save wages but entail employment dolesmust be carefully measured.  The  Admiralty have since the washington conference proposed  reductions of work in the  dockyards which entail the dismissal  of 7,500  men.  We have asked  them  to  consider  afurther  cut of   500,000 on dockyard work.  This entails the dismissal of another 4,000 men.  We are  very doubtful whether this  can be effected.The Cabinet must decide.  The Ministry of Labour,  whom we requestedto supply  us with figures showing the unemployment doles entailed, statethat it is  not possible accurately  to  estimate the cost per  week of theproposed  discharges.  The amount of the dole varies in individual cases,but they  estimate that a charge of 15s. per week will fall  directly on the
Treasury  in respect of every man discharged from the  dockyards.  Wedirect  special  attention  to  tlie  paragraph  in  the  final  admiralty memorandum  requesting that a definite policy be laid down.  Hithertoevery cut  made has been followed by directions from the Cabinet to theAdmiralty to help relieve the resulting unemployment by restarting work.In  those  circumstances, we are very doubtful whether the additionalL&apos;500,000  cut can be  realised.   As an alternative, we  have asked thatarrangements  should  be made to  save, say,  300,000 on the . 1,430,000estimated  to   be  spent  on   the   two  new battleships  of  1922-23.Careful investigation has shown that no substantial  economy is to be attained by delaying these two battleships.  But if the further   500,000is to be found  off the Dockyard Votes, we think the Admiralty should be free to spread the suffering between  the  dockyards and the Clyde.  Thedelay  in  tlie  guns for these  two ships which is proposed will affectWoolwich, and must  be considered in connection  with  Army economies and labour reactions.    19. Subsidiary services and stores have been  rigorously pruned andheavily drawn  upon in order to effect a saving.  We are satisfied that theefficiency  of the Fleet will be affected by any further reduction.  Votes 8(Shipbuilding, Repairs, &amp;c), 9 (Naval Armaments) and 10 (Works and buildings) have been  similarly scoured.   The Admiralty papers will showexactly what has  been done, and why, and why not more.    20. We have not yet completed  our discussions with the Admiraltyabout their stall&apos; and the higher appointments generally.   We recommend,however, that  the posts of Commander-in-chief, Coast of  Scotland, and commander-in-chief, Western  Approaches, be abolished.  We think thewhole  of  this field requires further  scrutiny.   But  time is necessary,and the  sums  in question  will not  appreciably  affect the total of theEstimates.    21. We have felt unable to reach a  conclusion upon the question ofthe &quot; Enchantress &quot; in the absence of  the First Lord.    22. The above comments  are by no means exhaustive.   They shouldbe read in conjunction with the Admiralty papers printed separately as appendices  to  this Report.   These documents will be  found to containfull explanations on  every aspect  of  the  Naval Estimates, and alsocategorical  answers  to the  various recommendations of the  geddes committee.    23. To  sum  up.    The  Naval  Estimates for the  current year are 83 millions.  The sketch Estimates for 1922-23 presented to the geddes committee (including provision for four capital ships) were  81 millions.We recommend that  the Estimates of  1922-23 should  be presented at approximately  02 millions (net in  all cases).  Total  reduction on lastyear&apos;s  Estimates,   21  millions, and on  the figures  presented  to the
Geddes  Committee,   19 millions.   We also recommend that Vote  should be fixed at approximately 98,550 officers and men, exclusive of the2,775 Coastguards nob required by the Admiralty.    24.  We wish to  place on record the great  and  loyal assistance wehave received from the Admiralty, and in particular from the  First sea lord, but for  whose  extraordinary personal exertions these immensefinancial savings could not  have been achieved without grave injury toour naval power.  It must  be borne in mind that it is easy to advise  orindicate economies when one has not got to  bear  the  burden of carryingthem  out,  or the responsibility for seeing  that  the national  safety  ismaintained.                        IX. ARMY ESTIMATES.    25.  The section  of the Geddes Committee  Report dealing with theArmy proceeds to compare the Estimates of 1914-15 with those of 1922-23without taking into account  the decreased purchasing power of the pound.Unless this be taken into account,  the calculations are not helpful.  Notonly has there been a large  fall in  the purchasing power of the pound,but the pay of the Army has been increased  2&amp; times.  It seems probablethat the  Estimates  of  1914-15 should  be  multiplied  by the  factor  of2]; times for the purposes of true comparison. We should thus get          Army (excepting Air), 1914   ....      ....   27 millions,         Multiplied by 24;, equals     ....      ..... 60fmillions,               cost of producing similar army in 1921-22.If the Estimates of the present year reached that figure, they would make no greater drain for military purposes upon the civil energies of the nationthan in 1914.  Moreover,  00 millions is 9&apos;0 per  cent, of  the total  expen-diture of the country in the present year (excepting debt, war terminal,and pension charges), and  27  millions was 14&apos;7  per  cent, of the totalrevenue in 1914-15 on a comparable basis.    20.  The Geddes Committee further assumed that the strength of thepre-war British Army bore some relation to the possibilities of a Europeanconflict.   This is, of course, an absolute delusion.  Not a single unit  onthe balance was added to the Army in the  ten  years  before the war forthe purposes of Europe.  The Army existed  then, as  its exists now, solely for  the  purpose of maintaining our foreign garrisons,  of providing  anadequate force to  proceed  to their relief  or reinforcement  and  as  an ultimate  aid  to the civil power at  home.   It is true that  the  forcesremaining at home for these purposes were woven  together to form  an expeditionary Force capable of intervening in a  European conflict.   Thiswas a matter of organisation and not of  increase of  numbers.   We agreewith the Geddes Committee in  thinking  that  the organisation  of  the
Army into  higher formations for immediate purposes on a great scale canbe geared down very considerably at  the present time.    27. We do not consider  that  the change in  the European  situationin any way affects  the  responsibility which the pre-war British Armyexisted to discharge throughout the  British Empire.  We do  not think the foreign garrisons can be reduced  below the point now contemplated bythe Secretary of State for War.  We note that even these reductions are opposed by the General  Staff.   The British  Empire is larger  than it  was before the war.  It is certainly much more unrestful.  The Indian situationis one  of  grave  anxiety,  as the telegrams  from that  country  show.The  Egyptian  position is  also critical.   Although  the Army has been relieved  of Palestine, Iraq and South Africa, it is  still  charged  withmaintaining a garrison  at  Constantinople and on the Rhine.   In thesecircumstances  we are  not prepared to recommend further reductions in battalions than those contemplated by the Secretary of State for War.    28. The Geddes  Committee do not recommend  the  abolition of theCardwell system,  by  which an equal  number of units are  maintained athome and abroad.  We do  not think it would be useful to reopen  thishistoric controversy  at  the present  moment.  We understand that theSecretary of State for War  and the War Office are definitely opposed to it.It would  certainly throw  the Army into  complete  disorganisation forseveral years, and it can certainly in  no way be made effective  upon theEstimates  which  have  to be presented in a few weeks.   There is noreason, however, why the subject should  not be  studied by a Committeeduring the course of  the present year.    29. Moreover, quite apart from the linked battalion theory, we do notthink that there is any large margin in the troops available  for  the main-tenance of  order at home or as a general reserve of the British  Empire.We do not think that less  than nine or ten battalions of Guards should stand  available for  the  maintenance  of  order in  the  Capital  andseat  of Government, nor  that fifty-four battalions  of  infantry are inexcess of what might be required for  similar purposes throughout GreatBritain.   Very much larger  numbers have been required in aid of thecivil  power in each of the last three years.    30. We have  considered  the effect  of the Irish settlement  ou themilitary position  at  home.  If there had been no  Irish settlement, notonly no  reduction of the  Army would have been  possible, but, on  thecontrary, a very large increase would have  been  necessary to  bring  the rebellion to an end.  The relief given by the Irish settlement is thereforeenormous.  On the other hand, compared with the pre-war situation, theevacuation of  Ireland affords  no  relief.  Ireland before the war was  amilitary asset  and not a liability.   The 30,000 troops maintained theremore cheaply than in Great Britain were always considered available as a
reserve for Great Britain and as part of the general reserve for the BritishEmpire.    31.  The  Geddes Committee  proposed  that  the Army should  bereduced by 50,000 men.   We do not think such a reduction is practicablewithout the gravest possible danger to the peace and order of the BritishEmpire.   The Secretary of  State for War has, however, laid before us ascheme  for  reducing the Army  by  30,000 men.   This scheme we areprepared to recommend to  the Cabinet, though  the  resultant militaryweakness is  most serious.  The  scheme involves a reduction of twenty-four battalions  of  infantry, a reduction  equivalent  to five  additionalcavalry regiments, one-third of  the now existing batteries of the RegularArmy,  and  a complete  reduction of  the artillery  from a, six-gun  to a four-gun basis, the whole comprising a diminution of over 40 per cent, ofthe guns of the Army.  These  reductions in the fighting troops should be accompanied by even larger reductions in the administrative services (seeparagraph 30).  We have strongly pressed upon the Secretary of State theimportance  of  preserving  as many fighting  troops as  possible and of effecting tlie savings on the administrative and  ancillary services.  Inpursuance of this policy, the  Signals and Royal  Engineers have  beenreduced  by  two-fifths, the Mechanical Transport  by 50 per cent.,  andother administrative departments in a similar manner.    32.  The   result  of  these  reductions  aggregates  approximately 10,000,000, as against  20,000,000 called for, but  by no means indicated,by the Geddes Committee.  -    33.  As the result of these  reductions, the total numbers of the Army(ex India) will stand at 158,000 compared to 171,000 (ex India) pre-war.The Expeditionary Force available in the first month will not exceed two divisions, as against six pre-war.   A third, fourth  and fifth Division couldbe gradually formed during the first six months  of a war.  We  need notcomment on. these facts.  They certainly acquit the War Office of  havingclaimed &quot;a great Army to  enforce its will upon Europe and the world.&quot;When the available forces  a/re  compared with  the possible requirementsset forth  in  recent telegrams  from  the  Viceroy of India, the seriousness of the situation will be fully appreciated.    34.  Very serious reductions  have  been  effected in the  size  andstandard of maintenance of the  Territorial Army.   These are fully setout in the War Office paper  attached.   The reductions will  deeply affectthe efficiency of the  force and  will be extremely unpopular.  We do not see how they can be  avoided in the existing circumstances.    35.  Full mobilisation equipment will be kept for 5 Regular  Divisionsonly, but rifles and&apos;guns and certain other mobilisation stores for another15  Divisions will be  presence! to the limits of the reduced floor space
available.   These weapons  must be considered while they last as a finalreserve for the State and as an asset not possessed  before the war.   Thecost of their storage, can1 and maintenance has been greatly reduced.     86.  A sub-committee of our Cabinet  Committee  has made a specialinvestigation of  the Quartermaster-General&apos;s  Department.   The  full report of that Committee is printed as Appendix X.  We think there canbe no doubt that there  is room  for  further compression.  Increases in numbers in  the  Royal Army Service Corps, Royal Army Ordnance. Corps,Remounts and Army Veterinary Corps,  average 58  per cent, over thenumbers required for these services in 191-1.  The  Army is smaller, thewar  danger  less imminent and the  country far poorer.  The  figures forthe  Royal Army Ordnance; Corps  are no doubt accounted  for to someextent by the greatly increased volume of war  stores which have to bemaintained.  But that Remounts and the Veterinary  Corps  should showlarge increases at a time  when Mechanical Transport lias  so  largelyreplaced horses in all branches of  the Army, and when the Cavalry itself is being  substantially reduced, is a  fact  for which,  in  our opinion, no satisfactory explanation has been forthcoming.  We are not prepared inthe time available to indicate further  detailed  reductions.   We recom-mend, however,  that a  sub-committee of  the Cabinet, on  which theTreasury is strongly represented,  should  scrutinise the Quartermaster-General&apos;s  Vote  in detail with a view to  securing a further appreciablediminution.   We have taken no account of this in our total figures.    37. We recommend the proposals of the Secretary of State for War asa whole to the Cabinet.   Although no doubt the process of minor adjust-ments and administrative  economies  within the Army should continue and additional savings may well be  realised, we do not  recommend anyfurther reductions in our military strength at the present time.  We  are convinced that the forces at the disposal of the Empire are  now reducedto a  weakness  unprecedented  since the South African War.  these reductions will  be justified only  by  a prolonged  period of  peace  andquiescence.  If,  for instance, India  were  to be the  scene  of a seriousuprising or mutiny, very large expenditure  would be  required to repair theeffects of present economies.                     X. AIR FORCE  ESTIMATES.    38.  The Estimates  of the current year were M18i millions net (in-cluding  Iraq,  &amp;c).   The Estimates laid  before the Geddes Committeehad been reduced to  13^ millions net (excluding Iraq, &amp;c.)  Thus the AirMinistry had effected by their own economies the reduction of 20 per cent.called for in the Chancellor of the Exchequers circular.
It    39. Tho  Geddes Committee  have proposed  a  farther  reduction  of4&apos;5A  millions.  Due  to  a miscalculation,  their  real  recommendationamounts only to   4* millions, but  the Air  Ministry  point  out that the saving that would be  effected  by carrying  out these recommendations would  be  2J-  millions.  This  they propose  to achieve by abolishing the squadrons maintained in the United Kingdom for the service of theArmy  and  the Navy.   Apparently the intention was to force the Armyand Navy to make further economies in order to secure the indispensable.air services.  But the Army and Navy are dealt with separately.   We donot think it is feasible to deprive the Army and the Navy of all aviation.Such a course would mutilate both the Services.  It would certainly leadto a demand on the part of the Army and the  Navy to create air servicesof their own.  Thus there would be three air services and not one.    40. On  the other  hand, this  country  is at the present  momentpractically without means of  defence against a Continental  attack fromthe air.  This situation  has engaged the attention of the Committee  ofImperial Defence, and  by Mr. Balfour&apos;s directions a Committee to inves-tigate the serious situation has been set up.   It seems certain that so farfrom abolishing the few air squadrons now at home devoted to Army and navy services, there  is  an urgent need to organise some new force whichwould  at any rate give  us some means of defence against the Continentalmenace.  Nineteen squadrons of the Air Force, or  three-quarters of thewhole,  are  maintained abroad, in India,  Iraq,  Palestine and Egypt.  no reduction seems possible in  these  forces.  Those  in India are  paid forby India, and may be the means of securing  a considerable diminutionin military charges.  Those in Iraq  have been the  chief agency through which  an enormous reduction of expenditure  has  been achieved.  Thesame is true of Palestine.  The Egyptian situation speaks for itself.    41. The only further  field of economy, therefore,  is the organisation.of schools  and training  establishments  at  home necessary to  create awell-disciplined and efficient Air Force.   We are strongly impressed,  aswrere the Geddes Committee, by the sense of  economy  and of thriftyadministration possessed by the Chief of Air Staff.  We cannot feel thatthere is  any large opening for further pruning.  The result might wellbe to destroy the efficiency of the whole force and waste to a large extentsuch funds as were still allocated to  it.    42. With regard to Halton, five-sixths of the money has already been spent.   We think the work should be completed.  We think it impossibleto draw the technical personnel of the Air Force solely from apprenticestaken from the Trade Unions.  We  therefore  think- that  the training  of boys into air mechanics at Halton  should continue.  On the other hand,measures should be taken to reduce the cost of the training establishment,and make sure that those who receive this expensive training at the costof the  State should give a full return in a longer service, thus reducingthe annual intake of recruits  and the numbers under training.
    43. Notwithstanding all  the above, the Air Ministry have proposed a further diminution  of  1A  millions, as  against the  .i&apos;4   millionsdemanded by  the  Geddes Committee.  We are asking them  to make afurther reduction of     millions.  If this can be achieved, we are satisfied.that it will represent the absolute maximum of economy possible at thepresent time.  In that  event the Air  Ministry would present  Estimatesto Parliament of   10f millions (excluding Iraq,  &amp;c.), as against  18&amp;millions  (including Iraq,  &amp;c.)  of the current  year.  This  represents a diminution (excluding Iraq in both cases) of 43 per cent.                    XI. TRAVELLING CONCESSIONS.    44. We recommend that the Votes provided in the Estimates of allthe services to enable officers and men to  travel by rail at reduced faresshould be discontinued.  Before 1914 the services enjoyed this  concessionby arrangement with the railway companies.   When  the  railways were taken  over  by Government  on the  outbreak  of  war the cost of  this concession was transferred  to  the  Treasury.   The  sum proposed to beincluded in the Estimates  for  1922-23  for the three  services  for  thispurpose was  630,000.   We  suggest that the Departments  should enterinto negotiations with the railway companies  on  a business  basis witha view to obtaining from  them concessions  for  the  members  of theservices similar to  those that were granted  before the war.Signed on behalf of the Committee,                      WINSTON S.
