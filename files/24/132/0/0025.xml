ETBOBS.-T     l3urope-^is paralyse.-   Her industries are dislocated-,tae&apos; volume of international  trade has seriously decreased,.Many of her- people  suffer  from unemployment and; in eastern Europe, from&apos;privation.-    Systems of transport in Central and-Eastern.:Europe  have fallen, into disorderwith the result that the whole current of commerce has&quot;been impeded.     Want of donfidence among  nations has paralysed theefforts of individuals, and  the fluctuation in the&apos; values of the national currencies has tended to restrict tradeto primitive barter, and to  destroy opportunities of-employment.-     A resumption of international trade and a developmentof the resources of each country-will extend the volume&apos; of productive - employment^ and-tend to reld-eve--eJids-ting &apos;-prdaratdU*v1 . - -
      International trade will be re-established only when theengaged in trade and industry can once more feel confident that in Central and Eastern Europe economic principles willbe observed which are essential to the development and eventhe existence of private enterprise.      The fundamental conditions \xpon which alone inter-national trade can be actively developed with the central and Eastern European countries have been defined in theResolution&apos;passed by the Allied Powers in Conference onJanuary 6th, 1922,      To bring back Europe to its&apos; former prosperity it isessential that these conditions should be fulfilled;otherwise trade and labour will necessarily be reducedwithin narrow limits.      If any country refuses to fulfil these conditions,trade with that country will regain impossible except toa limited extent, and all Europe will suffer in consequence^.The markets of Central and Eastern Europe are essential tothe well-being of European industry.   If these marketscannot be reconstituted Eastern and South-Eastern Europe                            -2-
will los.e millions of the i r&quot; population., and. reoo^nstracti on.will -hooome-:pr-ogrB&apos;SSiTely&apos;&quot;more  difficult;  and  the conditions-which produce misery and  starvation  in the East will  doom.tho industrial population of Western Europe  to a long periodof unemployment., during which -they will compete with  eachother in.markets Incapable  of taking more  than a part of thegoods they are anxious to produce-.     In such circumstances  the  economic rehabilitation ofEurope will become still more difficult..   In .. flat ion  willcontinue in many countries.   The  cost of  living will not&quot;fall, general depression wi 11 not  abate, and the wage-earning end the. professional, classes will  be the worstsufferers*..........     The evil.is. even more  far-reaching and *wtends forbeyond Europe, for it has. to be  borne, in mind that thosecountries producing raw materials  such as  India, China,the Argentine and Brazil, if unable  to sell these matoilalaowing to the impoverishment of  Europe, cannot  in their turnpurchase the manufactures with  which Europe has hithertosupplied them-                         -  3 -e^
     The process of reeonsi/iljTrtihg1 each -country.&quot;by  its ownunaided efforts has not yet proved  successful.   Whole Jrearte-d-op^operation among the nations  of Europe  and  amongst  all  the classes of the community  can alone  overcome the  difficulty  Saidstimulate and assist each country to make the best  use of itsenergies and ro sour cos.     It is therefore proposed that  the British Empire. Fran:^ tItaly, Belgium and Japan  and the Unic ed States  of America,if willing, should take a share in  the task,  together withother countries capable of effective help.    It  is  desirablethat- Germany should&apos; co-operate-i   Germany, is. industrially,commercially and financially an important factor in central and Eastern Europe.  .*&apos; Ilot only  do her resources  and hergeographical position give her  great importance, but  she has  in the past acquired  kntawledl*e  and - experience which areuseful for the process of reconstruction*                           - 4  -
     The problefri is to r^to-re-confidence and the credit machirrerxTT-ecessary for setting Central and eastern Europe to work again-.  Governments cannot do this themselves, &quot;because apart f^om other reasons creditoperations require .knowledge of the position and thecharacter of possible borrowers, and--on 17 industrialistsand financiers possess this knowledge:                     II,     It is proposed that an International Corporationfree from Government control shall be constituted inthe, manner specified in the annexed memorandum/&apos;     The primary purpose of the International Co1&quot;0Nation and of the National Corporations which will be affiliatedto it, while duly safe-guarding rights previously acquired by nationals of &quot;the participating Powers, will be to undertake organisation of transport and harbour facilities and enterprises associated therewith in such countries ascomply with the conditions above referred to and desirethe assistance of &quot;the International Corporation.
