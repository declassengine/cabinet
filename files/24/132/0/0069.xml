y   i,  ., .  .       354iTHIS DOCUMENT  IS THE  PROPERTY OF  H3S BRITANNIC  MAJESTY1 S -GOVERNIvE NT                         &apos;C A B I W E TSET            INCREASE OF RENT l\G. (RESTRICTIONS)  ACT.  -      L. G .65,3670        &apos; MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER ^OF HEALTH.          The Increase of Rent arid Mortgage Interest (Restrictions)Act, 1920, which superseded the previous enactments on thismatter, authorised certain increases in the rent, of houses to which the Act applies and prescribed the conditions underwhich such increased rent could be charged by the landlords.          Section 3(1) of the Act provides that &quot;nothing in this&quot;Act shall be taken to authorise any Increase of rent exceptnin respect of a period during which, but for this Act, the&quot;landlord would be entitled to obtain possession&quot;.   Theeffect of this provision is, of course, to prevent any Increaseof rent during the currency of an existing agreement betweenlandlord and tenant *          When, however, such an agreement comes to- an end(either by effluxion of time or by a legal notice to quitgiven by the landlord) the tenant, If he elects to remain inpossession of the house, as he hao a right to do, as a statutory tenant&apos; under the Act, becomes liable to pay theIncreased rent permitted by the Act..   But the Act providesthat no such increased rent is payable unless- and until the landlord has served on the tenant a notice in the prescribed form of his intention to demand the Increase.   In the caseof  an  increase of rent alone, the notice must be a month&apos;.notice;   in the case  of an increase due to higher rates,one week&apos;s notice is  sufficient.          Thus in the case of a weekly tenancy, the tenancymust first be terminated by a notice to quit, which, if given,converts  the tenant Into a  Statutory tenant1 at the expiration of  the notice.   Not until he has become a statutory tenant can the permitted increases of rent under the Act be demanded of
him, though the Courts have held that a notice toincrease the rent may he given simultaneously with thenotice to quit, provided of course that the former doesnot become operative before the latter has expired.          I am, however, Informed that the great majorityof landlords have been under the impression that noticeof an intention to Increase rent given in the prescribed form was the equivalent of a notice to quit, in allcases where a month or a week&apos;s notice to quit, as thecase may be, would have been sufficient to terminate the existing tenancy.   This impression was not in myopinion an unreasonable one, since notice of an in-tention to increase the rent payable under the existingter*ancy might well be regarded as notice of an intentionto put an end to that tenancy.   In Very many cases alsolandlords have been unwilling before increasing rents togive a formal notice to quit, in order to avoid un-settling the minds of tenants who, not understanding the technicalities of the Act, might otherwise be led tobelieve they were actually in danger of being ejectedfrom their houses.          An unfortunate situation has now arisen owing tocertain decisions in the Courts to the effect that a notice to quit is necessary in every case, not exceptingcases of weekly or monthly tenancies, before  increases in rent can be charged,    In consequence,  though atfirst the demands for  increased rent were  generally met without objection by the tenants, there  is  now a growing demand  on their  part for a refund of the  money paidwhere no notice  to quit has been  served,  or  alternatively,they are withholding or making deductions  from the rentsnow due.           I have received  a communication signed  jointly                           2.
by the President of the National Federation of property owners and Ratepayers, the President of the PropertyOwners1 Protection Association of London, and the hon. Secretary of the (tenants) Y/ar Rents League, inwhich they say that grave difficulties and complicationsinvolving consequences of a very serious character have arisen in various parts of the country and are increasingfrom day to day.   They state that the houses subject toweekly or monthly tenancies represent some 90 per cent of the whole of the dwelling houses coming within theprovisions of the Rent Restriction Act and that the ;\question at issue is believed to affect some 6,000,000houses in the country where increased rents have al-ready been paid but no notice to quit was originallyserved.   They give the following reasons among othersfor not serving such notice:-   That it was mutually agreed between the leading representative owners andthe leading tenants organisations that hot ices to quitwere unnecessary;  that there is no indication in thestatutory form of notice to increase rent as affectingweekly or monthly tenancies that the service of a notice to quit Is also required, and the notice, if served,could not be enforced under the  provisions of the ActJand that the service  of such notices was bitterly re-sented by the tenants and would  cause them unnecessaryanxiety, worry and disturbance.          They further state that many claims are beingmade by tenants In various localities that all increases of rent paid since the 2nd January, 1920, are unlarfuland may be recovered  by them.          The communication proceeds:-          &quot;In the majority of cases the  tenant&apos;s method  of&quot;recovery is to cease payment of.all rent until the
&quot;amount alleged to be  unlawfully collected  has been&quot;recovered.   Seeing that the  average&apos; increased  rent&quot;of a house let at an  &quot;inclusive&apos;  rent is now approxi-&quot;mately 50- per cent of the pre-war standard rent (about&quot;half of which is in respect of increased rates  and water&quot;charges already paid  to the Authorities) this with-&quot;hoiding of rent means broadly that no rent whatever&quot;vould be paid for probably twelve months,          &quot;This grave  position in effeot means that no&quot;rates, water charges,, or imperial taxes in respect of&quot;the houses affected could be  expected to be forthcoming&quot;from the owners, and  it will  be seen that  the owners&apos;&quot;position becomes impossible and.must lead  to grave&quot;disturbance.   It should be borne in mind  that  the&quot;increased rents paid by tenants without objection&quot;cr demur have already been.paid a &quot;ay in increased rates&quot;and water charges, in, increased mortgage^ interest,&quot;and in increased cost of repairs.          &quot;There.is ample evidence that this purely techni-cal difficulty is being exploited.for gain in various&quot;parts of the.country, that the evil Is growing  daily,&quot;and is leading to unrest, constant disputes and costly&quot;litigation.   It is beyond doubt that if this movement&quot;is not checked forthwith it may be seized by extremists&quot;and can only lead to chaos&quot;,  -          I am further informed by the Artizans, Labourers&amp;  General Dwollings Company, Limited, that if noticesto increase rent are  invalid without prior service of a notice to quit the Company will lose some  79,500 up tothe 31st December last, with a continuing liability of..some  .1250 a week.
                What appears to be needed is -                 (l) A provision to the effect that, as from the      passing of the Act, where a notice to Increase rent      is  served  in  conformity with the provision in sub-      section  (2) of section 3 of the Act of 1920, and      the period Is equal to or exoeeds the period required for      determining   the tenancy the notice so served shall be      deemed to  meet all the requirements for making such      inorease of rent as is authorised by the Act of      1920  and is set forth In the notice:                 (2) A provision to the effect that, where a      valid notice  to increase the rent has been served      prior to the  passing of the Act, a tenant shall not      after the  passing of the Act be entitled to recover      by deduction  from the future rent or otherwise any      sums  paid  in  pursuance of such notice, by reason only      of the fact that at the date when the notice became      operative  the landlord had not? by serving a notice      terminating the tenancy, converted the tenancy into      a statutory tenancy under the Actc                 Having regard to the undoubted hardship which      is being caused to the landlords of small houses,      many of  them  very poor people, by reason of the      purely technical difficulty which has arisen, the      consequential loss to the rates and the Exchequer,      the fact that the difficulty is growing and that      reputable  organisations of Tenants as well as Property      Owners have pronounced emphatically in  favour of re-      moving this difficulty, I am of opinion that amending      legislation on the lines above suggested shouldbe       introduced at the earliest practicable opportunity.                                           A. MOND.                                              31st January,  1922Ministry of Health.
