                                                                /[This Document is the  Property of His  Britannic Majesty*s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1922.CABINET.I circulate to my colleagues  the following two telegrams.                                                           E. S. M.    2nd  February 11)22.                 From Mr. Sastri, Washington, 1st February 1922.    I hear Churchill has announced decision  of  Kenya ;  likely to  make Indian crisismost  serious.   1.  hope  I  am misinformed, but in  any  case trust ultimate  cabinet decision  will be satisfactory.  Also venture to suggest you try  to delay decision untilalter my return, though this may not be much use.                        From Viceroy, \st February 1922.    ReuteFs  telegram  from  London,  dated 27th  January, received Bombay  on30th  January, reports  that  Churchill,  at  East African  Dinner,  announced finaldecision  that  highlands  of  Kenya will  be  exclusively reserved  for  Europeans, that future immigration of Indians into  East Africa will be  strictly regulated, and thatIndians who conform  to well-marked  European  standard, regarding  which european community will be fully consulted,  will  not  be denied  fullest civic and political rights.   The  occasion of this announcement  appears  to  us  unfortunate, and thesubstance of it is bound to provoke extreme bitterness in this country, and to  add toour difficulties at a very critical juncture.   It is  most regrettable that  the announce-ment has  apparently  reached India in an incomplete form.  Nothing  is reportedregarding segregation, or the precise qualifications for the franchise. - We are  greatlyembarrassed, both by the  lack  of official  information  as to the exact terms  of theannouncement, and by the  knowledge that we  recently officially advised Indians in east  Africa  to refrain  from passive resistance, and  to  accept  interim offer  ofnomination of  Indian members to Executive and Legislative  Council,  in the confidence that a fair settlement  would be reached.  The political effect of the announcement inthis country is likely to be so  serious that we beg you  to consider, even  at this latestage, whether you cannot do anything further to help us.     2. In the meantime, in order to put the  Government of India right with  thecountry, it may be necessary  for us  to publish the correspondence that has passed between us on the subject.  But before doing so we shall inform you what papers  we propose  to publish and ask for your approval.     3.  We should be glad  if you would send us a telegram which  we may publish,stating the exact  terms  of  the decision, with such explanations as may be necessary.Please telegraph also, for our own information, a summary of  what Churchill actuallysaid.   We may  add that  Churchill&apos;s  reference to  creation of great East  african federation, taken with his reference  to the future of East Africa as a characteristicand distinctively British Colony looking forward to self-government, will add to  theapprehensions which  will be aroused by  the rest of his  speech.  We should like toknow whether this has  been definitely accepted as the goal of colonial policy in EastAfrica.SECRET. C.P. 3088.5125    100  2.22
