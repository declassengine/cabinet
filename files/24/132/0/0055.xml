RUSSIA.      Information has been received that it is proposed  tocomplete  the following ships of the Baltic  Fleet in 1922  :-           Cruisers:    Svietlana, Admiral  Butakov.           Destroyers:  Kapitan Belli, Pryamislav.           Submarines:  Yaz, Forel.           Trawlers:    Klyazmya, Kivach,  Seim, Iset, Selionga.           Icebreaker:  Toros.                         NORWAY,      The  proposed Naval Budget is stated to show an expenditureof Kr. 16,047,600 ( 600,000 approximately), a decrease of Kr.2,567,000 ( 95.000 approxim&amp;tely) on the previous budget.  Thegreater part of  the  decrease  in expenditure is due  to a reductionunder  the  heading &apos;Naval Cruises  and Manoeuvres&apos;.                         HOLLAND.      Naval Estimates.   The  Navy  estimates  amounting to about 5 , 000 , 000 came up for  discussion again in  the  Second Chamberon 9th January, 19220  It appears that criticism was fairlyevenly divided, but there is every prospect that they will be passed.   It is expected that they will be presented  to the first chamber in February,  but owing to Parliamentary procedure,several months may elapse before  the  fate of the&quot;Navy Bill issealed.      The Parent Ship for Submarines  &quot;Pelikan&quot;  in course  ofbuilding for the Colonial Office  was  successfully launched on31st December, 1921  and will shortly go to the Schelde  forengines.  She should be ready in  4 or 5 months.      Naval Air Service.The  eight Viking amphibious  machines are ready for delivery and  will  be sent straight to the  $ast  Indies.By request of the Dutch Government, Messrs. Vickers  have  selectedas specialist instructor, a  Mr. Baker, who  will become a  servantof the Colonial Government at Tandjong Priok.  The Marine Depart-ment, who were dealing with  Messrs. Vickers with a view  to obtaining further Viking machinos, have now entered  into  a contract with Mr. Fokker  entirely on account  of political pressure insupport of Dutch industry.      The Dutch Cruisers&apos; &quot;Java&quot; and &quot;Sumatra&quot; are to be  fitted,with protective Paravanes.                                                    FRANCS  ... /

Sailors from the  Greek battieshin &quot;Lemnos&quot;  at  Smyrna havebeen indulging in demonstrations  against the  French,  which took the form 01 forcibly stopping the playing of  the  &quot;Marseillaise&quot;and smashing some windows in the  French Consulate.   Althoughit is known that the Greek troops at Smyrna are getting out of hand, special significance is to  be  attached  to  uhe  action ofthe men from the &quot;Lemnos&quot;, who, until quite recently,  have beenmodels of good discipline.The Coast of North AfricaTURKEY.

It isnot clear whether Abdullah is coming to England.

It is confidentially reported that the Greek Government isat the end of its financial resources.      It is almost certain that the Greek army is two monthsarrears in pay, and funds to meet contractors&apos;&apos; bills are not forthcoming, except in the Smyrna area, where the bills are met so as to create a favourable impression.                       ITALY.      The members of the Federation of Free Italian Shipownersare threatening to lay up all  their ships as a protest againsta recent decree passed by the Marine Federation.                      RUMANIA.      Owing to a vote of censure against the present government having been carried in Parliament by a considerable majority, thePrime Minister,    Take Jonesou, resigned on 18th January.  his successor is M. Janel Bratianu, who has formed an entirely new cabinet.                       TURKEY.      The Allied High Commissioners at Constantinople havedecided that the ex-enemy vessels passing through the Dardanellesand Bosphorus and not calling  at Turkish ports are  to be  allowed to fly their national  flags:  those calling at  Turkish ports  to fly  the inter-allied flag.  A  form of questionnaire  to be handed to the Master of each vessel by the examination  officer,  Chanak,has been decided upon, and authority is being delegated  to the                                                       Allied  ...

He has asked for the moral support of Great Britain.      In consequence  of the attitude- taken up by Lt.ColonelSarrau, the G^CLCin  C. at Constantinople has asked for hisremoval,  LteColonel  Sarrau styles himself Inspector Generalof Turkish Gendarmerie, and refuses to  take orders fromGeneral Pilloneau, head of the Allied gendarmerie sub-commission:he further claims to  control all gendarmerie in the Brusa andBalikesri areas.                    G-SEK OPERATIONS.      The Greek military authorities are contemplating thepreparation of a second defensive line  behind Afium Kara Hissar.This has given rise to rumours that they intend to withdraw from that town, which&apos; course would seem impossible in existingcircumstances.                         CHINA.      The situation at CHIN3QANG remains unchanged.  A jointnote has been addressed to the Chinese  Government warning themthat unless immediate steps are taken to prevent interferencewith the central salt administration, the Foreign Governmentsconcerned will have to deal with the situation themselves0Information has been received  that WU-PEI-FU has given orders to detain the HUPEI salt revenue for military purposes.
