The  British Government strongly desire that the Cannes Con-   ference shall lead to definite results which will be approved   by French and British sentiment and also by the opinion of Europe   as a whole.    In their judgment the indispensable condition of   such success is a close preliminary understanding between the   French and British Governments.        Public opinion is undeniably anxious and disturbed both in   Great Britain and in France,   Questions  in which both countries   are deeply interested are rightly believed to be at stake,   There   is a general feeling that some of the fundamental objects of the   peace have not yet been achieved.   The recovery of Europe is   delayed beyond expectation.   The disappointment of the peoples   provokes  irritation, and  irritation leads- to misunderstanding  and   controversy.   These have been, reflected  throughout Europe and   even beyond Europe with unhappy results .        The  failure of the Cannes Conference would therefore re-act          j   with very bad effect on the relations of  the two countries.    In-   determinate or provisional decisions would be regarded as tantamount   to failure,  and would inevitably accentuate the divergence between   Freno  and. British sentiment which has. lately made itself felt.   Europe would regard any such consequence  with dismay, since its   peoples realise that a close understanding between the British   Empire and France is not  only an essential part of. the Entente   between the Allies but indispensable to, European welfare  and the   peace of. the world.   The British Government desire  to make it   plain at the Cannes Conference that the British Empire  and France   stand together as firmly  in the issues  of peace as in the of.SQ.al  of                                                          war
&apos; war.      In  their opinion this  is not  to  be secured by  any  pie-come-al treatment  of  the  questions  by  vrtiich. the Conference  is faced.    On the  contrary,  they consider it  abs-olutely necessary than..the problem  should be treated as a  wholej and with this object in view, they  desire to state the  position  of  both countries;&apos;  as they  see it, at the present time.      In  their opinion there are two principal  reasons for anxiety in France.      In -the first place,  French opinion is disquieted on the  subject of reparations.    France  is endeavouring to  repair  her  devastated areaj  and  is  obliged to  advance great sums,  which make  a formidable gap  in hot&apos;  budget,  for that purpose.     This expenditure should and must  be met by Germany;   but in spite of settlement after settlement, satisfactory reparation by  Germany is always postponed.      In  the second place, French- opinion is  naturally anxious about the  future  safety of Prance.   She has been  invaded four times in a hundred  ahd twenty years,  and in spite of the  losses  of man-power suffered by Germany in the  war  and under the peace, France has still   i                   - .a population twenty millions less, than that  of the  German Empire. Germany, moreover,  possesses in the  surviving  soldiers  of the Great Tar  five million,  men trained to arms, ahd amongst them  a very powerful  corps of officers  and  non-commissioned Officers.   It is true.that  Germany has been  deprived of nearly  all her  arms and equipment,  but France cannot overlook the possibility  that this deficiency may, by one means or other) be made good.    It is therefore  essential to her  that the  discrepancy between French and German man-power  should  be  made up in such a way as to  guarantee her  soil  from another devastating  v?arv.      In  Great Britain there is  also  grave cause for anxiety and discontent&apos;.   Britain Is  a  country which iives by its  exports,     &apos;tr,                   *  2 -                          and
and its trade has been devastated, as- terribly--as&quot;the--s.oH--oiLFranee.The con-sequences in human, suffering and privation are very serious.Nearly two millions of the British working class are unemployed,and their maintenance costs the country nearly  2,000,(500 a week..This burden falls upon a community more heavily taxed than any other in the world and more hardly hit than Prance by the economic con- \sequences . of the war.     Prance is  in this way more fortunately situated than other-European -countries.   0-wing-partly to the large proportion of herpopulation which lives upon the land, partly to the stimulus givento internal production by the needs of her devastated area, andpartly also to  the fact that the arrested condition of emigration toextra-European  countries affects her population much less than thosewhich sent large numbers of emigrants, over-sea before the war, sheis suffering less than others from unemployment and from the collapsec*f international trade.     The other  peoples of Europe are, however, suffering deeply fromthe same causes as the British people.   In Italy and Belgium, un-employment is serious.   Italy is alBe very dependent upon foreign trade, and has  a greater population to employ than before the war.Belgium is a food Importing country, dependent upon the Europeanmarkets for 80^ of her export trade.   In Central, Eastern and SouthEastern Europe, the collapse and confusion of the normal processes of economic life are even more marked.   Millions are living in conditions of bitter privation and misery.   Even where inflationhas given employment and good wages to the working  class, the relief is temporary and reaction certain, unless measures are taken in  time.Those dependent on small fixed incomes are suffering still more.     Russia,, a  fertile source of raw material and food before thewar, is now  in  the grip of famine.   Millions are faced with                                                    s tarvation
starvation in her great.....eorn-gr-o-wing lands.   In the cause of humanity and in the cause of fe-er own welfarej to which the revival of Russia is&apos; indispensable, the European peoples should striveto find some remedy for Russia&apos;s present state,  but they have &apos;hitherto looked on impotently, not knowing what  to do.   In thelong run, the civilisation of Europe must suffer profoundly from &apos;&apos;such impotence&apos;.   In its present state, it is moving fast towardssocial and economic catastrophe.     profoundly, therefore, as her own interest  is engaged in theeconomic reconstruction of Europe, Great Britain appeals in noselfish spirit for the co-operation of all the Allies in thatgreat human cause.   It must be undertaken here  and now.   There isan awful aggravation of human misery, and in some parts of Europeah increasing menace to civilisation itself/ in every month of delay .     The problem before Great Britain and France &apos; is how to meet their respective&apos;necessities by common action.   These must be metas a whole.   Complete frankness between the statesmen of hothcountries is essential, if the problem is to be effectively solved.Great Britain-fUlly recognises France&apos;s ground for anxiety, anddesires  to do all in&apos;her power to allay it, but she cannot agree topostponing the question of the reconstruction Of Europe, whilemeeting France.&apos;s desires in regard to her reparations and her &apos;security.    In order&apos; to give  satisfaction, to French needs, theBritish  Government must be able to tell the British people thatthe two  countries are marching together to restore the economic structure of Europe and the general prosperity  of the world.      With regard to reparations,  His Majesty&apos;s:  Government  are pre-pared  to abide, so far  as  they are concerned, by the arrangements&apos;reached  in London under which France would reap  considerable advantages while Britain would make  considerable sacrifices.   They^                        .-  4 -     ,                    believe
believe that this aJ^rangemerrt will meet the essential claims of france  until such time as a. wider financial settlement can be attained - perhaps  in two or three  ears.           . . . 0&apos;-&apos;&quot;      ith regard, to the safety of Prance against invasion,. GreatBritain will regard this as an, Interest of her own and is therefore prepared to undertake that in the. event, of unprovoked german aggression against French soil the British people will place their forces at her side...   There will be a double, value in this, guarantee-since it will not only safeguard France in the event of german attack but will make any such, attack extremely improbable.&apos;   It isnot likely that Germany would have attacked in 1914, had sherealised the great forces which, the British Empire, would throwintb the war-   In 1914 Germany credited Great Britain with onlysix divisions  .  She knew little or nothing of the character and resources, of the British Commonwealth.&apos;,.  She Is wiser now, for she.knows that, instead of six divisions only, the British Empire wasmaintaining 400,000 men, In the. field in France, by the. end. of thefirst year of the war...  These numbers rose rapidly afterwards and during the last two years the Empire maintained a s trehgth of ,000,000 men in France and Flanders despite a heavy drain of casulties.   Great Britain..called out a total of 6,211,427 men. for-military service by land, sea. and air... The self-governingDominions, India and the Colonies called cut $,284,94.3..   The total strength thrown by the British Empire into, the, war..,was nearly10,000,000 men.  .. The losses in killed, wounded and missing were3,266,723;   The killed numbered 847,364.            ...     It is inconceivable that Germany should forget, these facts or their significance as a guarantee of French, soil.  . vftiat theBritish Empire did  once- for. civilisation,  it-will, if need be, doagaiu.,.,.. The great - reserves of trained, officers and men which itInherits from the Great -&quot;ar will be available as long as Germanyrsown.   The vast equipment manufactured for the war will be availablein Great Britain for at&apos; least&apos;a generation, whereas that of Germany has been taken away - wholesale by the&apos; Allies,
                                                    -    109If,  therefore-. Germany  la  eeirtain  uhshr tli.e&quot;&quot;Brltlsii Empirewill stand  by ]?rundo  in a  future war,  she will not bo temp-to:&apos;  to  toeop alive%any dreams  of revenge.   It is of Greatimportance  to divert  the German mind  from any such ambitionsas woll as  to &quot;provide for  tho defeat of those ambitions should.they mature..  The British  Government believe that both objectswfru-Lfr be; met by  an  undertaking that the two nations will standtogether against an unprovoked attack upon French soil byGermany,  and that such  an  undertaking must ripen and. strengthentho  friendship of ,the two  nations  as years go on.     There ere two; ways  in  which this mutual undertakingcould, be given.-     The -first is by moans  of  an offensive and defensivealliahoo,   Though: such  an  alliance might seem desirable toFrance,, it  would in reality-not serve her interests well,because such alliances  are contrary to British tradition.h                               the-The  British people  understand      claira:of Franco to be guaranteed-  against invasion  of her soil; but they wouldhot-.willingly be committed to military liabilities for breaches of t e  peace elsewhere.   Participation in military  enterprises in Central snd  eastern Europe they would hotcontemplate. An Alliance  involving, or even, appearing to involve,, any such- responsibility would not carry the whole-  hearted concurrence  of the British people... On, the con tray-it - would he strongly  opposed   by large sections of thecommunity . in all parties, and would therefore not be as&quot;valuable to France  as an undertaking in another form.     - The second  alternative is a definite guarantee thatthe  British Umpire  and  prance will stand - together in  theevent of unpro-vo-kedaggression by  Germany against FrenchSbil- ;  This alternative was discussed at the ImperialConference  last  summer, and it is  probable that the opinion  of  the-empire. would  support  that, of Great Britain in giv-ing:,;s&apos;Uc\h &amp;. guaraniopvto Franco.&apos;;-  It would-therefore ; have                                             far greater
far greater weight, for &quot;It&apos;-&quot;would,  tho - &quot;BritgLsh  Kmmmmrtbelieves, carry with it tho wholo-^hoartod. opinion,  not  ofgreat Britain alono, hut of the Dominions.   The  real  danger to Franco is frod Gorman invasion.   She  cannot he  invaded&quot;by any other, nation.  A guarantoo  against&apos; German invasionsecures her safety &quot;beyond doubt.-  This,  therefore Ore,: is thealternative, which His &quot;iajesty,:s Government  prefer to.adopt.&quot; They propose thedraft Treaty between Groa t Britain  andFrance attached to this memorandum as  the  form of  engagementbest calculated to protect the &quot;common  interests  of bothPowers in &quot;Western Europe     In order, however, that  effect may  bo given to it, itis necessary that the Treaty should be accompanied by a com-plote Entente between the two countries.   This was  tho  basisof the agreement of 1904, which gave France  tho  support ofGreat Britain in tho war, and it is equally  essential now..     His Majesty1s Government consider that  the  first condi-tion of a true Entente is the avoidance  of naval competition between the two countries..  With regard,  to submarines they  &apos;fully Una erst and that tho divergence ofFrenohsnd  Britishviews on the subject may be due to  different ideas of &quot;the..uses  which submarines can servo.   The British opinion,however,  based, on ,four years&apos; war  experience.,  is that .s.ubr-                         onlymarines are   .  &apos; effective/ again-it merchant ships  and areineffectual otherwise  as instruments  either of  attach  ordefence.   British opinion would inevitably insist  on  a heavy programme of anti-submorlno.
craft,, if the French: submarine pro-gramme- were&apos; carried&apos; out, and thetwo countries would thus be launched on a course of competitivenaval, construction..   The. British- Government cannot disguise the factthat any such development would, react very seriously  on Britishsentiment towards Prance,. anc. French sentiment towards Great Britain.britain s sea communications are. to Britain what France,:s Eastern.frontier, is to - France.  &apos; Naval competition in any form between GreatBritain-.and j-ranee would, correcto good-will..    His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, therefore,, propose as the condition of the Treaty and-Entente which they contemplate that the Admiralties of the twocountries shall confer together regarding their naval programmes inorder that all competition in shipbuilding may be avoided betweenthem..     The British Government also strongly desire that&apos; France, shallco-operate whole-heartedly, with Great Britain in the economic and. -financial reconstruction of Europe..  They therefore look for theagreement -,of France to the immediate summoning of an  Economic-Conference at which all the lowers of Europe,, including Russia, wouldbe represented..   The economic collapse of Central, Eastern,  andSouth-Eastern durope is now the most serious  factor in the paralysisof European trade;-and it cannot be remedied unless the produce andthe markets of Russia are once more made available to the world...The presence of the real leaders of Russia is therefore necessary,. inthe opinion of the British Government, to the success of such aConference..   No. useful, object is served by fo-rwardihg  conditions inwriting to Moscow..  It  is most important. to deal,. if possible,-direct with:the heads of the Russian Government,. -and .the Conference&apos;should be held as soon as:possible -at the. most suitable centre-, for-&apos;that purpose...     In., order to trade with Russia, certain assurances  and guarantees are essential-
     It should be pointed-out that while nations can claim no :right to dictate.to each other regarding the principles on whichthey are to regulate their system of ownership,, internal economy and government,  foreign capital cannot be ma,.e available to assist.a country&apos;until&apos;foreign,investors are. - assured - that, their property and their rights v-iii be respected, and the fruits of theirenterprise secured to&apos; them.   &apos; The sense of, security cannot be, -re-established unless&quot; the Governments of. countries desiring foreigncredit freely under take       . (a)  to recognise all .public debts and obligations.         -&apos; as well as the obligation to restore or compensate           all foreign, interests for loss,Or damage caused to         &apos;. them when property has been confiscated or withheld.        fb)&apos; to establish a legal and juridical system which           sanctions and enforces, -commercial&apos; and, other contracts           with impartiality.Finally, an adequate means Of exchange must be. available,  and,generally, there must be financial and currency-Conditionswhich&apos; offer sufficient &quot;Security-. for- trade .     His - hajesty1s&quot;Government would also lay down the two following principles:-      &quot; (1)   Ail nations should undertake to refrain from            propaganda subversive of order and the established           - political-system in other countries than their own.        ( )-- : All countries should join in an undertaking: to            refrain from.aggression against their neighbours.     His I.IajestyTs Government-have indicated the importanceof agreement upon naval - construction1, because they consider  itindispensable to that complete Entente between Great Britain andFrance which they desire to maintain.,  In the. same spirit theywould desire to  clear away all -questions  on which.controversy between the two  countries, is &quot;possible.     It is essential, for instance, that.peace  in the Gear Bast
 shall  be  restored,  and that there  shall be -absolute  agreement between France  and  Great Britain as  to the Allied  policy  to be pursued.   The same  consideration applies  to  other  important points at issue  in foreign, affairs,.  which have  hitherto, in  some:measure - impeded  a -corap 1 eta uxiderstaiiding.     She&apos;  time-&apos;.has passed when - statesmen could pledge their&apos;countries to engagements without full regard to the  popular sentiment-which  they  represent.  In  order that  the Treaty  of Guarantee proposed  should be of lasting value to both countries, it  is  essential&apos; that  the democracies- of the  British  Empire and the French Republic should.&apos; feel assured that they  are guided by similar purposes and  harmonious ideals.   All questions,  therefore, should be cleared away which may be  capable  of  dividing  the  senti- ment of the two  countries and marring their  accord.    His  Majesty.rs Government are&apos;  confident that there  are no outstanding euestions which  cannot be&apos; solved in a manner satisfactory to both  Governments., and that-the Treaty of Guarantee between  the, two countries may thus&apos;&quot;be&quot;sealed and confirmed by a complete and durable  Entente.     It is moreover their particular desire  that this Entente between Great Britain and prance,  so far  from excluding  other nations,  should form  the basis of  a  v/ider scheme of  international co-operation to  ensure the peace of  Europe as a whole,  They look confidently to what can be accomplished by collaboration between the Allies&apos; ih this  purpose.   The  last of the- conditions laid down in this Hemorandum as:the basis of the  proposed Economic Conference^ propounds  a. simple- condition, of international. accord   -                       -,that. all nations  should join in  an undertaking to  refrain from, aggression against  their neighbours.&quot; The hope  of Great Britain is to secure this  -undertaking-from all the-nations&quot;of  Europe without,  exception.   It  is essential that the  division of.  the European  nations into  two mighty  camps                        .  -10  -
should&apos; not c-e pel^t&amp;^^d^o^ &quot;tMSPp-w. fears on  the wart of  thevictor -nations^-or secret , rejects of revenge- on the part  ofthe vanquished.- It is essential that the rivalries generatod bytho emancipation of. nations since the war should he averted, f yk mthe paths of international hatred and turned to those ofoo-co-operation and good-rwill.  It is  essential ,  also,, that  the conflict-between rival social and economic  systems which  theRussian revolution has so greatly intensifiedshould not accentuate the fears of  nations  and culminate  in international war-/-     If the conditions created In Europe by these  new rivalries-and. divisions  are not wisely handled by co--crperaiion &quot;betweenthe Powers, peace can only be short-lived,  and Europe will  beplunged by the  coming gen oration  into another fierce  struggle,. -which may overwhelm its  civilisation in even completer  ruin anddespair.-  It is  for the  lilies, to  whom the war  has bequeatheda position of vast responsibility And far-spreading power,  te :stand together  against this menace,  ,t0 combine their influence in averting it,; and to rr-ke sure-  that in the has? t and  will of. their own peoples,, who fought- and bled for civilization,the cause of civilization prevails-. Great  Britain, therefore, .offers  \0 Prance and Italy her  intimate and earnest&apos; co-opera-* -tion in building up a great  system.of European  accord,which will put  the maintenance  of peace between  nations and the reduction. of national  armaments in.  the  forefront  of&apos;&apos;Its aims; for  only-  so in their  belief;  will Europe secure thatsense of  safety amongst  nations,  great  ---n-d  small,  which throughthe many - c enturies  of its  political history it  has jnevcryet - attained.   If the Economic  Conference  is agreed to, itwill create  an. -opportunity-:/for the  gr&apos;e&quot;at Allied Powers -France,  the British. Empire  and  Italy^-to inaugurate an eraof peace, in- their own Continent  whose  war-sodden&apos;fields record           - -     -          .....c a  history -more terrible  than that- of any other continent &apos; in modern tines;
