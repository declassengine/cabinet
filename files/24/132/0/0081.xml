MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  WAR.     1. The Geddes Committee recommend that Army Estimates should  be reduced by m20,* and brought down to  a  maximum  of  m55.   Concurrently they recommend the reduction of the Army by (i) 28 battalions, and (ii) 50,000 men.     2. The sum of  m.20, however, bears no relation to the reductions of 28 battalions and of 50,000 men.     I have tried to ascertain by correspondence with the Chancellor of the exchequer to what extent the 50,000 men included the 28 battalions, or whether the 28 battalionswere in addition to the 50,000 men.  The only  reply  I  received was that  there  was some overlapping  between these two  figures, but I have not been able to ascertain what it is.     3.&apos; I have also been informed that the  Geddes Committee had  three methods-of arriving at the  m20 reductions.   Again I have asked to see the calculations by whichthey arrive at their figures, but this also has been refused.     The Churchill Committee,  to whom I reported these facts, themselves asked to besupplied with the  information  by the Geddes Committee, with what result I do not know.     4. Before,  however, stating  my proposals, as modified after discussion with theChurchill  Committee,   for  reducing  the   Army in general  accordance  with  the geddes  report,  I  am  obliged,  in  view of the  advice  given me by the  GeneralStaff (CP. 3619) to warn the  Cabinet that  our liabilities  abroad are  such thatit is not possible, without grave risks, to reduce the fighting strength of the Army.  Itmay be that administrative economies are possible, and these I pledge myself to  effect,but it is for the Cabinet to decide whether,  having regard to the financial position ofthe country, the financial and economic risks, if expenditure is maintained at or aboutthe level-proposed  by me  to the Geddes Committee (see page 57 of their Report) aregreater than the military risks which will be run if reductions in the fighting strengthof the Army are  made, either  upon  the basis proposed  by the Geddes  Committee orupon the basis which I will now outline.     5. In preparing sketch estimates for 1922-23 it has been necessary to leave aside the special expenditure which will -necessarily be incurred  in bringing the Army downto its  new  strength  and distribution, a task which  cannot  possibly  be  completed before  1st April  next.   The  Geddes  Committee  in  their report recognize that non-effective charges involved  in disbandments, &amp;c, will require special treatment, and thesame applies to such effective charges as the cost of sea and land transport involved inthe  process of redistribution and the maintenance during part of the year 1922-23 ofthe officers and men marked for  reduction.  These may be  considered terminal charges of the old-scale Army, which it  would be confusing to  mix with the maintenance ofthe  new  establishment, and it  has so far been impossible to frame any estimates ofthem.  &apos;     Eliminating for purposes of comparison these as well as the terminal  charges of thewar, the Army Estimates I now propose show a total of   m60^, including  m7 for the                 * Figures are in millions of pounds (i.&apos;m) unless otherwise shown.

This figure  compares with  m75, includiug  mil for the Middle East,proposed to the Geddes Committee, and with a total of&apos; m97,* including . m24 for theMiddle  East, provided (and to be provided) in 1921.-22.

The reductions in the cavalry will amount,with the four regiments disbanded during this year, to nine regiments ; it may be thatit  will be  possible to accomplish  the reduction without actual disbandment, but theecpuivalent of nine regiments will disappear.    * Viz., fml06 in  the original Army Estimates (of which   m24 for the Middle East), .fm7 in the supplementary Establishment of November last for the Strike charges and at least  m5 yet to be providedby Supplementary Estimate for Irish expenditure and arrear Sea Transport  charges, less  m21 for -warterminal chargeH.  *

The retention of two more pairs of line battalions than  proposed by the  geddes committee  obviates  the necessity  of sending  two  battalions  of  Guards  to  theMediterranean.    8. The duties of the troops abroad are of course to  garrison the Empire; those ofthe troops at home are-     (i.) To provide reliefs and drafts for the troops abroad.    (ii.) To provide a striking force.    (iii.) To maintain law and order&apos;at home.    &apos; (i.) Drafts.-For this purpose I am satisfied that the Cardwell  system which  has-worked well for  50 years, is the most efficient and least expensive.    (ii.) Striking  Force. The proposed  units necessarily maintained  at home will beorganized into a striking force as follows :     One  infantry  division  and one  cavalry  division  complete with personnel  andequipment would be capable of mobilization and ready for embarkation  at home stationswithin 15 days.  .  A second infantry division would be made up after the necessary delay&apos;  of about months  required  for  the  special enlistment of some 4-5,000  technical personnel.Later on, when the Militia is  formed, it may be possible  to find this personnel from  theMilitia and consequently at an earlier date.-  .  A  third and a fourth infantry  division would be complete  in all arms after  4months.   Special enlistment would be required for these divisions also.    A few units would be left to form the nucleus of a fifth infantry division.    This striking  force compares with the 1914 Expeditionary Force as follows : -    In 1914 we had 1\ cavalry  divisions and 6 infantry divisions, which with non-divisional  troops, amounting  to  160,000  men and 486 guns  ready for active servicewithin 10 da)^s of mobilization.   (I make no mention of the further 5 Regular  divisionsformed in 1914 by withdrawing  nearly all the  Regular  battalions  from India,  theMediterranean and the Colonies.)    It is to be  remembered that  in  1914 we had  a Special Reserve of 55,000 and anArmy Reserve of  146,000.  To-day we have no Militia and only 65,000 in the Reserve.    Provision  is  accordingly made  in my draft estimates for  ml  for  the Militia.Its objects are threefold     (a.) To provide the technical men not available in  the Army for  the 2nd, 3rd  and           4th  divisions of the striking force.    (6.) To provide a body of infantry available in times of civil disturbance.    (c.) To provide drafts for the divisions of the  striking force.    (iii.) Laiv and Order. The Forces.in this country will  be constituted as follows : -      (i,) By those Guards and Line  battalions not required by the 4 divisions of the            striking force, viz., 5 Guards, 10 Line.    (ii.) By the Militia when reconstituted.  The  ml  taken in the present estimates           represent  the cost  of  perhaps  30,000  men ;  the  number  cannot  be           accurately given till the terms of service have been worked out.     9.  Reductions in the  higher staffs  will  be made by adjustments  between  theEastern Command and the London District, and by making North Ireland an area.     10; I turn from the personnel of the  Army to its material and equipment after theproposed economies have been effected.     (9671-2)
     Full mobilization equipment and war reserves will be maintained for the 1 cavalry division and  5 infantry  divisions, together with  the  necessary non-divisional  troops, which will be the ultimate composition of the striking force.    &apos; In addition, mobilization&apos; equipment and  war reserves will be  kept for a  second cavalry division and 15 infantry divisions, together with appropriate non-divisional and lines of communication units, in the following items :  -I  I      Guns, carriages, ammunition wagons and limbers.          Super-heavy guns on railway and  siege mountings.          Machine guns.          Rifles, bayonets, swords and lances.          Accoutrements.          Harness and saddlery.II.         Ammunition.     The  extra cost of storing this equipment is 200,000/. over the cost  of storing  the equipment for 1 cavalry division and 5 infantry divisions ; these  stores would fetch very little if sold and are  irreplaceable, except after a long period.     In excess of these requirements, we shall retain all guns (but  without limbers and wagons),  machine guns, rifles and bayonets  which  can  be  stored in  existing accommo- idation without extra expense.     11.  The  following table  shows the cost  of  the Territorial  Army in 1914-15, 1921-22  and  under present proposals : Estimates, 1914-15.	Strength, Establishment, 1st January, 1914.	Estimates, 1921-22.	Strength, 1st January, 1922. Proposed Establishment.	Present Estimates. 3,369,000 ( (p. 209 of Estimates.) L	252,000 316,000	1  7,573,000 1	187,000 183,000	j  5,570,000 .     These figures  include  the cost of  ammunition and  stores  as well  as cashexpenditure.     The reductions now proposed amount to  mlf, and are made up chiefly  by notraising  certain non-divisional units, by reducing artillery to a 4-gun basis, by reducing/the  establishment  of infantry officers  to  75 per  cent, and the rank and file  peaceestablishment of a battalion to 600, and by reducing staff and administrative personnel.     At the same time, it is proposed to lay the  foundation  of a Territorial Air service by raising  half an anthair group (about 3,500 officers and men) within the  TerritorialArmy.     It is to be noticed that the rank and file of the Territorial Army to-day is made upby men under varying terms of enlistment, as follows :          Men on 4-year  enlistments...     ...     ...    ...      ...     65,000         Men on 3-year  enlistments ...     ...     ...    ...      ...     24,500         Men on 2-year  enlistments ...     ...     ...    ...      ...     4,000         Men on 1-year  enlistments ...     ...     ...    ...     ...     34,000Total strength    ............   127,500     The proposed reductions will undoubtedly cause resentment, which may immediately be felt by the refusal of the 1 and 2-year men whose periods  are about to expire tore-engage, and  we should be left with a Territorial Army with  a war establishment of300,000 and a peace strength of less than 100,000.     The proposals provide for  the maintenance of  14 Yeomanry regiments and  twoScouts regiments as cavalry, all  other Yeomanry regiments being converted  into otherarms or disbanded.     The total cost of these  16 cavalry regiments is 237,000/.     .12. The reductions thus proposed amount, on the very rough estimates which time has  permitted  me to make,  to approximately  ml 5^-  beyond my proposals to the geddes committee, but it is clear that many of these estimates will require revision, and some of

The figure of  m60^ might be reduced to  m59, if a recovery from germany of  ml^ for  the  cost  of the Army  of  Occupation  were  secured  and credited  toArmy Votes.                                                                      L. W.-E.THE WAR OFFICE,       Uh February, 1922.the proposed cuts will not leave us with a properly balanced force.   I therefore proposethat a cut of  ml 5 should be sanctioned, and a ration fixed accordingly, leaving  meabout  m-1, on the basis  of these very rough estimates, with which  1 can  round offcorners.     13. This, however, I am aware, is   m5 less than the proposals of the geddes committee.     To reduce the Army further without making corresponding reductions in our com-commitments, would be to run very grave risk ;  there is  one method that occurs  to  me bywhich  the further  m5 reduction could  be secured, viz.,  by limiting our  liabilitiesin Iraq by  withdrawing  to Basra,  or,  better still, by evacuating  Iraq  as soon as our responsibilities towards King Feisal  permit.  Although Iraq is within the sphere ofthe  Colonial Secretary, our occupation,  whether by Air  Forces  or Indian  troops,constitutes a contingent liability upon the Army which it is impossible to ignore.  GreatBritain could not allow  either  Air  Forces or Indian  troops to lack support in anemergency.     Withdrawal  to  Basra would  make   possible  a  further saving  of  some  m5and at the same time would actually  mean a decrease in military liability.     14. The picture of the Army as it will  be  after  the  Estimates are  reduced toa normal  mGO-g- is sketched upon the following assumptions :      (i.) That increases in non-effective charges due to pensions or other  compensation           necessitated by compulsory retirements are borne on a separate vote.    (ii.) That the  rates of wages and course of prices and of the Indian and German           exchange, are  as stated  in  Section III. of the War Office  Notes  on the           questions  raised by  the Geddes report which were  submitted to Mr.           churchill&apos;s Committee.   (iii.) That after April,  1922, in  Palestine, and October, 1922,  in Iraq, all British           Army personnel (other than officers and  men temporarily lent to, and paid           by, the Air Ministry) will be withdrawn from those areas.   (iv.) That the  Admiralty place orders to  the value  of 900,O00Z. with Woolwich.           If this assumption  is not realized and  if  the Admiralty orders fall to           650,000/., as was anticipated as a result of the Geddes  recommendations           relating to the  Navy, a further   m^- must be added to Navy Estimates,           failing  which the Army Estimates will have  to be increased to provide the           necessary work.     15. To  sum up, whereas Vote A for  1921-22 stood at 341,000, falling to 235,000,the strength to which  we  shall work  in  1922-23  is  153,000,  and, as explained inparagraph 2, Army  Estimates  as  compared with  those  of 1921-22 will  stand asfollows :
