The Allied Powers consider that the resumption of inter-  national trade throughout Europe and the development of the  resources of all countries are.necessary to  increase the  volume of productive employment and to relieve the widespread  suffering of the European peoples.  A united.effort by the  stronger Powers is necessary to remedy the paralysis of the  European system.  This effort must include the removal of all  obstacles in the way of trade, the provision of substantial  credits for the weaker countries, and the oo-operation of all,  nations in the restoration of normal prosperity.       The  Allied powers consider that the fundamental conditions  upon which alone this effort oan be made with hope of success  may be broadly stated as follows:-       (1)  nations can claim no right to dictate to each other       regarding the principles on which they are to regulate       their system of ownership., internal economy and govern-       ment.   It is for every nation to choose for itself the
system which it prefers in this respect.

(2) Before, however, foreign capital can be made available to assist a country, foreign investors must be assured that their property and the rights will be respected, and the fruits of their enterprise secured to them.

(3) The sense of security cannot be re-established unless the Governments of countries desiring foreign credit freely undertake:

(a) That they will recognise all public debts and obligations which have been or may be undertaken or guaranteed by the State, by municipalities, or by other public bodies, as well as the obligation to restore or compensate all foreign interests for loss or damage caused to them when property has been confiscated or withheld.

(b) That they will establish a legal and juridical system which sanctions and endurces commercial and other contracts with impartiality.

(4) An adequate means of exchange must be available, and, generally there must be financial and currency conditions which offer sufficient security for trade.

(5) All nations should undertake to refrain from propaganda subversive of order and the establised political system in other countries than their own.

(6) All countries should join in an undertaking temrefrain from aggression against their neighbours.

If, in order to secure the conditions necessary for the development of the trade in Russia, the Russian Government demands official recognition, the Allied Powers will no prepared to accord such recognition only if the Russian Government accepts the foregoing stipulations.
