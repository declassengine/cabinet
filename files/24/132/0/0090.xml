[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;? Governmentreturned to tho Foreign Office if not required for official use.]     CIRCULATED TO THE CABINET.             (1)i, and shouldbeSSgALIi^^Meraorandum concerning the amendments to be made inrHR F 1   ^iie  British draft treaty between France and GreatBritain.Communicated by the French  Ambassador to  the MarquessCurzon of Kedleston, February  let.  1922.pSLATION)     The French Government  have  studied with the keen-est interest the  draft  treaty which was nanded by theBritish Prime Minister  to Monsieur Briand at Cannes.     The French Government  desire in the first place to express their  appreciation of the sentiments whichinspired Mr. Lloyd George  in drafting this text, which contains proof that  the British  Government understand the legitimate preoccupation of  France in regard toher security, and bears the mark of deep feelings of friendship towards our  country.     The draft treaty further shows that the BritishGovernment realises  that the safety of Great britain is closely bound  up  with that of France and that any threat by Germany against French territory is equallydirected against  England.     The draft of the preamble preceding the text ofthe Treaty shows  that the memory of the common sacrifice-benefices made by the two nations In the course of theglorious struggle which they maintained side by sideduring the whole  duration of the most cruel of wars isas keen in England as in France,     The French Government  desire to express theirthanks to the British Government for having epontan-eously defined the spirit in which the proposed pact,                                                should
     1 *    Reciprocity clause.          The first of these amendments concerns theaddition of a clause of reciprocity.     In the opinion of the French Government the first                                           reasonpact should be drawn up in such a manner that theFrench Government have nothing to add to the motivesso strikingly set out in the English text as justify-ing the conclusion of the treaty between the twocountriest     Monsieur Briand wished to give Mr. Lloyd Georgethe opportunity of formulating his viev/s on the treatyunder negotiation by asking him to draw up a drafttext.   The French Government accordingly consideredthat it was preferable to await the British text beforepreparing a draft of their own.   The viev/s of theFrench Government in this respect had moreover been explained to the British prime Minister in the memoran-dum handed to him on January 8th.   The French Govern-ment have since received the English proposals andhave carefully examined them.   As stated above, theyhave learnt with great satisfaction that the Britishtext already presents satisfactory guarantees againsta German aggression.   The spirit in which the Englishtext has been drafted justifies the French Governmentin hoping that the amendments which they considerdesirable to^ introduce will be accepted in their en-tirety by the British Government.
reason for such a clause is the necessity of givingGermany some public demonstration of the solidarity of france  and England in the event of a German aggression.It must be understood beyond the Rhine that if Englandregards an attack on the Eastern frontier of france as a threat to herself France would feel similarlythreatened by an attack on England,     It is no less necessary, as the British Govern-ment with their clear Intuition of the sentiments ofthe French nation will also realise that in a treatyof such importance for the relations of the twocountries both of them should be placed on a footingof perfect equality.   Moreover, although Englandderives from her insular position and her naval powers feeling of security against any German attack notaimed at her through France and Belgium,, so 1 rapid isthe evolution of armaments that it is not impossibleto foresee other forms of attack, for instance, by air,  which might rob Great Britain of the advantages which she derives from her natural defences.     The French Government are convinced that theBritish Government^  on weighing these considerations,will raise no objection to the addition of a clausestipulating that France should place herself at the                                              side
\side of England just as the latter will  place her-self at the side of France in the event  of a german aggression.     2 j   Nature of the aggression.     Article I of the British draft provides thatGreat Britain shall place herself immediately  atthe side of France with her naval, military and airforces in the case of a direct and unprovoked  attack by Germany &quot;against the soil of France&quot;.   It  seemsto the French Government that this text  would  restrictin a dangerous manner, and one certainly not corres-ponding to the intentions of the British Government,the circumstances in which the assistance of GreatBritain is contemplated.     On a strict interpretation of the words it wouldbe necessary before the casus foederis could arisethat the German attack should reach French territory.If that were so France would be exposed, beforeBritish intervention supervened, to undergo a newinvasion with its terrible consequences.   Now theremay be aggression before the attack on French  soilactually mat er iali se s.                                               Do  &apos;
              r 5 -      Do not a declaration of war, en ultimatumaddressed to trance, or  even a  concentration  oftroops in the direction  of her  frontier,  constitute an aggression?  Cannot an aggression  take  placeby sea or in the air? If British  intervention wereforthcoming only when the French  frontier was crossed by a German army there would be a rj.sk of  mat-erially weakening the safety which France shouldderive from the treaty which is the subject of thepresent negotiations.      To avoid all doubt in this  respect  the  Frenchgovernment propose, therefore,  to suppress  the word&quot;territory&quot; and to adopt the formula &quot;in  the  caseof a direct and unprovoked aggression .by  Germanyagainst. France&quot;? an expression  which is quite clear and self-sufficing,         3o Articles 42  - 44 of the Treaty  of Peace      Article 2 of the British  draft contains a clause which is highly appreciated by the Frenchgovernment; its object is defined in the  preamble.According to this preamble tho  High ContractingParties consider that the measures of security con-tained in articles 42, 43, and  44 of the  Treatyof Versailles mav not provide sqtfictently  for thedefence of the vital common interests, nor  for themaintenance of peace in  Western Europe. Articles42 and 43 of the Treaty  of Versailles, in fact,create a zone on tlie Eastern frontier of  Prance                                      in
in which Germany can neither construct forblfica-tions, nor maintain or concentrate troops, norprepare for mobilisation.      Article 2 of the British draft treaty isrightly founded on the idea that in certain cases it would be indispensable for the security of france  and of England not to wait until germany had effectively violated the provisions of articles42 and 43, and that it would be necessary to takepreventive measures as soon as it were evident thatGermany was preparing to violate the said articles.It is for this reason that the British text lays down that in such  cases the two governments will consult together.  The same thing applies in thecase of any doubt  arising as to the interpretation of articles 42 - 44.      The French government could not do  otherwise than agree to so necessary a precaution,  and they therefore accept article 2 of the British draft.      The French government consider,however, thatthis draft contains an important omission, inasmuch as it does not provide for any concerted  Franco-British action in  the gravest contingency of all,namely the effective violation by Germany ofarticles 42 and 43.  Such a violation shouldconstitute an immediate  &quot;casus foederis&quot;, sincearticles 42 and 43 were  specifically inserted inthe treaty of peace in order to prevent Francefrom being the object of a surprise attack,exposing her once  again  to sudden devastation at                                          the
the hands of the enemy.      It seems that there has been some misapprehension-hension in London concerning the hearing of this request, to which expression was given in theFrench draft handed by the French ambassador to theSecretary of State.  It appears to be feared that france desires to bring the &quot;casus foederis&quot; into play even in the event of legitimate policingoperations or simple military preparations.      Such is not the idea of the French government.A brief examination of the different cases whichmight arise will suffice to make clear to theBritish government the meaning of the clause in-serted in the French text in the first line ofthe new article 2.      Take the following illustrations      Germany invites tho consent of the alliedpowers to some provisional infraction of articles42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles; -for instanceshe wishes to send police into the demilitarised zone in order to suppress unrest. In such a case there would be no violation or even a threat ofviolation. If permission is given, the question doesnot arise. If the Allies refuse permission and if germany gives sign of  an intention to disregardsuch refusal, then there is a threat of, violation,and in accordance with paragraph 2 of article 2 ofthe French draft England end France must consult together. If Germany actually disregards such re-refusal, then there is clearly a case of studied ag-progression on her part, and the &quot;casus foederis&quot;comes -into play.      France and England are informed of certain
certain acts of the German Government which  indicatethat they are preparing to violate  Articles  42 and 43;for Instance the Reichstag vote  credits for  the  con-structlon of fortresses in the demilitarised zone, ortroops are concentrated in unusual  numbers in thevicinity of the zone in circumstances which  gave riseto the belief that the German Government  intend  tosend them into it.   In such a case there is noviolation of Articles 42 and 43  and consequentlyno aggression and the casus foederis does not arise.On the other hand there is a threat of violation and,in accordance with paragraph 2 of the French article , which reproduces the English  Article 2, the Frenchand British governments must consult together and examine the situation.     Germany deliberately violates  the provisions  ofArticles 42 and 43, which implies that she has nottroubled to invite the consent of the allies in  order,for instance, to send police forces into  the neutral zone, or that she has sent in forces other than  thosewhich she has been authorised to send.    This deliberateviolation constitutes a hostile act in the terms ofArticle 44.   The French Government are  justified,in virtue of the weighty considerations which led  tothe drafting of Articles 42 and 43, and to whichallusion is made above, in asking that  such  violationshould constitute an act of aggression, under penaltyof finding herself exposed to the invasion of french territory, since the protection afforded  herby the Treaty would no longer exist.   This  is  the                                                case
case contemplated by paragraph 1 of  the  FrenchArticle 2;   To make such a violation an act  of aggression under the Anglo-French treaty would bethe best way of preventing it from taking place.     It is unnecessary to recall that under the termsof Article 2 of the English draft, reproduced in para-graph 2 of the French Article 2, each time that doubtarises as to the interpretation of Articles 42 and43 the two governments shall consult together.  Englandhas no reason to fear any surprise in the operationof the casus foederis in the event of a  violation of these articles:  it is only a clear case  of viola-tion that the French Government have in  mind, asthey-consider that such violation would  constitute a grave danger for the safety of France  against whichit is indispensable to be forearmed.          ENTENTE BETWEEN THE, GENERAL STAFFS.     The French Government consider  that the  obligationassumed by the two governments to assist each other in the case of a German aggression against eitherwould only be regarded seriously by Germany if thenecessary measures were taken beforehand to rendereffective the eventual co-operation, expressly  con-templated in the Treaty, between the military, navaland air forces of the two countries.     This is so true that in 1911, although the Britishand French governments had no mutual obligations,the two staffs had been authorised to conclude a                                             virtual
                  do)virtual agreement.     It is recorded in the minutes that  in the  courseof a conference between General rjubail and general wilson &quot;essential questions were elucidated andindispensable preparatory measures were  decided on  inadvance to ensure,  if It ever becflme necessary,  the effective co-operation of the joint armies under themost favourable conditions possible&quot;.  Agreement had actually been reached between the two General Staffson the following points:  (1) The composition of theBritish army to be landed in France;  (2)  transport by sea;  (3) disembarkation on French soil and eccommo-dation in temporary camps; (4) railway transport;(5) zone of concentration, date of completion of trans-port;  (6.) supplies.     In September 1912 an exchange of notes between sir Edward Grey and Monsieur Paul Cambon laid downclearly that the two governments, in the case of oneor other having serious reason to fear aggression orany incident threatening the general peace, would examine &quot;whether they should act in concert to preventthe aggression or to safeguard peace&quot;.   In the eventof their deeming such joint action necessary, &quot;theywould  examine the plans drawn up by the two General Staffs and then decide what action should be taken on them&quot;.     An understanding between, the French and EnglishGeneral Staffs is therefore nothing new or impossible.If such an understanding was considered necessarywhen co-operation between the two governments wasoptional and uncertain, how could it be otherwise                                               when
when co-operation is expressly provided  for  incertain specific eventualities?     It is also not out of place to recall thatin 1920 a conference,  held at Cologne  betweenMarshal Foch, Marshal  Wilson and General Maglinse,fixed the reinforcements which French, British and belgian armies, weald  furnish to the armies  ofoccupation after decision by each government,  &quot;inthe event of reinforcement being rendered necessary by any threat or any act on the part of  Germany&quot;.Seeing that a military understanding on  this pointalready exists, the absence of any similar corollaryin the treaty of defensive alliance now  under ne-gotiation would place  France in a less good  position than at present.     It is true that it is for the governments todecide in what circumstances there shall be  military co-operation-operation between the two nations.  But if  suchdecision is to be taken rapidly, the speed with  whichit can be carried out  depends essentially on the pre-paratory measures adopted.   It is necessary to  decide in advance what troops at the outset should  be moved from one quarter or another, either to the base  onthe Rhine or, after evacuation of the  Rhineland, tothe frontier line, in order to cover the movements of the main allied forces.   In the absence  of anysuch arrangement the General Staffs would be obligedto concert their plans under the threat  of the enemy,and under conditions which would involve a risk  of                                             rendering
rendering British co-operation ineffective  during  what might he the most critical period of  all, namely the initial hostilities.   It is equally  essential  todecide in advance, as was done in 1911, the methodsof transporting,  of accommodating and of  supplying the British troops.   An understanding between  thegeneral staffs is therefore indispensable.     6.   The French government are of course perfect-ly aware that Groat Britain&apos;s military strength intime of peace bears no relation to the immense  power which she can develop in time of war.  But here again it is necessary that measures should  be takenin advance in order to utilise her resources to thebest advantage.   It is not a question of laying down definitely and rigidly in a military convention the number and character of the units available, but rather, by constant collaboration between the twogeneral staffs on lines adaptable to  any  change inthe military organisation of each country,  of deter-mining the resources which, if needs  be,  would  beavailable for the common defence.     This collaboration will be all the more..necessaryin that the two general staffs will,  it seems,  haveto provide not only for Franco-British co-operation,but also for the co-operation of the  combined forces with the army of Belgium.   The defensive militaryconvention concluded by France with Belgium and.thetreaty which the British government is in process  of negotiating with the Belgian government can only comeeffectively into play if measures are taken to                                         co-ordinate           k
 co-ordinate the carrying out of these several obliga- tions, which have all the same object, namely the defence  of France, Belgium and England against a German aggression which could not be directed against any  one  of tho three without immediate throat to the other two.     If  the British government would prefer not to&quot;insert the provisions in regard to collaboration between  the general staffs in the actual text of the treaty,  the French government would be ready to agree that these provisions should be embodied in an ex- change of notes to be annexed to the.treaty and signed simultaneously with it;  such letters to be published at the same time as the main treaty,                 5o  Duration*     In  their draft the British government had limited  the duration of the pact to 10 years, re- newable  with the consent of both parties,     The French government hold this period to be insufficient.   In the first place it is shorter than the period of occupation of the Rhineland and covers a period during which such occupation itself makes any German aggression difficult..   Moreover if so short a duration were given to the treaty, Germany  might well conceive the hope that at the end  of the 10 years, the pact would not be renewed; and  the  nationalist elements would be able to propagate the idea of an attack on France at the end  of that period.   Will Germany in 10 years time not  be more redoubtable than she is today?  It. is                                    undeniable.
undeniable.   It is :Cor that reason that the  guaranteetreaties which were offered to Prance in 1919 by theBritish and American governments contained no clauselimiting their duration.    Nor, if the information given by the press is correct, is there to be anylimit of duration to the treaty of guarantee  nowunder negotiation between England and Belgium.     The French government do not believe that thereis any need for them to insist that the Franco-British treaty should contain no clause of lirnita-tion.   The character which it is their idea  to give to this treaty, namely a declaration of the solidar-ity uniting the French and British governments andof their resolve to remain united, is incompatible with any time limit.   The two governments will thus be able, on the expiry of the stipulated period,freely to re-examine the clauses of the treaty andto invest it by such examination with fresh force.     The French government had at first thought itdesirable, in order to re-affirm more clearly the friendship between the two countries, to prolongthe duration to 30 years.   If the British governmentfind this period too long, it could be fixed  at 20years, it being understood and expressly statedthat it was renewable by common accord.,         6.   General understanding.     The British draft treaty has as its object theprotection of France and England&apos;against a direct attack on the part of Germany, and sets out the                                  circumstances
circumstances  in which the two countries would co-operate for their common defence with their military.naval  and air  forces.     The French government, since the inception ofthe discussions, have never wavered from the viewthat the treaty should not &quot;be restricted to that object, but should also be a clear demonstration ofa general understanding between the two countries for the maintenance  of peace.    In the opinion of the French government, it isin effect not  merely a question of guaranteeing thesecurity of France and of England against a directaggression on  the part of Germany,   The real aim off the government of the Republic, is to consolidate..peace  by establishing on a solid basis the lastingunion  of France and  England..  .     So- long as the  elements, who have an interestin modifying or destroying the order of things setup under the treaty  of peace, can cling to the hopeof dividing France and England, the peace of europe will not rest  on any firm foundation.   If Germanyknows  that she will  have to meet the united force-Of France and  England, ready in addition to co-operate with Belgium, it will not be by a direct attack on one  of these three countries that she will seek to disturb the  peace.     It is of  course understandable that France and england should each-  have their own point of viewwhere  important international problems are con-cerned.   But  when these problems are calculated                                         to
to endanger the peace,  if Prance and England consult together a conversation a deux will surely lead themto a mutual adjustment  of their views,  provided theyput the general interest in the foreground.     The French government consider that afterproviding for the most  pressing need, namely the contingency of a direct attack by Germany againstone or the other, the treaty should logicallydemonstrate to the world the determination of Franceand England to remain closely united for the main-tenance of peace by engaging to consult together, inthe event of peace being threatened, as to themethods ensuring a rapid, just and pacific settle-ment of the:dispute,  and the maintenance of the treaties which they have signed.     An agreement of  this kind does not- exclude any agreement embracing other countries, any more thanit is rendered superogatory by the existence of thecovenant of the League of Nations.   Its object isto hasten peaceful solutions in the light of theeffect which common action on the part of England andFrance will always have on the opinion of the world.     The British government think with reason thatthe economic restoration of Europe cannot be achievedunless the necessary precautions are taken to acts of aggression between co-terminous states.   TheFrench government share this view, but they thinkthat this object will be achieved more speedily if France and England declare beforehand that .theyare resolved to pursue it in concert.     It goes without saying that the co-operation  &apos; .of other countries for the maintenance of peace is                                          also
also highly desirable, but unity of purpose alreadydetermined between Prance and England is the best wayof encouraging such co-operation.   The will of thetwo countries to arrive at this unity, if it is expressly and publicly proclaimed as a lasting resolvwill discourage ill-intentioned and hostile elementsand, in accustoming the two countries to a mutualtrust in one another, will facilitate the reconcilia-tion of their views.     The French government therefore attach the ut-rnost importance to the  inclusion   of  theclause which figures  in article 4. of the Franco-British draft, the effect of which will be to ensure a united policy between the two countries whenever the general peace is  endangered.     The French government would however be willing,should the British government make their assent sub-ject to such condition, to embody this clause inseparate letters to be exchanged, signed and publish-ed simultaneously with the treaty.   This procedure would emphasize especially the difference between atreaty which provides for the military co-operationof two countries in a defensive war, and a -purelypolitical agreement which provides for co-ordinating the action of the two governments on all occasions when peace is threatened.     Such are the reasons for which the Frenchgovernment have thought it necessary to submit tothe British government certain modifications whichthey consider it desirable to make in the Englishdraft, in order to bring it more into line with the -                                        policy
policy followed by the two  governments,  and  soeffectively to contribute to  the  establishment  onsolid and durable foundations of  the  friendly and peaceful collaboration of the two nations.
