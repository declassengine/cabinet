IR,   10.35 p,m. 20th January, 1922.No. 27.Most Urgent.     Your telegram 21.     1.   Advice I have given to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment is my final considered opinion after full dis-cussion with those most capable of advising me.   I amcertain that my proposals if immediately accepted will prove the basis of a lasting settlement in Egypt:  ifthey are rejected, I foresee nothing but a rule ofrepression driving us to annexation of the country which far from solving any problem of governmentwould greatly increase our difficulties.     Responsible Egyptian opinion has been thoroughlysounded and is entirely with me.     2.   I may perhaps not have sufficiently explain-ed.     (a)  That it is not a question of obtaining orfailing to obtain a Sarwat ministry, but of succeedingor failing in attempt to carry on government of Egyptby constitutional and legal means.     (b)  That existence of a prospect of some suchmodus Vivendi being reached as I am recommending has enabled me for the time being not only to consolidate.                                        those
those elements in Egypt which honestly desire a settle-ment hut greatly to weaken influence of Zaghloulistfollowing, and even to win over several of its leading members.   I must beg His Majesty&apos;s Government tobanish any idea that if this policy is rejected, therewill be any body of Egyptians of whatever party class or creed upon whose support we shall be able to rely.     (c)   The character which my action in deportingZaghloul will wear will depend on the spirit of mynext immediate action.   It was designed and has to a remarkable degree been interpreted as being necessary preliminary to a policy of conciliation.     (d)   That any increased power of resistance toour views which Egyptian ministers might acquire underproposed arrangements as compared with their pre-                         rdecessors under pre-war regime, will be mainly duenot to formal abolition of protectorate, but to theintroduction of parliamentary institutions.   I donot conceive that Kis Majesty&apos;s Government would beprepared to take up an attitude opposed to establish-ment of such institutions pending the acceptance of.a treaty.   Quite apart from obvious difficulty on general grounds of defending such an attitude, it isto be observed that independence of ministers vis-a-vis British authorities, has been increasing unmis-takeably in recent years under pressure of publicopinion as manifested in press and through less order-ly channels,   There is considerable ground for hoping that cautiously formulated parliamentary institutions                                            such
such as are contemplated by Sarwat and Ms friends  maytend to clarify and moderate this pressure,.     3.   I trust, that His  Majesty&apos;s Government fully appreciate that Egypt in the past has been administer-ed by Egyptians with advice and assistance of a verysmall &quot;body of Englishmen whose work has been renderedpossible only by the good relations we have been ableto maintain.   If those relations are destroyed,machinery of government must break down and we shall he quite unable to restore it.   It must not be sup-posed that English have even in most normal and peace-ful times attempted to govern country except as a smallleaven dependent on largest measure of co-operation byEgyptians who have,at all times held great majority of administrative posts.   Strained political situation oflast three years has brought these Englishmen to theend of their resources and they will be powerless in face of situation which would arise on rejection of mypr es ent propo sais.     4.   Time is a matter of vital importance;  atpresent counsels of moderation and conciliation pre-vail based on hope for near future.   This situation will not continue and any prolonged indications ofhesitation on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill seriously undermine my influence.   Departure  toEngland at this juncture of two advisers could not fall at once to have same effect.   Amos ClaytonPatterson and Dowson have nothing to add to opinionsthey have already expressed.   They are in complete                                           iaccord with me.     5.   I am prepared of course to give Your Lordship                                           fullest
fullest information by telegram on any specific point,but you could look for no better informant than Mr.Selby who should reach England on Sunday:  he will beable to give you an accurate and up to date explanation of whole political situation in this country.     6.   I must ask Your Lordship to trust me that my &apos;recommendations are not based upon an opportunistdesire for immediate peace,  but are inspired by a care-ful consideration of best interests of two countries.

Decypher.     Lord Allenby (Cairo).                               20th January,  1S22.       D.   1,20 a,m. 21st January, 1922.       R.   8.30 a.rn. 21st January, 1922.No. -.     Personal.     Conversations with Sarwat and Sidki Pashas showthat proposed Egyptian ministry share my view aboutreservations, and that pending conclusion of negotia-tions thereon, they have no intention of alteringactual state of affairs in the matter touching thosesubjects.   They have signed proces verbal of these conversations in which they explicitly agree inter alia that no foreign loans shall he concluded or foreign civil officials above certain rank orofficers in the army or police shall be appointedwithout my consent.     I propose adding to my letter to the Sultan inparagraph 13 after &quot;spirit&quot; the words &quot;and with fullfreedom of discussion on both sides&quot;.   This will .show that our hands are not tied and will also enableSarwat to meet a criticism which he anticipates.     If protectorate is abolished and independencesecured, we must rely upon the presence of troops inthe country as a sanction to compel Egyptian govern-ment to meet us.   But this is our sole effective                                          sanction
sanction even now;   the protectorate without troops  isof no value end double guarantee ox protectorate and troops is of no greater practical value as againstEgyptian government than the single guarantee oftroopsj  while on the other hand maintenance ofprotectorate means a hostile Egypt.     Subject to observations In paragraph 2 (D)  ofmy telegram No, 27, it may be said that effect of my proposals would be a return to pre-war conditionsminus Turkish suzerainty but with the new advantage to us that we should have staked out a claim inrespect of subjects covered by reservations.     I may perhaps remind you of the phrase in theprevious letter I addressed to Sultan to the effectthat the declaration of a protectorate was a recog-nition of necessity of common action against a com-mon enemy;  this phrase appears to admit the justice of what Egyptians have always contended, that es-establishment of a protectorate was essentially awar measure which.should disappear with the restora-tion of peace,     I have replied officially to the request forAmos and Clayton,   I do not in the least wish tobe obstructives but apart from ruinous delayinvolved - and previous delays during the last three years have5 as you know, always led to ourmissing our opportunities and increasing our dif-difficulties - you will appreciate the impossible position in which both they and I would be placed.Both these two advisers and Dowson and Patterson                                          are
are in most complete agreement with me and consider proposals essential.     I consider however that Cabinet should certainlyhear Selby.     Risk which Cabinet is prepared to run is muchgreater than that of (? los)ing a Sarwat ministry and my proposals will save the position rather than sur-render it.   &apos;  I may add that I showed Sultan my proposedletter as soon as I had telegraphed it to Your Lordship.His Highness was delighted though of course he makesspecious reserves on one subject of constitutional government,     I have now brought to bear all the arguments which seem to apply to question as seen from here,and I repeat the sands are running out.     Though this telegram is addressed to you person-ally, you are of course at liberty to make such useof it as you may think fit.
