C -A B I K E T T.                                                          L.G.  64;33S8..LEGISLATION FOR TEE COMING SSSSlOfc.Memorandum by the Minister cf Health.         I have had under consideration the question oflegislation for next Session so far as it affects myDepartment and I should be glad to have the authority of theHome Affairs Committee fcr the introduction of the followingBillss-1. Housing,  A Bill to amend Section IS of the Housing, town planning etc, Act, 1919, r.ith regard to the conditions of sale of houses.2. National Health Insurance.   A Bill to provide for increaseof contributions and other matters.5. Alkali porks.   A Sill to provide for the payment of increased fees under the Alkali Acts.         (These three Bills are required to give effect to recommendations of the Geddes Committee).4. Audit.   A Bill to. substitute  &apos;annual&apos; for  ^half-yearly&apos;audits in the cases of rural district councils, guardians, andoverseers.   This Bill, though net suggested by the geddes committee&apos;, might be&apos;considered to be an &quot;economy&apos;1  ill.   Theproposed alteration in the lav/ has been strongly pressed forby the authorities concerned and would obviously save themexpense.   As regards the central department some expenseof administration would be saved but this would have no effect upon the Exchequer as the cost of audit is now covered bystamp duty.HIS DOCUMENT IS THHi PROPERTY OP HIS  BRITANNIC luVJiil STY&apos; S  GOViiKNOiilNT,.
         In the event of this Bill being introduced it isfurther suggested that the opportunity should be talren to empower town councils, il they so desire, to have theiraccounts made subject to Government audit.         This Sill would be in the interests or economy andwould probably be non-contentious.5. Milk.  It is essential that gome Eill dealing with milkshould be passed before next August, otherwise the Act of1915 would automatically come into force, involving additional expenditure and the appointment of additional officials by thelocal authorities.   There are two alternatives,,   One is tointroduce a Bill merely postponing the date on which the 1915Act is to corne into operation.   The other is to repeal the1915 Act and to seek such powers only as will not involveadditional expenditure.6. Valuationi and Rating Reform.  The report ox the valuation and Rating Reform Committee (C .i;,.3544) is now before theHome Affairs Committee.   A Bill giving effect to the recommendations of the Committee would be -a Bill of great, if not ofthe first, importance.   Certain vested interests would beaffected and it is unlikely that the Bill would be uncon-controversial, but I am sure that it ..ill receive a large measureof support, and I hope that at any rate it may be possible tointroduce the Bill and have it read a second time: in thecoming session.7.i Rating of Machinery.  The Chambers of Commerce have askedfor the introduction of legislation on this subject and I havecirculated a Memorandum (CP.3563) on this question.   TheBill would probably be opposed by the agricultural interestsand possibly other sections of ratepayers, but it would be
strongly supported by the manufacturers and would at least do something to assist industry.6. Kent Restriction.,   Urgent representations have been madeto m&amp; to amend the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest(Restrictions) Act, 1920, in order to protect landlords who,through a purely technical omission to serve a notice toquit, are now liable to repay to their tenants the increases of rent permitted under the 1920 Act.   The case for amending legislation is supported not only by the Property Owners butalso by the chief tenants Organisation, and on grounds of equity the case for amendment is very strong.   I am circulating a memorandum dealing more fully with thisquestion.9. Housing Consolidation Bill.   A consolidation of theHousing Acts has been asked for in both Houses of parliament and the Government have given provisional undertakings tointroduce such a Bill when practicable.   As a large amountof work has been done on this Bill and the  draft, isapproaching completion I suggest that the Bill should beintroduced in the House of Lords, in vrhich case it would, inaccordance with the usual procedure, be referred to the JointCommittee on Consolidation Bills.10... National Health Insurance (Consolidation) Bill.   Inthis case again strong representations have been made bothinside and outside Parliament as to the necessity of a Oon-sclidation Bill.   The -work has been taken in hand and itwould be possible to introduce the Bill at an early date butfor two complications.   The first is the proposal, referredto above, with regard to the amendment of the Insurance Actswhich is required to give effect to tha recommendations of
the Geddes Committee.   This is not a very serious matter,, asit would probably be regarded by Parliament as convenient that,-the two Bills should be introduced simultaneously that taeamending Bill should be passed first, and that the consequentialamendments should then be made in the Consolidation Bill,The position, however, in regard to the transfer of powersto the Irish Governments will probably mean that the Intro-duction of the Consolidation Bill must be delayed until the amendments in the Insurance Acts necessitated by the transferhave been settled.         In addition to the above measures I may find itnecessary at a later date to ask for authority to introducesome ether bills dealing with such questions, for example,as (a) defaulting Beards of Guardians and other localauthorities, (b) the increase of fees payable for the regis-tratlon of blrti.s, marriages and deaths, and other matters connected therewith, (c) the powers of a Public HealthCommittee of a local authority to take over the control of school Medical service, and (d) the treatment of IncipientMental disease.                                 A. MOND.                             31st January, 1922.Ministry of Health.
