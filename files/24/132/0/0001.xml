SECRET.CP.  3601.THE CABINET.PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND  COMMITTEE.     As Chairman  of the Provisional  Government of Ireland Committee, I circulate, forthe immediate information and attention of the Cabinet, two reports upon the steps thatwill  have to be taken  to  transfer to a  Provisional Government  of Southern Irelandexecutive responsibility for  Southern Irish affairs, in accordance with Article  17 of theTreaty.     These two documents consist of      (1.) The Main Report (P.G.I.  18), which  has been carefully drafted in a form which           makes  it possible to  submit it, without alteration, to the Irish leaders upon           whom  the responsibility of forming a Provisional Government for Southern           Ireland will devolve.   It will; in fact, be the Agenda Paper for the discussions           that will proceed with the Irish leaders as soon as they come to London.     (2.) A  Supplementary  Report (22/N./36) which deals with certain matters supple-           mentary to those dealt with in the Main Report, but not suitable for presentation           to the  Irish leaders in the form in which these  matters are now submitted  to           the Cabinet.     Both Reports  have  been prepared for  the  Committee  by a Technical Sub-committee under Sir James Masterton-Smith, in association with Sir John Anderson, with Sir HerbertGreedy, Mr. Lionel Curtis,  Mr. C.  T. Davis, Sir Francis Greer, Sir Frederick Liddell andMr. S. G. Tallents  as members.     The whole field has been explored with care  by  the  Technical  Sub-Committee, andthe reports embody the results of continuous work during the last fortnight.     I shall be glad if my colleagues in the Cabinet  will  make  time to  study these two documents with care and attention, as discussions with the Irish leaders may begin at any moment.  I need not emphasize the secret character of these two reports.     Alternative drafts  of the Bill required  to  give effect to  the  recommendations  inSection 9 of the Main Report will be circulated later for the information of the Cabinet..

REPORT of the CABINET COMMITTEE  appointed  to  consider what steps should     be taken on approval of the Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland, for giving     effect to its provisions, and more especially for the establishment  of a provisional     Government for Southern Ireland in terms of Article 17.                  1. PROPOSED PROCEDURE DESCRIBED IN OUTLINE.     It is clearly the intention of Article 17 that the transfer of authority from London to  Dublin is to be effected as soon as  may be after the Treaty has been approved in terms of Article 18.  In brief outline the steps  we propose for  this purpose are  as follows :      The  British Government would invite to conference the Irish leader  upon whom as the result of the meeting held  in  terms  of Article 17 the responsibility of forming a Provisional Government would naturally  fall.   That leader,  as  the  rle facto Prime Minister, would name  his  colleagues from amongst those prepared  to signify their acceptance of the Treaty in writing.  On the advice of the Ministry so  formed the Lord Lieutenant  would act from the outset in deciding  all questions relating to the dissolution of  the  Parliament of  Southern Ireland  as if its  members  were regular responsible Ministers.   In  consultation with, them  as the potential  government the British Government would decide in  detail  (l) what steps  are to be taken  to  transfer the various services and (2) the times when the transfers are to take effect.   As soon as a service is  transferred  the  Lord  Lieutenant will act in respect of that service on the  advice of  the  Irish Minister  in charge or of the Irish  Government as a whole. All  other  arrangements required  to effect the transition, e.g., those for withdrawing the  Crown forces, should be settled in close consultation with the Irish Government.     For the first  few  weeks  such a Government- would have  no separate  existence in law, but the British Government would  undertake to propose, as soon  as Parliament meets, such measures as are needed  to clothe the Provisional Government with legal authority, and  those measures would be settled in consultation with the Irish Ministers. The establishment of autonomy would thus pass through three stages      (1.) Immediately  on approval of the Treaty there would  be  in  existence  for           Southern Ireland  a body to  be  called  in &quot;&quot;this Report  THE  Temporary           Provisional Government.     (2.) When the necessary legislation had  been  passed  by Parliament this body           would be clothed with legal powers and become the Provisional Government           of Southern Ireland as contemplated by Article 17.     (3.) Lastly, the Government of  the  Irish Free  State would  come into  existence           when the Constitution  had been formally enacted.                   2.  AMNESTY,  INDEMNITY AND COMPENSATION.     There are certain questions which must be discussed  at once with the Irish leaderswho undertake to form the  Temporary Provisional  Government.   Of these,  the most pressing are  the questions of amnesty, indemnity, and compensation for damage doneby either side  in  the  course of  the struggle.  In  the  view of the Committee effect should be given to a comprehensive policy of oblivion on both sides.  If this  view beaccepted it will then be found that questions of amnesty, indemnity, and  compensationmust be dealt with in due relation to  each other.     &quot;With regard to amnesty it is  suggested  that  the British Government should offer to release forthwith all prisoners (other than  members of  the Crown forces) convictedfor  offences committed in Ireland from political motives  before the 11TH July, 1921,subject as regards  offences committed  in Northern Ireland  to consultation  with     (B21/301) 100  1/22  H&amp;S, Ltd., 9619-IttoSECRET.P.G.I.  18.
Sir James Craig.  It is further suggested that a tribunal should be established at oueoto examine and  adjudicate on. any cases of prisoners the motive of whose crime appearsto Jbe  in  doubt.  The British Government would further undertake to consider thecases of prisoners whose offences were  committed in Great Britain  from  Irish politicalmotives.   The sentences  on members  of the Crown forces will  be, subject  to  special review under the ordinary procedure.     Servants of the Crown and those acting under their authority  will, of course, haveto be protected by an Act of Indemnity against legal proceedings for acts clone by themin good faith during the period of conflict.     A policy of oblivion, however, will  not be comprehensive in effect  unless  similarprotection is given  to all those who were active against the forces of the Crown.   Sofar as  civil  actions are concerned, it  is not  possible  to show how this can be  done without examining the question of compensation for damage.     The principle should  be admitted  that  fair compensation is to be paid in respect ofinjuries which are the subject of compensation under  the Criminal Injuries Acts, andfor direct and substantial losses sustained through the destruction of property by orderof the military authorities under Martial Law.     Claims  for  compensation under those  heads  would be heard and determined bya, Commission specially constituted for the purpose,  and  all  claims before other tribunalswould  be barred and pending  proceedings,  including proceedings  for the enforcement of decrees,  stayed.   Where claims have already been brought  for damage to property and a final award given, the award should be liable to review by  the Commission if theproceedings  were undefended, as it is believed that the  awards in such cases have often been excessive,$swards already given in defended cases and  in cases  of personal injurieswould stand.     The Irish. Government should be asked  to assume the responsibility for seeing thatall awards of the Commission and, subject to such review as  aforesaid, the  awards ofother tribunals,  are duly satisfied.   They should determine whether the  whole  or  anypart of the burden should fall on the local  authorities  who would  have been liable ifthe claims had been prosecuted and finally disposed  of under the Criminal Injuries Acts.     The British Government would undertake to reimburse the Irish Government sucha total amount as in the judgment of the Commission was  attributable to the action ofthe forces of the Crown or their sympathizers.     The Commission  should consist of three persons  including as chairman a person who holds or who has  held high judicial office in the Empire.   The Commission wouldbe assisted by sub-commissioners who would hold local inquiries in all parts of southern ireland.  The expenses of the Commission would be  borne by  the Irish Governmentand the  British Government in proportion  to  their  respective liabilities  for sumsawarded  by the Commission.     The Provisional  Government should also be asked reciprocally to  undertake 1Oprotect from molestation or victimization by all means  at  their  disposal the persons,property and  interests of all those who are  thought to have sided or sympathized withthe forces of the Crown.     The period to be covered by the  proceedings of the Commission,  which wouldnot extend to Northern Ireland, should, we suggest, be  the  period from  Easter, 1916,to the date of the approval of the Treatjr in Dublin.                                3. MARTIAL LAW.     The  operation of Martial Law ceases with the  circumstances which gave rise to itsproclamation, and its  cessation  is marked by the passing of an Act of Indemnity.   in southern Ireland, Martial Law and the Regulations made  under the Restoration of order in  Ireland Act  will  no longer be used as administrative instruments.  Certainorders  such as  those  prohibiting the  holding of coroners&apos; inquests m certain districtswould  be cancelled.   A  universal  return to the  processes  of the ordinary civil lawwould take place as from the assumption of  responsibility by the Temporary ProvisionalGovernment.                            4. MILITARY  EVACUATION.     All necessary steps are being  taken by the War  Office with  a  view to effecting the evacuation of troops.   The amount of  military-stores  collected at various stationsis very large, in some cases amounting to thousands of tons.   Such huge aggregationscannot be removed or disposed of at short notice, and if they were looted any difficulty which  the Provisional Government may have  in enforcing  its authority  might be seriously increased.   Adequate guards must. be maintained  over the stores  until theyare removed.   This  will  be clone  and the guards withdrawn with  the least possible
                                        sdelay.   The question of safeguarding the premises when evacuated is dealt with in thefollowing section.    During the  time  required  for  the completion of the evacuation,  British forces which  remain in Southern Ireland  should not  be used  in  aid of  the  civil powerexcept on application by the Provisional Government to the Lord Lieutenant.                     5.  TRANSFER OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY.     On the principle that the Government of Southern Ireland is to be handed  overas a going concern the Committee recommend that all properties  used for the  purposeof ordinary civil government, such as departmental offices, &amp;c, together with furniture,equipment and all other departmental assets, including the special funds applicable todepartmental purposes in Southern Ireland, should he  regarded as Irish property and handed over to the Provisional Government in due course.   On the same principle, the liabilities of each department, e.g.,the charge for existing pensions, would, of course, beassumed by the Irish Government.     The Viceregal Lodge would be treated  in the  same way and handed over, to  bemaintained as an official residence of the representative of the crown in Ireland.  TheChief Secretary&apos;s Lodge and other official residences would  be handed over  as  soon asthey ceased to be required by officers of the British Government.     There are certain buildings, like the Royal Hospital  and Royal Hibernian MilitarySchool, which  are subject to ancient  statutory trusts, the terms of which  may not be appropriate  to  the new  regime.  There  are  also  the  lands and quit rents which constitutes part of the hereditary revenues upon which the  revenues  voted  for the useof the Crown on the Civil List at the opening of each reign are  based.  A question of even greater difficult)^ is  presented by the  museums, picture galleries and other publiccollections  in Dublin.  Two alternatives present themselves between which a decisioncannot  be  hastily made.   A Trust  might  be formed  upon the  governing body ofwhich Northern  Ireland might be represented,  and to which an appropriate  contri-bution might be made from its revenues.  The alternative  is that the Irish Free state should accept sole control  and financial responsibility subject  to  an obligation tomaintain the national  character of the collections.  These are all matters which willhave to be dealt with in the Constitution of the Irish Free State.   Special considerationmust also be given to the records in the Public Record Office.     Barracks and establishments constructed for police administration in normal timeswould be included in the transfer to the new Irish Government.  On the other hand,all police establishments  created for the purpose of restoring order since Easter, 1916,should be recognized as the property of the British Government.  Military establish-ments,  with all fixtures,  should be  similarly recognized  for  the  present.   In theultimate settlement, Ireland should  be  credited with such  proportion of the actualbuildings or their value as  corresponds to the  military responsibilities assumed by theFree State Government under the Treaty.     All movables in military establishments, and police transport and other equipment in excess of normal requirements, should be recognized as British Government property.Steps should be taken forthwith, in conjunction with the Disposal Board, to sell them,except in  so  far  as  the  Provisional  Government might  seek to acquire them ata  valuation.     If these  principles are accepted the Provisional  Government might be asked toundertake  the  safe custody of  any properties vacated by the military  and police untildisposed of.                          6.  TRANSFER OF  DEPARTMENTS.     The foregoing paragraphs relate to matters to  be raised for discussion and settledas soon as may  be with  the Temporary Provisional Government.  But  the measures required for handing over  the various  services should proceed  as rapidly as  possiblemeanwhile.  In the Appendix to this Report a list is given of the Government Depart-ments at present  responsible  for civil administration in Southern Ireland.   They maybe divided into three categories, viz. :      A. -Purely Irish Departments.     B.  Revenue Departments.     C. Other Departments having jurisdiction throughout the  United Kingdom.     (9619-1)                                                                  A  2
      A. In  the  case of certain  of the  purely Irish Departments there are questions which must be discussed with the Provisional Government&apos; before  the transfer can  he made.  For instance, the Prisons Department cannot be handed over until the questions of  indemnity and  amnesty are  settled.   In  the  case  of the Resident  Magistracy personal questions arise.   The  Provisional  Government must decide  which of these Magistrates it desires to take  over, and the Magistrates so selected must also he  asked whether they  desire to remain  in  the  service.   The  Police Department is of course the  most  difficult case  of   all.  The  transfer  of  the Royal Irish  Constabulary seems  to  have been  contemplated  by Article  10  of  the  Treaty.  But since  the publication of the Treaty  the  attitude assumed by the Police has made it clear that such transfer, even if it could  be effected, would not be in the interests of the Provisional Government.   This is clearly  a case in which  the practical application of the Treaty will require discussion with the Temporary Provisional Government.  That Government will probably desire to organize a new Police Force  of  its own.  It is  important that the Royal  Irish Constabulary  should  be  demobilized  as soon  as possible  because it is believed that a number of the Irish constables  may then be willing to re-enlist in the new  force.   Such  re-enlistment  will  reduce the  charges for compensation, and  the technical experience of these constables will be  of value to the Provisional  Government in  the training  of their  new  recruits.    There  is reason  to hope that  the Dublin Metropolitan Police Force can be handed over  to  the Temporary Provisional Goveru- ment as it  stands.      In the case  of the other purely Irish  Departments, the  problem is comparatively simple. Except as regards part of the functions of the Land Commission and the Board of Works,  the services  administered by those Departments are transferable under the Act of 1920, and,  save in the case of Education (including  Technical  Instruction) Health Insurance, Fisheries  and the Diseases of  Animals Acts, transfer to Northern Ireland has been completed.  The transfer  of Education and Health Insurance  to Northern Ireland can be carried  through not later  than the  transfer of responsibility to the  Provisional  Government,  and  it will then only remain to hand  over to the Provisional Government those  Departments as they exist at the date of transfer.      The Land Commission is concerned with :       (1.) The administration of the Acts relating to fair rents,  &amp;c.     (2.) The management of the Church Temporalities Fund.     (3.) The collection of  Land  Purchase annuities and the control, to some extent, of            dealings with holdings purchased under the Land Purchase Acts.     (4.) The administration of the Land Purchase Acts.     The functions of the Land Commission in relation to (1) (2) and (3) can be handed over to the  Provisional Government but the administration of  the Laird Purchase Acts is a reserved matter under the  Act of 1920 and  its transfer will have to await a general decision on  the question  of the completion of Land Purchase.     The reserved  functions of the Board  of  Works in  Northern Ireland must be transferred  to the British Office of Works.     The services relating  to Fisheries and  the Diseases of Animals Acts, at present administered by the Department of Agriculture  and  Technical  Instruction, are, by the Act of 1920, entrusted  to the  Council of  Ireland, and their transfer can be effected as soon  as the Council is  constituted by the  election  of representatives  of Southern Ireland.     B. Coming to  the case  of the Revenue Departments (the Board of Customs and Excise, the  Board  of Inland Revenue and the Post Office), these are for the most part reserved under the Act of 1920.  So  far, however, as Southern Ireland is concerned, the^ Provisional. Government must  be regarded under the terms of  the  Treaty as entitled to assume control of all the services  administered by these Departments.     It is assumed that  during the provisional period the Irish Government will  wish to take  over the  control of  the  Post Office,  and  that if  the Provisional Government wish it an agreement will be made by which the British  Post Office will continue to function in Ireland as the agents of the Irish Government.  In that event the Postalrevenue collected in Southern Ireland will  be paid  into  the Irish Exchequer and the expenditure will be recovered from Irish funds.     As most of the postal revenue is collected in stamps and will be credited according to the  area in which the stamps are sold, it is essential, if  an accurate  division of
revenue  is to  be obtained,  that  the stamps in  use in Southern Ireland should bedistinguishable from the United  Kingdom issues.  The existing stamps  could without difficulty, be  overprinted for this  purpose;  the process  of  manufacturing  a  new issue would take a very considerable time.  To  avoid anomalies  in  the  rates  of postage,especially as between Northern and Southern Ireland, it would  be necessary that theProvisional Government should agree that the inland postage  rates and charges in force for the time being in the United Kingdom  should apply to  Southern Ireland duringthe provisional period.     Provision  will  presumably have to be  made for  a  division of  the  assets  and liabilities of the Post Office Savings Bank and for giving some option to  the depositorswho opened their accounts at Irish offices to remain with the  British  Savings  Bank orto be transferred to the Irish Bank.     In the case of the  transferred taxes administered by  the  Board of Customs and excise and the  Board of Inland  Revenue, the transfer to  Southern Ireland can beeffected under the procedure followed in connection with the transfer of these taxes to northern Ireland.  In  the  case of the  reserved  taxes administered by these depart-ments it  will  be  impracticable,  prior  to  the  establishment  of  the  Irish  FreeState, to do more than to  hand  over  to  the  new Government executive  controlover  the assessment and  collection in  Southern Ireland of United  Kingdom taxesfor the time being  in force, the Exchequer  of the  Provisional Government being-entitled  to  the  proceeds  of the  taxes, wherever  collected,  so  far  as  attributable to  Southern  Ireland.   Machinery  is provided  in the Act  of  1920  (Section  22) forascertaining  the  proportion  so attributable.   Should the  Irish  Government  so  desirethe British Government could, if  notified at  a very  earty date, continue to assess andcollect these taxes as agents of the Provisional Government.  The necessary provisionfor carrying  out  these  arrangements should  be covered by  the Bill  regularizing theposition of the Provisional Government.     C. The transfer to the Provisional Government of the services (whether  trans-ferred or reserved under the  Act of 1920) now performed in Southern  Ireland by other united Kingdom Departments will not present grave difficulties.   It can be effectedunder the  procedure already followed in the case of the  transfer of services to theGovernment  of  Northern Ireland.  As  respects  Northern  Ireland  the  transferredservices have already been  handed over, and, so far as reserved  services are concerned,the responsibility for  their  administration in Northern Ireland by the United  kingdon departments remains unchanged.     In the case of one service, viz., the administration of railways by the  Minister ofTransport,  being  a service which by the Act  of 1920  is transferred to the Council- ofIreland,  the  same questions  will arise as  in the case of Fisheries and  the  Diseases of animals  Acts.     With respect to ex-Service men, the Ministry of Pensions will continue to  dischargeits functions  in  the  payment of pensions and  the  provision of medical care to menresident in  Ireland.  But the special assistance  at present afforded to ex-Service menin connection with industrial training, the obtaining of employment, land settlement and housing by the Ministry of Labour, the Department of Agriculture  and  TechnicalInstruction,  the  Estates  Commissioners and  the  Local  Government  Board  raisesquestions which will  have  to be  discussed with  the Provisional  Government.  It isclear that the British Government cannot discharge  its responsibilities  to these menunder  existing  methods except by agreement  with, and  with  the  help  of, the new government.     The collection of quit,  rents by or on behalf of the Office of Woods  and Forestsmust continue pending the establishment of the Irish  Free  State. -     It will be essential to utilize the services of  the Joint Exchequer Board and theCivil  Service Committee constituted under the Act  of 1920, or of analogous bodies,for the settlement of questions  of finance and the transfer of staff and assessment ofcompensation which are bound to arise in connection with the transfer of services to theProvisional Government.                          7. POSITION OF JUDICIARY,  &amp;C.     During  the  provisional period  no question  should arise  as  to  the  enforcedretirement of judges of the Supreme Court.   Their position  as regards salaries, pensionsand tenure should continue as at present.   Should any  vacancies occur during theperiod Flis Majesty in filling  the  vacancies  would act  on the Lord  Lieutenantsrecommendation, who in turn, would be guided bv  the advice of the Irish Ministers.     (9619-1)
     The staff of the Supreme Court, on the other hand, would, so far as payment of salaries and general financial control  are concerned, be  transferred to the ProvisionalGovernment subject to the provisions as to compensation contained  in Section 54 ofthe Act of 1920.     Under these arrangements the future position of  existing judges of the SupremeCourt will remain for determination on the establishment of the Irish Free State.     The County Courts and other subordinate Courts would, when the new GovernmentIS  established, occupy in relation to  it  the same position which they now  occupy inrelation to the British Government.     Existing County Court judges and other persons having the  like tenure of office would, so far as regards personal rights, be treated in  the same way as existing judges of the Supreme Court.                                    8. FINANCE.     Consideration of  the  arrangements involved in  the transfer of  financial powersindicates clearly that the collection of taxes and the establishment of an Exchequer bythe Government of Southern Ireland should date from the beginning of a new financialyear.  It would he convenient that the replacement of the temporary by the regularizedProvisional Government should synchronize with the  assumption by the Irish Govern-ment of full financial responsibility.   If  so, the  financial position would be  broadly as.follows :      (a.) The Temporary Provisional Government would have at its disposal the moneyprovided in the Votes  for the  current year,  the expenditure  of that money being,  of  Icourse, limited to the purposes authorized by those Votes.  If new expenditure outsidethese Votes were found necessary in the  short interval  before  an Irish Exchequer was set up, it should be possible for the  Temporary Provisional Government to arrange with  1the Bank of Ireland for an advance.   If this course did  not prove feasible, a temporaryadvance might conceivably be made, if the Cabinet agreed, from the Civil Contingencies  ftFund, not exceeding  100,000/. in all.     (6.)  The Provisional Government  would  regulate, its expenditure by Votes of its  Iown  Parliament.  There would be paid direct into the Exchequer of Southern Ireland  1the proceeds both of transferred taxes under  the Government of Ireland  Act and of  1the reserved taxes, for the assessment and collection of which we  have proposed above  1that the Provisional  Government should  take  over  the  responsibility,  even though the  united  Kingdom departments concerned might act  as its agents  after transfer.   The  L.government  could also obtain ways and  menus advances  from its  hankers in  the  Iusual way.  The&apos; Provisional Government would  further be responsible for the recovery  gof payments due in respect  of local loans and the collection of Land Purchase annuities,.  1but would agree to pay over the proceeds to the  British Exchequer, together with an  1amount equal to certain expenditure still borne  on the British Votes or charged on the  1Consolidated fund of the  United Kingdom (e.g., pensions of Civil Servants, payments  fffor any agency  services and salaries  of Judges).   Payment on  account  of the  Irish  pishare of the Debt would  presumably stand  over till  the  amount had been settled  1in the manner indicated.  The  contribution  due from Southern Ireland under the Act  iof 1920 should  be  regarded  as  replaced  retrospectively  by  the transfer of  debt  Icharges, &amp;e, when effected  in accordance with Article  5  of the Treaty.                  j -              9. REGTJLARIZATION 01- THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT.     The term &quot; Temporary Provisional Government&quot;  has been used to emphasize  the  Ifact  that until legislation has been passed the control of administration will be of an  pinformal character and could not without difficulty  be prolonged beyond a few weeks.  StIf our recommendations are to be carried into effect this legislation must be passed before  Bthe close of the current financial year ; and in order to determine the scope and nature  Iof the legislation required some estimate must be formed at the outset of the period for  which the regularized Provisional Government thereby established may be expected  to  Iremain in being.  This period is affected,  by the  exceptional task which the Provisional  1Government has to discharge/  Parliament has  been  told that  Ireland, like Canada,  IAustralia and South  Africa; is to frame the draft of its  own constitution, and, further,  Ithat this onerous task is imposed, in the first instance, on the Provisional Government,  which  is expected  to discharge   it  in conference   with  representatives   of  the  1minority.    Mr.  Griffith   is  personally pledged  to  Lord  Midleton  in the matter.  I
 A   discussion   of  safeguards   with  the  Government  of  Northern  Ireland   is foreshadowed in Article 15 of the Treaty.   The views of Organized Labour will  also have  to  be  considered.   In  consulting these  various interests  the  Provisional Government may  be led to convene some body for drafting the Constitution which  will be  in fact, if  not in name,  a  Convention  analogous to those  which  prepared  the Constitutions of the three larger Dominions.   But they cannot be expected to embark on  this task until  they have made some progress  in  taking  over and rearranging the various departments.  The process of formulating a  Constitution for Ireland cannot be hurried  or abridged  without grave risk of disaster.   To  suppose that  it can  be accomplished  within six  months is  contrary to  all experience  gained in  the other Dominions.  It is wiser  to conclude that the twelve months to which the Provisional Government is limited by Article 17  will i  practice be needed  for the  completion of its  task.     This conclusion  points to  and  is  reinforced by a  second.   In  Australia and South Africa the  actual texts of the constitutions were  framed by Conventions and ratified by the  Imperial Parliament.   But  prior to&quot; ratification the&apos; Constitutions were approved by the various Colonial Legislatures.  When Parliament agreed to approve the texts almost or entirely as they stood,  it was not because they had been framed by Conventions having no constitutional  status, but rather because their work was endorsed by  the Legislatures of the Colonies concerned and recommended by them to the Imperial Parliament for  formal ratification.  The British Government will be in  a far stronger position in asking Parliament to ratify the Irish Constitution if it comes to them with the approval of a Legislature duly elected for  Southern Ireland, and  still more if  it should happily  prove  to  have been  endorsed  by the Parliament of Northern  Ireland also. The body which  frames the  Constitution  will no  doubt perform the greater part of its  work in private session.  But, unless  there is full and free  discussion of its terms in Ireland,  the public opinion necessary to support it will not  have been educated and become articulate.   Any interests which would have had no opportunity of arguing their claims publicly  in Ireland  would insist on making their voices heard when the measure was introduced in  the Imperial Parliament.  Only if it was clear  that  the questions at issue had  been thoroughly  and  fairly  thrashed  out in Ireland could the British Government expect to maintain  the position that  those questions  ought  not  to be opened afresh and in detail in  both Houses of the Imperial Parliament.     For other reasons a Provisional Executive&apos;will be hard put  to it to maintain its authority for more than a  few  months unless it is supported  by a representative body with  real legislative&apos;  power, including the power  to vote money.  Its  members may become, so unpopular that their political influence will be undermined.  The experience of Crown Colony Government  in the Transvaal is a warning.   In  the present disturbed state of Ireland the  powers of the  Provisional Government  may well require  to be supplemented at an early  date.  They must either exceed them and disregard the law, or have resort to legislation.   Respect for the law  will only be established in Ireland as elsewhere by a, Government which  acts according to  law.   If, moreover, there is in Dublin no Legislature to which the Provisional Government can  be made responsible, its  actions will  very properly  be  called in  question in Parliament here.  The British Government can hardly refuse to answer questions as to the conduct of the Executive in Dublin, unless that Executive  is publicly and formally answerable to a  representative Legislature of its own.  There must  be a  Legislature to vote supply.  In the absence of an Irish. Legislature the estimates of the Provisional Government would have  to be voted by the British Parliament.     The conclusion is that a  representative  Legislature is an organ  essential  to the Provisional Government as contemplated by Article 17.     The Committee recommend that  the Temporary Provisional Government should be told that the Imperial Government is prepared to take whatever  steps are necessary to regularise the position of  the  Provisional  Government, to provide it with a represen- tative Legislature and to facilitate  the  process of evolving a Constitution which the British Government would be  prepared to submit to Parliament for legal ratification.     It should be borne in mind that  the Treaty cannot be ratified before the Constitu- tion is enacted, because as soon as the Treaty  is ratified by Act,  the month&apos;s option to&apos; Northern Ireland provided by  Article 11  of the Treaty begins  to run.     Assuming  that these  conclusions are accepted by the British Government on  the one hand and by the Temporary Provisional Government on the other, id is clear that effect cannot be given to them without some legislation when Parliament meets.     Such legislation could take the form either of a  provisional  Constitution enacted by  Parliament  or  of  an  adaptation  of the Act of  1920.  The objection to  the first
 of  these  courses  is  the  delay  involved.  The mere drafting of a new provisional Constitution is  a  formidable  business,  and when drafted its provisions  are likely to present a wide front for attack.   A considerable amount of time may well be consumed by debates in Parliament before  it can be passed, and under the terms of the Treaty the Provisional  Government must expire on 6TH December, 1922.   The object can be achieved far more rapidly by a simple amending Bill  to  cover  any changes that  the Temporary Provisional Government may desire  in  the Act of  1920, which contains a carefully  considered  scheme for the  administration of  Southern  Ireland.   Certain provisions  of the  Act, moreover, have already been  set  in motion even in Southern Ireland.    The  second  course  has  the  further  great advantage  that  the  Bill required could practically be limited to a  single clause  conferring on  His Majesty in Council power (1)  to adapt the Act of 1920 so tar as necessary for the purposes of  the Provisional Government,  (2)  to  make  such incidental, consequential and supplemental provisions  as may be required during the transitional period prior to the establishment of the Irish Free State.    The terms of the Bill should  be wide enough to authorize such adaptations by Order in Council  of the Act of 1920 as  the following :      (1.)  A signed acceptance of the Treaty should be substituted for the oath wherever           required by the Act.    (2.)  Irish Ministers should not be required to be members of the Privy Council.    (3.)  The  Representation of  Southern Ireland  in  the House  of Commons  of  the           United Kingdom should be abolished as from the date of the establishment           of the regularized Provisional Government.    (4.)  The Senate as at present constituted might be abolished.   Whether a second           Chamber  constituted in some other way should  be put in its place  is a           matter for the Provisional  Government to decide.  An  Upper  House to           which the  Provisional Government  could  nominate members  might give.           them the  means  of  introducing  to the  Legislature  the  spokesmen   of           unrepresented minorities.  .    Such a Bill as is here proposed could be passed  into  law within a few clays of  theopening of Parliament. The Provisional Government could then be placed on  a legalfooting with  a  Legislature of  its  own  competent to  pass   further legislation   toregularize  its position without reference  to the  Imperial Parliament.   Any mattersbeyond its  competence which might be necessary to clear the financial position could bedealt with  by transitory clauses in the Act legalizing  the Constitution  of the  IrishFree State.

INTRODUCTORY.    The Main Report of the Committee (.P.G.I. 18) has been  drafted in a form which makes it possible,  if the Cabinet approve the report, to  submit it without alterationto the Irish  leaders.   The  Committee  propose in  this  report to deal  with certainsupplementary matters.    To begin with are certain  matters  to which  no reference is  made in the  MainReport, viz.,  the option to Northern Ireland, the  Boycott, Land Purchase, the  NavalArticles of the  Treaty and  the form of the  Union  Jack. - These are dealt with inPart I.    In Part II. are included notes which are  not  suitable for inclusion  in  the  MainReport, but relate to matters dealt with in that report.PART I.                               GENERAL QUESTIONS.                        1.  The Option to Northern Ireland.     The Committee desire to draw the Cabinets attention to certain  provisions of theTreaty, which  may operate in a manner other than  that intended by the Irishsignatories, and so give rise to a misunderstanding.     The establishment of the Irish Free State requires three distinct  operations so faras the British Parliament is concerned.  The Treaty has first to be approved.  It hasthen to be ratified by an Act of Parliament.  But the Treaty when ratified and enacted in law does not  provide  the Free State with a  Constitution.   There  must be  a constitution which must also be ratified  by Act of  Parliament, though, of course, thesame Act might be used to give the force of law both  to the Treaty  and  to- theConstitution.     Now, as the  British  signatories are aware, the  option given to Northern ireland was reduced to one month at the instance of the Irish signatories, who took the viewthat they ought to be informed at once  whether the Irish Free State was to includeNorthern  Ireland.  The  Irish signatories  were probably under  the impression either that the  Treaty  was . itself the Constitution of the Irish Free State,  or that  a constitution  would be prepared and enacted within two  or three months after  theTreaty had been approved.   We doubt, indeed, whether  the apjoroval and  ratification of the Treaty figured in their minds  at  the time as  distinct  operations.  According toMr. Cope they are still under the impression that Northern Ireland is to be called uponto exercise the option within the next two or three months.    In the wording of Articles 11 and  12, however, it is assumed that the  ratification of the &quot;Treaty  and the  enactment  of  the Constitution are to be simultaneous,  for northern  Ireland is to exercise her option within one month of ratification, while  atthe same time it is presumed that the  powers of the Parliament and Government ofthe Irish Free State are in  being when the option is  exercised.  This view is placedbeyond doubt by the  terms of Article 12. In other words Northern Ireland cannotexercise her  option until the  Constitution has  been formally enacted.   It follows,therefore, that the ratification of the  Treaty  and the enactment of  the Constitution    (B22/49) 100  1/22 E&amp;S, Ltd  9631wo
must be  simultaneous.  If, however, the Committee are right in predicting that many months.will  elapse before the  Provisional Government  can  submit  a draft of theConstitution,* the known intention of the Irish signatories that Ulster should exerciseher  option  at once  will be disappointed.   Mr. Cope indeed understands that they thought  and  still think that the decision of Northern  Ireland was to be known beforethe Constitution  was drafted, an idea which  is clearly in  conflict with the  terms ofArticles  11 and 12.     In these circumstances, the Committee advise that the Irish leaders should be given time  fully to consider their  reasons  for  suggesting  that  the Constitution cannot be formulated as rapidly as was supposed when the Treaty was  drafted.    As soon as theyhave realized how long and difficult the process of settling the terms of a  constitution is likely  to  prove, the real  effect of  Articles  11 and 12 might  be  brought to their attention in conversation.     The convenience of knowing the decision of Northern Ireland  before  drafting theConstitution  is obvious.   But the balance of advantage in  not rushing a  decision on northern Ireland in the next month is far greater.   The  negotiations contemplated inArticle  15 could not be  carried through  in  the  time.   Northern  Ireland would be certain to decide against  inclusion in the  Free State, and  the Boundary  commission would have to be set  in operation without  delay..  It  is  surely safer  that some time should be given for wounds to heal, that Ireland should have a period  of  rest and atthe worst that the Provisional Government should  have time  to establish  its position before the Commission is set to  work on its difficult and disturbing task.                                  2.  The Boycott.     The Boycott, if continued,  will be a fruitful source of trouble between the Northand South, and of trouble in which the Imperial authorities may become involved.    .The Boycott was originally a reprisal for  the exclusion of Catholic workmen fromthe Belfast shipyards, following a series of faction fights in the late summer of 1920.The situation  which led to this exclusion was aggravated by a  feeling among  the protestant  shipyard workers  that  Catholic  workmen had taken advantage of  theabsence  of Protestant workmen in the Army during  the war to entrench themselves inpositions in the yards.     The authority  organizing  the Boycott was originally  more  or less separate fromthe Executive of the &quot; Republican Government&quot; in  Dublin, and it is questionable howfar it is within  the  power  of  the Irish leaders  to  stop the  Boycott so long as the catholic  workmen are excluded from the shipyards.  It  is clear, however,  that  thesituation will take on an entire].)&apos;- new aspect as soon as an  Irish Ministry comes into power in  Southern  Ireland.   At present the Boycott is enforced  by  threats;  forinstance, depositors in Ulster Banks  are warned that, unless  their deposits  are  with-drawn, their furniture will  be removed and  sold.   Such removals are, we understand,actually taking  place, and the moral  authority of the  Provisional  Government will be undermined if under its regime such  lawless proceedings are countenanced or ignored.A policy of oblivion will  not be  comprehensive, and will be felt to be a  mockery, solong as the Boycott continues in force.  The  Committee have no cut-ancl-dried remedyto propose, but  recommend that  the  Irish leaders should  be  invited  to  discuss thematter at once with Sir James Craig.                                . 3. Land Purchase.    , Land Purchase is not dealt with in the Treaty, but it is an important subject for negotiation  between  representatives  of different interests,  as  it affects not  only  the landlords who have not yet sold and the tenants who have not yet purchased, but alsothe well  being of the community. It is the effective safeguard against a revival of theland war and the agitation of the landless men in the West.     The  question  will clearly  have  to  be discussed with the  Irish leaders  at anearly date.   The  Government undertook  to   treat the completion of Land Purchaseas a necessary supplement to the Act of I 920, and accordingly  Land Purchase wasmade a  reserved  matter  under that  Act  and an Irish Land Bill was introduced inNovember, 1920.  That Bill proposed to  give statutory  effect to  a scheme for  thecompletion of  Land Purchase  which had been  adopted  by the  Irish  Conventionunanimously. The Bill did not  obtain a second reading before the end of the session,and during the unsettled conditions in 1921 effective legislation on the subject wouldhave been impossible.     The  Convention  scheme  is  generally  accepted  as  the best  solution  of  the                            * See SECTION 9 OF THE MAIN REPORT.
complicated problem.  It was  approved by representatives of landlords  and tenants.The scheme involves the following processes :      (L) Compulsory acquisition of unsold  land by Government departments (the Land            Commission and  Congested Districts Board) from the landlords and resale            to the tenants and  others..  All unsold  land in the congested  districts of            the West, and all unsold tenanted land  elsewhere, would be subject to this            process.     (2.) The issue of Government 5 per cent, bonds; these are  to be accepted by the            landlords at their nominal value in payment of the purchase money, which,            in the majority of cases, would  be  fixed  automatically.     (3.) The payment to the landlords in cash of a percentage on the purchase money,            called the bonus;  the bonus  to  be  raised by the  issue of Government            securities.     (4.) The  carrying out  of the  scheme through Government  Departments whose            administrative expenses would be borne by the Government.     The issue of Government  securities is  an essential feature of this  or any LandPurchase scheme.  The  securities  are  issued for  three main purposes ;  first, to the landlord in satisfaction of the purchase money  ; secondly, to raise money to provide the bonus;  and thirdly, to  raise  money  to meet  the  administrative  expenses.   Thedividends and  sinking fund  in respect of the securities issued in satisfaction of thepurchase money are  recouped by purchase annuities payable to the Government by the purchasing  tenants, but the bonus and administrative expenses fall on the Exchequer.     Under the Act of 1920  the scheme would have- been  administered  and financed by the United Kingdom Government, but the cost would have been deducted from theIrish residuary share of reserved taxes,  and would  thus have fallen  on the southern and Northern Consolidated Funds.     It is  impossible to  forecast approximately  the financial requirements of such ascheme.  The estimates before the Irish Convention of purchase money  to be raisedvaried from 16 millions to 72 millions, and  a  conservative estimate  would  probably be something  between 20 and 30 millions.   To this  must be added bonus  at  the  rate of,say, 12 per cent, on the purchase money and considerable administrative expenses.     In considering the transfer of Land Commission functions to the new  Government,it must be  borne in mind that there are still  pending in the Land Commission a largenumber  of sales which were agreed upon many years ago.  This  delay was due to various causes, including  the change in the rates, of interest, the volume  of business to be transacted and finally the war.  A  definite responsibility rests upon the BritishGovernment for seeing that bargains entered  into by landlords and tenants in reliance on the terms of the Land Purchase Acts  are honoured.   As shown above, the  delay in completion does not arise on the part of  the landlords or tenants.     The British Government, in giving Dominion status to Ireland, has placed  itself ina position in. which any attempt to carry out its obligations otherwise  than through theFree  State Government  would  be an infringement  of  the  powers  and privilegesconferred on that Government,   The  representatives  of the Provisional  Governmentshould be invited at the first  opportunity to express their acceptance  of the principle ofcontinuity  of administration,  which implies that, on taking over the rights, powers and privileges of the British Government, they, ipso facto, take over  the responsibility fordischarging any outstanding  obligations of that Government contracted in the  exerciseof the authority which/under the Treaty, passes to the Irish Free State.  This principlebeing accepted, its application in the case of Land Purchase would entail that the  IrishGovernment &apos;     (1.) should discharge the definite obligations towards landlords and tenants already            entered into, and.     (2.) should fulfil substantially the general pledges given by the British Government            for a further measure of Land  Purchase.  .     In that case the action taken by the  British Government  in  Northern Ireland, ifNorthern Ireland should  not come into the Irish Free  State, should  conform as nearly as possible  to what is done in Southern  Ireland.                         4. Naval Articles of the Treaty.     The Committee  have considered a  letter from  the Admiralty enquiring as to the,effect of the naval articles of the Treaty.  The Committee have expressed the opinion(9631)A 2
that paragraph 7 (b) of the Treaty may be regarded as covering the powers  asked forby the Admiralty in their memorandum to the Cabinet of 16TH September, 1921.     The Committee do not consider that any immediate  discussion need  be  held withthe Temporary Provisional Government in regard to further questions put forward bythe  Admiralty on  the  subject of fishery  patrol boats,  &amp;c.,-but they think  that the.papers should be circulated to the Committee of Imperial Defence.                              5. Form of Union Jack.     In reply to an enquiry by the War Office the Committee  have given the opinionthat the &quot; union Jack &quot; is the flag of the British Empire, and  that, even if it were not accepted and used by the  new Irish Government, no alteration should be made in it bythe rest of the Empire.   This  question should not, however, be raised for  discussionwith the Temporary Provisional Government.PART  II.     NOTES ON VARIOUS MATTERS WHICH ARE DEALT WITH IN THE MAIN REPORT.                 6.  Indemnity.   [See Section 2 of the Main Report.)     The  Committee  are advised that  an Act of Indemnity passed in the british parliament would be legally effective in Ireland.  They attach the greatest importance,however,  to  obtaining  in addition to such  an  Act  a  pledge from  the TemporaryProvisional Government that they will use every endeavour to prevent the victimizationor molestation of any person who is  thought to have aided, or sympathized with, theCrown Forces during the period  of conflict.  In their Main. Report the  Committee have recommended that there should be a  universal return  to the ordinary processes of civillaw as from the date of the  assumption of responsibility by the  Temporary ProvisionalGovernment.  In order, however, to avoid questions being raised prematurely as to the validity of measures&apos; taken during the period of conflict, it is not desirable that thereshould be a formal withdrawal of Proclamations or Regulations pending the passing ofan Act of Indemnity.     7. Martial Laiv, more especially in reference to the position of the Military in               Northern Ireland.   (See Section 3 of the Main Report.)     The Committee are strongly of opinion that after  the cessation of Martial Law in southern  Ireland  the maintenance  of  the  arrangements  in Northern Ireland, underwhich military officers are called on to act in a judicial capacity under the Restoration of order in Ireland Regulations and to discharge other duties of a civil character, can onlybe maintained with increasing difficulty as time goes  on.  This view has been  put  toSir James Craig at the request of the  Committee and he has expressed his generalconcurrence in the proposal that  the normal relations between the  civil and militaryauthorities in regard to  the maintenance of  order  should  be, made applicable  as soon aspossible to Northern Ireland.             8. Military Evacuation.  (See  Section 4 of the Main  Report).     All possible arrangements have been made in. advance for withdrawing the troops from Ireland.  Pending an order from Government to effect the withdrawal, instructions have been given that troops should be  concentrated as  described  in the War office memorandum of 21ST December  appended hereto.   (Appendix A.)     The  disposal of military buildings and  stores on  evacuation  was  referred to asub-committee presided over by the  Adjutant-General.   The  report as approvedis attached  (Apjoendix B).    The Committee recommend that the  Army  should  beresponsible  for guarding all important  military buildings, stores  and equipment untilsatisfactory arrangements have been made for their custody by the Provisional Govern-ment.  Where possible, stores should be concentrated, evacuated or otherwise disposedof.   The  Committee were  informed that stores  already transferred  to the DisposalBoard are being pilfered.  The matter has been brought to the attention of the Board.
   9. The Record Office.  (See end of paragraph 3 of section 5 of the Main Report.)     The Committee have pointed out in their Main Report that the case of the existingrecords deposited in the Public Record Office is une requiring special consideration.These records, though  held  in  Dublin, are not the  exclusive  interest of southern ireland.   They are British records relating to the affairs  of Ireland as a whole and theestablishment of  an Irish Free State  will not  materially diminish the  interest of theBritish Government (or of the Government of Northern Ireland in the event of NorthernIreland remaining outside the Irish Free State)  in their safe custody.  It must be pre-sumed that any suggestion  that  the records should be removed from Dublin, or, if left in Dublin, that they should he controlled otherwise than by the new Irish Government,would excite  the  strongest  opposition.   Further,  no  separation of  the  records  isphysically jJossible.  In these eircumstances the only question  that arises is  one  ofsafeguards.   It is important to  secure not  only that  the records shall continue to be freely accessible  both to the British Government and  to the Government of NorthernIreland,  but also that no  disclosure shall be made of confidential records in such a way as to cause either public or  private embarrassment.   The  Committee recommend,therefore, that the Irish representatives should be asked to agree, in  taking over the records      (l.) That they should be placed in the custody of a judicial authorhy occupying a            position analogous to  that of the  Master of the Rolls.     (2.) That  the  right  of  access   of accredited  representatives of  the  British            Government or the Government of Northern  Ireland to  records not open            to public inspection should be fully secured.     (3.) That  the  availability of the  records  for  other than  strictly departmental            purposes should be governed by the same rules  and subject to the same            limitations as are observed in the case of public records in Great Britain and            in  the Dominions, where  a practice uniform with  that  of the  United            Kingdom is understood to be in force.     The ordinary current records not yet transferred to the Public Record Office can bedealt with under  departmental instructions.        10. Transfer of Departments.   (See Section 6A of the Main Report.)     In the Main Report it is indicated  that certain  departments cannot be transferredimmediately to the Temporary  Provisional Government.  One  important  reason fordelay is  that,  in the  records  of the various departments are  confidential  papers  ofrecent date concerned with the  detection  of political  crime,  the disclosure of whichmight be prejudicial to the interests of many persons still resident in various parts  ofIreland.   Time must be given to remove all such  documents before the records arehanded over.   We understand that steps have already  been taken for this purpose.       11.  The Royal Irish  Constabulary.   (See Section 6 A of the Main  Report.)     A difficult situation has arisen by reason of the unwillingness of the Royal irish constabulary  to accept  transfer either to  the  Provisional  Government or  to theGovernment of Northern Ireland.  They ask for immediate disbandment on compulsoryretirement  terms,  and  the Committee, after  considering  the   report  of the  Sub-Committee appointed to examine the whole-question, have come to the  conclusion thatthe request cannot reasonably be  refused.  With the concurrence of the Chancellor  ofthe Exchequer an announcement  has been made to the Force in the terms recommendedby the Sub-Committee, a copy of whose report is attached.  (Appendix. C.)     The same considerations  do not  apply  to the case of the  Dublin MetropolitanPolice, and we recommend that this  Force should be transferred in the manner contem-plated by  the Government of Ireland Act.   We  consider, however,  that provision should be  made  for the  award  of special compensation  to members of this Force in exceptional  cases  as recommended for the Royal  Irish Constabulary.   112. Council of Ireland.  (See Section 6 of the Main Report, Subheads A and o.)     The scheme of the Main Report presupposes the utilization of the machinery of theAct of 1920.  Part of that machinery is the Council of Ireland,  which  by that Act  ismade the executive and legislative authority for the whole of Ireland in respect of three services Railways, Fisheries and the Diseases of Animals Acts.  The reason for singlingout these three services was that  it was considered that they were services in respect ofwhich unity of administration throughout Ireland is essential.
     In Northern Ireland the services  must be administered by the Council of Irelandand the services  transferred to the Council by the  2nd March next.  It is therefore essential to establish a Council of Ireland without  delay.     The question arises whether during the period, of the Provisional  Government theCouncil of Ireland should be clothed with powers in Southern Ireland.     The chief argument in favour of such a course is that the constitution  of a  bodyrepresentative of both parts of Ireland exercising  functions in both parts will afford anopportunity for the South and  North  to  work together  in  co-operation and to realizethe advantages of common action in matters of common  interest.     On the  other  hand Southern Ireland may  be reluctant pending the decision ofNorthern  Ireland on the main issue to  surrender executive control over any service to a body on which the Northern Parliament is represented.     In these circumstances the only course open seems to be to broach the subject withthe Irish representatives and to ascertain their views after the arguments on both sideshave been put before them.     In this connection should be noticed the somewhat  anomalous position created by article 12 of the  Treaty in the event of the Northern Parliament opting to stand out ofthe Free  State.   In Southern  Ireland the functions which .under  the Act of 1920 areassigned to the Council of Ireland will  be functions of the Free State  Government and parliament, whilst in Northern Ireland the functions will be performed by the Councilof Ireland, a body consisting as to half its members of representatives of the Free StateParliament.   This body  is  to  be  maintained,  though  the administration  of  theservices is to  be severed and the sphere of the activities of the Council will be limitedto Northern  Ireland.   And so the ground on which the  functions in question  wereassigned to the  Council of Ireland,  viz.  the  necessity  of unity of administrationthroughout Ireland, will have been cut away.             13. Postal Rates.  (See Section 6c of the Main Report.)     The Secretary of the Post Office has expressed the opinion  that it may be necessaryto increase the rates of foreign telegrams and parcels from  or to Ireland &quot; transiting &quot;Great  Britain, in order that the British Post Office may obtain its due portion of therevenue upon such messages and parcels corresponding to the work  performed by it.     The  Committee have  not, however, included this  recommendation in their MainReport because in their view the Provisional Government should be asked to accept theprinciple  that no change should be made in the United Kingdom rates of  taxationpending the establishment of the Irish Free State.  It is true that in many respects theIrish Post Office has been conducted at a loss to the Exchequer of the United Kingdom,so that during the term of the Provisional Government the British Exchequer stands to lose by maintaining the existing rates  on telegrams and  parcels.  In the opinion of theCommittee the measures to recover this loss advised by the Secretary to the Post office would   weaken the  general position  of the British Government in asking for thecontinuance of the United  Kingdom rates of  taxation and  tariffs  during the period ofthe Provisional Government.   If the existing  revenue departments  are to act as agents of the  Provisional Government, it  is  clearly of the  utmost importance that the taxesshould continue at United  Kingdom rates until they are handed over to the permanentcontrol of the Free State Government.                14.  Quit Rents.  (See Section 6o of the Main Report.)     In their  Main Report the Committee have suggested that quit  rents must continueto be  collected by or on behalf of  the Office of Woods  and Forests, until the mattercan  he dealt with in the Constitution of the Irish Free State.  A delicate question ishere involved.   These  quit rents- date from early times when Irish lands were heldforfeit  as a punishment for rebellion.   These  forfeited  lands were granted  to Britishsettlers subject to the emit rents which were paid to the Crown as personal  revenue.  in modern practice the personal revenues  are assigned by the Sovereign at the opening ofeach reign for his life time in return for the grant  of the Civil List.   The total of thesequit rents is comparatively small,  amounting with  other hereditary revenues of theCrown to  about 16,000^. per annum.   .  The  British Exchequer  is thus,  during  the life of the  reigning  Sovereign,responsible for meeting the  charges on the Civil List, in return  for  which it receivesthese quit rents and other personal revenues.  Thus, if  the  quit rents are made over tothe Irish  Exchequer, the British Exchequer  will  still  be responsible  for paying the
suras represented by them to His Majesty during his life.   His successor might properlyobject to their alienation beyond that period.    The Irish Government, however, will probably argue that these quit rents are theproperty not of the Crown in Great Britain but of the  Crown in Ireland, so that any arrangement made in respect of them must be made by the Irish Legislature.   It wouldseem that His Majesty and the Heir Apparent must be personal&quot; parties to any arrange-ment which is made ; but, subject to the Royal  consent, the Irish Government might BEasked to make an equivalent grant and collect the quit rents into their own Exchequer.            15. Alien Immigration.   (See Section 6 of the Main Report.)     The experience of the Home Office shows that it would be impossible to control alienimmigration into Great Britain via. Ireland except at  the Irish ports.   A memorandum from the Home Office on the subject is appended to this  report for &quot;the information,  ofthe Cabinet.   (Appendix D.)  In  the  view of  the Committee the Provisional Govern-ment should be asked  to  agree that the representatives of the  Home Office  shouldcontinue to control immigration at the Irish  ports,  until  some  definite scheme  fordealing with the  question has  been worked  out and settled between the British and irish Governments.         1G. Administration oj  Justice.   (See  Section 7 of the Main  Report.)     The Committee have had  the benefit of the advice of the Attorney-General on theadministration of justice during  the period of the Temporary Provisional Governmentand during  the  period of the  regularized Provisional Government.   This is given in amemorandum attached hereto.   (Appendix E.)        17.  Financial recommendations.  (See Section 8  of the Main Report.)     In their financial recommendations the Committee  have been  influenced by thefeeling that no motive should be given to the Temporary Provisional Government for raising  a further  loan from abroad. , They are, therefore, of opinion that, so far as the statutes governing public finance permit, no effort should  be spared to render  available from British and Irish, sources  whatever cash the Temporary Provisional Governmentmay need.
                            MEMORANDUM  BY  THE  WAR OFFICE.    1. Tlie War Office policy is to withdraw  all outlying  detachments and concentrate either in  NorthIreland or elsewhere, Dublin, the Curragh, and Cork, Ballincollig and Queenstown.    NOTE. Newbridge and Kildare are considered in the Curragh area and Dundalk and Tallaglit  in the dublin area.    2. When detachments are withdrawn, no rear parties will be left behind.    3. All arms and ammunition must be evacuated either before or with the troops.    4. Temporary lettings and requisitioned buildings should be returned to  the owners  on evacuation,fixtures or fittings being either removed or transferred to the owners at an agreed valuation.    5. Are the barracks  and War Department &quot;land (but  not the contents) to be regarded as Imperial orProvisional Government  property ?  The Colonial analogy  will  not  help  here  as the Colouies were notfinancially a part of the United Kingdom.    G. Mobilization equipment,  barrack stores, furniture,  stores in depots,  hospitals, officers&apos;and Serjeants&apos;messes,  institutes, &amp;c, cannot  be moved,  and the Provisional  Government should be  asked  to assume responsibility for their safe custody.    7. Sales of surplus stores, &amp;., will, it  is presumed, be carried  out by the Disposal Board, but theDisposal Board  should give the Provisional Government the option of purchasing any stores they may wish.    8. May military guards be withdrawn from aerodromes and when ?   The disposal of the aerodromes is amatter for the Air Ministry.    9. What will be the perimeter round  the harbour defences referred to in the Treaty ?    10. Tt is presumed that Martial Law will be withdrawn as soon as the Provisional Government, is set up.    11. Will the  Restoration of Order in  Ireland Regulations be withdrawn at  the same  time throughoutIreland ?    12. If they are not withdrawn what will be  the position  of the Competent Military Authorities, who,under these regulations, are largely responsible  for the Special  Constabulary and  also  for  the detention ofpersons suspected of crime?    13. What provision will be made for  the arrest of military offenders when  the forces are  withdrawnfrom Ireland ?    14. It, is  understood  that in the  case of. South Ireland, except in cases  of  grave and  immediateemergency, the Provisional Government will make their demand for the -employment of  troops through theLord Lieutenant who will himself requisition on the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief.  The procedurelaid down in King&apos;s Regulations whereby magistrates  may requisition in aid of the Civil Power will  not bein force.    15. What will be the procedure in North Ireland in similar circumstances?    Will demands be made to the Lord  Lieutenant or as in King&apos;s Regulations?    16. Will recruiting be.permitted in  South Ireland for the British Army?    17. What will be the position of Army reservists living in Ireland ?    18. What will be the position of the Royal  Hospital and  the Royal Hibernian Military School?  .    19. It is presumed that an Act of Indemnity will be passed at the earliest possible moment.    20. May the  rifles and ammunition  on the  War  Department  vessel  at  1&apos;embroke  Dock be sent toOarrickf ergus, and handed over to the Government in North Ireland ?    21. If&apos; there is an amnesty for Sinn  Feiners, it should not apply to soldiers, but the War Office will bemore lenient in the revision of sentences in connection with military offences committed in  Ireland.    22. It is recommended that instead  of providing accommodation  at Osvvestry for the demobilization ofthe Auxiliary Police, they should be demobilized at the port of disembarkation in this country,                                                                        T.

L, CURTIS.                                                                        G.  M.  W.  MACDONOGH.  The War Office.      21st December, 1 921.APPENDIX B.                     REPORT  OF THE ADJUTANT-GENERAL&apos;S COMMITTEE.                                    (i.) GOVERNMENT PROPERTY.  .    For the purposes of this Report all fixed Government property in Southern Ireland  may be divided into two categories :     (1.)  Properties which may be transferred  in due course  to  the regularized Provisional Government, as           belonging without question to the Irish Free State.    (2.) Properties to which the British Government has a claim either in whole or in part, which, if handed           over to the Provisional Government, can be transferred subject only to an ultimate settlement           of account.    On the principle that the Government of Southern  Ireland is to be handed over as a going concern, it follows that all properties used for the purpose of ordinary civil government, such as Departmental offices,
should be regarded  as belonging to Class (i) and handed over to the Provisional Government in due course.It should, however, be pointed  out  that  it is  involved in  this principle that the Irish Government should assume the  liabilities  together  with the assets, e.g., liability for pensions  payable to  Irish postal, oilicialsshould be assumed by tlie Irish Exchequer.     In Class (i)  should also  be  included all  police barracks and  establishments  required for policeadministration in normal and peaceful times.     In Class (ii) should be included  all police establishments created for the purpose of  restoring order sincethe Easter rising of 1916.     In Class (ii) should also be included for the present all  military  barracks and establishments,     All properties  in  Glass (ii) should be  handed over to the  Provisional Government subject  only to asettlement to be arrived at later on  between the British  and Irish Governments.   It should,  however, berecognized that the Irish Government may rightly claim a certain proportion of these military properties inview of the  fact that they were paid for by the United Kingdom funds, to which the Irish taxpayer wascontributing, also because they are  essential to the military responsibilities  assumed by the Irish Free State.     All movables should be claimed as  War Office properly,  and steps should be taken in conjunction withthe Disposal Board to sell them forthwith, except in so far  as the Provisional  Government may seek toacquire them at a valuation.  These sales will help to advertise the intention of the -British Government to evacuate without delay.     If these principles are accepted by the  Provisional Government, they  might be asked to undertake thesafe custody of any properties vacated by the military, pending a final settlement of accounts.     The Viceregal  Lodge, the Chief Secretaires  Lodge, &amp;c, should  be recognized as belonging to Class (i).     There  are certain buildings like the  Royal Hospital  which  are  subject to  ancient  statutory trusts.These  trusts will probably have to  be dealt with in the constitution of the Irish Free State,&apos;on lines to beagreed with the Provisional Government.     The lands and quit rents which form part  of the hereditary revenues  of the Crown must  also be dealtwith in the  same way.                                         (ii.) MARTIAL LAW,     In Southern Ireland Martial Law and the Regulations under the  Restoration of Order  in Ireland Actshould no longer be employed  as  an administrative  agency, but in order to avoid q questions  being raisedprematurely as to the validity of measures taken during the period  of  conflict, there should not be a formalwithdrawal  of proclamations or regulations pending the passing of an Act of Indemnity.     Certain military orders  such  as the orders prohibiting  the  holding  of coroners&apos; inquests  in  certain districts will, however, be cancelled in order to admit of the foregoing arrangements being carried out.                                (iii.) POSITION IN NOKTIIEKN IRELAND.     The Sub-Committee consider that the Regulations under the Restoration of Order in  Ireland Act should no longer be resorted to in Northern Ireland so far as they involve the intervention of military courts andmilitary officers.  Sir J, Oraig should be warned  of this intention in order that he may take such steps as hemay think necessary to meet the situation, by setting up, should  he  consider it essential for the  maintenanceof law and order in Northern Ireland to do so, some alternative machinery.   Such  machinery  would  have tobe of a purely civil  nature and not dependent in any respect on military courts.     Should  it be necessary to  invoke the. aid of the  military to deal  with riots (using that term in  contra-distinotion  to anything  in the  nature of  an insurrection) with which  the police forces at the  disposalof the Northern Government were  unable to cope, the. ordinary  procedure as.laid down by the  King&apos;sRegulations  should prevail.  Should the Northern Government be averse to allowing local magistrates in allcases to have the power of calling on the military for their assistance, arrangements could be  made wherebyreference  to headquarters in Belfast help  could ba required  before the military acted.     It &quot;would, of course, be  open  to the Northern  Parliament by legislation to restrict the common  lawpowers of magistrates, sheriffs,  &amp;o., to call on the military for assistance.                                                                          J. ANDERSON.                                                                          G. M. W. MACDONOGH.

(Report by Sir John  Anderson&apos;s Sub-Committee.)Report on Terms of Retirement to be offered to the Royal Irish Constabulary.                                Members of  the Sub-Committee.                      Sir John Anderson, Chairman,                      Sir Frederick Liddell.                      Sir Francis Greer.                      General Tudor,                      Mr. R. A. Johnson (Treasury).                      (Sir James Masterton Smith was also present.)The following questions were referred to the Committee for report:     (1.) What is the legal position  of men employed in the R.1.0. ?    (2.) What do the Committee recommend as to the  treatment of these men ?    (3.) What will be the cost involved by the answer proposed to question (2) ?    (4.) What is the.position in respect of the Royal Irish Constabulary in Northern Ireland ? (9031)                                                                                    B2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,             22nd December, 1921.
    The Committee  were also instructed to prepare a draft announcement to be made to the police at anearly date.    (1.)  The legal position may be stated as follows :     The terms of the Acts regulating the Royal Irish Constabulary axe such as to imply that members of theforce  are not liable to discharge before they  become entitled  to a pension on  any ground otlier thanincapacity or inefficiency.  Their position is  thus clearly by Act of Parliament differentiated  from that of ordinary civil servants.    It follows that the force cannot legally be disbanded, and, if it were disbanded, the disbandment wouldgive rise to a legal claim for compensation.    The posters inviting men to enlist advertised as an inducement to men to enlist the terms secured by theAct of 1920. .    The promises  implied  by the  posters could possibly not be  enforced by legal proceedings, but wouldcertainly be taken  into consideration by any tribunal to which- the question of the amount of compensationmight be referred  for arbitration.    It is to be noted, that whereas the Act  of  1914 conferred rights  of  compensation on members of theRoyal Irish Constabulary who retired voluntarily only if they had  joined the force  before the passing of thisAct, this limitation does not appear in the Act of 1920, and we are informed that it was deliberately omittedon the ground that its retention might prejudice enlistment  in the Royal Irish Constabulary after that Acthad been passed.    (2.) The Committee are of opinion that all regular pensionable members of tha Royal Irish Constabularywherever recruited  must be treated on the same footing ;  and  in view of the legal position  as abovedisclosed they do not consider that the compensation can in any case be  less than that accorded by the act of 1920 in the case of compulsory retirement.  Not to concede those terms to  the Force as a whole wouldbe to prejudice those members who have best served  the interests  of the Government  and in the  case ofthe British recruits  who have joined  within the past two years retirement on those conditions is virtuallyimplied by the terms of Article  10  of the  Treaty.  In addition,  special  consideration  would appear  to bedue to  Irish Members  compelled to quit the country or  to remove to a. new locality.  It is  suggestedthat a Standing Tribunal  should  be  constituted with power to  award additional  compensation  to  such members according  to  the circumstances of each case.  The Committee recommend  that  the followingannouncement be made at an early date :   .         His Majesty&apos;s Government lias accepted the principle that if- and when the Royal Irish Constabulary    ceases to exist as an Imperial force, the members of the force then serving will be permitted to retire    on pensions calculated on the terms provided  by  the Government  of  Ireland Act,  1920, for cases of    compulsory retirement.       .  Should, however, any pensioner take  service in  any police force, his pension will  be  liable to    suspension during such service.    (3.) and (4.)   The Committee estimate that the total cost of giving effect to these terms (apart from any additional compensation awarded) will be as follows.   This  charge will, of course, be diminished to theextent to which pensioners re-enlist in other  police  forces in Ireland or elsewhere.Approximate, Annual  Cost of pensioning  the entire permanent  Royal Irish Constabulary force  on the Compulsory                          Bitirement Terms. 1 Deputy Inspector-General    ..     ..     ..     ..     ..     1,000 2 Assistant Inspectors-General  ..            ..     ..     ..:     1,600 1 Commandant   ..      ..     ..     ..     ..     ..     ..      666 1 Surgeon ..     ..      ..........     ..      420 1 Barrack Master ..      ..     ,.     ..     ..     ....      466 28 County Inspectors    ..     ..     ..     ..     ..     ..    16,800 82 First Class District Inspectors      ..     ..     ..     ..    30,983 71 Second Class District Inspectors    ..     ..     ..     ..    18,291 111 Third Class District Inspectors    ..     ..     ..     ..    25,099 30S Head Constables     ..........    &apos; ..    72,893 2,093 Serjeants..........     ..     ..  346,914-10,244 Constables ..      ..........     ..  797,31612,928      /     &apos;  -                                      1,312,448    The approximate cost of pensioning the members of the Royal Irish Constabulary recruited in  Englandwill be 230,000?. per annum.  The course which we recommend will not bring any part of  the compensation payable within the strict letter of Article 10 of the Treaty so as to  saddle  the new Irish Government withliability.  It  is reasonable, however, to proceed on  the  assumption that the spirit  of  the  Article will be observed, and that the Irish Free State will in due course accept responsibility for so much of  the compensation as would have been payable if the southern portion of the force were transferred according to the procedure and provisions laid down in the Act of 1920.   So far as the  northern  portion of the force  is concerned, theCommittee is of opinion that ho difference whatever can in practice.be made in the terms offered to membersof the Royal Irish Constabulary in Northern Ireland.   So  far as the expense  of conceding the terms whichwe recommend exceeds the charge which would fall upon  the Government of  Northern Ireland on thetransfer of the force under the  Act of 1920, the  excess will  have to be borne by the Imperial Exchequer.The Northern Government should be invited to concur in  the proposal on this  understanding.

JOHNSON.                                                     L. CURTIS, Secretary.  23rd December, 1921.
                     NOTE  BY TUB HOME  OFFICE ON ALIEN IMMIGRATION.     The regulation of aliens is provided for by Orders in Council made under  Section  1  of the Aliens&apos;Restriction Act, 1914, as applied to  peace time by Section 1  of the Aliens&apos; Restriction (Amendment) Act,1911), for a period of 1 year and from year to year under the Expiring Laws (Continuance) Acts.     1. Immigration. The present Order in Council applies to the whole of the United Kingdom.  Under  its provisions all the aliens coming from outside the  United Kingdom are subject to inspection.   This, in effect,means the, examination of all  passengers  in  order that British subjects  may  be distinguished  from aliens,and to facilitate this examination and distinction all passengers are required to be in possession  of passportsor equivalent documents.     Certain ports in the United Kingdom  have  been scheduled in the Order as approved ports, and at these ports immigration officers have been  appointed by the Secretary of State to carry out  the provisions of theOrder.  The alien passenger  traflic is concentrated almost entirely at approved ports.     There are only two approved ports in Ireland at the present.lime Queenstown and  Moville at whichpassenger vessels from  United States ports  call  to- and from  ports in  Great Britain:  The inspection of passengers landing at Queenstown and Moville is carried  out by Immigration Officers, who  are  sent  fromLiverpool or  Glasgow as occasion may require, the work not being sufficiently continuous to justify permanentlocal staffs.   If both these ports had been situated in the jurisdiction of the [lister Government, no question would arise as regards the  present traffic,  as  under the Act which established the Ulster Government,  all matters affecting aliens were  reserved and the Immigration Officers appointed under the Aliens Order would still function. But both ports are situated outside  the jurisdiction of the Ulster Government, and as the AliensOrder will presumably cease to operate under the  new Government to be established for the rest of  Ireland,Great Britain will be left unprotected as regards the passenger, traffic from abroad to Free State ports unlessmeans are devised to  maintain the system of control set up by the Aliens Order.  This gap in the defences wouldbecome all the wider if  direct, passenger  communication were established between the  Free State and theContinent of  Europe,  and the passage to Great  Britain via the Free State would provide an easy route forundesirables  of all classes.     There are only two ways in which control can be maintained:      (1.) By subjecting the passenger traffic  from  Ireland to Great Britain to inspection;     (2.) By inspecting passengers from abroad at Irish ports.     The first method is so  beset  by difficulties as to be really impracticable.  It would  involve as  itsfoundation the  establishment of  the passport  system between Ireland and Great Britain which wouldcertainly arouse fierce public  resentment.  Even if the passport  system  could  conceivably  be adopted, theexpense  of maintaining  large  staffs  of immigration officers to  deal with the Irish traffic at the ports of arrival in Great Britain would be very great, as the present staffs at Liverpool and Glasgow. would  have tobe augmented, and entirely new staffs set tip at several  other ports, on the West Coast,  such  as  Holyheadand Fish guard. . There is  further  the  complication of  the  passenger traffic  from  Belfast, Lame andLondonderry, all under the jurisdiction of the Ulster Government.   This traffic would be free from controlunless the six Counties were  declared for this purpose ,not to form part of the United Kingdom, a  decision which the Ulster Government is little likely to accept; but if this traffic  were free from control it would beidle for obvious reasons to control the traffic from the rest of &quot;Ireland.     The only practical solution, therefore, would  appeal&apos; to be to maintain the inspection at Free State ports of passenger traffic  from abroad.   As a provisional measure,  and if  the Free State  Government wereagreeable, the immigration officers appointed under the Aliens Order could  continue  to act at any rate so longas the traffic continues in  its present channels.  The position would be  more difficult  if. direct passengercommunication  with the Continent were to be established during the provisional period, or if the Americantraffic were to be extended  to ports in the  Free  State  other than  Queeustown and Moville ; but provisioncould  probably be made  by a slight increase of staff to deal with all the requirements.  To get rid of the objection that would naturally be raised by the  Free State Government to the  exercise  of  authority within their jurisdiction by the agents of another government,  arrangements might  be made for the immigration officers to act at Free State ports as the agents of  the Free State Government.     The arrangements outlined above could, of  course, only endure during the provisional period,  and at theend of that  period the  regulation of aliens becomes entirely a matter for the decision  of the  Free StateGovernment.     It may be hoped, however, that the Free State Government would so deal  with  the matter as to maintainthe protection  which is secured for Great  Britain by the present system;  and  it would appear that theinterests of the Free State would lead in the same directiou, because it is within the knowledge of the HomeOffice that there are on the  Continent of  Europe and elsewhere very large numbers of undesirable aliens ofall classes who are only too anxious to gain admission to the British  Isles,  and  who, if the shores of Irelandwere left open, would be certain to seize any opportunity to set foot thereon.     This memorandum has only dealt with the broad aspects of  the alien question.   It  has  been thoughtbetter  not to complicate it with too much detail, but it may be pointed out that there are special restrictionswith regard to the admission  of former enemy aliens under  Section 10 of the Aliens  Restriction (Amendment)Act, 1919, which will  remain  in force until the end of  1922.  Unless these restrictions can be applied at the ports in the Free Stale, it would be impossible to carry out the provisions  of the Section withont the risk  of serious evasion.                                                         -           .     2. Registration and deportation. So far  as  the Aliens Order deals with registration  and  deportation of aliens, there is uo reason why the powers  and duties of the English Government in this connection should notbe handed over to the Provisional Irish. Government,  provided only that the Irish Government  will not in theexercise  of their power  of deporting undesirable aliens, send them to Great  Britain, except  solely for thepurpose of transit to their own country by arrangement with the English  authorities.
                           REPORT OP THE  SUBCOMMITTEE OX LAW.                                   (i.)  ADMINISTRATION  OF JUSTICE.                         ((/*)  During period of makeshift Provisional Government.     The  position of  the Judges of  the Supreme Court will  remain  unchanged.  No change  is either desirable or possible.     Their salaries will remain charged on the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom and they will be removable only on an Address being presented by both Houses of the Parliament of. the United Kingdom.     The same remarks, with no difference material for the present purposes, apply to County Court Judges.     It is presumed that Resident Magistrates  will  be dealt with in  the  same manner as the Royal Irish Constabulary&apos;,- and any recommendations on the subject  will be  made  by the Sub-Committee to which questions as to the police have been&apos; referred.     Other magistrates will continue to be appointed  by the Lord  Lieutenant, who in making the appoint- ments will presumably act on the advice of the Provisional Government.                       (b.) During the period of regularized Provisional  Government.     We assume that a Southern Irish  Exchequer  will have been established and a Southern Irish Legislature legally constituted having power to vote  and appropriate money.     On this assumption provision  would, if the Provisional  Government  so desired, be made for the payment of judicial salaries out of the Southern Irish  Exchequer, and for the substitution  of addresses by the Houses of the Southern Irish Legislature for addresses by the Houses of Parliament of the United Kingdom as the condition precedent to the removal of judges.     If so  the position of the existing judges would be materially affected, and it would be only right to give them the  option  conferred in  similar circumstances by the Act,  of  1020  [see  Schedule VII., Part III., paragraph 1 (V) and Section 54) of retiring on full pension  charged  in the first instance on the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom.     All these matters would require  legislation by Parliament, though the legislation might take the form merely of confirming an agreement if the  agreement was so drawn as to  contain the  detailed provisions necessary  for the  purpose.                       (ii.) DISSOLUTION  OP PARLIAMENT OF SOUTHERN  IRELAND.     There is no  doubt that the  Lord Lieutenant can dissolve the present Parliament of Southern Ireland and  summon a new Parliament of Southern Ireland (Section  11 (2) of the Act of  1920).  The dissolution would not, however, affect the Senate of Southern Ireland (Schedule IV, 2 (c) ).     The dissolution of the Parliament  would be effected by the issue of a proclamation declaring the calling of a  new Parliament and ordering the issuo of writs for the election of members.                                    (iii.) INDEMNITY AND  AMNESTY.     The consideration  of  this question  was. deferred until the  Colonial Office  had examined  into the precedents.  Nothing  can be effected by way of indemnity during the  period of the makeshift ProvisionalGovernment as indemnity can only be conferred  by Act of Parliament.   Amnesty on the other hand can beeffected at any time by the exercise  of the prerogative.  2,  Whitehall Gardens,          21st December, 1921.
