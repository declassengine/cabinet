MAUDAT^ FOR pAusSTiaa,               The following copy of a letter  dated  3rd  instant addressed             by Mr. Fisner to the Secretary  General  of the League          of nations on the subject of the appointment of the Commission          on religious (questions provided for  in Article 14  of the          Draft Mandate, is circulated for information.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.    13th January, 1922.  -                                               Offices of the Cabinet,                                                2, Whitehall Gardens, SW*jji                                                  3rd January, 1S22,          Sir,                 I have the honour to request  that you will  be as          good as to bring to the notice of  the Members  of the Council          of the League of nations the following observations of His          Majesty1a Government in regard to  the appointment  of tho          special Commission on religious questions  and claims whioh          is provided for in Article 14 of the Draft Mandate for          Palestine.                 In view of the world wide importance and interest          attaching to the obligations which Article 14 will,impose,          and seeing that it &quot;ata not yet boon  found  possible for the          Council to approve the Draft kaudate, his  uajesty:s Govorn-          ment are of opinion that it is highly desirable that the          appointment of the Commission in question  should bo under-          taken without further delay.r                 As the Council are aware, Article 14 provides that          the Chairman of the Commission shall be appointed  by the          Council of the League and that in  the composition  of the/
              tho Commission  the religious  interests oonoerned shallfe             he taken  into aocount.  His MajestyTs Government would              propose to proceed on-thoeo lines.  It is their intention              themselves to appoint a Vice-Chairman, and to invite              distinguished representatives of the loading Christian,             Moslem and Jewish interests to beoome Members of the              Commission, but they have hitherto refrained from             approaching any individual as they feel that until the             Council of the league has had an opportunity of express-              ing an opinion on the&apos; appointment of the Chairman, it             would be undesirable for the Mandatory Bower to proceed             with the appointment of the Commission, which is provided             for, not only in the Draft Mandate which-awaits the             approval of the Couhoil, but also in the Treaty of Sevres.                     While the provisions cf tho Mandate have not been            &apos; formally approved and issued by the Council of the league,             the Council has, through its President, in his letter of             the :3rd Odtober to  the Mandatory Governments, expressed             the hope that the Mandatory will continue to conduct the             administration of the territory in the spirit of the draft *                     In the circumstances His Majesty1 s Government             would be glad if tho  Council could see their way to             proceed with the appointment of a Chairman without  awaiting             the final definition of the mandate itself and  in tiiat             event His  Majesty1s  Government would  be  ready to communicate             for the confidential  Information of the  Council, the exact             composition of the Commission they have in mind, together             with  the names of the individuals who  will be invited to             eit upon it,                    I would add that it  is  not proposed that  salaries                                                         should/
should bo paid to the Members of the Commission &quot;butthat they should have thoir travelling expenses paid and that they should he entertained while at Jerusalby prominent Members of their ovVn oommuniti.es.  Iam to suggest that the incidental expenses of theOommlesion should be borne by the league of Nations*                 I have the honour to bo,                            Sir,                      Your obedient servant,                        $Signed!
