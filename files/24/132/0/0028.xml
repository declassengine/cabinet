ITALY AND ANGLO-FRENCH RELATIONS

AIDE-MEMOIRE

The Italian Delegation has taken cogniance of the Memorandum C.P. 3621. illustrating the proposed agreement between France and Great Britain by which the latter would undertake, for a period of ten years, to place her military, naval and air forces by the side of France in order to guarantee her Eastern frontier in the event of an unprovoked aggression on the part of Germany, and to concert with France the necessary measures to protect the neutrality of Belgium in the event of any German invasion of the latter.

The Italian Delegation is thankful for the previous communication given to it by the British Delegation of the said memorandum, and is gratified to have had an opportunity, in these days, to talk over both with the British and the French Delegations the bearing and the significance of the agreement by which they propose to guarantee the safety of the eastern frontier of France and the neutrality of Belgium, which represent vital interests for both parties.

The Italian Delegation, from its own point of view, cannot refrain from drawing attention to the first that the

Cannes tVenx^^^                               only two ques-tions, namely, German reparations and the economic re construe-tion of Europe,  in the discussion and solution of which,  Italy has placed herself above all selfish purposes in order tocontribute with her fullest and warmest co-operation towardsthe establishment and maintenance of real peace and theeconomio reconstruction of Europe.     The/third question, namely, the safety of Franoe, is not included in the  program of the present Conference ( as itappears from the nemor-andum) and the agreement reached by france and Great Britain cannot, therefore, be considered as a result of the Cer&amp;as, C-onf erence *     The agreement has, on the contrary, originated fromreiterated conversations which have taken place elsewherebetween the two countries, which have always succeeded in finding a &quot;terrain d*entente&quot; when discussing their partiou-^lar interests J the Brit ish, memorandum itself gives tounderstand that the consent of France to the British plan of economic reconstruction of Europe has been a condition as against the British guarantee for the safety of theEastern frontier of Franoe.     In establishing, therefore, which are the results ofthe Cannes Conference proper, and whioh are the results ofthe agreement between two of the participants to it5i theItalian Delegation feels that it would not be living up
 to the spirit of sincere friendship whioh has characterised the fre- quent meetings of all the Powers, which have won the great war, If it was hot to express its views aoncerning the covenant of guarantee) which is being entered Into by Great Britain, and Prance *  Kobody can doubt the peaceful intentions with which the two countries propose to sign tho agreement, which is to guarantee the safety of Prance against a possible unprovoked aggression by Germany. If, as the hopo is expressed in tho memorandum, the agreement will sucoeod ih discouraging German attacksj if it will succeed in pre- venting Germany from seeking agreements and alliances In order to keep alive the sentiment of &quot;revanche&quot; of part of its people, the agreement will, certainly be of the.greatest help in preserving the world&apos;s peace.   Likew/sei if the guarantee given by Great Britain to Prance will not affect the close cohesion of the Entente, which must survive for all the scopes for which it has been kopt up, any weakening of the Entento will bo avoided.   But, even granting all the above, the Italian Delegation cannot rofrain from observing that, in order to attain the same results more effectually, it might have been preferable to follow a  course which would have unquestionr&amp;y strengthened the whole Entento (which has identical interests to support in full solidarity and equality). instead of proceeding to the conclusion of separate agreements for the safety of one particular frontier.   In the opinion of  tho Italian                            would Delegation the first course/      have been more likely to disoour- cge any aggrossDvn intention of ono Power, or of a possible new grouping of Powers and to better promote the maintenance of general peace.   It is gratifying, however, to find that this thought of the . Italian Delegation finds its counterpart in the hope expressed byXV the British Government in tho latter paragraphs of its  memorandum, that, out of the next economic Conference, to which tho victors and the vanquished will bo invited, there will arise a broader, stronger and more durable understanding, Triton Hotel,   Cannes,                                   2f -hitohall Gardens, S,&apos;W0      January 13th, 19..&apos;  .                         17th January, 1922,          U.-1&apos;   .                     ;                              &quot;
