IHTERBATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE,  GENEVA,                           OCTOBER - NOVEMBER,1921.     Report by tho British Government Delegates        Sir montague Barlow - Parliamentary secretary to the                              Ministry of Labour,                              and        Sir Daniel Hall    - chief Scientific Adviser to  the                              Ministry of Agriculture.1.        The Third Meeting of tho General Conference of  the     International Labour Organisation assembled at  Geneva on     the 25th Ootoher, 1921, and closed on the  19th  November,     1921.2.        The Cabinet are&quot;already familiar with the  subjects     disoussed at this meeting.   It will be remembered that     before the Conference met, the reports of  the International     Labour Offioe, (including drafts of Conventions and     Recommendations circulated as &quot;baBes of discussion),  were     examined by the International Labour Committee  under the     Chairmanship of Sir Montague Barlow, parliamentary Secretary     to the Ministry of Labour.   As a result of this examination,     draft instructions were submitted to the Cabinet and     approved (See CP. 3215 and 3417).3.         It is proposed in due oourse to submit to  the Cabinet     a detailed report on the results of the Conference with     proposals for definite aotion.   At this stage  it is only     necessary to indicate briefly the deoisions of  the     Conference in respect of each item of the  Agenda, and to     add a few general observations.- 1 -
4*        In the appendix each item is dealt with separately,     and an account is given of the course of the debates;     the nature of the proposals finally agreed;   and tho     attitude adopted by the Government Representatives.5.        The chief Recommendations or Conventions adopted     wore as follows     (i)  Agriculture *  The French for Bomestio parliamentary     reasons wished to rule out the discussion of limitation     of hours in agriculture altogether as not within the     competence of the International Organisation,,   In     accordance with instruct!one Sir l\ call spoke with     effect in favour of the subject being discussed^     Eventually the question of the limitation cf hours     worked in Agriculture was referred to a future Conference,     but Conventions or Recommendations cf a general     character were passed with regard to (a) unemployment in     Agriculture;   (b) protection cf women at childbirth, and     when employed on agricultural night work;  and (o)     protection of young persons generally,  and also when     engaged on night work.          General  Recommendations or Conventions were also     carried on wider aspects of agricultural work, such  as     agricultural  education, and the rights of association     of agricultural workers in Trade Unions,     (ii)  Anthrax^   It was agreed that this matter was  not     ripe for a Convention, and largely at the instigation     of various representatives from different parts of the     British Empire, it was agreed that the proposed     Convention should stand over for the present, and mean-     while the Governing Body of the I* .0,  should be asked     to summon a Committee representing the chief States- g -
concerned, to enquire further into the whole questionof Anthrax and its prevention.   The Committee, it wa.3suggested5 when summoned should moot in London, andthe British Government should be asked to nominate theChairman.   The Governing Body have generally approvedthese suggestions.     Anthrax is largely a domestic question for theBritish empire.   India and Australia, as the chiefwool exporting countries of the world, expressed someannoyance that the subject had been ptit down for discussion at the Conference by the representative of Groat britain on the Governing Body, without their having been in anyway consulted or warned.   In view of this it is satisfactory to record that, at the suggestion of theIndian Delegates, Sir Montagu? Barlow presided at aprivate and informal meeting of all the Empire Delegates,at which the most friendly spirit was shown, and the compromise above indicated wa3 worked out*fiii)  Weekly Rest Day.  A Convention was carried by 73votes to 24, recognising the principle of the weeklyRest Day in Industrial Undertakings;  but allowing each  -State to make its own exceptions, provided a list of such exceptions be sent to Geneva for registration.     Owing to a clause containing difficult provisions for compensatory periods of rest, in the case of any timeworked on Sunday, we were unable, in accordance with our instructions, to support the Convent-ion.   The FrenchGovernment Delegates, who had definitely given under-takinge to us that they would vote against the Convention,unfortunately changed their n.;nds at the last moment.The South African Government Delegates also voted against
the Convention,   The  Indian Government Delegates voted for the Convention, hut at the same time announced that,owing to the compensation provision, their Governmentwas not to be treated  as bound by their vote.     As to Weekly Host Day in Comraorolal as distinct from Industrial Undertakings, a reoommcn&amp;ati-on  in general terms was adopted, to  the effect that each State shouldtake measitres to seottre its observance.     The proceedings in connection 7/ith the Weekly HestDay illustrate a difficulty which arises in countries such as Groat Britain, where advanced social conditionsare based, not on legislation, but on long-establishedcustom,   On tha adoption by the Conference of  a draft carnationfmforcing  as an international obligation the observance of the custom in question, it becomes necessary for such countries to introduce and carry legislation which may involve considerable domestic diff.icul.national without therebyimproving the local labour conditions by one iota.(ivj  White Lead.   This constituted the great  success ofthe Conference.   For  the first timo in the history ofthese Conferences a solution of a difficult question was arrived at - of a kind which was welcomed prao tic allywith unanimity, by Delegates alike of Governments,,Employers and Torker3.     At first any solution 3Semed out of the question*The Workers pressed the hiimaJii.tariari---aspoct, anddemanded complete prohibition*   Important Trade interests were involved, and the Lead Industry on one side, andthose interested pi the manufacture of zinc substitutes(espocially in Franoe  and Belgium) on tho other, producedmuch conflicting expert evidence before the Committee,dealing with the subject.
          The Home Office  had  recently appointed  a Committee     to Investigate the  whole  position de  novo, and our     instructions were  therefore  to  take no  part  in the  dispute,     which in effect resolved  Itself into  one  of  total prohibit     tion as against reasonable regulation.          Eventually,  at tho last moment,  and  largely through     the admirable skill and tact of Dr. Legge, tho Senior     Medical Homo Office Inspector,  a compromise  acceptable     to all was arrived at.          As this compromise was  welcomed  with practical     unanimity by all the  throe groups,  (Government,  Employers     and Workers), and as  there seemed a risk  of  the Convention     not obtaining the necessary  quorum, whiioh would have &quot;been     a calamity, we decided, with the full approval of those     representing the Home Office, to exercise discretion and     vote for the Convention.   But  Sir M. Barlow was careful     to give his reasons for  so doing and  to make It clear that     the support of the British Government Delegates was     conditioned by the compromise,  and was confined to  the     points olearly and finally agreed.6.   Unemployment.          In addition to the  items on the  Agenda, the Conference     discussed other matters,  of  whioh the most  important was     the world&apos;s unemployment  crisis.          The subjeot came before the full Conference in the     form of a resolution asking  the Office to institute an     anquiry into the international aspect of, and means of     combating unemployment.    This seemed to suggest the old     enquiry, which the Italians  are still constantly pressing,     as to the possibility of some international  pooling of     raw materials.
          Consequently,  in the  discussion,  we  forced  the     debate on to more practical lines,  explaining the     definite and elaborate steps recently  taken by     Great Britain to deal with the  evil;   we  also obtained     amendments to the resolution^ whereby  the scope  of     the enquiry was modified so as  to  lay  stress on  tho     national aspects of the  problem;   and  the strong and     impartial Finance and Economic  Section of the League     of Nations was to be asked tc assist the  enquiry.     Subsequently a paragraph was added at  tho instigation     cf the French Workers1 Delegate. Instructing the     Office to do all in its  power to bring about a general     international conference en the unemployment question.7 ^   Voting,          The voting at  the Conference  does not call  for     detailed analysis,  as,  in  most  cases-,  the voting was .     practically unanimous,   Generally, however, the     Workers acted as- a  group,  although the English speaking     workers shewed a desire  for common sense  and moderation     which had great influence, and  at  times tended even     to estrange them from the  Continental  workers,          As on previous occasions,  the South  American States     voted In a solid block,    This  was particularly  apparent     in the appointments of the different Commissions^     There was also apparently  an understanding between     Germany and tho South American  States, as they supported     one another continuously during the elections of the     different Commissions and  officials of tho Conference.          The composition of the Conference may be noted  in     connection with the voting.  Of the- 54 States members     of the Organisation, 25  sent a  full complement of
Delegates, 5 States sent two Government Delegates only,while 9 sent one Government Delegate only-   Thus, ofthe total of 119 Delegates. 69 represented Governments,and 85 employers and 25 workers,   Tho result was thatthe basic idea of representation, as laid down inpart XIII of the Treaty, i0Oo that the total numbersof the throe groups should be a multiple of tho numbers2, 1, 1. disappeared,, and there was a fooling, especiallyamong the Labour group, that this was unfair to theemployers and workers.M^^lL^^^tH^^l^&apos; 4&amp;e*9.*oa*&apos; Da legations&apos; J?* ^eBr it i sir&apos;jSmpIre 7&quot;&quot; &apos;                 .....  ......&apos;     Throughout the -work of the Conference, the relationsbetween the members of the different British EmpireDelegations were of a very friendly character-,   Wo gavetwo &quot;At Homes&apos;1 to the whole Delegations of the BritishBrapire, (Government, Employers and Workers - Delegatesand Advisers) 3 which were well attended;,  and promotedfriendly relations..   A pleasing feature was that theDominion Delegates themselves showed their desire tosecii.ro  the closest possible co-operation,,   On more thanone occasion during the Conference9 meetings wore held atthe express dosire of the Dominion Delegates under theChairmanship of Sir Montague Barlow,     Articles appeared in the Press while the conference was in session which suggested want of co-operationbetween the different Members of the British Empire andeven tantagonism bet-ween the Dominions and the mother country.   The Dominion Government Delegates expressed their desire to join in contradicting this;  and inview of the possible harm that such an article mighthave, a notice in the following terms was published
in the press of the  26th November :-     &quot;On tha last day of the International  Labour      Conference at  Geneva,  all the Government  and      Dominions Delegates met and signed the      following statement,  in view of reports that     - there had been an unfortunate clash between      the Government delegates of Great  Britain and      the Dominions:&quot;     &quot;During the whole conference a most friendly      spirit of co-operation prevailed between  the      representatives of the Governments of Great      Britain and the Dominions.

With his wide parliamentary and business experience, he was able to  conduct  the proceedings on lines resembling tho  normal parliamentary procedure of the English speaking countries.      The question of the Chairmanship of the next Conference will doubtless be considered by the Govern- Ing Body before long, and there is  reason to believe that a proposal to invite Lord Burnham  to be Chairman at next yearTs Conference will be considered.

               ABBEilDXXcItem I.  Reform of the constitution of the Governing Body;     The present constitution of the Governing Body has caused dissatisfaction for two reasons;  first, on thepoint of the eight States of chief industrial importance,and secondly, on that of representation of non--european states,,   On tho first, the Council of the League, who havebeen considering the question, are being urged to expeditetheir decision.   On the second,, the Conference has recom-mended that the system of substitutes should be extended soas to permit Government representatives to be accompaniedby substitute members who are not necessarily of the samenationality.   In the case also of the employers7 and workers&apos; representatives, each group may nominate sixsubstitute members-   The expenses of three of thesesubstitutes from each group will be borne by the Office.Further, it is recommended that at the next election ofthe Governing Body (at the W2Z Conference), four government representatives and at least one employers1 and one workers1representative shall be non--European.   It is generally recognised that little can be done without amending theTreaty and the Governing Body are charged with the dutyof examining the possibility of such amendment, and ofmaking recommendations to the next Conference..Item 2:  Adaptation^to Agricultural Labour of the Washington         dSOTSTSDS opneeiriing ^he Regulairiorroi&apos;&apos;The., hours&quot;         oT&quot;wor&quot;kl          &quot;     The Conference opened with a brisk debate on theprotest of the French Government against the inclusion ofAgriculture among the Agenda for tho Conference,  The FrenchGovernment held that the LL^O. was not empowered by its constitution to deal with agriculture, further that thiswas an inopportune time to consider hours of work in
agriculture whon in all countries tho need for increased production was so great.   On the question of competencetho French view was defeated by 74 to SO,  and the BritishGovernment delegates voted in -the majority.     The French Governmentrs demand to strike the agri-cultural items off the Agenda was then debated item byitem,   Under Article 402 of the Peace Treaty,  it is open to any Government to protect against  retention onthe Agenda of items to which it takes objection andin. such cases a majority of two-thirds is&apos;then ns&amp;psaaryto retain the Items on the Agenda.-   Item  II,  dealingwith the regulation of hours of work, was  struck offthe Agenda. 53 votes &quot;being cast, for its retention,against 39 for its rejection;  thus the proposal didnot obtain the necessary two-thirds majority.    TheBritish. Government-s Delegates voted for retention,on tho ground that it was desirable that tho question should be fully discussed, and that discussioncommitted the Conference to nothing. .  speaking generally, the Employers&apos; Delegates voted  for deletion,together with the Government - Delegates of Belgium,France, Greece, India, Japan, Holland, Switzerland,South Africa and Australia.     A vote was taken on the retention of  Item III oftha Agendawhich was retained by 90 votes to 17,Again Item IV was retained by S3 votes to  13, theBritish Government Delegates voting with the majority,in both cases.    These items were then sent to the commissions for.consideration.    It may bo notod thatthe French Government representatives took no furtherpart in the consideration of Agricultural  questions.
     In this connection it should be mentioned that aHe solution was submitted to the Conference proposing thatthe question of the regulation of hours of work inagriculture should bo inserted iii tho agenda of a futureConference.   This Resolution was adopted by 73 votes to18a   The Resolution was printed on tho Agenda of the dayas being submitted in the names of the Italian, Britishand Dutch Government Delegations, but the BritishGovernment Delegates had not in fact authorised any suchResolution, although in response- to an enquiry by theItalian Government Delegation it had been stated ingeneral terms that they were disposed to support sucha proposal.   As the Resolution had been printed it didnot seem desirable to make any formal protest.Item 3 A.Ljleasures for the Prevent ion of i or providj.ng jagainstUne mpIcyment.     The Committee dealing with this question did notadopt the usual form of recommending the members of theInternational Labour Organisation to take certain measures, but instead recommended that they should consider measures for the prevention of unemploymentsuitable to the economic and agricultural conditions ofthe country, and that they should examine particularly the advisability of adopting the specific measuresset out.   With some alterations in drafting, themeasures recommended for consideration agreed withthose indicated in the draft Recommendation submittedby tho labour Office.   Article 3, however, whiohproposed that the State should take steps to create a system of ownership of small farms by means of theprovision of State credit, was out out.  To the                      - 11 -
 proposal  to  t-no our age  the  creation of  ce.-operative societies  for the working, purchase  or renting  of land, was  added  a  rider recommending  the development  of credit- facilities for such  societies.      In the  discussion it  was decided  to  insert  in the preamble  a general reference to the  Washington  Conference. on the basis that the  Conventions  and  Recommendations regarding  unemployment  adopted  at  that Conference should be  regarded in principle a-s no  loss applicable to agricultural than to industrial workersc      A motion moved  on  behalf of the workers with the object of  giving the State power to  control the  ciiltiva- tion  of land, was rejected by 45 votes to 6.      At the  final vote  an  amendment was moved to delete the resolution concerning  tne creation of co-operative societies  for the working  of land, and the granting of credit therefor..   The  amendment was rejected by 58 votes to 32*   The delegates  of Great Britain voted with the majority.    The draft recommendation submitted by the Commission was then carried by 75  votes to 19, the Government Delegates of Great Britain  voting with the majority. It eaT 3-.31 Protection of men and Children,  part T.L prolTecTion pi 71 omen &quot;beTora and&apos;&quot; sfTTor ^ ohn.dbirthi     An amendment was moved to convert  this recommendation into  a Convention.   This was carried  by 47 votes to 44- The Government representatives of  Great Britain voted in the minority.   It was  then referred back to the Commission for reconsideration^ but as the vote had shown that a Convention would not obtain the-^nece^sary two-thirds majority,   it came back from the Commission,-again In theform of a Re commend at ion--and at the final voting the
Recommendation was oarried by 55 votes to 14, with 7abstentions.   The representatives of tho Government ofGreat 3ritaln abstained from voting,  and made a statement at the Conference defining the position of Great Britain -that women engaged in agriculture in Great Britainreoeived exactly the same benefits as other women, whichbenefits, however, could not be regarded as in all respects similar to those laid down in the WashingtonConvention.Part 2.   Rogulationiof the employment of women working          during the night in&quot;&quot;lgriculture;     The- report of the Commission recommended that the night -work of women workers in agriculture should be soregulated as to secure to them a period of rest of notless  than 9 hours, which shall, if possible, beconsecutive.  At the final voting, the Cuban Delegatemoved an amendment to mak- the 9 hours consecutive,but this was lost by 51 votes to 29,  the repre sent a-tives of Great Britain voting with the majority.The Hecommendation in its original form was thenoarried by 90 votes to 4, with one abstention, therepresentatives of Great Britain voting in the majority,Part 3.  Regulation of the employment of children and         Young Persons&apos;&apos; In AgriourSural work&apos;;&quot;     A motion to convert the Recommendation into aConvention was oarried by 73 votes to none, and thematter was referred back co the Commission.   the drafting Committee found considerable difficulty ininterpreting the draft Recommendation submitted by theInternational Labour Office and adopted by theCommission, and eventually submitted a much modifieddraft to give effect to what appeared to be the
the intentions of the Commission,    This read thatchildren under the age of li yoars may not be employedor work in any public or private agricultural under-taking or in any branch thereof, save outside the hoursof school attendance.   At the instance of Sir MontagueBarlow this was amended to &quot;hours  fixed for school attendance&quot; both in order to agree with the French textand tc be in harmony with the preamble which speaksof &quot;compulsory school hours&quot; o   Thus the Conventionmay be held not to apply to countries where attendance at school is not fixed by a competent authority.,    Thearticle further prescribed that if employed outsideschool hours, the employment shall not be ouch asto prejudice their attendance at school,.   Furtherarticles permit the employment of  children on lightagricultural work for the purpose  of practicalinstruction provided that thereby  tne period of school attendance is not reduced to less than 8 months in the year.     In this form the Convention was adopted by 85 roteto 1.Part 4,  Employment^ofrchildren jf or^night work inAgrIculturea     This was modified by the Commission by divisioninto two Recommendations, one concerned with children under 14,for whoa it was recommended that a period ofnot less than 10 censeeutivo hours&apos; rest should be assured, and the other dealing with young personsbetween the ages of 14 and 18 - the Recommendation was eventually referred back to the Commission forre-censideration.     On discussion, the Delegate from Cuba proposed
that for young persons the period q,f rest to be assuredshould consist of at least 9 qon.eeoutive hours, andthis amendment was oarried by 43 votes against 29.On the final vote Sir Daniel Hall pointed out t.he effectof this amendment in preventing &quot;boys from, learning1 theoccasional skilled night work which ooours in agriculture,suoh as shepherding, and protested that the representa-tives of Great Britain would be unaole, therefore,to vote for the Recommendation.   The Re.commena.ationwas oarried by 82 votes to 5, with 6 abstentions,amongst whom were the Government representatives ofGreat Britain.Item 4 of the Agenda,  Measures for the protection ofagricultural workers.&apos;(a)  Recommendation concerning the promotion of Technioal     &quot;Bduo at ion,     The recommendation drafted by the Offioe was adoptedby the Commission, and finally oarried unanimously inthe Conference.(b)  Recommendation concerning tho living-in conditions     ofiWorkers.     Considerable discussion took place as to the exactmeaning of the text submitted.  In Article 2, theCommission inserted an addition specifying that theregulations were applicable to housing provided by employers for workers living with their families.  AsIt was clear that such a regulation would involveinspection of tied cottages upon farms, the british delegates moved the deletion of the words &quot;with their families&quot;.   This amendment was lost by 32 votes to 28.On the final voting the Recommendation was carried by74 votes to 12, with 4 abstentlents.   The government delegates of Great Britain voted against the Recommendation.
Item 4. (o).  Convention regarding, right a of Association ofAgrioultural Workers.     When this Report oamo oapk from the Oommission, wordshad &quot;been inserted to seoure that agricultural workersoould obtain rights of combination and association both in law and in praotloe, and further words were also Insertedguaranteeimg to workers full right to belong or not to belong to Associations.     Upon the motion of Sir Montague Barlow these wordswere struck out, and the Convention was finally carried in the form originally proposed.   One minor alteration in form was adopted, viz. the reading &quot;all those engagedin agriculture&quot; instead of &quot;agricultural workers employedwithin Its territory&quot;.4*(d)(1).  Draft Convention extending the AgrioulturalWage^arners^&quot;&apos;Provisions concerning Workmen^s Compensation(Oompte Rendu 12, 17).                  &quot;     Both before the Commission and the Conference thequestion was raised of reoiproolty with regard to thetreatment of migratory labourers who suffered the effeotsof an aocident when working in a foreign oountry.    the amendments on this point were dropped, in considerationof the fact that the whole question of reoiprooity i3covered by the Washington Reoommendation concerningReciprocity of Treatment of Foreign Workers, whiohprovides for agreements to be made between countries.In order to prevent any confusion between this convention and the governing Washington Convention, the words &quot;omploy-ed within its territory&quot; were struck out of tha draftsubmitted by the Office, whioh read &quot;undertakes to extend to all agricultural wage-earners employed within its territory&quot;.   When the final text was submitted to the
Conference, the Convention was adopted oy 81 votes to 13.The Government Delegate a of Groat Britain voted with themajority.4. (d) (iil.

Tho draft submitted by the International Labour Officespoke- of extending to agricultural wag a-earner 3 &quot;its laws and regulations instituting systems of sooial insurance&quot;.   Itwas pointed out that these words introduced an element of uncertainty, and that it would DO better to define them by substituting tho words &quot;insurances against old ago, sickness and invalidity&quot;.   This was done, but the effect was nulli-fied by a further amendment which added the words &quot;other similar sooial girls&apos;*s&quot;.    It having been pointed out that in belgium and one or two other countries insurances against such matters as large- families and thy- death of the wage-earner were in force, the Committee further decided by a very&apos;narrow majority to turn the- lie commendation into a convention and in this form it came before the Conference.   At theConference, the representative of tho employers ofGt. Britain moved an amendment to substitute a recommendation for a Convention, and also to omit the words &quot;other similarsocial risks&quot;.   This amendment was carried by 55 votes to35, because it was evident from the narrowness of themajority the Convention proposal had obtained on the Corn-mission, that in the Conference the necessary tvo-thirds majority could not bo obtained.   A further amendment,however, to restore th* words &quot;other similar social risks&quot;was carried.   On the final vote, tho Recommendation wasadopted by 84 votes for, 2 against, 8 abstentions, amongstwhom were the Government representatives of Great Britain,who abstained because of the ambiguity residing in thewords &quot;other similar social risks&quot;;,
Item 5.    Di.sir.fection of aonl Infected with anthrt..?. spores.     The proposals submitted by the International LabourOffice to the Conference provided for the prohibition ofthe Import of scheduled suspected ivools unless previouslydisinfected;  the appointment by the Governing Body cf anInternational Anthrax Commission of technical experts todraw up and revise at intervals a schedule of suspected, woolsand to Investigate and report upon methods of disinfection,and arrangements for transport;  tc investigate complaints,and to report on the prevalence of anthrax and the measures ..taken for its prevention in stool producing countries.     The British Delegates had bain instructed tc press fora Convention on the lines set out above.     After  lengthy discussion in committee, it was decidedfor various reasons that the adoption of a Convention and recommendation on the subject would be premature withoutfurther investigation and in Its place a suggestion wasadopted providing for -           (1) Consideration of a Convention being post-     pcned  on the ground that the question has not yet     been sufficiently  studied.          (ii) Requesting the Governing Body to appoint an     Advisory Committee  composed 6f representatives  of     the chief wool producing  and consuming countries      (including,  if possible,  the United States) to     examine the  question in all its bearings  and report     in time for  the  1923 Conference.         (lii) Requesting that  the  above Committee should     be instructed  to enquire  and  report fit the  same  time     on. the most  effective measures for  eradicating     anthrax among  animals.
     from hides, skins, and oluor materials.     This result represented- the general feeling, of theCommission ;  Great Britain pressed for a Convention, butreceived support only from the German and SwedishGrovernments ..   of the employers rally the Germans supported the C -n vent ion.   The British Government did not receivethe expected support from the British, employers, who were.represented at the outset by an East Anglian Importer,This gentleman made a violent attack on the BritishGovernment  for having thrown the cost. of disinfection on.tho woel trade instead of on the State, and suggested thatif the State . here the cost there would be no need for aConvent ten-.   Later, the British employers were represented by a wool  spinner,, who supported tha Convention, but theImpression left was that the British employers were luke-warm.  Of  the workers, the British and South african representatives sp--ke  strongly  in favour of a Convention,but did not receive active hacking from the other nations.      It became plain that  there was  no possibility ofsecuring  -one requisite majority for  a Convention, theBritish Government  accepted  the compromise  outlined above , on  the basis that  the  proposal would not beindefinitely shelved out merely postponed  to  a  futureConference.  The  resolution  finally agreed to was arranged  in informal consultation with representativesof the British  Dominions  and  France ,  and was  unanimouslyadopted by the  Conference.Item  6.    Prohibition  of  the  use  cf  white  lesd  in           painting&quot;.      The  international Labour Office  submitted  to  theConference the  draft Convention providing  for                            -  ID -
(a) prohibition in external and internal painting of buildInand (b) regulation of Its use in other painting work.     After a lengthy discussion the White head Commissionsubmitted to the Conference two reports - a majority reportsupported by thirteen members., proposing a Convention forpreventive regulations (on the lines drawn up in accordancewith the advice of the Rome Office Technical Adviser),coupled with compulsory notification and verification ofcases of lead poisoning;  and a minority report supported bythe remaining eleven members in favour of prohibition inInterior painting of buildings and regulation In exteriorpainting.     vfnen the matter came before the General Conference,a resolution was moved by ft. God art, representative of theFrench Government, on the line of the minority report.   in moving this resolution M. Godart pointed out that Frenchexperience tended to show that regulation was ineffective,whereas as the result of prohibition the number of cases cflead poisoning had shrunk: from 361 in 1912 to 6 in 1920.After considerable discussion the motion was carried by amajority of one.   It therefore became clear that in theabsence of a compromise no Convention or Recommendation onthe subject would command the necessary two-thirds majority.All sides however, were anxious that some settlement shouldbe arrived  at, and in spite of the great divergence of views, at the eleventh hour  an agreement was reached, by&apos;which white lead would be prohibited  (subject to certain exceptions) for internal paint ins; of buildings, the  erohibl-tion to taice effect after a  period of six years; while its use in other operations would be subject to regulations,
which would be brought into operation r,t ores.    AConvent 1-on on these lines was adopted unanimously by theConference at its last sitting.     The British Government Delegates had instructionsto adopt n strictly neutral attitude, so as not to prejudice the reconsideration of the cuestion when thenew Committee, appointed by the  Home Office, has completed its enquiries.   The Delegates, therefore, didnot vote on M. Grdart&apos;s motion.    Subsequently, when ithad been ascertained that both sides were disposed to a compromise the Delegates felt justified in taking an active agreement on the lines set out above, and whenthe draft Convention  was finally put to the vote the delegates voted for It, after an explanation by SirMontague Barlow that  they felt warranted In taking this course In view of the unanimous nature of theagreement , and of the fact that there was some risk that owing to a quorum not being obtained the Conventionmight, through technical reasons, fail to pess.   SirMontague Barlow made  it clear at the time that If any difficulties  should at a later stage prevent the ratification  cf the Convention, the British Governmentwould not be  bound by the votes which Its delegates were new about to cast.
Iten 7.   The Weekly Rest, pay In Industrial and Commercial          Employment.     Sir Montague Barlow, was chosen Chairman of thisCommittee , which was a large one of ever 30 members.M-  Fr&amp;lpont, a Belgian Employer and Mr.  Tom Moore, a canadian  ivcrker, were chosen as Vice-Chairmen,     On tho point of procedure the Commission decided  toconsider  first the weekly rest day &quot;for Industrial undertakirand then  the weekly rest day in commercial establishments.This having been settled, the next question was whether, inrelation  to industrial undertakings, the Commission should proceed by way of Convention as proposed by the Office, orby way of Recommendation.   Cur Instructions indicated thata Recommendation could be accepted, but not a Conventionunless widely drawn and likely to be generally acceptable.This question was discussed at seme length in the Committeeseveral speakers advocating, a Recommendation, and if so,generally a somewhat complete and definite one.   Ctherssupported a Convention, and if so, one drawn on fairly widelines.    The latter view secured the more general approval;and in view of our Instructions, the Chairman accepted and supported a motion to appoint a Sub-Commission with theobject of securing, if possible, agreed proposals for aConvention on wide lines.     The  Sub -Commission after several meetings brought upto the General Committee a draft Convention embodying thefoilow1ng principles *-      (1)  A general obligation on all States who ratify to          secure  a weekly day of rest.      (2)  Full power in each State to make  a  list  of          necessary exceptions.     The  Sub-Commission had attempted to draw up  a list
cf such, exceptions, but this proved impossible;   industries which one country would erelude, such as  railways,  othercountries h. sisted must be included.    Tha only  alternative was to place upon each State which ratifies the  convention the duty of compiling &amp; list of necessary exceptions;  this8as agreed upon, the list to be drawn up  after consul.tot.lo&quot;:(apart from ecu tries where provision was already made byeffective legislation), with responsible  Associations ofemployers and workpeople, where such exist.     (3) This list to be reported to the  InternationalLabour Office forthwith, and any modifications to be notified to the International Labour Office annually;     (4) The definition of Industrial undertakings to bethat adopted at Washington with necessary modifications.     This Report of the Sub-Committee was practicallyunanimous.   when the Report was discussed in the full Corn-mission further clauses as to periods of.compensatory rest;as to each State being compelled, to give  reasons for itsexceptions;  and as to compulsory posting of notices and inspection, were added, all of which were the subject ofkeen debate and were.adopted by narrow majorities.     The final results of the work of the Commission - sofar as industry is concerned - ire re presented to the Confsr-ence in the form cf a draft Convention, which was approved inthe last meeting of the Commission by 17 votes to 12, withfour members abstaining and three members absent.  This draftConvention dealt solely with the weekly rest in industry.     This draft Convent ion : contained from, the british point of view three unsatisfactory features:-     (a) The provision as to compensatory periods of rest..     (b) The requirement that reasons should be  given to          Geneva for any exceptions made.
     (a) The throwing on Directors and  Managers  the          obligation to post notices,  etc.     Of these, (b )  (the requirement tc  give  reasons),  wasnot BO material as  the other two, though it  was  irritatingand unnecessary;  but  (a) (compensatory periods  of rest),and (c) (ths obligation imposed on employers to  cost notices),were directly contrary to our Instructions.    The rough onh-lines cf a Convention such as we could  accept which  weresanctioned by the Cabinet, expressly laid down that  theprinciple cf compensation could not be  accepted  in any shapewhatever.!  it was further expressly laid down, that any provision for State inspection  (with the increased staff and expense involved thereby) ware  also, from, our point of view,impossible.   The proposals  (a) and (c) above involved both these :  it is true that Article  (c ) was so framed as to makeIt appear that the obligation to post notices, etc., wasthrown upon the employer and not upon the State.   But, asthe Chairman explained to the Committee, there were only three possiole ways of enforcing such an obligation on the employer, i,e. either by State  inspection and finej  or b^means of ths Common Informer;   or by making the requirementas to notice an Implied term in the contract.  Clearly thelast  two methods were not properly  applicable, and  in the end the only effective means of  enforcing the requirement as  toposting notices would  be by  State  inspection  and by fine.      A draft Convention containing  all  three  of theArticles mentioned was  adopted  by  the Conference  and sentto the Drafting Committee in the  ordinary wsy (see  Provi-sional Record &quot;No.  .18,  page  47).      /then the Drafting Committee had considered the Conven-tion  it came up  again before the Conference  for thefinal voting  (see  Provisional Record No. 22,  page 16).                          -  24  -
and ,vith regard to  this a difficult  situation  arose.  Thetwo points mentioned as to compensatory  rest and  as  toposting, notices were as cojectionable  to the employers&apos;group as they were  t? the British Delegates;  &quot;and the Frenchand Belgian Governments also voted against  them.   They  wereconsequently carried In the Committee  as stated by only small majorities    (17 to 16 or so).   when the proceedings were near ing conclusion in Ccrami ttee,  and the  Committee  draft was practically settled, the French Government Delegatesapproached us.   The French Delegates  stated that their government would persist to the end in its  opposition  to thecompensatory reat provisions, although the  French government did not attach so much importance to the difficulty  of  in-spection, and the posting up of notices;  that if England,Franoe and Belgium  (and Belgium took the same  attitude  asFrance), hung together, and voted against the  Convention (if the compensatory provisions remained in the  Draft),  itwould be impossible for the Workers to get  the necessary two-thirds majority in the Conference, and the convention would fail.     On a subsequent occasion when  one of the  leadingEmployers was present, the French Government representativesagain stated that if Great Britain  was firm in its view to vote against the Convention if  it contained provisions forcompensatory rest,  France  and Belgium would do the same;this  we accordingly agreed to  do with the reasonableexpectation that this  would result  in the compensatoryprovisions being dropped.  This  arrangement was made known tothe Employers and Workers.  The Employers definitely statedthat they would vote against the Convention if the compensa-tion clause remained in  the Draft.  Furthermore, the EnglishWorkers and the British  Workers from overseas were aware ofthe  arrangement made between the French, Selgisn and British
Government Delegates, and took a strong line in the Workers&apos;group meetings to get the compensatory rest provisions outout.  They were against this clause, probably on principle,but undoubtedly the statement that the Government Delegates ofGreat Britain, France and Belgium, would vote against any convention which included such a clause. Influenced the actionwhich they &quot;took.     When the Convention finally came to be voted on in orderto  secure the necessary two-thirds majority, General Baylay,the British Employer, moved an amendment to omit the Articlecontaining the compensatory rest provision.   On t he morningwhen the vote was to be taken, the senior French government delegates stated to Sir Montague Barlow that the French Govern-ment Delegates had now changed their views;  that they had now-decided that they would vote for the amendment to exclude theArticle as to compensatory rest, but if this amendment was lost and the Article remained part of the Convention, they had decided that they could not vote against the Convention, but would merely abstain,  and the Belgians would do the same.     This was a distinct breach of the agreement made, and wasa  fresh proof of what  we had experienced the year before - &apos;-In the Conference at Genoa, viz., how difficult it  is to make arrangements with the  French.  They  gave as the reason thatthe draft had now come up In somewhat different shape; butthat really had nothing to do with the matter.  General 3ayley&apos;amendment was lost by  41 for to 58 against  and the  Conventionitself was voted by  73 votes for to  24 against.  The BritishGovernment Delegates,  in view of the Cabinet instructions  endalso of  the attitude they had taken  up earlier in  the dis-discussion,  felt obliged, though with regret,  and in  spite of theChange of mind of the  French,.to v*ta  against tha  Convention.
     The South African Government  Delegates also  voted  againstthe Convention;  the Indian Government  Delegates  voted  for thoConvention, of the general dorms of which they expressedapproval., but announced that, in view of the difficult  provl-slon as to compensatory rest, the  Indian Government  was not tobe held to be in any way committed by their action,  as  therehad been no chance to consult their Government,     With regard to Weekly Rest Day In commercial (as distinct from Industrial) undertakings, a Recommendation was  adopted in very general terms that each State should take measures toprovide that the whole cf the staff employed in any  commercialestablishment, public or private,  should enjoy one day&apos;s restin seven;  each, member may also make necessary exceptions, andshall communicate the list of exceptions to Geneva (ProvisionalRecord  3 , p. 867. )     The British Delegates spoke in favour of the Convention,and showed how, by custom, we had already long ago secured asimilar liberty for the workers of this country.   We had tried to legislate on the subject in 1911, but great difficulties asto definition of necessary exceptions,  etc. , had been found to exist, and the Bill was in fact withdrawn.  In view  of  this experience, the British delegates said they could not  pledgetheir Government to introduce legislation at an early date,and while favourable to the principle would not vote for theRecommendation, but abstain.     There was a further proposal for a Resolution withregard to Saturday half-holiday (La Semaine Anglaise).   Thiswent beyond the Agenda (which only spoke of a Weekly Rest Day);but was adopted by the Conference.  (See Provisional RecordGo. 23, p. 847).                           -  27  -
     Being only a Resolution (and not a Convention or recommendation), no Government need take any action withregard to it.It am 8.   Merc ant, lie Marine &apos;.,.ue st ions .(a) Prohibition of the Employment of any Person under the    age  of &quot;18 years &quot;a8&quot;&quot;Trlmms&apos;r pr Stoker.     A Convention prohibiting the employment of any person under the age of 18 years as Trimmer or Stoker was adoptedunanimously by the Conference.   The Convention includes anArticle  relating to the Coastal trade of Japan and India and providing that persons of 16 years and over may, subject tocertain conditions, be employed on vessels engaged In suchtrade.   ) Compulsory Medical Examination of all children    employed on board ship.     The Conference adopted a Convention making compulsory,except in urgent cases, medical examination of all childrenor young persons under 18 years of age employed on board ship.  The Convention also lays down that such medical examination must be repeated at least once a year.     While the British Government Delegates had power,under their  instructions, to agree to examination on entryup tc the age of 13 years, it was felt that the questionof making such examination periodical should be deferred for consideration  in  the light of future experience.Accordingly, when  the final vote was taken, the government representatives withdrew from the Conference.     It should be  noted that Doth the above Conventionscontain a definition  which excludes fishing vessels fromthe scope of the Conventions.
