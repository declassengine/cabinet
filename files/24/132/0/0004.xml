January  1922.SECRET.CP. 3604.Financial  Questions  outstanding between  the War  Office                      and the India Office.               Memorandum by the Secretary  of  State.for India.    In his memorandum of 29th. December, the Secretary of State for War stronglyurges the necessity  of  settling  the procedure  for  deciding these  matters  withoutfurther  delay, and observes that in the present financial position &quot; We cannot leave&quot;such large possible  charges  and credits  unsettled while leisurely controversy  on&quot;questions of constitutional theory proceeds between Whitehall and Delhi.&quot;    I must protest against this description of what is happening.    Of the six claims in question, two have already  been disposed of (No. 3, &quot;prices to be paid by India  for equipment in the hands of  the Disposals Board,&quot; and No. 0,&quot; Terms on which the War Office should  replace field artillery equipment lent from indian stocks during the war &quot;), while nothing arises at the moment on a third (No. 5,&quot; Proposed transfer  of  Aden  to the Imperial Government.   Possible claims by Indiato recover war expenditure borne by Indian revenues &quot;), as this would be contingent on effect being given to the proposed  transfer, which would require legislation in theImperial Parliament.  A further question  (No. 4, &quot; Leave, &amp;c, of  Indian troops  on demobilisation &quot;) is  relatively unimportant, ami I  have already informally agreedthat if the Imperial Departments are prepared  to drop their claims in respect of pen-commisionary charges I am willing to submit this question to arbitration, and to accept theaward of the arbitrator.    There remain two  claims,  Nos.  I  and 2, in which large sums of  money  and important principles are involved.    The first relates to two  separate matters,  recently considered  by a committee under  the chairmanship of  Mr.  Baldwin.  Of  these, one is a claim that India should pay 40,000,000?. towards the cost of  the  casualty pensions and  gratuities  arising outof deaths and  disablements among  British troops  during  the  Great War ; the otherthat a voluntary offer by the Government of India to make, subject to parliamentary sanction, a further contribution  towards the cost of  the Avar-in addition to the twocontributions  already approved, by  Parliament, viz.,  the  ordinary charges of  thetroops despatched from India for service in  the war  (Resolutions of Parliament of18th  September and 26th November 1914), and the lump  sum gift of 100,000,000?.(Resolution of Parliament of 14th March 1917) should be construed in a  sense morefavourable to  the  Imperial  Departments by some  10,000,000?.  On  both questions the Committee submitted an agreed statement of the points of view of  the ImperialDepartments and  the India Office, but  offered no  recommendations.   The Secretaryof State for War subsequently proposed arbitration  on all the outstanding questions,including these two points,  but the  Council  of  India, to  whom Parliament hasentrusted the control of the  revenues of India, subject  to  the  provisions of theGovernment  of  India Act,  and rules made thereunder, consider  that the  pensionsquestion must in any case be governed by the  larger  question of the understandingsattached to the offers made by the Indian Legislature to contribute to the cost of thewar; these oilers were of a purely voluntary character  and  the Council of India  arenot prepared  to  arbitrate  on  the  interpretation  which should be placed on theintention of  the Indian Legislature  in  making  these voluntary offers, whether in thecase  of  the  original or  the  further  contribution; and on these  grounds, and onthe further grounds stated  in the Baldwin Comnhttee&apos;s Report, they think that norepresentative  Government would in similar  circumstances assent to  arbitration.There is no question of  constitutional  theory at issue between Whitehall and Delhiin regard to  these  two matters, as suggested by  my  friend,  but  before sending  a formal  reply  to him in regard to them and  to  claims Nos. 2 (East Persia, not Eastand South Persia) and 4 (demobilisation concessions), I have  thought it  desirable toconsidt again the Government of India, who, as he will no doubt admit, are primarilyand deeply concerned.
