MEMORANDUM  BY THE  SECRETARY  OF STATE  FOR  WAR.     I  circulate to the  Cabinet  an important paper prepared by the General Staff anda note by the C.I.G.S., both of which should, I think, be  considered by the cabinet before  the Cabinet Committee deals in detail with the proposals for the reduction ofthe Army put forward by the Geddes Committee.

OBJECT OE THE ARMV&apos;S EXISTENCE AND  CONDITIONS  GOVERNING ITS SIZE.         &quot;The Estimates  provide  that in the  year 1923,  the fifth year after the     Armistice is signed, with a broken and exhausted Europe and no German menace,     we are to have far greater fighting power,  with a larger personnel and greater     preparations for war, than ever before in our history.&quot;^and again          &quot; We have suggested that by limiting our oversea garrisons and reducing the  .   corresponding units at home, a great reduction  could  be  made in the  size  of the     Army.&quot;f     The Committee have been careful to avoid any discussion of the purpose for whichthe  British Army exists but these  extracts  from their Report throws an  .interestinglight on what their conception  of that purpose appears to be.     It  not only  reveals a  complete misconception of the  reasons for  the Army&apos;sexistence, but  ignores  the  responsibilities with  which  it  is entrusted, so that it  is                   * Part I., paragraph 4.      f Chapter 2, paragraph 20.

useless to attempt the discussion of details without first pointing out these dangerousfallacies : -     For the last hundred years the British Regular Army has been maintained, not forintervention in a European war,  but for the protection of our overseas territories, andfor the support of the  Civil Power in the maintenance of law and order throughoutBritish  territory at  home  and abroad.    The  size of the Army has  been, regulated by our oversea  commitments,  and  not  by  the threat of any Continental  Power.It is true  that as the  German menace became more  and more  imminent in the yearssucceeding the South  African war, the possibility of our being involved in  a Europeancampaign had  to  be  increasingly taken into account.   Consequently, those militaryunits that we were, obliged to provide at home for the maintenance, relief and supportof our oversea garrisons were gradually organized in such a manner as to allow them,such  as  they  were,  to  intervene  in support  of our  Allies,  should His Majesty&apos;sGovernment decide so to act.  But the size of the Expeditionary Force had no relationwhatever  to the strategical problem of a Franco-German  conflict.   This force consistedmerely of the spare parts of our oversea military machine, assembled to form a provisionalweapon with  which to meet the  threatening emergency.     Thus the disappearance of  the German menace in  no way affects the size of theBritish  Army, which  is conditioned by our oversea commitments.   The elimination ofany European campaign does, however, enable us to make certain  modifications in ourorganization  and equipment, giving us for the present a  freer hand than we had before1914 in designing our military forces for their primary task.    This  new  situation hasbeen fully taken into account by the General Staff in estimating our requirements.     During the last two  years  the General Staff have  frequently drawn attention tothe serious increase in our oversea liabilities as  compared with the situation before thewar.  But as these commitments appear to have escaped the notice of the  Committee,I make no apology for once more bringing them to notice.                                    2. INDIA.     The present situation in India gives rise to  far greater anxiety than in 1914. then we(had a working  agreement with. Russia, a strong and  friendly ruler iii afghanistan and the danger of  internal revolt was in no way comparable  to  the  proportions whichit has now assumed.   To-day- we have to  reckon with  a Russia  whose  most markedcharacteristic is a  bitter and professed hostility to British  ideals and everything  forwhich they stand.  While lacking the organized military  force of the old  RussianEmpire, her methods of insidious propaganda and treachery are even more difficult to cope with, and the inflammable races of the  East&apos;are  more  difficult to  protect from suchcontamination than from more tangible forms of attack.     Afghanistan, instead of the benevolent buffer state that she used to be has  become a  potential  enemy, maintaining  the closest relations  with  Russia,  and  possessingunlimited powers of injuring us by fomenting trouble  amongst the  tribes of  the frontier and  conniving at  Russian intrigue.   We  have,  indeed, recently come  to  some  sort ofagreement with the  Amir, which may  temporarily alleviate  the  situation,  but thepractical value of the &quot;neighbourly treaty&quot; is so far open to question, in view of theserious acts of aggression  by  Afghan raiders that have occurred since it was signed.     Internally the situation in India has been getting steadily worse, especially duringthe last six  months.  Serious efforts have been,  made by the  hostile organization totamper  with  the loyalty of the Indian Army, and although it is believed that their efforts have hitherto met  with no great amount  of success, it will  be remembered that up to the very last moment in 1857, British officers had absolute confidence in the loyalty of their Sepoys.   A notable aspect of the activities of the :t Volunteer &quot;  and&quot; Non-co-operators &quot; generally is the similarity of their methods to those  of Sinn Fein.Distinct effects have been produced by the intimidation, social  boycott and propagandathus  employed  against  the Police.  (Indian Intelligence Summary, 13th  December,1921.)     To further complicate matters, the  state  of Indian  finance gives cause for seriousmisgivings for the future.     The call  that may be made  on us by India has  recently been  estimated by theCommander-in-Chief  as follows r      There are four contingences to be taken into account:      (.1.)  War with Afghanistan :     (2.)  Serious and widespread conflagration amongst the frontier tribes;
     (3.) Sedition  and disloyalty in the  Indian Army amounting  to mutiny among a            portion of that Army ;     (4.) Internal rebellion consisting of simultaneous  co-ordinated outbreaks in several            places, similar to Malabar.     In  the event  of all four  contingencies happening simultaneously or within a few months  of one another--and although perhaps unlikely this is a possibility that cannot be lost  sight  of India  would require reinforcements of  at  least  6  divisions  and 4 cavalry brigades.     In  the event of either (l) and  (2)  or  (3) and (4) happening together as they probably would, 4  divisions  and 2 cavalry brigades would be wanted.     A most  important point to be borne in  mind  is that it is the promptness with which the trouble can be crushed in its early stages that  will determine the extent  and gravity  of the emergency.                                      3.  IRAQ.     Our  commitments  in Iraq, which did not exist before  the  war,  constitute an entirely fresh charge upon our military  resources.   The policy now being adopted by  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  in this  territory,  for which  we  have  accepted responsibility,  is  admittedly  a  gamble.    For, as  it   is  manifestly  impossible  to provide  a  regular military  garrison  large  enough  to protect  the  country  from external   aggression   or   internal  revolt,   the  experiment  is   being   tried  of defending it   by   means of   local Arab  troops  supported   by  a  powerful   air force.   The  results  of   this experiment  remain a   matter of  conjecture  for,  pace the  assertions of  the  Air  Ministry,  they are so  far  only  assertions  and  remain to be proved.   In the event of  failure we  are given to understand that we shall accept defeat and make no serious effort to restore  our  control or prestige.   But is this really a practicable proposition ?  Nothing in our experience  would justify us in assuming it. Even if we are prepared to repudiate our obligation  to King  Feisal, is it  conceivable that  we can abandon the isolated  British officers  and political officials Avho  will be scattered throughout  the length and breadth of the  country and leave them to  their fate  without  an   effort ?  I venture  to   think  not,  for the  lesson  of  Gordon  and Khartoum has surely not yet  faded entirely from our minds 1     It  should further be realized  that the scheme is far less  promising  to-day  than when it was conceived at Cairo nine months ago..  The chief  hopes (it had no more secure foundation)  on  which the  scheme  was based have proved abortive.   For that scheme assumed a friendlv Turkey and no risk of aggression or serious internal intrigue by her.  Far from  being  friendly the Nationalist Turks are now mere hostile and more truculent  than ever, and as1  a result  of their military  and diplomatic  successes have now a free hand to  concentrate military forces on the northern march.   Added to this, the Arab  army, which was an essential factor in  the scheme, is giving  cause  for grave anxiety on account of the Turkish intrigue with which its loyalty is sapped.   So much so, that the  War Office is even now  being  pressed to consent to three battalions (including 1 Indian) being stationed in Baghdad to protect the Air Force and the seat of Government there, in absolute contradiction to the whole principles on  which the scheme of control by the loyal  Air Force was based.     Therefore, I maintain that so long as we retain any form of  control in  Iraq, director indirect,  which involves  the  presence of  British  armed forces,  officers   andadministrators, so  long  is  there a  direct liability on the  British Army  to providesupport,   It is impossible to assess  this liability at less than 2 divisions and 2 cavalrybrigades.                                   4.  PALESTINE.     This, again, is an  entirely fresh commitment, which, like Iraq, has no strategicalinterest for the British Army, yet constitutes a serious potential drain on its resources.In this territory His Majesty&apos;s Government is committed to a policy which is repugnantto 90 per cent, of  the population and bitterly resented  by them.   So much so that theAdministration have  so far  felt unable to  inaugurate representative Government, thefirst act of which would be to sweep away the  Zionist organization and ideals.  In thesecircumstances it is oidy the presence of sufficient numbers of British  troops that  securesthe lives  and property of the  Jewish minorities, and  the present garrison  is  barely
sufficient for  the purpose.  Tn the event of co-ordinated attack by the Arabs, assistedas they might be by their kinsmen from Trans-Jordania, the garrison would be insufficient,and reinforcements would be required.   These might well amount  to  the infantry of1 a division and  a cavalry brigade, though artillery might be on a reduced scale.                                     5. EGYPT.     The present situation in  Egypt is very different from that of 1914.  It is to-day evenmore difficult than a year ago, when the publication of the Miluer He port had given grounds for hope that a settlement satisfactory  to all but the most violent extremists was in sight.The Milner Report has now virtually been repudiated by the Government and the Nation-alist feeling proportionally stirred.  At the same time, as  Lord Allenby has pointed out,these anti-British elements have not been slow to appreciate the means by which  the Irishrevolutionaries have achieved their ends, i.e., by murder and arson, and they may be ex-pected to adopt methods of terrorism in order to convert the more moderate sections of thepeople to their views.  Should  this policy succeed we shall be faced with the organized  &apos;hostility of the  whole country, including the Sultan&apos;s Government and the egyptian army with the  result that  reinforcements of at  least 2 divisions and 1 cavalrybrigade would he urgently needed to maintain our  position in the country and protect the lives not only  of the British but of the other European communities for whose safetywe are responsible.  In any  case  the  minimum garrison  with which the situation cannow be secured is  9 battalions  of infantry besides  the necessary cavalry  and  artilleryunits a clear addition of 4 battalions  to the pre-war garrison.                                 6. CONSTANTINOPLE.     At the  present moment we have to maintain a force of 6 battalions at Constanti-nople,  2 of  which at least must  be British, as part of the Allied  Forces of Occupation.Although this  commitment  is understood to  be temporary it constitutes a very seriousliability while  it lasts.   More  than once in the last two years the situation there hasbeen extremely difficult  and might easily have become critical, as the Allied forces have not been,  and are not now,  sufficient  to protect Constantinople and the Darda-nelles  from a determined attack in force by the Nationalist Turks.     As long as this commitment lasts we must  be prepared to  reinforce up to thestrength of 1 division and a cavalry brigade at least.                        7. UNITED KINGDOM AND GERMANY.     The situation at home has changed altogether  for the worse since  1914.   Beforethe war the question of internal security in Great Britain hardly existed as a militarypre-occupation.  During the last  year it is  true  that the revolutionary forces havereceived a  decided check, but the snake is only scotched and  not  killed.   We have  toreckon as a permanency  with organized forces of  disruption subsidized and abetted by our enemies abroad, whose purpose is to destroy the whole  fabric  of society and make all government impossible.   Since the armistice  the   country hafe been  subjected  to^a succession of industrial upheavals, chief among which were the Railway Strike in theautumn of 1919 and the Coal  Strike of 1921,  which all  but  precipitated, a general strike  of the &quot; Triple Alliance.&quot;   While giving every credit  to  the  common-sense andgood citizenship of the majority of the inhabitants of the  country, it is quite certainthat it was only the firm attitude  taken up by the  Government, backed by tangibleevidence of military forces adequate to protect -people from the violence of extremists,that prevented these crises developing into far more disastrous conflagrations.     In the Railway Strike  of 1919,  the troops actually  employed were equivalent  to43 infantry battalions and 3 cavalry regiments, while in reserve were a large number of units which were in process of  demobilization.     During  the  recent  Coal  Strike   the equivalent of 56 infantry  battalions  and  cavalry regiments were actually employed on strike duty,  while  in reserve were anadditional  194  weak battalions which the Government found it expedient to have  inhand.   To provide these the whole of  the Regular  Reserve had to be called out, and animprovised Defence Force of over 60,000 had  to be hurriedly created in  addition to the units provided by  the Navy owing to the absence in Ireland of a large proportion of theRegular Army.     It is not the province of the General Staff to forecast the political conditions of thefuture; but unless  His Majesty&apos;s Government can  give us a categorical assurance that  no
Serious industrial unrest is to be contemplated for a period of years, the Army is boundto assume that it may be called on to perform similar tasks at any moment.   But whatmoment is more likely to be selected by the forces of anarchy as a &quot;favourable opportunityfor extorting blackmail than when we are  in  the throes of  some  crisis  abroad,necessitating the despatch of reinforcements from this country ?    As a result of past experience it is estimated that for the maintenance of law andorder in the face of the revolutionary forces, a minimum  of 40 infantry battalions,totalling 30,000 bayonets, with  cavalry, armoured cars and tanks, &amp;c, in  addition willbe required.    It has been shown that our commitments abroad involve us  in liabilities which weare quite unable to meet even by stripping the United Kingdom bare of troops.    The  Committee&apos;s proposals reduce  the  total number of  battalions  at home,including Ulster and the Rhine, to 67.  Thus the despatch of even the 3 divisions now contemplated as the only Expeditionary Force immediately available would reduce the battalions  at home  to  27, and of these only  19  are in the United Kingdom, theremaining  8  being  on the Rhine.   Not even  this total  would be available  in GreatBritain, for, even supposing it possible  to withdraw the whole of the Rhine garrison,we should still  have to  leave at  least  4 battalions in Ulster, where their presence isessential for the prevention  of bloodshed between the opposing racial  and religiousfactions.  Thus not more than 23 battalions could be counted on for use in this country as against the 40 that are required.    It will be observed that nothing is allowed for liabilities  in Ireland beyond the fourbattalions for Ulster.  Whether this bold assumption  is justified or not is not for theGeneral Staff to say, and only time can prove it.    It  is further for  consideration whether it  is justifiable to  count on the RhineGarrison permanently as part of the Home  Forces.  Up to the present  we have beenable to draw on it, when required, because the situation in Germany permitted it.  Butwe have no assurance that .as time goes  on the Germans will remain  equally tractable,and the very fact of British troops being in occupation of the Rhine means that  theyare for use in case of necessity.    Since  the above was written, news  has been received of  an agreement proposed at Cannes by His Majesty&apos;s Government to  come to the assistance  of France in theevent of unprovoked attack  by Germany.  Although such a  contingency may seemremote  at the  present  moment,  this  undertaking  adds definitely to our  potentialcommitments, and cannot be altogether  ignored.                          8.  SUMMARY  OF  COMMITMENTS.    Summarizing the foregoing survey of our commitments at home and abroad, we see that the Army may have to .meet a call for reinforcements as  follows :               For India  ...     ...     ...  6 divisions and 4 cavalry brigades.              For Iraq   ...     ...     ...  2      ,,       2        ,,              For Egypt and  Palestine...  3       ,,       2        ,,              For Constantinople     ...   1       ,,       1        ,,              For United Kingdom   ...   3-J-      ,,       2        ,,     It is obvious that even with an Expeditionary Force of  6 divisions and 3 Cavalrybrigades capable of immediate mobilization the margin of safety would be dangerouslylow, seeing that the whole  of 6 divisions  might be  required  in India alone, whileif trouble  arose in the  Middle  East  at  the same time, we should want at least a  total  of 8 or  10  divisions and 5 or  6 Cavalry brigades.  Now  we  have definite evidence  of a  world-wide conspiracy fomented  by all the  elements  most hostile to  British  interests -r- Sinn  Feiners  and   Socialists  at  our   own  doors,  RussianBolsheviks,  Turkish  and  Egyptian  Nationalists,  and  Indian  Seditionists.   Up tothe present, we have  been lucky  in not having experienced  trouble  in  more thanone theatre  at the same time, but when it is remembered that the hostile combinationis  working with the  connivance if not under the active direction  of the german foreign Office, it would  be folly to ignore the probability of better co-ordinated attacks in  the  future.  Yet the effect of the  Geddes Committee  proposals is  to reduce there reinforcements  available in, the  critical initial stages  to  3  divisions and less than2  cavalry brigades, since  the 4th  and 5th  divisions  could not reach the  theatre of operations for 5 or 6 months after the outbreak had begun.

                   9.  THE  ARGUMENT OP INCREASED FIRE  POWER.     The  Committee,  as  already pointed out, make  no  reference whatever  to  theincreased liabilities which  the Army has incurred since 1914, but proceed to recommendarbitrary reductions in units on the ground  that  the increased  fire power of modernweapons will compensate for lack of numbers.     This argument will not bear serious examination.     It might be correct to state that if 10 British  battalions were  drawn up opposite10  German battalions, and the British had the monopoly of modern armament, theywould be more than a match for their opponents.  But this in no sense represents  thestate of affairs as it exists to-day.  All civilized countries are equipped with weapons and engines of war unknown to armies  in  1914, and therefore the  superiority  of  the battalions alluded to by the Committee  disappear.    One nation at  least is superior tous in numbers, equipment and readiness for war, and infinitely  superior in  the air.   Inthe case of the uncivilized nations, when  the  distance to be  traversed, the length of lines of communication, the  difficulties of the country, whether from  mountain, river ordesert, are considered,  the balance of recent improvements  in arms and equipment isjirobably in favour of the uncivilized nation and against us.     For the Indian frontier we have to provide a Field Army capable of dealing withthe  organized forces of Afghanistan and the warlike tribesmen.   The armament  andtactical training  of these forces  has  made great strides  within the last few years,  andthe  new political  status of Afghanistan  gives her  every facility for equipping their forces with the most  up-to-date weapons, including aircraft.   Taking everything intoaccount, the  Afghans  and the  tribesmen are relatively more formidable opponents thanthey were.   So much  so,  that  Lord Roberts&apos;s  famous march from Kabul to Kandaharcould not be  carried out to-day without a very much  larger force than he had at his disposal.  &apos;   Apart from the Frontier, the main business of the Army in time of peace is to actas an Imperial police force throughout our Eastern Dominions.   The real nature  of  this task  has  been well stated  in  a recent memorandum by the  Chief of General Staff,India :          &quot; The Lewis gun may  be considered equivalent to 10 rifles, and the Vickers  gun     similarly  represent the power of 20 riflemen ;  the armoured  car and the aeroplane     too are, from  the  same point of view, admittedly  very powerful instruments of     death.  But the -primary duty of troops told off for the maintenance of law and     order is  to prevent bloodshed -mainly by show of numbers,  which gives them  the     moral as well as the physical power to arrest murderers.  In other words, it is  the     man  and  not the machine which  is  more  valuable for  maintaining internal     security. &quot;*     It is  not until disorder has reached the stage of actual war that the full power of modern weapons can be brought to bear.     This  elementary fact, which is a truism to  all who have any experience of the Eastor West, has been entirely ignored by the Committee, who  have nevertheless taken itupon themselves to lay down in  great detail the  size of our various oversea garrisons.Another point which has escaped the Committee is that their argument cuts both ways.If a machine-gun crew is the equivalent of 20 riflemen it is also 20 times more vulnerableas the fire power  of 20  rifles can  be  annihilated  by one lucky bomb.   Similarly, a battalion  of  infantry  or  smaller unit  isolated and 1 split up  into detachments ispeculiarly vulnerable to the ravages of disease, and may find its effective fighting strength diminished by a half or more through some  sudden  epidemic.  In any case the&quot; overhead charges &quot; in the shape of employed men, furlough, courses of instruction,  &amp;c,fall even more heavily on detachments than on complete units.     The Committee point to India as having reduced the number of  British and  Nativetroops on account of the increased efficiency of modern armaments.   Here again  the argument is ill founded.   The  reductions in  the Indian Establishment were made inorder to provide, on a proper basis, those essential ancillary services and reserves which under  the old and vicious system had to be improvised from the ranks  of  the fightingunits on mobilization.  &quot; This arrangement,&quot; as  pointed out by the Commander-in-chief in April,  1920,  &quot;benefited  neither  party, as  not  only  were  the  fighting strengthsreduced, but the administrative services had to  employ men  unversed in their methods.It is  essential  that in  future the administrative units should be  separately constituted in peace.&quot;* Memorandum by General Staff, India, 10th May, 1921
    &apos; When it  is  a  case 1 of war  another  factor  comes  into  play.   No  civilized administration  would dare  to send  its troops into battle  without the most up-to-date&quot;equipment that science  has  evolved, for to  do otherwise would be  deliberately  to sacrifice lives.   Such criminal parsimony would no more be tolerated in these days than a colliery would be allowed to send its men clown the pits without the most efficient safety  appliances.    It  is obvious  that  all  our foreign  garrisons must stand  ready equipped for war in its true sense.  But, as I  have pointed out, the full power of this equipment does not come&apos;into play  during the everyday routine work of the Army abroad, which,  for  its deterrent action to be effective, demands a  minimum  number  of actual men to restrain evildoers by their bodily presence.                 .10.  SUBSTITUTION OF NATIVE FOE BRITISH  TROOPS.       &apos;     One of the expedients proposed by the Committee to  justify reductions in  British.units is the substitution of native , troops  for British  in oversea  garrisons.  There are three great objections to this policy, which is the exact opposite of that for which theGeneral Staff must continue to press.     In the first place, the same degree of reliance cannot be placed on natiye troops forthe  purpose  of quelling sedition.   Since the regrettable  mutiny at Singapore at thebeginning  of the War, and certain  troubles in India itself last  year, the  civil authoritiesin the Far East have  lost confidence in Indian troops.   As an example of this, it  is sufficient  to  recall the strong  protest made by the Governor of Hong-Kong at theprospect of an increase in the  Indian troops to  be stationed  there.   In his  letter  of8th  September, 1920 (083/5258), Sir  Edward Stubbs states that the civilian membersof his Executive Council regard with  apprehension an increase  in the strength of theIndian troops, and &quot;he himself  fully  endorses their  views.   He also points  out that apart  from  the  possibility  of a  seditious outbreak the Indian troops  stationed  at hong Kong have  for years past  had a  bad reputation  for  committing  outrages  onthe local population.     Secondly,  there  are serious political objections  on  the part of India, to keepingIndian troops serving outside India,-and the Legislative Assembly is making capital out-of this grievance.     Thirdly, the  insurance value of an Indian or native unit from the general aspect ofImperial Defence is  infinitely  less than that of a British unit, which is available to  do anything  and go anywhere at a moment&apos;s notice and  is far better value for money fromthe British taxpayers point of view.     All these things are either  unknown to or ignored by the Committee..                   11. REPLACEMENT OF CAVALRY BY AIRCRAFT.     The Committee  advance no valid  reason for the drastic  reduction proposed incavalry regiments, but from the general tenor of their&quot; remarks  it appears to be the advent of the Air Force which has influenced them in this direction.  -     Certain of the functions formerly discharged by cavalry are now more efficiently per-formed by aircraft,- viz., the so-called strategical or long distance reconnaissance.   It was this  consideration which influenced the General Staff in agreeing to the reduction of 4Cavalry Regiments, which has already been carried out.  But to assert that the place of cavalry can entirely  be taken by aircraft in the work of close reconnaissance protection and  support  is a complete fallacy.   Aircraft  in its  present  state of development is  only  effective against  an  enemy  presenting  a tangible and extensive  target,or for  bombing  women  and children.  They  can,  for  instance,  operate  decisivelyagainst  a  large column  of troops or transj)ort  packed  in  a  defile  or  assembledin  close  formation.    But  they   cannot  replace   cavalry  in  advanced  or  flank-guard  actionsthey cannot push forward  and seize vital tactical  points ahead ofthe  troops or  protect a column on the  inarch from snipers  on the flank.  They cannottake prisoners or requisition supplies or  escort convoys or interrogate  inhabitants, to mention only a few of the everyda3T tasks which cavalry have to perform.  Nothing ismore certain than that in way of the operations which the British Army may be calledupon to undertake  in the  East the need for cavalry  will be most urgent,  and theCommittee&apos;s  proposals  will  disastrously cripple  the efficiency of  our  ExpeditionaryForce.                                             : *
                                    12. TANKS.     The Committee take objection to the fact that tanks are provided as an addition toand not in substitution of rifles and bayonets,  The General Staff are fully alive  to  thenecessity  of economising men by the use of machines to the fullest possible extent.But  it has already been shown that for the normal police work of the Army abroad it is-rii&amp;ii, that  we must have in adequate numbers.  Moreover, we clo not at the present timepossess any  tanks  that are suitable for operations in a hot  climate, and the whole matter of tank design and tactics is in the  experimental  stage.   It will probably beseveral, years before a sufficiently satisfactory type is produced  to warrant adoption,for the money is not available to permit of experiments and research on a sufficient scale.At the same time it is essential to begin to build up the personnel of the Tank Corps sothat they may  be ready for service when the. equipment is  provided, and this  personnelconsists for the most part of highly skilled men, who take a long time to train.  In themeantime they are performing valuable service in manning armoured car units, whichhave been indispensable in Ireland, Mesopotamia and India, and could not  be provided from any  other source.                           13.  THE TERRITORIAL ARMY.     So less  remarkable than their disregard of the Regular Army&apos;s responsibilities isthe manner in which the Committee have dealt with the Territorial Army.   They haveno,t hesitated light-heartedly to abolish  regular fighting units that are essential for  thepreservation of our security but they pass, over almost in silence the policy of spending5,000,0007.  a year on  a force which under present conditions is of no practical value inupholding the  authority of the  British Government  at  home or abroad.  The onlysuggestion which the Committee have to make on this  question is a reduction of 50o/oin the  permanent staffs, thus ensuring that the military value of the force shall be even less than it is at present.     It must not be thought that the General Staff are hostile to the Territorial Army;no. body of men realize better than the General Staff what the Territorial Army did inthe late war, and if the Territorial Army could be constituted  in  some other  way, suchas suggested by the  General Staff in  1919-20, there would be  much  to  be said  forspending a certain amount of money on them.     The General Staff have already pointed out   that the whole raison detre  of  theTerritorial Army  has  been definitely ruled  out by the Cabinets decision that a great war is  out of the question, for 10 years or more.  This wipes out any chance of invasion.The  Territorial Army  cannot find our  oversea garrisons, it  cannot provide drafts, itcannot furnish reinforcements for an Eastern campaign,  and it cannot  be used for  thepreservation of internal order.   It therefore, fulfils none of the essential tasks whichthe maintenance  of the British  Empire demands.  On the contrary, it is  absorbingmoney to find which regular units are  to be abolished.  It is, therefore, impossible tojustify the retention of the Territorial Army,in its present form on military grounds.On the other hand, if they are to be so retained for political reasons it  is only  fair tothe Army Council that the fact should be. made public.     If the conditions of service in the Territorial  Army can be so modified  as to permit of their being used in an  emergency to reinforce  or relieve bur  hard-pressed RegularArmy  in defence of  the Empire, there would be less objection to the expenditure upon it  of Army Funds.   But  this whole question was exhaustively  discussed before  theTerritorial Army was reconstituted in March, 1921, and the difficulty of reconcilingsuch an obligation with  the limitations  inherent  to the  recruiting of the Force  was found  to be insuperable.     The Committee suggest that the Territorial Army should be considered in relationto the danger  of aerial  attack,  and  the General Staff agree  that this  is a  logicaldevelopment of the duties to be undertaken by a  force originally constituted for HomeDefence.  With this  object m  view, an organization  of  two Territorial Air DefenceDivisions has already be approved by the Arm)&apos;- Council, but has so far not  materializedowine:  to lack of funds.    ,It is undoubtedly true that  in  the event of Avar with a Continental Power the campaign would  probably  open  with a  most formidable aerial attack on this country,far exceeding in  severity  anything that was experienced in the late  war.-   It is  also possible that for a considerable period, at least, operations  might be confined entirely tothe aerial and  naval spheres, as it might prove impossible  for either ourselves or our opponents to engage military forces in each others territory.
     If, therefore, any forces are to,be maintained purely for home defence it would &apos;W wiser to organize them for  air defence  than for defence against invasion as  formerly understood.   &apos;                                                                   .:.-     It is agreed that the predominant share in air defence  must be undertaken by thel Aii&apos; Force, but it has also been pointed out in various recent General Staff papers that the Air Force requires a very  elaborate organization  of ground  troops to provide the-.anti-aircraft guns, searchlights and communications, without which the Air Force cannotr exert its full power.   If this organization can be  provided on an efficient basis by the Territorial Army it would justify considerable expenditure upon it, and might take tlla. place of some  of the  infantry,  cavalry and artillery units at present maintained.       :&apos;/&apos;     To sum up, the  expenditure of Army Funds on the Territorial Army in  its present form cannot be justified.   But in so far as it can be reorganized in such a manner astfco provide  reinforcements for service abroad  in a  &quot; small war,&quot; or to undertake the Air Defence of the United Kingdom, the  General  Staff would welcome its  continued existence and development.                  14.  DETAILS OE DISTRIBUTION  AND ORGANIZATION.     The reductions proposed by the Committee leave us a total of 19 cavalry regiments (including 3 Household) and 130 battalions of infantry (including  10  Guards) at home and  abroad.-  From  what has been  said above it is clear that  this  total  is quiteinsufficient to&apos;meet the calls that may at any moment be  made upon the Army.  on the grounds  of sentiment and  esprit de corps those  potent factors in the fightingefficiency of  the British Army -the destruction of 8 more cavalry regiments, making 12 in all, is even more to be deprecated than that of the  28 battalions.   For the third and fourth battalions  of  an infantry regiment can be  reduced without destroying the&apos;regiments individuality and traditions, and it is  possible that in  any event we may losemany  regiments now  territorially  based on the  Irish  Free State.    But a  cavalry regiment cannot be abolished without annihilating its existence.    If these proposals are to be  enforced the following distribution is preferable to that given in the table on page 40 of the Committee&apos;s report :                        &apos; :&apos;: &apos;:Station.

(c) If required by Foreign Office.	ii	63 (including 3 Guards).		8 i(including&apos; 3 Household).	07 (including 7 Guards).		19 (including 3 Household).	130 (including 10 Guards).	     The above distribution gives Egypt 7 battalions and 3  cavalry regiments in placeof 9 battalions and 1 cavalry regiment which is the minimum garrison compatible withsafety under present conditions ; 2 cavalry regiments being withdrawn  from Palestinebeing substituted for 2 infantry battalions.     In this connection it would be instructive to know by what process the  Committeearrive at the  conclusion  that  the  safety of Egypt can be secured by  G  battalions,whereas the civil and military authorities, who are responsible for the lives  and propertyof Europeans in that country, have constantly stated that 9  is the minimum.     It will be seen that  nothing is allowed  for Iraq.,  After careful consideration theC-eneral Staff have been  forced to the conclusion that under the  scheme of reductionscontemplated it is  impossible to lock up one cavalry regiment and two battalions  in thiscountry which has no strategical interest for us, where they will not only be of  no use
as a military asset, but will constitute an additional liability in case of trouble.  If theColonial Office, wish to press for British troops  they must obtain Cabinet sanction forthe additional units required over and  above  the 19 cavalry regiments and 120 linebattalions now left to us.    The General Staff take the strongest objection to the committee&apos;s proposal  toscatter half battalions throughout the Far East and the  West Indies.  The fallacy ofthe increased fire  power  argument  has  already  been pointed out, while from theadministrative point of view such dispersion is uneconomical and vicious in the extreme.Allowance  has, therefore, been made for full battalions in Hong Kong, Singapore, and north China, though  the latter  serves no military purpose and is  retained  merely onForeign Office account.  If released from there  it should  be stationed in Ceylon,  which,until that happens, must go short of British troops.  GENERAL. staff,         WAR OFFICE,              10th January,  1922.Secretary of State,     May I, in addition, add a few personal words,  not  of  criticism, but of friendlywarning and advice.     I have perhaps had more experience of the  working of  the War Office and of its relation to the Cabinet and the OLD. both in  Peace and in War than has fallen to the lot of any other living  soldier.  My experience, indeed, extends over many years andembraces many interesting and many critical moments, and I trust, therefore, that theCabinet  will  not take  it amiss if I record in as few words as I can the nett resultof the knowledge thus gained and of the impression made on  my mind.     So far as  my recollection carries me it is the custom of successive governments to decide on Policy without sufficiently considering  whether they possess the powerand force to carry it into execution.     In  the past I need  only mention the South African War  and the  Great War in  all its theatres as examples of my contention, and  in order to show  that this habit stillprevails 1 recall that Lord Milner&apos;s  Commission on  Egypt sent  in their report without consulting the War Office ;   I find that the Geddes Committee completed their reportfor the drastic reduction of the Army without any knowledge of, probably wholly inignorance of, the fact &quot;that a strong C.I.D.  Committee, with  Mr. Austen Chamberlainin the chair, is  at this  moment considering  the strength of the Army in India and the liabilities of the Home  Government for sending reinforcements ; and to the  aboveexamples, which I could add to indefinitely,  I may mention that  only a few nightsago, I received  a copy  of a telegram from Cannes to  Mr.  Chamberlain which  indicated that a military convention of far-reaching consequence and  of vast potential militaryliabilities was.to be entered into by England and France on the following afternoon, theGeneral  Staff not having  been  consulted,  and indeed being wholly ignorant of-this great change of Policy ; and to-clay I see by a series of telegrams that a further and separate  agreement  of  a  like nature  has   been  entered into with  the BelgianGovernment, and even communicated to the Belgian  Press, without  the General Staffhaving any knowledge of the subject.     1 am afraid that if our great problems  are treated  in this manner it is not possible.on the one hand to maintain  contentment and efficiency in His Majesty&apos;s Army, and  onthe  other  hand &apos;to supply to His  Majesty&apos;s  Government an  instrument capable ofcarrying out the Imperial Policy.     I had hoped that  the lessons  of the  Great War would have made so deep  an impression on  the people and Government of this  country, that a  repetition of themistakes before the war, and  of the terrible losses and  disasters both during the warand since the war would have been impossible.    - If on the one hand Pligh Policy ignores High Strategy and on  the other hand HighStrategy is ignorant of  High Policy then I am afraid  the  lessons and the losses of the.late war and the present peace will  all have been in vain and our terrible experienceswill be repeated in the not distant future.                                                        HENRY  WILSON, F.M.,                                                                          C.I.G.S.   20th January, 1922.
