UNEMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT                              INSURANCE.                   MEMORANDUM  BY  THE  MINISTER  OF                                LABOUR.SBC RET C.P.                I venture to ask the attention of my colleagues3S89.              to the memorandum attaohed.   The position with regard              to Unemployment continues very grave.                   I ask at the moment for a decision only on t-wo              specific and urgent points raised in the memorandum,              namely     (1) the question of the continuance of a              further six weeks&apos; benefit under the Unemployment              Insurance Acts, and (2) the possibility of reduoed  ,              rates.                   But it will be seen from the memorandum that              other and more distant points are raised and I trust              that my colleagues will give attention to these              points because it Is, In my view, of great importance              that we should look ahead and determine a more              connected policy in regard to the treatment of              Unemployment Insurance than has been found possible              during tho last twelve months.                                   (Sgd)   To J. MACNAMARA.Ministry of Labour.          February 3rd, 1922.
II^UKAHCS,  .      There are several very important issues in connectionwith this problem to which it is necessary that the cabinet should give very early consideration.     (l)  its regards the course of Unemployment, we had hopedthat improvement in trade conditions would reduce our burdenfor the whole of the Insurance Year, July 1921 - July 1922,toan average of l-  millions of persons wholly unemployed:   witha burden of f a million wholly unemployed for the subsequentInsurance Year, July 1922 - July 1922.     (2)  AS things are turning out the average number ofpersons wholly unemployed during the Insurance Year, July1921 - July 1922 will apparently be round about 1-f millions(and not 1^).   Whet it will bo during the Insurance YearJuly 1922 - July 192 , it is impossible to say, but so faras it can now be seen, the estimate of an average of ^ amillion is far too optimistic.   The period will start withround about 1-g- millions, probably; how far it may tail offI cannot at this moment undertake to say.     (3)  Having sot forth tho Unemployment situation, sofar as it can be foreseen, there are several extremely important decisions which must now be taken in regard tothe Unemployment Insurance Act and the Unemployed Workers&apos;Dependants  Act.    (a)  The special period of Eenefit now running (15/- aweek for men and 12/- for women) will begin to be exhaustedon February 22nd.   It will.petnecessary to announce thefurther six weeks for which   the Insurance Act provides.- 1 -
      In announcing the six weeks1  extension  I  should  impose the following conditions;-      (1)  Workers under 18 yeers of  age  who, when  employed, are   not dependent on their earnings  for their  livelihood, should   ho excluded from the extended  rights,  Kris  was  done  in  the case   of the first extension,      (2)  in the case of single  men  and  women  and  of  widowers and   widows without children under  14 the extension shall  not he   granted except on the specific recommendation  of the  Local   Employment Committee, who would  he asked to  exercise  special   c&amp;re in considering such oases,  and to ascertain the  true facts   in each case.  The Committees  should he  told that the extension   should not he granted to individuals in  this class, unless it   could be shown that they have  relatives  wholly or mainly   dependont on them and that there was in  fact no  suitable v/ork   available for them.      (3) . Local Employment Committees should be  directed to have   regard to the earnings of short-time workers,      (4)  Committees should also be  specially  directed  to  examine   carefully all cases of persons who have  previously  drawn Unera-   ployment Benefit for long periods.  In the oase  of  women there   are  manifestly vacancies to which their attention  should be   directed.                                 I  want a decision  on  this.      (b)  The question arises whether at the same  time  we  should   announce a reduction of Benefit  from 15/-  and  12/-  to 13/- and   10/- respectively.   The argument  in favour  of such a course   is this-.-   That - apart from the question of  another  special period to   fill the hiatus from the beginning of  April  (which  is the   dtte at which the additional 6 weeks will  begin  to  be
exhausted) to tha end of June - wc have to endeavour to have something In hand wherowith to start insurance for the newInsurance Year, July 1922 - July 1923, in oase the times remain .,so hard that the conditions whioh govern ordinary Insuranoeprocedure cannot bo fully restored.     (c)  t have borrowing powers up to  20,000,000 (now 19,000,000 since the Irish Transfer).   Our estimate was that Ishould borrow up to  16,000,000 during the early part of thepresent year and then, as a result of improving conditions,  reducethe debt to  13,800,000 by th^ end of June.   AS things are golagthis oxpootation will not be realised.   I have, ao far, borrowedabout  10,000,000 and am adding to my debt at the rate of about 600,000 por week at the present time.   I shall reach tho ond ofJune with my borrowing powersprobably completely exhausted.   Theroduotton of Benefit on February 22nd to 13/- and 10/* will saveabout  100,000 a woek, leaving me with oay, between two and threomillions in hand at the end of June.     (d)  1 hesitate very much in any casa to recommend thiscourse for social reasons, and could on no account oonslderit were it not that between the 22nd February and the 9thMay the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants Fund will still be operating in respect of all persons still drawing UnemploymentInsurance Benefit.   The Unemployed Workers&apos;  Dependants fund is now paying, roughly, S/- a week to, say 500,000 wivaa andhousekeepers and 1/- a week oaoh in respect of a millionohildren.    Therefore, if the unemployment Benefit oamedown from 15/- and 12/-, to 13/- and 10/- respectively,the position would be between February 22nd and 9th Maythat married men drawing Insurance Benefit would In fact bogetting on an average 20/- a week instead of 22/-, and womenwith dependent husbands and two children would be getting 17/-instead of 19/-.
     (e)  There remains the question of what we arc to do whenthe Unemployed Workers&apos;Dependants  Pund oomes to an end onthe Sth May0   At that time we cannot estimate that tho numborof persons wholly unemployed will he lower than a million anda half.   It will ho a very serious thing indeed, with such avery largo volume of unemployment, If men with wives andchildren dependent upon them, say 2 ohildren on an average,drop at once from 20-/- to 13/-.     My recommendation in respect of the reduced UnemploymentInsurance Benefit is conditional upon the continuance in some form of tho Dependants1 Grants Scheme, and I should hope tofind it practicable to deviso plans which would ensure this with a minimum charge upon the Exchequer, and I will consult with the Treasury and the Government Actuary ac to the mannerIn which this can be done,.     I will approach the Cabinet later upon two questions     (l)  The situation which will arise between the 5th April          and the end of June - 12 weeks - as a result of the          exhaustion of Unemployment Inouranoe Benefit.     (2)  The terms under which the Unemployed Workers&apos;          Dependants1 Pund should be continued after the          9th May.     Meanwhile I want a decision on the question as to whetheror not the Unemployment Insurance Benefit should be reduced from 15/- and 12/-, to 13/- and 10/- respectively as fromFebruary 22nd, on the understanding that the unemployed workers&apos; Dependants-will be continued in some form aff terMay 9th.(Intd)   T.  J.  M.&apos;February 3rd, 1922.
