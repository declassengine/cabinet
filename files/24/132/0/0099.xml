(Received Colonial Office 12.% p.n, 4th February, 1922),* i 4 e *       I received information on January 24th of raids on Haushtribe at Ad Dareja about forty miles north west of. Lahej withinprotectorate border.   This was latest of.several attacks-maderecently on British protected tribes under various pretexts.       Raiders were loan men, but orders had. recently beenissued by Iman to his Commanders that such encroachments were tcease.   It is agreed by Iman5s envoy here that these raiderswere acting without his orders.   I assisted Eaushabi with, armsand ammunition, but these tFilbeeiren are peer fighters under anervous ruler.       Continued reports of&apos; our tribes&apos;  losses in life and property impelled me to decide that the bombing of Sarawar wher(group omitted) was reported to have made his quarters withinborder was justified.       The Royal Air Force effected this operation on afternoon of February 1st and they were heavily fired, on near Dareja soonafterwards,       Royal Air Force returned, fire and dispersed gatheringwhich threatened Dareja.       On morning of February 2nd aeroplanes reconnoitringwere again fired on and party of enemy was successfullybombed.                                               /Lat er
