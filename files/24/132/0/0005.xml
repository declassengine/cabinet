[This Document  is the Property of His  Britannic  Majesty s  Government.]Printed forSECRET.C.P.-3605.                        CABINET.WEEKLY SUEVEY  OJb  THE  STATE  OF  IRELAND.              MEMORANDUM BY THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND.    I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended9th instant.                       GENERAL  STATE OF THE  COUNTRY.Observance of 1 race.    I am glad to state that, notwithstanding the split in the ranks of Sinn Fein onthe question of the Treaty, the liaison arrangements have been preserved intact, and,apart from one or two incidents of minor importance, the observance of the Trucehas everywhere been satisfactory.    The only  offences  committed against members  of the  Crown Forces were  anassault by a crowd of hooligans upon a  Constable at Dungarvan, Co. Waterford, onthe 6th instant, and  the holding  up and disarming  of three military  officers atRoskeen, Co. Cork, on the same day.  In the first-mentioned case there is no evidencethat the Constable&apos;s assailants were members of the I.R.A., and his rescue was effected by a party of local  Sinn Fein Volunteers, who came to his assistance before he had sustained serious injury.  The second incident was an attempt by  a party of eight or nine members of the LR.A., purporting  to be acting under instructions, toenforce  a Sinn Fein order prohibiting the shooting of game.  The officers, who wereshooting over an estate on the invitation of the owner, were deprived of  their shot-guns, one revolver, and a small quantity of ammunition, but were informed that thearticles taken  would be restored to them  at a subsequent date, and were invited tomake a  note of the numbers on the guns for the purpose of identification. It is notanticipated that there will be any difficulty in obtaining an immediate return of thearticles through the intervention of the  local liaison officer.    The only other breaches of the Truce reported during the week were two  furtherraids upon the Ballyquirke Air  Station, Youghal  District, Co. Cork, on the 31stirltimo  and the 2nd instant  respectively, resulting in the loss of material to the valueof about  800; the theft of forty head  of cattle from Moore Park Military Camp,Fermoy District, Co. Cork,  on the 4th instant; the theft of a rifle from the MilitaryBarracks at Ennis on the 1st instant; the theft of eleven  rifles from the Royal irish constabulary Barrack  at Killorglin, Co.  Kerry, on-the 4th instant;  and  four casesof the  illegal arrest of civilians, in two of which the person arrested is known tohave been released.  I regret to state that there are grounds for suspecting that thethefts of the rifles from the military and police barracks were effected through thecomplicity of certain members  of the garrisons.Ordinary Crime.    Although  political crime in  Southern Ireland  is now rapidly diminishing, thealarming increase in the amount of ordinary crime, particularly highway  robberyand housebreaking, to which I have drawn attention in my recent reports, is amatter  which  will demand  the  serious attention of  whatever  Government is responsible for the maintenance of  law and order throughout the country  during thenext few months.  The police reports of the past week include raids by  armedrobbers  upon two Post Offices  (Loughglynn,  Co.  Roscommon, and Newtownmount-      [7633]the Cabinet.  January .1922.AO
keimedy, Co. Wieklow), in which  sums  of money, amounting to  62 and  130respectively, were stolen; the hold-up of a mail car at Caherlavine, Loughrea District,Co. Galway; and a highway robbery of  230, committed  upon a cattle-dealer atBallyshannon, Co. Donegal.  No arrests have yet been made in connection with anyof these crimes.Trials of Civilians by  Court-Martial.    No Court-Martial results were promulgated during the week.                         STATE  OF  THE POLICE FORCES.    The following figures show the present strength of the Irish Police Forces:                            Royal Irish Constabulary.Regular Force.

The strength of the Dublin Metropolitan Police remained unchanged throughoutthe week at 1,134.                   PRESENT POLITICAL SITUATION IN IRELAND.    With the ratification of the Treaty by  Dail Eireann and the defeat of the motion  for Mr.  de Valera&apos;s re-election, the early establishment of the Irish FreeState may now be regarded as assured, but until, either by a plebiscite or a GeneralElection, the people of Southern  Ireland have given their direct endorsement to thesettlement  the path of Mr. Griffith and his colleagues is likely to be beset with difficulties  and anxiety.   The debates in the Dail have  shown that  the  uncom-promising Republicans, represented by persons of the type of  Mr. Cathal Brughaand Miss MacSwiney, are a formidable and implacable body.  There  is no reasonto suppose that their following in the present Assembly will not  hold together, eagerand resolute  to seize upon any opportunity that may offer  of  frustrating the actionof the Provisional Government  in giving  effect  to  the terms  of  the  Treaty,  andalthough Mr. de Valera himself may be reluctant to lend the weight of his authority and personal prestige to the indefinite persistence in purely wrecking tactics, he has
already committed  himself  deeply  to a  policy of uncompromising opposition.   Itwould therefore appear to be necessary that a direct appeal to the electorate shouldbe made at the earliest possible date, and fortunately there is every reason to believethat the result of such an  appeal will be to confirm  the  Irish Free State in beingby an overwhelming majority.  Mr. Griffiths election as President of the Dail, witha Cabinet of his own choosing, is an event of first-rate importance, inasmuch as itmust  render the setting-up of a de  jure Republican Government claiming authorityto the exclusion of the Provisional Government  during  the transitional period a constitutional impossibility, even in the eyes of extreme Republicans.  It is equally important, however, that,  as  head of the  Provisional Government,  which will  bebrought into being  when the necessary formalities have been completed by the vote of the Southern Irish  representatives (including the four Unionist members),  as required by Article 18 of the Treaty, he should be invested with responsibility forthe de facto administration of the country at the earliest  practicable  date, and thatthere  should be no unavoidable delay in carrying through  the  evacuation  of  theCrown Forces from Ireland, and thus demonstrating in the most effectual manner tothe Irish people that the Treaty is a reality, and marks the renunciation for ever ofthe British Governmenfs  claim  to interfere  in  the  internal government of theircountry.
