SECRET.CP. 3607.CABINET.SPECIAL   WEEKLY   REPORT   ON               UNEMPLOYMENT.                             No. 52.    WEEK   ENDED   JANUARY   6,   1922.                           THE  SITUATION.    As in many places the holidays have been prolonged it is not yet possible toindicate any real signs of trade revival.  The slight improvement recorded in coal-mining has continued, and has extended to Lancashire.  The iron and steel industryremains depressed, showing  no signs of revival.    Shipbuilding  and  marine engineering show no change.  The improvement in the woollen industry is main-tained, and the hosiery section is still brisk.  General engineering remains extremelydepressed, but the  situation is  considered more hopeful  in the motor  and cyclesection.   In the boot and shoe  industry there is no  change.   The revival  in thetinplate industry  is maintained.  There are signs  of revival in the spelter  trade.The reduction of prices in the pottery  industry are expected to lead to a greatervolume of orders in the near future.

I.-SUMMARY OF ACTION TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT.                    [From Autumn 1920 to Autumn 1921.]                      Cabinet Unemployment Committee.    The  prospect of a severe trade  depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, there was a special discussion at a meetingof the Cabinet, when  the Cabinet  Unemployment Committee was  appointed  toconsider  the whole question and  devise means for relieving unemployment.    [This Committee has-since  been  in constant  session and  has up  to  the 7thJanuary, 1922, held 41 meetings.    The  problem of unemployment in one form or another has also been before theCabinet on 56  occasions  between the 13th  August, 1920, and  the 7th January;1922.]                        (A.) Unemployment Insurance.    An  Unemployment Insurance Bill of  general scope was introduced on  the23rd  December, 1919, reintroduced on the 16th February, 1920, received  a third reading  in the Commons on the 19th July, 1920, passed into law on the 9th  August,1920, and came into operation on the 8th November, 1920.    This Act &apos;applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously.  The weekly rates of benefit, paid out of contributions from employers, employed and the State, were 15s. for men and12s. for women, after a &quot; waiting period &quot; of three days.  In general, the amount ofbenefit was limited to one week for every six contributions paid, but during the first year eight weeks&apos; benefit  could be drawn after four contributions had been paid.    An Amending Act of the 23rd December, 1920. granted eight weeks&apos; benefit, upto the 31st March..  1921, to persons who had paid no contributions but had beenemployed for a certain minimum period in an insured trade in 1920.    A further Amending Act of the 3rd March, 1921,  increased the rate of benefitto 20s. for men and 16s.  for women.  It further provided that during  each of the periods March-October 1921 and November 1921-July 1922  16 weeks&apos; benefit couldbe drawn by  persons who had been employed in an insured trade in  20  weeks sincethe end of 1919 and were normally employed in an insured trade genuinely seekingwhole-time employment and unable to obtain  it.    A third Amending Act of the 1st July,  1921, reduced  the rate of benefit to 15s:for men and 12s. for women and  increased the &quot; waiting period &quot; to six  days.  this change was  necessitated by exhaustion of funds owing  to  the great amount ofunemployment and was coupled with a heavy increase in contributions and authorityto borrow money from the Treasury to the extent of  20,000.,000, as compared with 10,000,000  previously.   At the same time power was taken to allow 22 weeks&apos;benefit (instead of 16)  in each of the periods March-October  1921 and November1921-July 1922.    Between the  8th November,  1920, and the 31st December, 1921,  the amount paid  in unemployment benefit was  58,814,000.  Of this amount the contribution ofemployers since the 8th November. 1920, was  11,930,000, that of employed persons 10,933,000  and that of the  State  5,859,000, in addition to  1,590,000 in respectof benefit for ex-regular  sailors, soldiers and airmen.   The balance was  providedmainly out of the accumulated reserve fund  of over 20 millions and advances b)^ theTreasury amounting to  7,600,000.    The  number of  persons in receipt of benefit was on the 1st July, 1921, 2,062,012wholly unemployed and  988,364 on  part-time,  and on the 30th December, 1921,1,800,229 wholly  unemployed and 315,741 on part-time.                 (B.) Emergency Works  and other Measures.    A sum of  10,400,000 was provided for expenditure  on arterial roads, half tobe  given  by  way of actual grant and half by way  of a loan to Local  Authorities.This  money is administered by the Ministry of Transport and is expended  by LocalAuthorities under their supervision.   The men  to be employed are  selected by theLocal Employment  Committee of the Employment Exchange and preference is givento ex-Service men.    A further sum of  3,000,000 was allocated  to  the  Unemployment GrantsCommittee, presided over by Lord St. Davids, for the purpose of assisting LocalAuthorities to carry out at once works on which a substantial number of  unemployed       T7637]                                                    B 2
could be engaged.  The conditions imposed with regard to the expenditure of this money were that works could only be approved in areas where there existed seriousunemployment which was not otherwise provided for, that the men employed shouldbe taken from the registers of the Employment  Exchanges, preference being given to ex-Service men, and .that any grant paid should not exceed 60 per cent,  (originally30 per cent.) of the wages bill of additional men taken on for the work.  Further,the works had to be such as were approved by the appropriate Department of theGovernment as suitable works of public utility. The condition as to recruitment oflabour through the Employment Exchanges  was  subsequently modified so as topermit Local Authorities to draw all or a portion  of  the labour  from Boards of guardians.  A condition has also been imposed by which Local Authorities carryingout schemes by means of direct labour may not, during a probationary period of sixmonths, pay to unskilled men wages higher than 75 per cent,  (or, in the case of men employed only  half-time,  87   per  cent.)  of  the authorities&apos; rate for unskilledworkmen.    In  addition  to the  items outlined  above,  assistance from  the  Ministry ofTransport  has  enabled Local Authorities to  maintain in  employment on  road maintenance  a  number of men beyond those  ordinarily employed on  this work.Additional employment has  also been  provided by expediting work on sites and sewers for housing schemes.  An emergency programme undertaken by the Office ofWorks,  and the introduction of alternative work and a system of short-time working in Government Industrial Establishments hav-^  further assisted towards relief of thesituation.    In. addition, Local Authorities have been encouraged by the Government to putwork in  hand without receiving  definite Government assistance.    From the autumn of 1920 to autumn,  1921, in this way, a sum of at least25 millions was set  aside by  the Government and the Local Authorities for schemesof work which are still continuing.  At least 200,000 men have had employment onthese schemes at various  times,  and at the  present time  over 120,000 men areemployed (see table below).                         II.-LATER  MEASURES.                         [Autumn, 1921, onwards.]    Before rising for the recess, the Cabinet agreed that the position with regardto unemployment  was so serious that the Cabinet  Unemployment  Committee mustdevote special attention to it,  with special reference to the exhaustion of benefit underthe Unemployment  Insurance Acts.    On  the 19th  August,   1921, the Cabinet, on   the  recommendation   of  theCommittee, agreed  that assistance could be given to Local Poor Law Authorities,either by way of expediting  the sanction for   loans or  permitting the loans to bespread over  a number of years, in cases in which the Local Authority could prove that there were exceptional  circumstances due  to the abnormal unemployment andthat they were exercising their powers with due care and discretion.    The whole matter was again discussed at the Cabinet which met at Inverness onthe 7th September,  1921.    On the 16th September, 1921, the  Cabinet Committee further agreed that     &quot; (1.) Where, for the purpose of providing employment in the present emergency,Local Authorities  (including statutory bodies  who do not trade for profit) put inhand or  accelerate  approved works (other  than revenue-producing works), whichwould not otherwise have been proceeded with,  or so accelerated at  the present time,the State will give financial assistance on the following basis.    &quot;Grants equal to 50 per cent,  (since increased to 65 per cent.) of the interestand sinking fund  charges on loans raised by Local Authorities to meet expenditureon schemes actively commenced before the  1st January, 1922, will  be paid by theState for a period of one-half the term of the loans subject to a maximum of fifteen years. The expenditure to be taken into account will be all approved expenditure incurred within the period ending the 31st March, 1923.    &quot; In approving schemes, special regard will be had  to the direct employment ofunemployed persons and to a preference being  given to  ex-Service  men.    &quot; (2.) In the case of revenue-producing works, grants will be paid, in approvedcases, equivalent to 50 per cent, of the interest on loans, raised for a period of notless than ten years, in respect of expenditure on schemes actively commenced beforethe 1st January, 1922, provided that such expenditure is incurred within the period ending the 31st March, 1923.  These  interest  grants will be paid for a period offive years.
     &quot; (3.) Schemes shall not be authorised exceeding a total capital expenditure of 10 millions without consultation between the Minister of Health and the Chancellor of the Exchequer  (since increased to 13 millions).     &quot; (4.) Schemes must be approved  by the Ministry of Health  or other appro- priate Government  Department  as schemes  which will provide employment  and must be certified by the Ministry of Labour for districts where unemployment is severe.&quot;     Subsequently  it was decided that Local Authorities carrying  out schemes by means of direct labour may not, during a probationary period of six months, pay to unskilled men wages higher than 75 per cent,  (or, in the case of men employed only half-time, 87-J per cent.) of the authorities&apos;rates for unskilled Avorkmen.                III.-FURTHER REMEDIAL  MEASURES.     During the Autumn Session,  1921, the following measures were submitted to Parliament and approved :      (1.) Amendments  to Exports Credits Scheme. (a.)  Government guarantee to be increased from 85 per cent,  of the cost to 100 per cent, with recourse against the exporter for 57^ per cent.     (h.) Maximum  guarantee  for  each  firm to be  fixed by special  Advisory Committee.     (c.) Extension of  scheme  to all countries, including the British Empire.     (d.) Extension of period of credit in certain cases to 1927.     (2.) Government Guarantee of Payment of Interest and Principal  of Loans raised by Dominions, Colonies, foreign Governments, public authorities, &amp;c, where such loans are to be applied towards the carrying out of any capital undertaking or in the purchase of articles to be manufactured in the United  Kingdom required  for the purposes of  any such undertaking,  the  British Government^  liability  under this  scheme not to  exceed  25,000,000.   It is to be a condition of the guarantee that the application  of the loan is calculated to promote  employment in  the  United Kingdom.     (3.) A Sum of 5^ Millions for  General Unemployment Relief. Subject to Treasury approval, the money  will be used in connection with schemes for providing employment on land improvement and  drainage ( 650,000), forestry ( 250,000), light railways, and also by way of loans to Boards of Guardians or  Parish Councils in necessitous areas who are unable to meet claims for relief (see Cabinet decision of the 19th August above).     (4.)  &quot; The  Unemployed  Workers&apos;  Defendants&apos;  Fund,&quot;  to be established by legislation  for a period of six months for the purpose of making grants towards the maintenance of the wives and  dependent children of unemployed workers in receipt of unemployment benefit.  The grants will be at  the weekly rate of 5s. for the wife and  Is. for each child. The necessary money will be obtained by means of  further contributions paid by  those now contributing to the  Unemployment Fund (both employers and workmen) together with  a grant from the State.  The total amount available will be approximately 6^ millions.     (5.) Overseas  Settlement. A further  330,000 was voted to assist ex-Service men desiring to emigrate to the Dominions.     (6.) Acceleration  of Government  Contracts. The  position  with  regard to Government contracts  is being examined to see whether, in any cases, a reasonable anticipation of requirements can be made with advantage from the  point of  view of increasing employment.     (7.) Ministry  of Transport. A further sum  ( 2,000,000) will be available fromthe Road  Fund for  expenditure on roads to relieve  unemployment in necessitous areas.     (8.) Unemployment Grants Committee. A further sum of  600,000 was placed at the disposal of this  Committee for dealing  with Schemes on the original basis of 60 per cent, of the Wages Bill.     (9.) Of/ice of  Works. A sum of   50,000 has been voted for unemployment relief works in the Royal Parks.    For the above schemes (apart from the  assistance  to Local Authorities with regard to Loan Charges, the Export Credits Scheme and the  Government^ liability under  the  Guarantee  of Loans for Capital  Undertakings)   the Government  has undertaken to find  12,000,000,  the greater portion within  the current financialrear.
