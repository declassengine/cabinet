This  document is the property of His Britannic Majestys  Government.SECRET.CP. 3690.THE  CABINET.SENTENCES  ON MEN  OF THE  CONN AUGHT  RANGERS                     CONVICTED  OF  MUTINY.       MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.    In  accordance  with the  decision of the Cabinet of  30th January (Cabinet 6 (22),Conclusion 8) I have examined the question of the possibility of releasing men of theConnaught Rangers who were convicted of mutiny.    After  careful thought I have come  to  the  conclusion that there are no military grounds whatever for  recommending their release.   Organized mutiny  is  one  of themost serious offences that a soldier can commit.    The effects of condonation would not be limited to these particular men.    Generally speaking, when soldiers  undergoing sentences are prematurely released,their release  occurs without being  known to the Army at large.  The men are let outof prison and become swallowed up in the population.   The Army is aware  of theirsentence (and it is their sentence which has the effect on discipline), but is  unaware oftheir premature release.    In the case, however, of  the Connaught Rangers, it is certain that their releasewill become very widely known.  It is sure to be advertised by the  Irish ProvisionalGovernment as an example of their power and clemency.   The Army will, draw its ownconclusions that political pressure can set  aside the verdict of a  Court  of Law, and savea criminal from the  consequences of his own act.    It is of paramount importance that the Army should continue  to view the offenceof mutiny as the most serious of military offences, and thus meriting  the  most severepunishment possible under the military code.  Grave effects may be anticipated  if theArmy ceases so. to regard mutiny, especially in the event of a civil  emergency.  Casesmay well arise where troops are called upon to support the Civil power when restoration oflaw and order will depend on their loyalty and  nothing  else.   Attempts were made totamper  with  the  discipline of the  Army during the emergency last  summer, and theeffect on the discipline of the Army both now and in any future emergency would bedeplorable  if it were believed that punishment for  organized  disobedience would beannulled as a result of subsequent public agitation for &quot; no  victimization.&quot;     It  may  be remembered that during the  Coal  Strike considerable pressure was brought to bear  to obtain  ihe  release of a  certain Corporal Varley of the 1st Bn.Grenadier Guards.  This reservist was tried for refusing  to obey his call to the Colours.Release was not granted, though a remission of the punishment was made.    As regards the Connaught Rangers, I would  point out that  the Commander-in-Chief in India insisted that  in the interest of discipline the death sentence should becarried out in one case.  Of  the 14  other death sentences,  12 were commuted to penal servitude for life and one to penal servitude for 20 years.     I would  point  out  the grave  difficulties that may be anticipated  in India in enforcing discipline in our Indian troops, if it becomes known that British soldiers guilty of&apos;the most serious military crime  have had  their punishment  reduced as  a result ofpolitical pressure.    While I am most strongly opposed to any action that could give colour to such asuggestion, I am prepared, if the Cabinet approve, to acquiesce in the sentences being reviewed; they are undoubtedly severe, and to that extent  merit revision.
