                    Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1922.SECRET. C;P; 3030. &quot;    I circulate to iny colleagues tlie following telegrams which I  have  received. fromthe Viceroy:  -From Viceroy, dated 18th January 1922.    Private; and personal.   You will  have seen from,  my  official telegram?1?; of  3,6th  * SeeJanuary  the resolutions passed by  Bombay Conference.  I need  scarcely tell you  Annexurel.that 1 do  not  think  them  worthy of  a moment&apos;s  serious  consideration,  .andthat they are&apos;&apos;the product of  Gandhi  embodied in a document emanating from theCommittee of;the Conference, but excluding Gandhi, who  attended only, to  use the phrase in the telegraphic communication, &quot; to advise and  to help and not as a -member or -delegate.&quot;  The conference developed according to my anticipations as I indicatedtfjlyouv save that on the surface it  has surrendered absolutely to  Gandhi,.who hasdominated the situation at Bombay.  If in truth we had to accept  published statement as containing the views of some 350 who  are said  to  have attended the^ conference,the situation would have become graver, because  Gandhi  would have obtained the adherence  of  some  who  had  hitherto  abstained from  politics, and  of many  whohitherto had refused to join him.  The truth is gradually leaking out.  Lloyd telegraphsme from  Bombay that the conference was a fiasco, and  it  is now  said (I  do  not. ye;tknow whether it is true) that there were scarcely 20 who  would sign  the. resolutionsarrived at, most of the members having come to the conclusion that  no  good  could result  fro.nl further&apos; discussion  with Gandhi.  At present  moment Malaviya has arrived here, and  is waiting to see  me, but I am purposely  not  granting  him  an interview!  till to-morrow, as a  debate on the subject  is now  proceeding in theLegislative-Assembly which will be voted upon  this evening.!  I thought the situation  t &amp;eeso important that I asked Vincent to bring up the written portion  of his speech ;to  be  Annexuremade, at  the House affecting proposed conference in order to get complete agreementif possible of all  members  of my  Council.  We  had  full discussion and; arrived atUnanimous -conclusions.   Vincent  and  Sapru  are   the   chief  speakers-  for -the&quot;Government to-day.   You  will appreciate importance of  a speech  by  Sapi-u,;:whocommands the conlidence  of the Liberals in  India.   Substantially, the  position we take is that impossible terms have been put forward, and the Government Aloes not propose: to;discuss them in detail, and that it must be obvious that no  Governmentcould think of accepting them.   I shall send you further  information to-morrow ; uponthe debate,.and also of  the happenings at the conference.  Sir C. S.  Nair  presided  atthe conference the first  two days, but  resigned on the  third  day, because  he  said:hewas convinced that Gandhi  did  not want a  conference  except to obtain,  his&apos;ownirreducible terms.   Other persons of importance also resigned or left, but  Lhave notyet ascertained their names.  In next few  days we shall know all the  facts.:.of. theconference/                                       -            :,    .-  \-r;a;    , My  impressions, which I  admit at  the moment  are  hastily formed, ;&apos;:,are&apos; that ghandi has made a tactical mistake, and, by showing such an irreconeileable attitude,has estranged men who for the moment were rather inclined to join him:   Moreover,the Bombay Conference has for the  present destroyed  all notions of a, roiuid-table conference, and  has  thus  taken from moderates and others the solution  they wishedof the present situation. You will understand  how easily the Indian mind fastens onthe compromise of a round-table  conference.  In view  of recent events in  Ireland,I remain of opinion hitherto expressed that  Government  could only  consider the convening  of  a conference  if satisfactory assurances  Avere given  of the.&quot;cessation ofunlawful activities&apos;of&apos; non-co-operationists.   What  I said on &apos;21st Beceniber you maytakeas fo-day&apos;s Views of myself  and my&apos; Executive1 Council&apos;. &quot;There&apos; isiuV prospect ofGandhigiVing such an assurance or discontinuing  some  of  his&apos;present&apos; unlawfulactivities.&apos;/ He&apos; will - doubtless - now&apos; begin  his civil  disobedience &apos; campaign with the(? communication, ? letter, ? proposition)  I have already indicated  to you.5072&apos;100  1.22I9th january 1922.
                                ANNEXURE  I.                      -1                     From Viceroy, dated IQlh January 1922.    Following apparently authoritative statement  appears in Bombay press telegramof 16th January :     &quot;Representative conference of  leaders passed following resolutions at,its,secondday&apos;s sitting    &quot; &apos;1. This Conference is strongly of  opinion that policy adopted by government within last few weeks, of extending and applying Criminal Law Amendment Act andSeditious Meetings Act to various parts of the country, and of misusing ordinary lawin connection with political offences leading to wholesale arrests and imprisonments,including  those  of some  of most respected leaders and  citizens,  constitutes anunwarranted encroachment  on  elementary rights of  citizenship, of freedom of press,and  liberty  of speech and  association,  has defeated its own  object  by alienationpopular  sympathy,  and aggravating general  discontent, and ought to  Lie  reversedwithout  delay.     &quot; &apos; 2.  This Conference is further of  opinion that, until it is clear beyond any doubt that no other means will  secure redress of country&apos;s grievances, and status  of full  responsible government, civil disobedience contemplated  by Allahabad Congressought not to be resorted to.     &quot; &apos; 3.  In response to sentiments expressed by His Excellency the  Viceroy in his speech at Calcutta on  21st December,  and in order to explore all methods of  reaching a harmonious and honourable settlement of important issues  now  before the  country,namely,  Punjab and  Khilafat wrongs, and demands  for Swaraj or full responsible government on Dominion  basis, this Conference supports proposal for  a round table conference between Governments and popular representatives, and is of opinion that,in order to provide favourable atmosphere for dispassionate consideration of points incontroversy, all notifications issued and orders passed  by Government under  Act 14of 1908, Part 3, and Seditious  Meetings Act should be withdrawn, and all prisonersconvicted  or  under arrest or  prosecution under  aforesaid   notifications or  orders should be released, as also Fatwa prisoners ;  and that inasmuch as persons have been convicted for non-violent activities and other activities of an innocent character undercover of ordinary laws, a committee should be  appointed by Government consistingof two  persons, one  to be  nominated by Government  and other by Committee of conference appointed by Resolution No.  5, with power to them to appoint an  umpireto investigate cases of persons  hereinbefore referred to, and  that such of them as-might be recommended by said committee or umpire  be released, and that pendingresult(s) of said Conference all hartals, pieketting and  civil disobedience should cease.     &quot; &apos;  4.  This  Conference is  likewise  of  opinion that, having regard to  critical situation in country, and desirability effecting early settlement, round-table conference should be  called as soon as possible, and  that  His   Majesty&apos;s  Government  shouldclothe  His  Excellency the Viceroy  with authority  necessary  for the purpose of arriving at a settlement.      &quot; &apos;  5. Without at present going into particulars of demands of  country withreference to Punjab, Khilafat and Swaraj questions&apos;,  this Conference hereby appoints a committee  of following persons to carry on all  communications with Government on  the  one  hand, and important political organisation  in country on  the other hand, with  view of  arranging composition, dates  and other  details  relating  to holding of said round-table conference, and for all purposes incidental to carrying- out of  those  resolutions,  including,  when necessary, convening of   another  repre- sentative  conference.  The committee-consists  of  20  members, including Sir M. Visvesvarayya Pundit  Malaviya,  Mr. Seshagiri  Dyer,   Sir P. C.  Roy,  Mr. Jinnah, Sir  Dinsha Petit, Sir H. Wadia, Mr. Bhurgri, Dr.  Gour Pundit Kunzru  and - Mr. Hasan Imam, with power to co-opt.&apos; &quot;      N.B. It appears that Mr. Gandhi attended representative  conference  to  advise and  help,  and not as a member or delegate.                                 ANNEXE RE II.                      &apos;  *                From  Viceroy, Home  Department, 19/7i January 1922.      No.  Ill  Pol.
