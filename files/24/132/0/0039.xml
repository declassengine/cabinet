The organised unemployed in London and Sheffield are showing signs of restiveness.     The Western Secretariat of the Communist Internationalis sending money to the British Bureau of the RedInternational of Labour Unions this week.     The General Coimcil of the Trades Union Congress andthe Executive of the Labour Party have decided to &quot;assist&quot;the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, which will reduce its price to a pennyas from. January 23rd.     The Communist Party has selected some of its members asParliamentary candidates aid is considering the possibility,of a Labour-oonmun 1st &quot;coalition&quot;.
TBS TOJHgLCYZP          Cn  January 10th  the wholly unemployed on the live     registers totalled approximately 1,933,000 as compared with     1,885,300 on  December 30th:  the latest return of short time     workers  is  304,000.         The  approaching  exhaustion of tho funds placed at the     disposal  of the Unemployed Grants  Committee is causing     anxiety  among sections  of  the unemployed, who fear that     relief work will be imperilled:  the  extremist Press finds in     tho  situation an excuse for.  attacking the Government.         The  National Administrative Council is paying special     attention to  the question  of overtime:  it will be remembered     that the engineers are  at present  balloting on the proposed     agreement re  management and  overtime, drawn up at the end of     last year and recommended  by th-Q Executive, ?/ho were careful     to inform their members that 90,000 engineers are unemployed.     On January  16th about  1,000  organised London unemployed     aocompanied a deputation,  consisting.of Hanriington, Holt-,     Rose and  Sllis  (Walthaiastow), Swaine  (St. Panoras), Andrews     and  Smmerson  (Greenwich) and Webb  (Saling) to the offices of     the  Amalgamated Engineering  Union  in Peckham Road:  the     deputation  was informed by .J.T. Brownlie that the unemployed&apos;s     protest  against overtime would be  brought before his executive     Ilannington  said that  the unemployed were &quot;ready and willing     to raid  every faotory in tho country to prevent the working     of overtime,&quot; if the  engineers1 executive would net take     action.   The unemployed procession subsequently  visited a     Poskham works where blackleg labour was alleged tc have b^en     introduced  during a strike,  but found only the caretaker on     the  premises.         The  &quot;Daily Herald&quot; reports that a band of South London     Unemployed  seized Southwark  frorkhouse on January 17th and     remained  in possession  for about an hour, hoisting the Eed     Flag and  holding up communication. -
      It was announced at unemployed meetings last week thatdeputations tc demand increased relief from the Guardians will Ifbe organised in the near future..      My correspondent reports that the general unemployment situation in Lancashire and Cheshire shows no sign ofimprovement ;  the cotton industry is in a particularly bad way Ifa typical instance occurred at Blackburn, where 23 mills havebeen  stepped, last week, when about 150 people recommended &apos;,ythe   Clergy to a Distress Committee assembled at 4 p.m. andstood ip extreme odd until 7 p.in. when parcels of food valued at 5/- and 10/- were distributed.   The chairman of the extremijunemployed committee in Rochdele, Robert Dawson, was summoned afthe local Police Court on January 11th in respect of variousbreaches of the peace caused by holding meetings.  The toneof Dawson&apos;s speeches has recently been revolutionary and he is fdescribed as a  dangerous agitator.      Peeling among the urieirployed in Sheffield is running highpressure on the Guardians has resulted in an increased allowancfiof 3/- a week but the agitators are dissatisfied with this amonOn January 13th the unemployed overturned a hut at Meersbrookpay station in which men were dealing with pay:  the clerk was!                                  .                           Iroughly handled and forced to promise that he would give theunemployed their money in an hour&apos;s time.  My correspondent anticipates trouble in Sheffield during the next few weeks.                                                      &apos; the     \      There is not much movement among the unemployed in/Midland:;! but the  numbers attending demonstrations in Coventry are increas ing.COIEUJJISTS     Thore is evidence that the supply of Russian money forcertain communists in this country has been resumed, although tCommunist Party io in great financial difficulties.   Accordingto the &quot;International Press Correspondence&quot;, the  nglish editioi                                                            of/
 of which  (edited by Philips Prioe in Berlin) &quot;is sont free of charge  to all labour and oomnninist organs in England, America, India,  South Africa, Australia and Canada&quot;:  communist parties will, howovor, be expected to pay as well as to receive,  in the future.  On December 4th the Comintern decided that &quot;all members members must pay an international assessment&apos;&apos; as from January 1st, 1922.  The assessment is to be paid quarterly and is designed to meet the expenses of tho &quot;central apparatus of theJComintern&quot; and to enable the &quot;better situated sections to support the weaker ones&quot;:  it is doubtful whether the British Communist Party will appreciate the necessity of refunding a part of their iiussian subsidy.     The Executive of tho Communist Party has boon devoting a good deal of attention to its election policy and will probably adopt the suggestion of R.M. Fox that &quot;the immediate need is for a labour-coalition against a capitalist-coalition.  Prom a communist standpoint the problem is to get labour moving  however .slowly and to extend communist influence.&quot;   In this connection interest attaches to a letter written on Janizary 10th by  Fred Pcet, acting secretary of the Communist Party to Saklatvala, the notorious Indian agitator and communist.          &quot;At the meeting of the Executive Committee held this     week-end, tho question of the position of members of the     Party who may have been adopted as Labour Party Candidates     in various constituencies was considered, and a general      instruction to these comrades was drawn.          &quot;In accordance with this instruction, I am directed     to ask you to go forward as a Labour Candidate, subject to     the rule of the Party which governs the relat ion ships     between the Party, and candidates or elected representatives,.          &quot;We shall be glad if you v/ill let us know from  time     to time how the situation in Battersea develops and  report     on the pro^reas you may make,   We wish you success,  in your     candidature and promise you that any assistance the  Party     may be able .to give you, will  bo given.&quot;     Peet has also sent the following communication to Robert Stewart, who was recently tho unsuccessful  communist candidate at the Caerphilly bye-election;          &quot;The Executive Committee  dooided  to recommend that you     should bo the candidate for tho  East Rhondda constituency     which is represented at present  by Maj or Watts-Morgan.     Watts-Morgan was unopposed at  tho  last election and  is,  as     you know,  a  minors&apos;  candidate.   All the reports from the     divisions suggest that he is by  no moans popular with&apos; the      i                                                miners/
miners and as he may not be opposed by the Coalition it Is&apos;possible that you will have a straight fight with him...     &quot;Arising out of the discussion it.was decided torecommend that the following constituencies in your divisishould be contested with the candidates mentioned below.                   Dundee            W. Gallacher                   Motherwell        J.T. Palton-IJawbold.                    inning Park      Mrs. Helen Crawfurd..          &quot;Letters have  been sent to the branches  concerned     informing them of these decisions and asking  them to take      the necessary steps to set up the machinery  required.  An;     intensive campaign  should be organised with the least     possible delay and  your sneakers should be so arranged so ;     that the maximum amount of effort can be put  into the work,ff     The communist attitude towards the proposed economicconference of European powers is well expressod in a paragraph jjheaded &quot;Tho Penitents at Cannes&quot;, which appeared in &quot;ThoCommunist&quot; of January 14th:                                    g          &quot;The capitalist world goes to Cannes as  the old     Emperor H11 de brand  went to Canossa - to make  its submissloi     For four years they have tried to overthrow Soviet Russia.     To-day they confess their failure.  Only a few years back     they talked of a barbed wire fence round Russia.  To-day til     offer Russia recognition with full relations.  A short     tiaie back they called for the heads of Lenin and Trotsky si     common criminals.   To-day they invite them to their midst     for conference.  It is not for love of Lenin and Trotsky     and Soviet Russia that they do these things.  It is the     victories of the Red Army that are reflected  in Cannes...     Russia is throwing  among them the apple of discord in the     form of concessions.  There will be some interesting      manoeuvring ahead. .The .workers of the world will need to     be on the alert to  assist Prussia in the dangerous period     coming.  Meanwhile, if Lenin comes to Genoa, we may look     out for something.   The bolsheviks do not miss opportunity     And Lloyd George and 3riand will not be looking forward toll     that meeting.  Soall wonder that they try to hide their     own change of front by trumpeting abroad of change in     Russia.&quot;                                                               I     Anxious to earn the approbation of Russia the communistsare redoubling their efforts to raise money for the famine fund.,.more especially as Moscow has referred to the sums hithertocollected as a &quot;modest beginning&quot;.   A &quot;Russian Famine Bazaar&quot; i!i    -                                                           mbeing organised but it was decided at a secret meeting of branchdelegates on January 16th that the Communist Party should not be mentioned in the advertisements.  There is little doubt that insome respects at least communists are using the famine as acloai                                                               IIfor propaganda as one of the lerlin leaders suggested last week                                                               it that if Tom Mann met with difficulty in entering the United Statlof America the &quot;famine stunt&quot; should bo utilised,  whitehead has                                                         been/ 1
been refused permission to the States and  the  publicity  given  tohis case has caused amusing recrimination  among  rank and filecommunists in this country, who say that it  was  a shame  to waste&quot;famine money&quot; on a first class passage  for  him.    Provincialbranches are showing some activity  in connection  with  tho  bazaarend are collecting miscellaneous articles  including in the caseof Birmingham 12 egg cosies, a model  of  a  settee  and two pairs of&quot;ovcling&quot; stockings.     hi reference to the connection between  cemmunistsand  indian and Egyptian agitators to which reference  has  been  made  in previous reports interest attaches to the following translation of an extract from the &quot;Eommunistiseher Pressedienst&quot;  (&quot;Communist PressService&quot;  published in Berlin/&apos; number 399  of January 10th:     &quot;The Revolutionary Movement in India  and  Egypt          &quot;Reported from London:   The situation in India  is     becoming extraordinarily grave.   The revolutionaries  are     informing the peasants in various parts of the country     that the Englivh King has been deposed.  Taxes and rent     are reported to be no longer paid.  In many parts of  the     country it is believed that the  independent     Indian  administration will be introduced.          &quot;In Egypt the boycott of English firms is boing     organised.   The natives are withdrawing  their money  from     the English banks.&quot;     Documents from the Egyptian Socialist Party dated Cairo,December 22nd, have been forwarded to Robert Stewart,  Glasgow,through Berlin for his Information:  one  is a  French translationfrom the Arabian of a manifesto of the Egyptian Socialist  Partyto manual and intellectual workers:   the other is  an  unsignedGerman document from which the following  extract is translated:          &quot;It is plain that England has now decided on a course     of intimidation as a result of the fear that the  example     of Ireland would have a bad influence upon Egyptian and     Indian diplomats.    English and  French pap ers  published     here are filled with news about  the  repressive measures     in India (to intimidate the enemy).    And indeed  the     recipe is working, very much so:  it happened  yesterday     that two English soldiers wore shot  from&quot; behind by two     English agents-provocateur in order  to &apos;influence public     opinion&apos;  and to bring matters to a head.   I believe,     however,  that they will not confine  themselves to two     soldiers; probably  England will: have  to pay dearly and     arrange a pogrom of Europeans or something of  this kind    &apos;for the nationalists are keeping themselves very   quiet.&quot;                                                    Pege/

Interesting evidence has been received to the effectthat a financial subsidy is being sent to the British Bureauthis week:  the exact amount is not yet known but arrangementwere made for the money to be changed in Germany and broughtto this country by hand:  elaborate precautions were takento cover the transaction by changing small sums in severalbanks into marks and English notes;  in this way it was also possible to &quot;avoid a certain State tax which has to be paid on large amounts.&quot;   The evidence discloses the existenceof complicated revolutionary machinery in Berlin, whioh is controlled by the Western Secretariat:  tho British Bureauhas been instructed to send copies of as many trade unionjournals a3 possible to the Western Secretariat, to which ith&amp;3 al30 to render a monthly statement of expenditure.     &apos;The agenda for the session of the Profintern  (central committee of the Red International of Labour Unions) onJanuary 25th, which Watkins will attend^ is as follows?     &quot;1.

We can get this number easilyif each one of your members will go at once to thenewsagent in his district and place an order for thepaper.     &quot;This is extremely important, as by so doing weshall be saved the great expense of over-printing.Where possible, we suggest two or more copies shouldbe takc-n each day, the extra copies takon to be sold to friends who at present do not buy the paper.     &quot;7/e also need more funds.  A3 you knowm a dailypaper is an expensive venture.

Unemployment, thecontinued attacks on hours and wages by hugecombinations of employers,  all prove the need for a .strong, united and organised Labour Movement backed by a Press that can be read in every town and village of the land.     &quot;The coming General Election also demonstratesthe need.   Tories, Liberals, Coalitionists, all the groups which represent money and wealth will pourout half truth3 and lies day by clay.   We shall have one voice, and that the Daily Herald, which will                                             daily/
     daily tell the story of what Labour wants,  and how we     hope to attain our ends.          &quot;We all confidently appeal to you to range     yourselves with us in a groat effort to establish    . the Daily Herald as a strong, fighting, working class     organ.  Always remember that though we cannot offer     you free insurance schemes of doubtful utility, we     do supply you with a bright -newspaper containing all     the news of the world and of the movement,  together     with a thoroughly efficient all-round review of sport     of every kind.   And wo are able, as members of the     organised working-class,  to invite the workers to     join with us in a real Insurance scheme one that aims     at the prevention of evil and disease-, because labour     stands four square for a social orde*r, within which     the care of each will be the duty of all, and within     which preventable sickness, accidents and poverty will     find no place.          &quot;Confident of your ungrudging support,                  We are, yours fraternally,                            Arthur Henderson                            George Iansbury                            R.B.

Please see that this     letter is immediately, brought before your organisation     and please see the enclosed poster is at once     displayed by your newsagent or elsewhere.&quot;     In an article entitled &quot;Our Day&quot;, George lansburywrote, on January 14th:          &quot;As the circular tells you-we also need, and     must have, more money.  We have asked-for various     sums, and so far have., never got all we asked for...          &quot;If you, in your branches and by individual     effort, will raise  35,000, m shall go marching     along  -from victory to victory.  I wonder if this     time we really shall do the trick?  For over 10 years     myself and others -have been begging and borrowing     to get this paper a firmly established success,  :&apos;;ome     friends have fallen out, weary, tired and heart-sick.     Others have left us for reasons of their own.&quot;     The paper maintains its begging campaign with considerable energy, &quot;out there is as yet no indication that its readers are responding to the invitation to &quot;Be abooster for the rooster&quot;, nor is there an immediate prospect that the paper will attain the million circulationat which it aims.

ARRESTS     The present managers of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; are maijimost of their time as may he seen from the followingextracts from a leader published on January 10th:          &quot;Down and down and down.   Such is the fate oflj     the working class, employed and unemployed alike,     with a Coalition Government, the subservient ally     the big capitalist interests, in power. -          &quot;And, so long as those interests are in power     so long will the fate of the employed and unemploye]     of the working class be to go down and down and do          &quot;Unless the workers realise who is the enemy,     unless they realise the necessity for getting     together and getting power to use against  that     enemy, their lot witll always be to go down - and     down - and down...          &quot;Side by side with the attack on the wages     and hours of those in work proceeds the attack on     the grants to the unemployed...          &quot;The attack is quite definitely and     deliberately on the whole standard of life of the     vast bulk of the nation.   Those in power mean the     people of this country to be broken in to a     standard far lower than that meagre level of     subsistence which the Labour movement has fought     and toiled in the past to win.  But those in power     do not submit, or intend to submit, to any     curtailment of their own extravagantly high standaxi     of life...          &quot;If the Government &quot;cannot1 get the money, thaff     is because it will not get it from where the money     Is...          &quot;The war was &quot;won&apos;.   And who benefits?  The     rioh are still rich.   But the poor get poorer and     poorer, and our masters will find no way out - becaii     they don&quot;t want to.          &quot;They want to get you down to, cvnd below the     &quot;coolie1 level - and keep you, and your children,     there for ever.power.&quot;Ind they  will succeed - unless Labour gets     On January 18th five of the West Bromwich unemployedJohn.

The greater majority of the Sinn Fein    Clubs in Great Britain may  be expected to follow de Valera.         P.J. Kelly, President  of tho Irish Self-Determination    League in Great Britain is  reported to have received    instructions from the Opposition or Republican party  in    Ireland, that  all branches  of the League  are  not to have  any    peace celebrations; that  they are.to work hard to force    recognition of Ireland as a Republic;  care is to be  taken    to keep their machinery private and that  they * are to    communicate any matters direct to de Valera or Austin Stack.         The Central Executive  Council of the League on Sunday,    the 15th January, passed  the following resolution:              &quot;The Central Executive Council, while regretting         that Da.il Eireann has  felt itself compelled to agree         to a settlement which  is loss than the complete  claim         of Ireland to absolute independence, pledges support to         tho Government of the  Irish Free Stato,  if and when         established, but, at the same time,  calls upon the  Irish         people of Great Britain to help their compatriots at         home In every way until that complete claim is finally         achlevod.,&quot;         In the north of England new branches of  the Irish    Self-Determination Leaguo are being inaugurated and it is a    curious fact that in many places some of  the  most extreme    Sinn Feiners and members  of the Irish Republican Army are    amongst tho most enthusiastic supporters  of the Treaty.
