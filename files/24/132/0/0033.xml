This Document  is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government.]                     Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1922.                                                                                /SECRET.CP. 3633.        Financial Questions outstanding between the War Office  and the                                  India Office.     Telegram circulated  to  the Cabinet by the Secretary of  State  for  India  incontinuation of CP. 3601.              From Viceroy, Finance Department, 14th January 1922.    436 E.   Your telegram dated  6th December 1921, No. 6203.   We  are  in entire agreement with your view that the question of India&apos;s liability in  respect  of casualtypensions of British troops, and the question of India&apos;s further contribution to the war,are not capable of arbitration.    2. We hold the same  view with regard to the  question  of India&apos;s liability fo1East  Persia  expenditure   and  for  demobilisation  concessions.   We  hold  verydefinitely that the determination of the incidence of the expenditure in  each of these four cases turns upon a single  constitutional issue, namely, whether the expenditure is of a character which can be legitimately imposed  on Indian revenues, and we arefurther advised that the Secretary  of State for India in Council is, under the Govern-ment  of India  Act, the sole arbiter competent to decide the constitutional issue inquestion, and that it is not within the authority of the Secretary of State for India inCouncil, under that Act, to refer  disputes on  such  an issue  to the arbitration of a third person.    3. This  is substantially the  view  which  you yourself expressed in para.  9 ofyour  Secret  Minute of the 23rd  March 1921, which was circulated to the Cabinet,where you reserved to yourself in Council the powers conferred on  you by section 21of the Government of India Act, under which  the expenditure of Indian revenues is subject to your control and no grant or appropriation from any part of those revenuescan be made without concurrence of a  majority of votew at a meeting of Council ofthe Secretary of State for India.     4. It is  unnecessary for us to recapitulate the reasons why we hold that  these four claims of His Majesty&apos;s Government represent  charges which cannot legitimatelybe imposed upon Indian revenues.  You are  already fully acquainted with them, andwe are sensible that, in three of the cases, you hold the same  view  as ourselves.  Weare disquieted to learn, on the other hand, that you are apparently prepared to  make some concessions in the matter of East Persia expenditure ;  and we must thereforereaffirm most  emphatically our  views regarding   this  charge   which  have  been previously communicated  to  you on more occasions than one.   We  see no reason why this claim should be  differentiated from the others, either in  the matter of itssuitability for arbitration, or in  respect of  legitimacy of charges against Indianrevenues  which its admission would involve.  In this connection we desire to endorse the view which  was expressed  in their  dissentient report by  the  India office representatives on the Committee  on Indian Charges for Forces in East  Persia.     5. In considering the whole matter, we  have found further difficulty which has so far never been definitely expressed.   We have referred, above, to advice given us on the point of law, to the effect that it  is not within the competence of the Secretary of State for India in Council to refer to arbitration of a third  party decision whether certain expenditure can be chargeable to Indian revenues.  This advice was furnished to us in connection with  the  award of Sir Laming Worthington-Evans in the war gratuity case, communicated to us with your Despatch dated  12th  May 1921, No. 35, Financial.   It has also been held  that, notwithstanding the award and  your  apparent acquiescence in it, expenditure involved by payment of Avar gratuity  at Is. id. per       5066   100  1.22
rupee, instead ot at current rate of-exchange, cannot be admitted legally as chargeable to Indian revenues, without ratification of both Houses of Parliament being obtained,as was  done  in case  of  India&apos;s  Contribution to expenses of Great War.  So far as war Gratuity Case is concerned, where  payment  has already  been effected,-  question-of regularity will doubtless be pursued by Audit  Authorities, whose function it is toensure regularity  of  financial  decisions ; but we see clearly that the same difficultywill arise and will acquire a more practical shape if  the  cases which are now underconsideration  lead to charge  being  made  upon  Indian revenues.  The permanent(sic ? paramount) consideration in the cases  still pending, is that the sums of  moneyinvolved are so large  that if they, or any considerable portion thereof, were  imposedupon Indian revenues, the claims could not be paid without funds being  speciallyraised for the purpose, and it may be taken  as certain that Legislature in this country would refuse grant of necessary supply.  If, therefore,  Resolutions were laid beforeboth Houses of Parliament in order to regularise any payments that might be claimedfrom  Indian revenues on this account, either under arbitrators award  or otherwise,they would  inevitably be met by counter Resolutions of.  Indian Legislature protestingmost  vehemently, and declining to  give their authority for raising funds required.You will realise that a situation would then arise which in present condition  of affairs it is impossible to contemplate;     G.  We  trust, therefore,  that you will resist to the utmost all demands to  refer anyof these cases to arbitration and will, by virtue of your  authority   under Governmentof India Act, also decline to admit any payment on this  account from Indian revenues.
