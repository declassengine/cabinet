The possibility of increased relief in Poplar has given a f 13 lip to the organised unemployed in London,who are again demonstrating before Guardians8 Offices.     Communist officials are working to effeot a &quot;coalition&quot;with the Labour Party for municipal and parliamentary elections.   the official attitude of the Labour Party isnot yet clear.     Sylvia Pankhurst is attempting to form nuclei of theFourth International in this corjntry and has been askedto attend the International Conference in Berlin thismonth.     The engineers have rejected by a majority of14,715 the proposed management and overtime agreement:only C5,765 voted.     There is considerable discontent in the coalfieldsowing to reduced wages.
      On  January  24th the number  of wholly  unemployed  on  the live  registers was  approximately  1,915,700  aa  compared with 1,  925,956 on  January  17th:   part  time  workers  numbered 282,500 on  January  17th.      (There ia a  recrudescence  of- activity  among  the  organised unemployed in the  London area:   this is  due  in  part  to the proposal of the Poplar Guardians  to  raise the scale  of relief  and  in part to a meeting  between  Tom  Bell and the National Administrative Council  of  Unemployed, when  this &quot;body  was told that unless it  was more effective he would  have to  report adversely on  it  to Moscow.      During  the  week meetings  of varying numbers have  been held in Camberwell, Clapham, Greenwich,   ewisham,  Poplar,  Richmond,  Southward, Stratford,  Tottenham, and  V7andsworth:  in  most of these  oases  deputations  have  approached -the Guardians on  relief questions.  An  audience of  1,000  in Poplar  was  addressed  by Mrs,  Thring  and Soderberg of the Industrial  Workers  of the -.world.      On  January  25th the poplar  Board of Guardians decided&quot;  to  adopt the following now scale of  relief:            40a.  for  man and  wife            6s. for each child  up to  16 -            Eent  to 15s.            1 cwt.  coal or  its  equivalent in gas            153.  for  single persons between 16 and  18.      The Guardians were informed by  the  &quot;Ministry of Health  that the suggested scale was unlawful and  the Board decided  on  January 51st  to postpone  the  operation  of the new scale:  the Clerk reported that if the now scale were enforced  the &quot;estimated deftciencp on  March 51st would be  96,00&apos;&quot;,&apos;.                                                  Lansbury/
Lansbury moved that all cheques except those for Vcq.es be held M.P in order to conserve the Guardians&apos; funds and threatenedthat if local shop-keepers refused to honour relief tickets he l]would make arrangements with the London Co-operative Society,  j     On January 20th a demonstration of unemployed from Southwa Iand Camberwell visited the Southwark Guardians but were refused \an interview and after a march of some hours&apos;wore dispersed by Ithe police:   nine arrests were made with the following results!     Ernest Perkins, insulting behaviour, fined 20s.           j     Margaret Jones, insulting behaviour, fined 40s,     Frederick Mears, insulting behaviour and obstruction,     [               bound over in 40s. for twelve months.     Charlotte Sullivan, insulting behaviour,               fined 40s. or 21 da^s.     Robert Overton, assault, fined  3 or 1 month.     Albert Parker, insulting behaviour, fined               40s. or 21 days.     John Hewitson, insulting behaviour, fined               40s, or 21 days.     Robert Dimmock, insulting behaviour, bound over               in the sum of 40s. for twelve months.     It is possible that further demonstrations to Guardians1                 -Offices will take place and in the case of Camberv/ell a secretdemonstration is being planned for the next meeting of theGuardians:  18 volunteers have been selected as an &quot;attackingparty&quot; and they are discussing the feasibility of uaing smokebombs.     Unemployed speskers have stated that attempts will be madeto employ men on the Wembley exhibition at less than tradeunion rates and they threaten picketing by the unemployedshould the &quot;necessity&quot; arise.     It is reported that the Red Intex-national of labourUnions Intends to take a hand in the organisation of the Londonunemployed and to assist in arranging deputations to trade unionsthe circulation of &quot;Out of V/ork&quot; fell to about 27,0-X) in
      On January 30th unemployed from Westminster,  Deptford, lewisham,  Sydenham and Befmondsey met in Caxton Hall to unite in opposition to the extremist unemployed organisation:   the&apos; proceedings  wore interrupted by Communists and  It  was eventually decided to refer back tho scheme to  the individual ;jroup&quot; .      The unemployment returns for Lancashire and Cheshire show a slight increase for the woek ending January 24th,  the total number of claims for all classes of benefit at  the exchanges  of the division being 429,995 as against 427,935 on January 17th. The extremist unemployed committee in Liverpool has  decided  to suspend operations,  owing to lack of support.      Ho perceptible  change in the unemployment  situation in  the IvtLdlands is  reported:  the extremists are concentrating upon tho elections to Boards of QuBxtikxfW o-- which&apos; they hope-to secure representation of the organised unemployed.      In Yorkshire tho organised unemployed are  quiet -.but the Sheffield  extremists are discussing the  advisability of pressing their Guardians to grant the Poplar scale of relief.      As a result of  pressure rffi.de by Labour members  on the County Councils a special conference representative-  of .all local authorities in Glamorganshire,  Jvlonmoutlishire,  Breconshire..and West Carmarthenshire, was held at Cardiff to discuss the question of  unei^employment on January 30th.   The conference decided to send a deputation representing County&apos; Councils, Board of Guardians and Borough Councils   to interview the Premier with a demand that unemployment  should&apos;  be  made a national and not a locai charge.  The res olution/was proposed by Sir Walter Nicholas,  clerk to the E hondda Urban District Council, and solicitor to the South Wales Miners.&apos;  Federation.      On January 28th a deputation from the Ogmore  Divison of the Labour Party  interviewed the Bridgend and Cowbrid&amp;e Guardians  and urged  that the scale of relief,- which.-has  been                                                    recently/
    recently reduced, be re-considered.   L. Lewis said that if th    Board took no steps, the deputation would consider collecting    the rates themselves, distributing a reasonable amount to the    unemployed and giving the surplus to the Guardians.  Ho was no    allowed to finish his speech.THS COiMIJMOTS -         Communists in London are devoting a good deal of attentioi    to the London County Council elections and in the provinces    unemployment and a possible general election are the subjects c    most of tho speeches.         lily- Midlands correspondent states that while the increase j    in actual membership of the Communist party i3 negligible in hi    area, numbers of the unemployed are becoming converts to the    doctrine preached by Communists, who lose no opportunity of    seizing local leadership.  Communist officials are visiting    certain areas&apos;and making personal enquiries regarding unemployel    organisations and factories in ?/hich overtime is being worked. \         Propaganda on behalf of the Russian Famine Fund is still    carried on but there does not appear to be much enthusiasm amoul    the rank and file:  on January 29th only about 400 people attem    a famine lecture by William McLaine, which v/as a failure largol;    owing to the absence of the more important lantern slides    recently purchased from Germany,,  McLaine load instructed Tom    Clark to send these new slides from Glasgow but Tom Bell sent    them back as they were intended for Famine agitation in Scotland    McLaine is much, ruffled by Boll&quot; a action and complained on    January 27th that &quot;my meeting will be spoiled and all the people    who have paid sixpence for their tickets will be swindlodo&quot;  Tho    Communist Party has now cabled to Germany for another set of    lantern slides.  Preparations for the Russian Famine Bazaar, whi    is to be held in the Holborn Hall on March 25th - 27th, are bein    pushed forward:  delegates to the Central Committoe met at Zing                                                          Street/
Street on January 30th:  estimates for stalls were discussed and it was decided, if possible, net to give the order tocapitalist firms but to have the stalls made by &quot;comrades&quot;.There is to be no -)ant ion of the Communist Party inadvertisements of the Bazaar and letters of appeal for goods to large London firms, will bear only the Gray&apos;s Inn Roadaddress.   The Irish Communist Party has been asked tosupport the bazaar.  Thousands of flags for sale on behalfof the Fund at football matches, meetings and factories arebeing offered to branches.  According to a letter sent to theCoTentry branch from headquarters, money for the Fund is coming in very slowly.  Coventry decided to ask for collectingsheets, but Leicester has informed headquarters that the branch, can do nothing in the matter:  Birmingham continuesto contribute socks and small woollen articles to the fund and has been informed by London that if other branches doas well, the success of the Bazaar is assured.     The &quot;Free Speech Defence Committee&quot; is endeavouring towork up agitation for the release of Inkpin:  ex-ColonelMalone has been obtaining signatures for the letter sent tothe Prime Minister and efforts.are being made to inducepolitical parties, trade unions and Labour bodies to forwardresolutions demanding Inkpin&apos;B release to the Prime Ministerand the Homo Secretary.   There is some feeling among the rank and file, however, that little notice is taken when   .one of their number is imprisoned and that the case of thesecretary is being given unfair prominence.  Sylvia pankhursfcvoiced the opinion of more than one Communist when she wrotein the last issue of her paper:          &quot;We regret also the extravagant expenditure in     this case; an expenditure that produced no propaganda     result.  The expensive legal luminaries hired for the     defence,of course, advanced no Communist argument.  Hot,     thus does the blood of the martyr become the seed of     the Churoh.&quot;                                                   On/
     On January  28th a secret meeting of  the  Worth EasternDivisional Council of. the Communist Party at  Newcastle was attended, by delegates from Gateshead, Newcastle  All  Saints,Newcastle Central, South Shields,  Sunderland  and WestHartlepools  the Birtley and Ashington  delegates had influenza,Newcastle reported that bad weather had stopped  open airmeetings and that the sales of  &quot;The Communist&quot; had consequentlyfallen.    300 raised by the All Saints branch and theSocialist Society had been sent to the  Friends1  Committee andthe Council expressed the opinion  that  some of the money shouligo to the Partyrs fund.  Cameron reported that an  unemployeddivisional council covering&apos; the Tyne and  Y/ear areas  had been set up;  the committees concerned  being Newcastle, Gateshead,Wallsend, South  Shields, Felling and Sunderland:   seven member;of the council of twelve were Communists,  Cameron  being chairs .and Smith secretary:  he added  that demonstrations were being  Iarranged to protest against overtime.   E.H. Brown, the         idivisional organiser, is trying to effect  a fusion of the two  ifBradford branches:  he has recently visited the  Blrkenshaw andShipley branches and reports that  they  are sound,  though smallj     During the week-end.ex-Colonel Malone, M.P.,  andW. Gallacher addressed meetings in Coventry:  their  remarksemphasized a note which has recently been sounded  in Communistspeeches, that of detailed criticism of Gov/ernment policyrather than, an indiscriminate attach upon capitalism&apos;.  Thefollowing extracts indicate the line taken by Malone;-I       &quot;Whether we  look  at  the  British Empire  or at the world we.  always&apos; fir-l onrse&apos;jve&apos;s&apos; coming across-the figure of V:r0 I-lcvd Sec\vgs&apos;,c   Gome times Coalition,  sometimes liberal,  Xsa Lloyd George is  always  the biggest enemy of- working&apos; class in  this  land.   I want  you to  try and pictW to ycta-seli&apos; Mre Lloyd  George  as trickster,  a man who tal^ so much and dees  so little.   Look at his record.  Look at his.Conferences&apos;with the members  going about like a band of strolling minstrels.   What do these  Conferences mean?  Mr. George and  the other Prime Ministers after ths war concluded the Treaty  of Versailles and  ever since the&apos; have been strolling round Europe like a band of Minstrels Thev have been trying  to  make this peace they  made.,  work&apos;                                                        Th&apos;
William/                        M 7 -Then all of a sudden after nine or ten Conferences Mr,Ceorge comes along with a bright idea, . He says I willhave a new and wonderful policy at Cannes and instead of trying to annihilate Germany and cooDce Russia, I willtry to have a talk with Lenin himself at Genoa.   Withregard to the new policy against Russia. I was two years agoadvocating the conclusion of peace with Soviet Russia...                                                 *     &quot;What sent M. Briand back post haste to Paris and Mr.Lloyd George oust haste back to London.  People ask what are all these&quot;Conferences about?  They seem to have noLead or a.i.\y tail.  The reason of all this confusion istha-c yen. aid I have before our eyes M.. Briand and LloydGeorge as they appear on the stage but they are onlymarionettes moving in accordance with those who pull thesti-3iigo - the big financiers and bankers.   It is easy to understand the big bankers and financiers supportingMr. Lloyd George,.  The most distressing result in thelast few years of the capitalist policy is the resultof the Treaty of Versailles and that the workers havebeen led to believe that they would be led to betterconditions and luxury.  Have they?  Look at tho slump theyhave been brought into to-day.  The figures of unemploymentare worse than before the war.   What remedies have the;Conservatives and Liberals?  Reduoe expenditure and cutdown wages.  What expenditure do they want to cut down?Expenditure on the education of your children, in facton&quot;all expenditure for the well being of the working class.   All this is In the report of the Geddes Committee,they must save 150 to 200&apos;million pounds..   In the last three years they have spent hundreds of millions in warupon Russia and in supporting concessionaires in otherparts of the  world...     &quot;Mr. Lloyd George is the shepherd of the capitalistlambs.  Look at the speeches we have heard in the lastfow weeks.  In all these electioneering speeches by Mr.Lloyd George, Churchill, Guest, and the other lessersatellites - they have all come together,now - and they say the great danger is that&apos;private enterprise is goingto be attacked, and they say that private enterprise is responsible for our wonderful national prosperity to-day with 10,000 unemployed In Coventry alone.  If it isnational prosperity, then I say, to alter that nationalprosperity, down with private enterprise.  As I have said capital has closed up its ranks and labour mustclose up Its ranks.* *     &quot;We must give up attacking personalities inside the  &apos;Labour movement, we must close up our ranks whether right,left or centre,, and realise from the experience of thelast 12 months what our weaknesses are and also realiseour strength if we are invited.  If you.are moderate orextremist, close up your ranks.  This Government has tobo thrown down;  that is necessary for the safety ofthe workers not only of this country but of the world.If the working class realise the power in thoir hands, the few rioh men in this land will not govern this countryand the system that allows a few rich men to live by thework of thousands of men toiling for long hours and whoare threatened with the deprivation of education andother amenities of life, then this can be thrown down.Let us then do this, so that we shall have a workers1commonwealth of the world and the time come when thereshall be no more unemployment.&quot;
     William Gallacher,  who is prospective Communistcandidate for Dundee, said at the same meeting:          &quot;Here is a sample of the smartness of the skilledj     politician.  You have heard about the Economy Committed     and how they are keeping back tho report.   Lloyd     George says:  &quot;We are willing to swing the axe but     don&apos;t forget there are nails in the wood.&apos;  Smart that,]     isnTt it?  It is not the first time we have found nailj     in the wood...Our modem George Washington, our Lloyd     George Washington,  he made a grand discovery - he     stares at the wood and says there has been nails     driven into the wood and we cannot use the axe, a     remarkable diaoovery, but he seems to have forgotten  ff     he has driven in every nail.  Since ever he had the     opportunity and given a free hand in the Munitions     Office in 1915 he has bought up supporters hand over     fist and spent millions of pounds in buying up     supporters and finding them jobs.  Never was a man     who talks more and does less tut never was a man who     gives the impression of doing a lot.  You remember     the troubles of 12 or 14 years ago when you were     suffering from all  sorts of hardships and you said     what we want is to get at the land, you were ready     to support anybody in that battle.   Lloyd George said     ^es,  there is something going to be done&apos; and he was     going to put all the boys on the job, yet to-day he     is talking about doing the same job again.  Then     there was the housing problem.  Who could settle     the housing problem - Lloyd George I   Addison gets     busy and all of a sudden Addison ceases to get busy     and the big jobs stop.  You remember Lloyd George     was out to make Germany  pay right down to the     bottom of their pockets.  At any rate he searched     your pockets.  You returned to Parliament a Chairman     of the Federated Industries because he would support     making Germany pay.   Make Germany pay, that was     what was wanted and Lloyd George put in for the     job.  One of the men \?ho got busy on the&apos; job was     representing the British and Economic Council     and he uaid you are blundering and he resigned and     wrote a book TThe Economic Results tf the Peace&apos;,     in whioh he points  out that Lloyd George was Amply     a political trickster and was utterly incapable     ef understanding the problems...          Two or three years age Lloyd George would not     associate with Bolsheviks - it was not to be thought     cf.   Lloyd George  is Tory now, he used to be a     Radical.  He was .moro than that when standing on     the platform at St. AndreWs Hall he yellod out:     &quot;I am as keen a Socialist as any man in the hall,&apos;     Now to-day Mr. Lloyd George is very anxious that     the Bolsheviks should come in and very anxious     that Lenin should come in.   Lenin knows things and     they know they,don&quot;t know things.    They want     somebody to help them out.of the muddle they are in.     But politicians are never in a muddle, are they?     They are always satisfied but those behind the     politicians,  your big bankers and business men know     that things are going from bad to  worse and that     the crash is  coming.  Now they recognise that     Lenin and the Bolsheviks are the men to come to                                               help/
     help them out, just as a drowning man clutches at a     straw they want Soviet Russia to come and help them     and that is enough to convince any man that capitalism     is doomed and damned.  Bankrupt capitalism - there     is a continuously heavy burden on the backs of the     working olaos and the only possible^escape for us     is the complete end of capitalism and lay the foundation     of a new system...          &quot;Lloyd Georgo wants a strong powerful Coalition     so that they can carry on as they have been doing.     It is cur duty when uniting our forces to see there     must bo no fighting between tho Coj.amoj.district and other     BO si?3.ens of the working class in the fight to weaken     the Cociliticn and knock thorn out clearly.  It is no     use striking against the Coalition as such; it is     a blow against capitalism.  We must prevent capitalism     getting sufficient strength to rally their present     force, that will prevent us oarrying forward when     tho next industrial struggle takes placee  For that &quot;&apos;*     purpose wo must have unity everywhere over tho front.           &quot;I ask you. overy man and woman, fron now     forward to concentrate upon tho Labour movement.  Make     this your fir^t business.  Get the unemployed the     fullest measure of support from Union or Council,     Do ovoryshing possiblo to make the unemployed     movement a success.  Rally all the men and women of the     constituency to fall in with the working classes and     march thorn out to declare to Coventry and the country     that you have finished with the British industries     representative and with capitalism, and that Coventry     it at any rate determined to raiso the standard of     revolt and keep it high in the air and make the pathway     free to the freedom of the world.&quot;     Several communist meetings have been held in birmingham during the week but the audiences have been smalland the collections smaller still, a sum of 7d, being raised from 80 people on January28th:  William Pauladdressed about 200 people on January 29th when aresolution demanding the immediate release of Inkpin and the cancellation of his sentence was passed.      On January 22nd Saklatvala addressed a meetingof about 350 people at Aberaman- in a manner likely to fosterolass hatred:          &quot;Look at your shirts, boots, houses, there you     have the complete lesson iii-front of youe  We must     go  making&apos; hats and boots,and keep the rough onesfor/
      for ourselvea.  The rough mediocre woollens we      must keep for ourselves.  We build tho palaces and      castles and then hovels for ourselves.  Those who      live in palaces and castles pay no rent.  What is      the lesson in tho (Soalfield?  Coal produoes all the      light and comforts, but you donlt find them in the      colliery villages.  Food packers and growers are      the same, they get the pickleif/^frd so fin - Why?      The simpletons of the world surrender these things.      We are told it is dishonourable to keep the      things we produce...How are we to remedy these things,      How are you going to get Justice?  You are told to      keep patient.   You get your turn every 4 years.  You      walk up to the Ballot box and record your vote.      The only cure you&apos;ve got is to come into direct      touch with the workers in other parts of the world      who produce the rubber, the jute, the hides and      wool and they hand it over.  Nothing very revolutiona      about that.  You get it by a bold International polic;&apos;      Sylvia Pankhurst, whose activities are reviving,is attempting to form actual, if not nominal groups, ofthe Fourth International.  She has sounded likely people in London and is now in touch with W. Braddock, the liverpool revolutionary, to whom she wrote last week:          &quot;I am putting the constitution you sent me      into the dreadnought1...  I see that you have      not got to the point of forming a union and yours      is purely a propaganda league.  If you mean to      I want to know whether you are prepared, to fall      into line with the 4th International and the A.A.U.      (form a Union later) when you have done&quot;the      preliminary work of propaganda.  If not., why      not, what differences of opinion are there between yon      and them.  I think we might come to arrangements      with you regarding regular notes from your league      to the dreadnought1.  But I should like to know      more of your views on this point, and also      whether you will in return assist the &quot;Dreadnought1      by pushing its sales, from your point of view thai;      would only be common sense if it were a medium      which would advertise your activities.&quot;      The constitution of the &quot;Revolutionary Industrial Union Propaganda League&quot;, to which this letter refers, appeared in the Workers Dreadnought1 of January 28th.  The following are the main points:&quot;PREAMBLE&quot;The League asserts that:     &quot;The Working OlasS and the Employing Classhave nothing in common, and between these two                                     classes/
      olasses a struggle must go on until the Workers      of the World abolish tho Wages System and set      up a world-wide Workers&apos; Industrial Commonwealth.           &quot;The trend of Capitalism makes tho Trade      Unions unable to cope with the growing po-;er      of the Master Class and fosters a state of affairs      which allows one set of Workers to be pitted against      another set of Workers In tho struggle for bettor      conditions:  moreover, the Trado Unions of to-day      mislead the Working Class into the belief that they      have interests in common with the Masters.           &quot;Those conditions can be changed only by      scientifically organised Industrial Unions:  the      workers must be organised not only for the every day      struggle with the Masters, but also to carry on      production when Capitalism shall have boen overthrown.           &quot;By organising industrially, we&quot;are forming     - the structure of the new Society within the shell      of tho old.           &quot;Therefore, knowing that such an organisation      is necessary to wage&quot;the Class War and to      emancipate ourselves, we unite under the following      Constituion:                       &quot;CO INSTITUTION      Objects -             &quot;To propagate the idea of Revolutionary      Industrial unionism, with the object cl urging      the Working Class to form Labour Unions on a      revolutionary am&apos;-&apos; scientific basis, so that at the      earliest possible moment it may be in a position to      take over the industries of the country and eliminate      as far as possible tho inevitable confusion arising      from tho transfer of the individual ownership of the      means of production and distribution to a      collective basis.&quot;      At present the Jourth International cuts no icein this country, but there are elements, such as the  xSocialist Labour Party, the &quot;Workers1 InternationalIndustrial Union and the anti-parilamentarian members-of the Co.m.aunist Party, who may concoivably form acompact and irreconcilable revolutionary party.  The&quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; meanwhile is in its customarystate of financial difficulty and is trying to raise 500 &quot;to free it from harassing financial liabilities.&quot;                                            TBS/
PR0J5CTSD &quot;LABOUR GOALITIOU&quot;      There are indications that efforts are being made by communist officials to bring about a c oirmunist-labour coalition, at least for the purpose of parliamentary and municipal elections:  the source of their inspiration is found in an article entitled &quot;The United Front&quot; in the current issue of &quot;The Communist&quot;, from which the following extracts are taken:           &quot;...The need now is for practical unity of action.      The leaders of the Yellow International pay lip service      to  unity,  but oppose it in practice.&apos;  The quickest way  to I      6xpcse them is to press for united working class action.      It&quot; does not matter for the moment how limited the demands ;f.      may be.   So long as they represent a genuine resistance      to the capitalists,  the conditions of the present period      will compel them to take on a revolutionary significance. I           &quot;uharef TO the Communist International approves the      demand for  a United Working Class Front. &quot;The Communist    -  Party in every country will enter into negotiations with      every other working class organisation (right,  centre or      left.) to establish a common fighting programme,   The      Communist International is prepared to enter into      negotiations with the Second International, the Two and  a  j      Half International and the Amsterdam International to      establish a programme of common action...           &quot;To those who may be misled by reports in  the      capitalist  press that the Bolsheviks are modifying their      .outlook,  it  may be worth recalling that this policy has    &quot;&quot;been pursued successfully by the Bolsheviks time and again      since their foundation.    In 1905,  and age.in in 1910, the      Bolsheviks  entered Into agreements with the Menshoviks      for a common front,  even while remaining their  bitter      enemies.  A similar  situation has now been reached en the      international state  for tho pursuit of the same policy with      the same success.&quot;      Robert Williams threw further light on tins matter in a recent  interview  with a &quot;Daily Herald&quot; representative:           &quot;Labour is being wrecked,  and its timbers  rent      asunder by  antagonistic  tendencies of its adherents in      different ooxurcries  of Europe,  and the time has arrived      to  bring together an All-in International Trade Union and      Socialist Conference....           &quot;The Bureau of the  Red Trade Union International in      Moscow is now driven to a policy of stern realism in its      relationship with the trade union movement of Western Europe.           &quot;Losovsky,  with whom I had many intimate conversations      while  in Russia,  and with whom I assisted in drafting and                                                  formulating/
      formulating the basis of the  Red Trade  Union  International,      recently sent  an urgent  cable  to the  Bureau of the      Amsterdam International,  urging  joint representation  of      Moscow and  Amsterdam in  order  to heal the  breach  which had      taken  place between  the  Centrists and the  Left wing elements      of the French  trade  union movement...          &quot;It appears to  me from these indications  that a      means  will  shortly be found of bringing us all together      for the purpose of showing the strongest form  of      resistance  to world  Capitalism and exploitation ...          &quot;Steps should be taken immediately to convene      meetings of all genuine working-class organisations in      order  to pave  the ^ay for a&apos;European  Conference of      representatives of the working class  to watch  and to  deal      with the &quot;thieves&apos; kitchen&apos; of Europe at Genoa.   For  when      thieves fall out, honest  men come by  their own,          &quot;Any pact  between our  Government and  France  will tend      towards the reintroduction  of  conscriotion in  this      country ...          &quot;I  therefore sincerely  hope  that  the General  Council      of  the  Trades Union  Congress and the  Executive of  the      Labour  Party snould  either  take  the initiative, or assist      initiators,  to  promote either  a  European or a  World      Conference  of oolitical and industrial  representatives      of  the  working  class.&quot;      The Communist Party&apos;e ;TMunicipal  Manifesto&apos;&apos;, which wasquoted in Report Ho. 128  has been circulated  to branches againby Poet  in connection with the Urban  District Council, and LondonCounty Council elections:   this document emphasises  the desire of tho Communists to work  in conjunction with the Labour Partyin cases when&apos;it  is  impossible or inadvisable to run Communist&apos;&apos;&apos;candidates.      The Labour  programme for  the London County Councilelections as  set  forth in  the  conference on  January 28th is not far removed  from Communism and the  difference between  that party and the  Communist Party  would appear  to be  in  regard  to methodsrather than  aims.  The following is a  summary of the LondonCounty Council election policy of the  London Labour party:          &quot;The administration  of&apos;municipal services as  far afe      possible  by  local authorities  covering,  small areas.          &quot;The extension  of grants-in-aid  to locally administered      services.          &quot;Breaking  up of the  Poor  Law, and  abolition  of Boards      of  Guardians.                                          .                                                  &quot;Transfer/

In Glasgow the Red International of Labour Unions is gainingaffiliations: in some oases these are engineered by a handful ofextremists at branch meetings:  in others, they are the expression of the trade unionists&apos; annoyance with their leaders for failing to make a stand against wage reductions.                                                &quot;THE/     &quot;Transfer of the functions of  1 such bureaucraticbodies&apos; as the Port of London Authority, the MetropolitanWater Board,  and the Metropolitan Conservancy Board tothe &apos; co-ordinated administration of the popularly-electedcontral authority.&apos;     &quot;Rating of land values.    1 &quot;Rating of empty property.     &quot;Further application of tho principle of theequalization of London rates.     &quot;Conferment of powers on local authorities &apos;to enterinto remunerative enterprises and to associate for thepurpose of combating private rings and trusts.&apos; &apos;     &quot;Rapid erection of houses to be let at *the lowestpossible rents&quot;.    &quot;Public ownership of motor-omnibuses and undergroundrailways.     &quot;Communal control of markets, slaughter-houses anddepots, and of the coal, bread, fish, milk and meat supplies,     &quot;Payment of full trade union rates to all municipalemployees.    &quot;Establishment of public medical, dental,  nursing andmidwifery services.&quot;
 &quot;THE SOOTS NATIONAL LEAGUE&quot;          My correspondents in Scotland report that the demand     for local government for Scotland is gaining ground;     labeur parliamentary candidates are making some play  with     this question and intend it to he a plank in their general     eleotion platform.EX-INSPECTOR SYME          On January 30th Syme, who was released under the     Prisoners&apos;  Temporary Release (through Ill-Health) Aot     1913, was re-arrested:  the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; comments on this     fact:               &quot;It is obviously no use to appeal to our rulers,          who have the power.   Their bestial cruelty is beyond          the reach of human appeal.  There will be no decency          in the public life of this country till power is taken          away from them.&quot;          A Trafalgar Square meeting passed the following     resolution on the previous day:               &quot;That this meeting of London residents assembled          in Trafalgar Square  on Sunday 29th January, 1922,  calls        &apos;  upon the Parliamentary Labour Party immediately  on the          opening of Parliament to demand a publio enquiry into          the Government&apos;s persecution of ex-Inspeotor John  Syms:          and that we further  call upon the Labour Members to give          full publicity to  demand a public enquiry and to maintain          pressure upon the  Government until the demand for  an          enquiry is granted.&quot;     The attendance at this  meeting at no time exceeded 1,000     people, although the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; reported that 5,000 were     present:   the speeches  contained no new matter. THE &quot;DALLY HERALD&quot; ,          There  is, as yet,  no  evidence that the strenuous efforts     of  the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; to  increase its circulation&apos; are meeting     with  material response: on January 28th Beorge  Lansbury     wrote in  the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;,  &quot;We have put on over 100,000     copies daily.   We do not yet  know how many of these will  be     actual sales.&quot;                                                  Enthusiastic/

In this     connection it  is worth noting that&apos;a flour mill belonging tc     Major  Hallinan of Mallow was seized,,pome  days ago and the     Red Flag hoisted.          Those who seek to make Ireland  a base for the Communist     attaok on the  British Empire are not idle.  The &quot;Workers1     Repuhlio&quot;,  organ of the Communist Party,  publishes an appeal     to  the Irish Republican Army, and the Citizen Army to contifl     the fight for  the Republic even  against the Free State.

The Irish  Congress which opened in Paris on tho  Slst closed on the 27th January.   Mr.  T.  Ryan, an  Australian delegate, had a resolution pledging  the Congress to assist the Irish people tc secure complete independence.  A  strong party, including all the Australians, except  Mr.  Ryan, and the Tasmanian,  New Zealand  and  Argentine Delegates, were opposed  to  the  introduction of  party politics  and intrigues against  the Treaty,  and threatened  to withdraw from the Congress  if Mr.  Ryan&apos;s  resolution referring to  the Treaty was net withdrawn.    The  Rav. Dr.  0&apos;Reilly  of  Australia  led  the  opposition to the resolution  and  many  supporters  of tho Treaty woro very outspoken.      Sean T* 0&apos;Kelly was personally attacked  for using  his diplomatic position  to bring  support to de  Valera.  The action of  the opposition  in threatening to break up  the Congress if the resolution were persisted in led to de Valera asking Ryan to withdraw  it, which he did.     It was  decided  to  form a new organisation  to be known as  the &quot;Fianna Gaedheal&quot;  (Sons  of the Gael) and de Valerawas proposed as President by  an American delegate, Mr. J. 0&apos;Connor, Dr.  McBeill  at  once announced that if LIT.  de Valera&apos;s name was put forward in a party spirit he would vote against him.

De Valera said that he wanted the Congress to forget thathere were two political parties in Ireland and to take the stand that the organisation shoiold not be used for thepurposes of any political party.     It was resolved that an Irish Athletic Team should start cn a tour of Europe in the summer of 1923, beginning wiPrance, where they would take part in the Olympic Games.i i
