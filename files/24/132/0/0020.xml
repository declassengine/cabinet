RUSSIA.          Black Sea.  The report in the  Press that the SovietGovernment of tho Ukraine has sold four  submarines to the Kemalistsis incorrect; apart from the fact that the Ukraine Republic ownsno warships, there are only two submarines fit for service inthe Black Sea, while of the three &quot;building&quot; at Nikolaev, so many parts are missing that their construction cannot be continued.One other sub;T&amp;rino remains at Nikolaev, but the hull has beenstripped of practically all fittings and machinery and this boatis no longer fit for service.                          DENMARK.          The hew Defence Bill shortly to be placed before the danish Rigs-dag contains provision for using the old German torpedo boat Base at Sonderborg (Slesvig), as a  Base for Danish torpedo boats.95   1
                             ITALY.          The new destroyers &quot;Generale A,Cantore&quot; and wGenerale A,Chinotto&quot; have been passed into the Italian Fleet,  k third,  the&quot;Generale A.Papa&quot;, is on the point of completion.  They carryd - 4&quot;, 2 triple 18&quot; tubes and have a designed speed of 33 knots.                            RUMANIA.          It Is reported that the Rumanian Government has  purchasedthe old eruiser &quot;Varese&quot; from Italy for use as a training  ship.                             GREECE.          The Greek Fleet Is being strengthened by the incorporation of the destroyer &quot;Smyrne&quot; and torpedo boat &quot;Proussa&quot;, which arcunderstood to he ex-Austrian &quot;Ulan&quot; and one of the ex-Austriantorpedo boats allocated to Greece.  Several old vessels have been withdrawn.                             CRT: A.          Four Chinese Gunboats have arrived at Chinkiang on theYangtze with the alleged object of detaining the salt revenues cfthat place on accountof the pay of the Chinese Navy being overa year in-arrears.  The salt revenues are already pledged to thefour Consortium Powers, Great Britain, U.S.A., France and Japanas security for loans.          /. Gunboat to protect British Interests has been sent tothe spot, and it is probable that the other nations concerned will follow suit.                             FRANCE.          The Minister of Marine has laid before the Chamber a law for the re-organisation of arsenals and other naval establishments.BREST and TOULON are to be retained in their present condition.  TheIndustrial establishments of LOR IE NT, undertaking new construction ,are to be placed under the same control as the &quot;establissoments horsdes ports&quot;, viz:- RUELLE and INDRET.   CHERBOURG and B12ERTA willbecome war anchorages (points d&apos;appul do la flotto).  A part ofthe CHERBOURG Arsenal is to be handed over to mercantile concerns.          The RUELLE establishment (artillery) and INDRET are to bereta ined.          The Ministers of Marine and Finance are to bo authorised to hand over to private concerns the ROCHEFORT Arsenal and GUERIGNYestablishments.  Tho chain cable factory at GUERIGNY is to betransferred to another ostablishment.
M*197                          PERSIA.          The belief is general in Teheran that the Shah is determined to leave Persia as soon as possible.          Roza Khan, tho Minister of War,  who has gained muohpopularity for his energetic and, for Persia, remarkableefficiency with which he is running the army, his aloofnessfrom politics, his non-identification with any foreign power,will probably assume the power of dictatorship.                         FINLAND.          Relations with Russia as regards the Karelian risingarc still disturbed, but both Governments have given strictorders that troops are to be kept  well back from the frontiersand the affair has been reduced to a diplomatic duel.                          RUSSIA.          There is reason to believe that the s .s .nVneshtorgn  (ex-&quot;Neath Abbey&quot;) belonging to the All-Russian Co-operative  society of London, with  a British Master has sailed from Rotterdam with10 aeroplanes packed in cases on board and rifles concealed underthe coal.  The ship Is bound for Petrograd.          The Russian Icebreaker &quot;Lenin&quot;  (ex-&quot;Alexander&quot;) isreported ashore near Khailoda Buoy, North of Narva Bay,  Gulf off inland.  Icebreakers &quot;Sviatogor&quot;, &quot;Truvor&quot; and  &quot;Purga&quot;  (?) havebeen ordered to her assistance.  Another  report  in the Pressstated that the Icebreaker &quot;Yermak&quot; is also caught in the iceand driven ashore.                         ALBANIA. &quot;          News has been received.that the Albania Government hasdismissed all the Greek Governors of Northern Epirus as  well asall priests who have refused to sing the  Mass In Albania,                        BULGARIA.          The Greek Minister at Sofia has been black-listedby the Bulgarian Revolutionary Committee, and has receiveda communication informing him that.his death has been decided upon and his executioners appointed.          A prominent Greek notable  was assassinated atVarna on Christmas Eve (old style) and a number of otherGreek citizens - have been proscribed.                          TURKEY.          In an Interview with the British High Commissimer atConstantinople Signor Tuozzi expressed the following opinionon thePART II  -  GENERAL. INTELLIGENCE-
on the situation in Anatolia.          Mustapha Kernel&apos;s position is very strong,  as he  ispractically a dictator.  His aim is to transfer the  seat of govern-ment permanently frcm Constantinople to Angora (or some suitableinland town) in order to abolish the existing state  of affairsunder which pressure from the sea can be exerted against agovernment situated in Constantinople.          His policy and that of the Angora Government is to try  tomake separate agreements with Great Britain and Italy, as  hasalready been done with Prance, after which he considers it willbe: comparatively easy to dispose of Greece.  The failure of the.attempt to conclude a treaty with Signer Tuozzi, and the news thatGreece has been given permission to raise a loan in England, has,however,  had.a disconcerting effect.          Relations between the Nationalists and Bolsheviks, continue,but are characterised by mutual suspicion;  arms and ammunition ofwar continue to be supplied by the Bolsheviks, but not in such large quantities as has previously been the case.          Great ^Importance is attached to a campaign of propaganda which is being initiated in India, and which is considered to bea weapon that will bring Great Britain to heel.          (Note;  The Sheikh Ahmed-el--Senussi is the head of thispropaganda campaign, and has formed a society called Shura-i-Ahmcdie, for the purpose of disseminating Pan-Islamic and Anti-British doctrines throughout the Moslem world.   15,000,000 werevoted by the Grand National Assembly to provide funds.  Kharputis the mo3t important centre).          There is much discontent in the Turkish zone inAna+olia.  Armed bands of malcontents, such as deserters andpersecuted people, are making their presence felt.          The Kemalist troops are still short of arms and very short of money (see paragraph below).          The economic situation is very bad.Flocks have beendepleted and agriculture is at a standstill.          Deportations of Christian minorities still continue,as.the Nationalists are determined to settle the minorityquestion once and for ell by a process of extermination.          The Angora Government is becoming financially-embarrassed.  It is doubtful whether funds will be forthcomingto pay the officers of the Nationalist /rmy, although their pay has already been reduced by 15%.  It is stated that the kemalists are considering the advisability of demanding apecuniary indemnity instead of territorial restitution, and thesum of twenty million pounds sterling is mentioned.TURKEY (Corvtd) .
