Po in care&apos;French Interpreter.         MONSIEUR POINCARE. began by offering his  apologiesfor the inconvenience caused by the political  crisis  in france.         He had thought that Monsieur Briand would  takea vote of the Chamber and return to Cannes with authorityto conclude the work of the Supreme Council there.The Government was not yet formed but he  thought  it mightbe useful to have a preliminary talk with Mr.  Lloyd George,He emphasised the fact, however, that the opinions  whichhe expressed were necessarily  personal  and provisional.Although he had almost completed his- Government it  was notyet in existence and he had no right to speak  exceptinformally and purely on his own behalf.   He  would likeat the outset to assure Mr. Lloyd George  of his, feelings of friendship both towards England and towards.Mr. Lloyd Georgehimself.   He had alwpyo been  a firm believer  in  the franco-British Entente.
    ------ - -$m-PKim-MINISTER thanked him. &apos;   He  said it was inconceivable, that France and England  should  net.aot together as close friends,           With regard to the text cf the agreement&quot;published &quot;by Monoieur Briand that ECrning.  MOSSIEUR PQTNCARE said he had - always &quot;been a  supporter&apos; of a written agreement &quot;between;--France -and England and that he would like to take the  discussion  up at the point where Monsieur Briand hod left  it.    He agreed&apos; that such an agreement  should &quot;be accompanied xaf a&apos; general -1 iqtiidat ion of out standing questions -which might raise- difficulties  between the two countries, and he regretted very much  that the  text of.the agreement should have been made public before all these&apos;quest ions had been disposed  of.    He  was now afraid that the - discussion  of-, these&apos; questions -- would he- /rendered mere difficult by public . c-r.lt icism.           THE-&apos;PRIME MINISTER said: he- thought a ...   &apos;-.gerieral-&apos;clearing-:uP -most  desirable  and.lie  hoped that&apos;. it -would be possible-.to keep up the-:arrangement .tinder which Lord. Curzon was to meet  the  French-and Italian&quot;.Foreign Secretaries, in Paris&apos;nest&apos;:week. -    -      - - MONSIEUR POIHCARE&quot;  said that: he had found: himself in uomplete.agreement  with  Lord - Curzon&apos;.in&apos; iv conversation he .had had&apos; a month  or. two ago:,; with regard, -however  to- the &apos; questions raised.,. he - ought - to -say.-.that Tangier  presented- certain &apos; difficulties and- that: he:. nust.-v.have--time to go... into it  carefully...  r  -  &apos;&apos;:.;-&apos;         &apos;:-
          THE PRIME MINISTER agreed and said thatit would no doubt be necessary to discuss thequestion &quot;a trois&quot; with Spain,,.          MONSIEUR POINCARoS agreed.   He then wenton to discuss the question of Angora, expressingsome regret at the course taken by MonAieur Briand1 .sGovernment.   He would like time., he  said., toconsider the situation there also before discussinga settlement&apos;,.   Monsieur Franklin-Bouillonhe &quot;thought had not been kept very well informed by the Q,u.ai d &apos; Or say-.   He wished &apos;to. settle -this and all other outstanding.quest ions as quickly aspossible, but of course, without sacfificing anyof the rights of Prance.          THE PRIME - MINISTER assured  him that Great^britain did not ask for any sacrifices of Frenchrights.          M01TSlElTR POIN-CARE&apos; then turned to thequestion of the draft treaty and said that he wouldlike to postpone the discussion of that indetail until other questions had been cleared, up.  Itmight be useful, however,  if he&apos;gave  Mr. LloydGeorge an indication of his views upon it,  inasmuch as it was necessary for him to make some&quot;: reservations..He emphasised again the fact that he.was merelymentioning his&apos;&apos;&quot;rtpre&apos;occupations personnellee.&quot;          THE PRIME MINISTER said he  would be grateful for an  indication of his personal attitude.         &apos; MONSIEUR POINCARFJ said&apos; that his first pointof anxiety related to the  form  of Article I.  Frenchopinion  disliked the idea  of a  unilateral guarantee.
It was a question of the dignity of France and ofmaintaining relations of mutual loyalty, and he felt that France would be to some extentcompromised by a purely unilateral guarantee.&quot;You guarantee us,1&apos; he said, &quot;because you are interested in France and in the maintenance of peace8We should like to guarantee you in return against any attack by Germany.&quot;          THE PRIME MINISTER said that he quiteappreciated the poftnt and that the draft treatymade a special point of the &quot;common&quot; interest.ofFrance anrf Great Britain in French security because.seGermany could only get at England through France.          MONSIEUR POINCARl said that germany might build, submarines or devise, long range art illeryor develop great air forces all of which night bea menace to Great Britain.          THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that even 80 Germany could only (approach England throughFrance and Belgium.          MONSIEUR POINCAKEl said that ho would notargue the point at present except to say that theunilateral character of the guarantee was a difficulty, and that it might he wise for england to take the precaution of giving  it a bilateralcharacter even  if the precaution  seemed a.littlesuperfluous.          MONSIEUR PQINCARE then  passed to  thesecond point  of the  draft treaty  about which he felt anxiety  -  namely, the absence  of any
reference to a &quot;naval. and military conventionbetween the two. countries.   He considered  It most important that Such.-.a convent ion should be providedfor in the same way as before the War.          THE PRIME MINISTER pointed, out  thatthere had been no written- convention before theWar...   There had .not even been any. obligation togo into the War.   It was- true that discussions had taken place between leading soldiers  of both countries on the measures which we  should take, if and -when Great Britain cftme.into a war;   but these were merely .informal arrangements and carried withthorn no obligation on the part of the.BritishGovernment.   What was offered now was  somethingfar greater, -namely, a definite  engagement on thepart of the British Government to come  immediately to the side of Prance with all -its  forces, naval,military and air,          M01TSIEf/R POINCARE&quot; agreed  that therehad been no written convention -before theWar-.   He had bo en surprised at a statement made.by Mr,- Lloyd George ih the House of  Commonsindicating that.there was.   The Prime-Ministerremembered tho speech.   It Was a slip, on his part.-..   He had been immediately corrected byMr-. Asquithj and had accepted the correction onthe spot.
          MONSIEUR POINCARBl pointed out that theTreaty would seem to have very little effectivevalue in Franoe without a military convention.  lie  osaid that he would rather have a military conventionwithout a treaty than a treaty without a militaryconvention,          THE PRIME MINISTER said that he took a very different view, which he would like toexplain.   He did not ask for an answer fromMonsieur Poincare&apos; here and now, but gave his view only in order that Monsieur- Poincare&apos; mighthave time to&apos;reflect on it;   If England made amilitary conventionj that convention would necessarilydeal only with such troops as she possessed.   Itwould stipulate perhaps that Great Britain should move three.or four Divisions within a certain timeto Prance.   That would he In,reality a very smallthing compared with, the guarantee given in thedraft treaty, because the forces, with which itdeo.lt would not in any way represent the realstrength which we were prepared to place on the sideof Prance.   In this way it would he misleading,not only to Prance itself, but to Germany and to thewhole of Europe.   Monsieur Poincare&apos; no doubtunderstood perfectly that our paper strength inpeace time was net our real strength.   Our paperstrength - he meant the forces covered by theestimates and available for a continental expedition&apos; -amounted only to three or four Divisions;   ourreal strength consisted of something much greater.We had millions of men, trained to arms and                       - 6 -
discipline  in the War,  and  that  immense  reserve.easily available, easily mobilized,. would maintain its value for twenty years  that  is, certainly forthe whole period during which  Germany&apos;s  own reserves -from the war coyld  bo  considered d.nngerons ,          MOHSIEffti  POmCAHE&apos; explained  that  he. inno way wished to exclude this  powerful guaranteecontained in the treaty;  but  that  he  thought the-treaty should also  oontaln  a-military  convention, giving at.least a  statement of  the minimumforces -which Great  Britain  would put&apos;into thefield.. &apos;          THE PR-IIBS MINI3TER&apos; said that such aConvention  would make  the treaty seem  much less valuable- than  it  really was.  We were actuallyreducing our regular forces in England stillfurther .- below the level of 1914-;  hut  in  pointof -fact oyr military strength  was immenselygreater than&apos; in 1914,-   Even in  the first year of thewar we had  been much better than cur word,    the six Divisions which we promised  were rapidly followedby immeasurably greater forces.  &apos; There  were 400,000British soldiers  in the field  in Prance  by  the endof the first year,  and we had. maintained a  strength- of two millions  in  the field despite greatcasualties  for the- last two years of the wax-,Whatever, therefore,&quot;  our  paper strength  might be,we could put -a million &quot;men  in  the field  in  a very short time.  They  were&apos;trained;  the  organizationand  equipment were&apos;the?eV   in such circumstances he thought  a military  convention relating  to nominalforces almost absurd.    It  would be much hotter to
trust.to the honour of England.   Monsieur Cambonhad said in 1914 that he knew very well that ifonce a squadron of British cavalry went to Prance itwould bo followed by a million men.   Tho important thing v/as britain S pledge.   He put this toMonsieur Poincaro&apos; for consideration;  ho would not press him for an answer&apos;in any way.   He know the difficulties of forming an administration^ andhe would much rather that Monsieur Poincare did not give him a definite answer on the subject now.          MSISrjPv POIHCAKE*  said that he was not really thinking of giving a definite answer, or even orarguing the question, but he considered it important to. say that the feeling of Prance about the.treaty would be very cold if it contained no military con-vent ion.   It was not necessary for such a convention to bo published.   All that was necessary v/as thatthe General Staffs of&quot;the two countries should examine the question and make their plan3 together,remaining afterwards in continuous touch, andre-examining their arrangements yearly,          THE PRIMS MINISTER said that it would beimpossible to refuse publication of the convention in England.   Ii Prance it was possible to submit sucha convention to private examination in a Committee.We had a different parliamentary method in England,and Ministers had to submit every day. to searchingquestions tinder which the terms of such a convention would  certainly have to be revealed.   He was alsoagainst any concealment In principle, and he would regard a military convention as a great mistake.After  all, tho most  important thing was for Germanyto know exactly what she would have to face in a new
attack on Prance.  The guarantee was the thing that mattered.That was what Germany would lock at.  That was. the only thingwhich might divert her from dreams of revenge.  monsieur poincare&apos; should also reflect that while the British Dominions-&quot;&apos;&apos;might be willing to sign a guarantee (some had ratified thetreaty of 1919) they would not- dream of .putting-their  signa-tures-to .a military convention, nor of pledging the despatchof a single battalion under, such a convention.  This method&apos;was against the spirit of the British Empire..  It would he much better if Prance would take the word of the British Empire.the value ofwhich.,, and the: strength .behind-. it, she knew.What mattered to her, ,sijrely, was net an arrangement betweensoldiers to move a few units here and there in such and such atime, but a definite undertaking from Great Britain that  she would honour her pledge to Prance with the whole strength at her command.  .....  .        &apos;--  .  .. - . -   -  -v:  -.:.&apos;::.-.      .  . - MONSIEUR POIHCARi objected that the difficulties madeby the Prime Minister, with regard to a military conventionwere unreal. .  Parliamenthe thought, would not.ask every year what the convention might be, provided, that, the-army estimates with, which  they were confronted- were unobjectionable,;          THE PRIME; MINISTER said that the French government must allow the British Government, to adopt the- method  best suited, to-the English, system.&apos;:  The right method- with--us was to submit all Such plans to-the. Committee of ImperialDefence, where, they, would be thoroughly- discussed..  . - Of&apos;-.course..French officers could come, over to England to express their views to our soldiers, and.British officers could go to France to  consult Marshal Foch and, the French   -  ., -.military off icers,.,and,, their conclus ions could., then bosubmitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence for     :examination.      : .:  .--&apos;-/&apos;                 ..
     Mo POINCARE said that he only wanted some reference inthe Treaty to the existence of a military convention and themaintenance of co-operation between the Staffs of the twocountriesWhere would France stand without a military conventionsupposing Great Britain disarmed altogether ?     THE BRUCE MINISTER asked what diff erence &apos; that would makeaOur equipment, our reserves, our pledge; would still be there&apos;0We could not possibly bind ourselves to maintain this or that-military strength in peacee   He could not present such ademand to the British people or to a British Parliament0   Ifthe word of the British people was not sufficient for Prance,he &apos;-feared that the Braft Treaty must be withdrawn *&apos;  The british people would honour their pledge; if Prance were attacked,  withthe whole of their strength,, but they would never bind themselves by military conventions as to the forces which they would maintain in present conditions during a time of peacea     M* POINCAEE said that it, was really not a question ofmaking conditions hut rather of knowing whether the guaranteewas sufficient or noto   There were conventions before tho war between tho General Staffs,   How could Prance calculate thestrength which she would have to maintain if she had no idea oftho strength to bo maintained by Great Britain ?     THE PRIME MINISTER said that there had been no military con-ventlons in existence before the war; at any rate within theknowledge of the 3ritish Cabinet,,   There had of course beenconversations &apos;between soldiers, but&quot; thoy carried rib&apos; obligationswhatever.   If France really preferred ndw a convention providingfor conversations between Generals to a pledge&apos; by the british people and the British Government, he was afraid that it wouldbe impossible to carry any Treaty through the British Parliament.,     Me POINCARE explained that he asked for no more than had            : &apos;                                           been                              -  10  -
 been  done&apos; before  the war.   He asked simply that the two countrioe should  not be  loss united than in 1914.  Ho would like something,llko  tho  -agreements which passe:- in 1912.      THE  PPIPiS KIHISQ?i2E aske &apos;  whether ho would really prefer such  an exchange  of letters to tho draft treaty now proposed..      M. POBICaEE!  said he w ould net.      THE  PRIME MINISTER said that he must choose between the two.   &quot;The British people would, be totally, unable, to understand M.  Poincare-.&apos;o  insistence on a military convention, as part of their pact,        -                          -        &apos;.----      Ii.-. POiiJCIRS  said tii-it to  him personally (ad he ga-sd it only as  a  personal  opinion) the Treaty was useless without a military convention because the guarantee contained in it was illusory,      THE  PPIjp.:MINISTER said that in that 08 ee it only remained for S.  Poincare to communicate-v.te those views when he had&apos;.formed ..his. &quot;Government.   There -would  -bo then: no more draft Treaty- to  discuss.- -      M. POIWGaiHE  said that in  that case-Prance would know, that under, the Treaty  proposed. she.-  had had no real military guarantees. The wrench people would be greatly cisturbed by this, and he would look with apprehension on tho effect-.of it on the relations- of  tho  two countries.                          . ;                -yd-      THE  PRIKE lilllloTER said: that the Prench people were &quot;of course-  tho only judges of their own. interest, but that if Prance was not satisfied with tho promise of England to put all her forces at  1--ranee-*.s side, there was really no. possible basis for a      .  . genuine accord between the -two countries.            w.    &quot;&apos;  M. P-0Ij.-I0-.33  s&amp;ia he hastened, to say. -that franco did.not    .  . doubt -tho word of England,&apos;  prance know that England-would cc     - everything she- ..-.oo&apos;r.la&quot; even wore . tho re -no Treaty in existence&apos;, - but if  Prance had.  no  -idea &apos; Doxoroi^nd.. oi what &quot;the&quot; &quot;military situation would be  ht .the &apos;outbreak of war, -3ho oould not possible measure                                                      the forces
the^/Ioro-es which she would hex self have to maintain;     THE PRIED MIHISTEK asked what difficulty there could possibly ho in knowing tno strength -oi tho.British Empireafter tho experience of tho war.  It acorae,:&apos; to him reallyprepoefcerous to die-ca-ss military conventions regarding astddon Gorman attack on Prance-when Germany had boon almost completely disarms! and could not possibly ro-equip her armieswithout long preparations which must bo known- There hadbeen much more reason for a military convention before the warthan now. ;:.We were thou confronted with a powerful Germanyready for attacks   There was no such Germany in existencenow, and Prance must know that tho British Empire rs greatreserves &quot;of strength could be thrown into the. field just as quickly as those of Germany; much more quickly  indeed,since Groat Britain had the equipment for millions  of men-while &apos; Germany had not.   A &quot;malentendu&quot; &quot;between- Prance andGreat-Britain  on such a point appeared to him  tho  height ofunreason..   It made him despair of any proper understanding with French statesmen since it looked like- a refusal  on  their part  to  deal with realities,  Tho time for a military con-vent ion  might  come-  if Germany again became- formidable *   Wore- it necessitated by  a revival  of German military power.,.. GreatBritain  fcoulfl not hesitate to make it.- .But to  raise  dif-difficulties  in England on such  a point, now was  to him. inexpll-&apos;cableo   The Treaty was not altogether popular. in  England..It was being attacked by  friends  of the League  of  Rations, andso on,   He  could carry  such a Treaty through  the present parliament, but he  would  not  undertake to  say what would&quot;become;  of  it  in another Parliaments  Tho  reason for theFrench attituac as  bc-T  out by IE  Poinca.ro  must surely be                                            derived   -
derived from political considerations of some kind0  Itcould not possibly be derived from military facts.     M. POINCARE said that he would not venture to discusspolitical difficulties in England and he hoped that thePrime Minister would not discuss those of France,  Thoyshould roally not oome into a discussion of this kind,,  -     THE PRIME MINISTER said that stesmen should understandeach other &apos;a political difficultios,  Ho had his own, andhe was quite prepared to meet those of IU Poincare where hecould, but he could not understand such a Treaty as the oneproposed failing on political grounds in Franceo     Me POINCARE referrod again to the&apos;difficulty for Pranceof regulating tho effectives which she would have to maintainif Great Brit.ainra effectives were not really known,,  Hewas only, howovor, indicating his personal opinions, and hewould like to resume the discussion later through the medium of the Embassies.  He felt, however, that loyalty and friend-ship had made it necessary for him to explain his view as early as possible to Mr, Lloyd George,     THE PRIME MINISTER thanked him,  He was particularly anxious to know whether the change of government in Francemeant a change. of policy also,     !L POINCARE said that the aims and desires of the FrenchGovernment would be the same, - Tho &quot;nuancos&quot; might bodifferent, but he believed that the relations between Great-Britain and France would be even better than before,     THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether there were any other points which he wished to discuss *     M, POINCAFE said that the period of ten years was thought to be badly chosen.  The expiry of the ton years would                                                   coincide
coincide with the time for the withdrawal of British troops from the Rhine, and he thought that it might be a &quot;coincidencegenante&quot;*     THE PRIME MIKlSTSR said that ho v,oulc*. be quite ready todiscuss that.     M. PQlPCAEE added that ho hoped arrangements would, atany rate, be made for permanent contact of the two Staffsso that the:&apos; Prench Government- might know whore they stood-,     THE PRIME MINISTER said he had no objeotion to that.Indeed, he assumed contaot betwoen tho 8taffs*     M. P0IM0AR2 said that he would think the matter overand communicate his views.     The conversation then turned to the Ganoa Conferenceo     M* POIBCARB sajd that the new Pro noli Government would of course honour the engagements of its predecessors buthe was anxious regarding the preliminary acceptance bythe Soviet Government of the conditions communicated by theAllied Powcrea     THE PR IMS MINISTER said that, they had discussed at Canneswhether those conditions should bo treated as preliminary tothe meeting in oonferenco or as preliminary to recognitionof tho Russian government  Thoy had docidod on the latter.But M* Bonoml was to call attention to the importance attachedby the allied Powers to these conditions ih hi3 notificationto the Russian Government regarding the Conference.  Itwould be made quite clear that those were the only conditions.on which they could possibly hope to revive the trade of Russiawith the rest of Europet     M. POIHCAHS asked whether it was not very dangerous toattempt to  initiate discussions with the Soviet Government                                                 until
until they had accepted those conditions;,     TEE PRIME MINISTER ospli inocl that discussion  of  thoconditions was exactly what was wanted and they had beenput first &quot;by the oiipromo Council for  that reason...     Ho POIECiSS acid ho was afraid that tho conditionsmight be amended in discussion,,  STould it not bo saferto insist on acceptance beforehand ?     THE PRIME MINISTER said that, tho Ministers of tho AlliedPowers were surely capable of holding their ground, ovenagainst Lenin and Trotsky%     M0 POBTCAKB pointed out that other than Allied powers would be theroo                           -     THE PRIME MINISTER sr.if- that&quot; England and France  must ofcourse march togothere  If they marched togethert everythingwent right; if they did- not march together, everything wentwrongs  .They must therefore have a clear understanding asto&apos; their course of action at Genoa beforehande  It would not do to have any appearance 01 disagreement botween the Frenchand British Prime Ministers there *        ....

POIHCAEE then thanked tho Prime Minister for stoppingin Paris for this conversation and said ho would like to take them up again later,,     THE PRIME MIKI31SH said he knew what tho pro-occupationsof forming a Government were, and he thanked Mo Poincare&apos;sincerely for having found time to talk matters ovor*He wished, to ask one other tiring about reparations^  Whatwas M, l5oinoard*B view on the general question which hadbeen discussed at Cannes f   .

PR PL&quot;1&quot; HIJlIldZPE pointed out that  the provisional arrange.-ments  at Cannes unly covered  a short period, and that  itwould  bo necessary to discuss the reply of the GermanGovernment to. the Commission1s enquiries  which would be due in 15  days,-   It would also bo necos3ary to discuss theprovisional  dooisions at Cannes regarding the partition ofthe payments?   If  these arrangements were not  to  stand.Groat  Britain would resume her right  of claim to her  fullshare  under  the Treaty;, namely 22$ of all payments, and the-cost  of her  armies  of  occupation,:  The  only  way of dealing withthe. matter successfully was,to enable  Germany  to  get  a bigloan  abroad.  This  could not  be  done  until reparations were settled.;  . It had. already  been tried in  the London  market  and london had refused  until- reparations  by  Germany were  quite clear..      Me.
