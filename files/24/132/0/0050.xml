   [This Document is the Property  of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]                    Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1922.SECRET. O.P. 3050..    I circulate  to  my colleagues a telegram \  have received from  the Governor ofMadras regarding the visit of His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales.                                                                     E.  S. At.    24th January 1922.   From Governor of Madras to Secretary of State for India, 21st January 1922.    Priuce of Wales&apos; visit.   Visit passed oil&apos; successfully and the Prince of Wales leftMadras 17th January, night, after witnessing  display of  fireworks on Island Maidan,at which crowds, estimated at 50,000, collected to see fireworks and catch last glimpseof Prince.  Reception of His Royal Highness was everywhere most enthusiastic,  and,after  disturbances  on  13th, unmarred  by  any  untoward  incidents.  (Jrowds  atraces  on  14th  and  17th, and  at  polo  on  13th and   l(3th,  were  particularlygreat,  although Guindy,  where  these  took  place,  is  six  miles  from  Madras.At polo,  in addition to  those  invited  to garden  parties, very  large number  ofgeneral public  attended.  Reception  by  students  in Senate  House  on  13th  wasenthusiastic, and, on  such  occasions  on.  which  Prince appeared in  public,  andwherever he drove along the  roads, he was met by  welcoming  crowds.  All shopsremained open  after 13th,  and  though rumours  of  possible disturbances  on night of  departure  were  current,  and precautions were  taken   accordingly, nothingunpleasant occurred.   Popular  attitude  in  general  was undoubtedly  one  of  regardand reverence  for  the   Prince, who  appeared gratified with reception accorded tohim.   Too  early yet to  judge general effects of  visit;  but hooliganism  displayedon  day  of arrival,  and  particularly  attack on house  of  non-Brahmin   leader,Sir  P. Theagaraya Chetty,  has -  undoubtedly rallied  opinion  against activity ofextremists.5086    100 1.22
