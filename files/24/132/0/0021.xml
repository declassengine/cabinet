A divergence in their policies would prevent therestoration of that general feeling of security which is indispensable,  in ardor that the efforts necessary for theeconomic restoration of Europe should boar fruit.   Theunion of the two nations would be for Europe a firm pivotin which all peaceful tendencies would find support.       In -order that this union may produce its beneficenteffects, it is neoessary that it should seem close and last-ing; and that it cannot be unless it is founded upon/ mutual understanding of the essential interests of each country.       Fer France, one question dominates ell others -- thequestion of her security. &apos;  This country which has sufferedso much from the proximity of Germany, and which has been soeruelly tried during the last war, dannot contemplate with-eut intense anxiety the possibility that such devastation may f$be renewed.   France cannot forget that the German population is 20 millions stronger than her own; that democracy is sti^.for the great majority of Germans no more than an empty phrsa.se.and that this people highly disciplined, industrious, giftedwith a fertile geniJus for organisation, but in which &amp;n   politicalactive/ and intellectual propaganda, notably in the universl-ties and schools, supports a spirit of- aggression and anardent desirs for revenge, may some day render vain themeasures of disarmament prescribed by the Treaty of Versailles
      The best guarantee against any such eventuality would be the certainty  in Germany that France would not be isolated in the event ax a.Gorman attack.   Those &quot;who negotiated the Treaty of Versailles .understood this well, since, they found it.necessary in 1919 to complement the stipulations of that Treaty by the Treaties between France and the United States and&apos;between -France and England, which were not:ratified .    .&apos;. :The-situation is not quite, the same today as. then-. The United States, appear.certain to-hold themselves aloof from&apos;-European, politics. - ... For two years past, moreover, the execution of the-;peace. and -. the difficulties involved in the. solution of- the-different problems raised by the general&apos; situation-.have-, -given- rise to certain differences of view between France, and. England. which were-not apparent in 1919.                                             ;  to be It is therefore desirable. that the agreement  ;   -.concluded between France and England: against a German attack should also register the determination of the two countries to act together with complete -harmony-for the; maintenance, of peace.   A Treaty/containing, only a military, guarantee would not be. sufficiently effective in- its? bearing on Germany if the latter, were, able to. discover means of- provoking and using-Franco-British disagreements for. the purpose of destroying their accord.
      In the mind of the-French;defensive Treaty to be concluded ought&apos; to Contain bilateral&apos;.            The   --&quot;engagements.     -one-sided guarantee,- contemplated  in  the franco-British Treaty&apos;&quot;of 1919, which was supplemented  bya similar Treaty between France&apos;and the United States,    &apos;-                                              situation.would no longer correspond to  the realities  of  the  &apos; &apos;  *,It is necessary to give public expression to  the unity-&apos;of the two countries&apos;in the- event of -German  aggression.-Moreover, even if England believes herself unexposoft&apos; to  &apos;-German attack, no-one&apos; can affirm in &quot;spite of&apos; the &quot;factthat England;is&apos; certainly much less exposed  than France&quot;in that respect, that the transformation Of methods  and&apos;engines of war may-not entail for-England the &quot;loss  of  all &apos;or some of the advantages which she draws from  Ker-&quot;natural defences., -   - - -      The;.French Government therefore Considers &quot;that the&apos;-Entente; in&apos;-future should, provide that in the-event  of&apos;&apos;direct German aggressidn against 6ho&apos;of the&apos;two  countries&quot;          -  ,                                  imac-;d ii^tely -  -the other country should&apos;bind,  itself&apos; to cometo its&apos; aid- with all  its military, :naval and--- air  forces-.It should further bo laid down that  the&apos;British&apos;government undertook to consider the. maintenance-&apos; of&apos; German  disarmament&apos;&apos;contemplated in the  Treaty &quot;of:-Versailles ,: and. specially-in&apos; :-*the clauses -referring; to -the regions &apos;of - the  Rhine land,under Articles .42, 45 :and&apos;&apos;-44 of that Treaty,  as.&apos; indlspehsableto tho safety of French&apos;soil;&apos;and&apos;that all violation bf  those arrangements would constitute  in&apos; the eyes of the British.&apos; -Government a case of direct aggression  against  French&apos;  - --security&apos;in&quot;exactly  the  same sense  as  invasion of the  &apos;actual soil of France&apos;.

                                                     -     103            Paragraph 6  of  the  resolution adopted on the      6th January &quot;by the Cannes Conference contains  in  itself      the principle of a guarantee  of that nature.    The  Genoa      Conference might give clearer shape and broader scope      to  that guarantee  in  the  sense of the engagements eon-      eluded at Washington  for  the  maintenance of peace in      the Pacific,            France and England  are  called upon to exercise their      influence to bring about  the  conclusion of  such an  arrange      ment;  but an engagement between the two Nations to  take     ;. council together on all questions endangering  the general      peace  would,as has already been indicated,  enable them     ... to  &apos;.exercise an even more.powerful influence, whether by      concerted action in the Council of the League  of  Nations      or  in-putting their joint authority at the  service  of      the caus e of&apos; peace.            There could  be  no more  effective guarantee  of a      durable peace than a  vast system of international co-opera      tion founded upon  a close union between France and  England      It  is  not conceivable^  as experience shows, that  the peace      of  the worldshould be disturbed, when Franco and  England      show themselves publicly  resolved to act together for the      prevention of war.            These are, in the opinion of the French  Government,      the conditions upon which the collaboration of Franco -      and England would  most usefully contribute  to  the main-      V-mance of the general peace, -and the preservation \o.f      the interests of the  two  nations,rlton Hotel,             .    .            , .. .
