This document is the property of His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government;05THE  CABINET.POLICY OF  CALLING  UP  THE ARMY RESERVE IN  TIMES                          OF CIVIL  UNREST.      MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY  OF STATE  FOR WAR.    The &quot;War  Office are in entire agreement with the Admiralty view, as expressed in cp. ,3471, as to the difficulties caused by the mobilization of the Reserve in the recentcivil emergency.    The Army Reserve consists, at present, of two sections       Section B. Men enlisted for Colour and Reserve service who, on completion of           their Colour service,  are transferred to the Reserve.               Strength on 1st October, 1921     ...     ...   56,451      Section  D. (a.) Men who re-engage for 4 years after completing  their first           period of engagement.&apos;                  (b.) Men directly  enlisted  into  the Reserve,  having served for           6 months with the Colours  during the war.              .Strength on 1st October, 1921     ...    ...    8,803The pay is  Is. a day.    The importance of maintaining an adequate Reserve is obvious, and its value wasamply illustrated  in the war.   It  is now hoped  to increase the numbers of menenlisting into  Section D under the conditions at (6) above,  but  such enlistment is entirely voluntary,  and  if there is an impression  that the  Reserve  is likely to bemobilized  in the  event of  civil unrest,  with  the  consequent risk of dislocation ofbusiness and unemployment, these men  will not be  obtained.   The  considerationsadduced in the Admiralty paper referred to apply throughout with equal force to theArmy Reserve, and  there were  many  cases in  which  it was  found, after the recentmobilization, that  private businesses had been ruined or that employers had dispensed with  the services  of Army Reservists  who had  been called up, as may be seen  from various  questions which were asked in Parliament at the time.  In all cases that  came to notice, the War Office communicated with the employers, generally with satisfactory results,  but the experience was unfortunate, and unless it is made generally known thatthe Army Reserve will not be called up except in the last resort;, the necessary numberof men will not undertake the obligation.    It  is, therefore, urged  that, while the present powers of calling  up the reserves should be retained,  they  should  only be exercised in an emergency so  great  as to override the foregoing objections ;  the nature of the emergency must necessarily be judged at the time.                                                                     L. W.-E.   THE WAB OFFICE,       20th January, 1922.SECRET.CP.  3646.(B21/386) 100  1/22 il&amp;S, Ltd.  9610wo
