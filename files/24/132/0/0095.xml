This Bill confers power on tho Secretary for Scotland,          on application made to him and after such enquiry m ho may          direct, without compensation to cancel o? suspend any lie one          held under the Aot of 1907 if he. is satisfied that the          prosecution of the whaling industry under gush licence          is prejudical to the herring or ether fishery,,2.             Whaling stations were established in Sbetlseed and on       &apos;   the West Coast of Harris (in the Hebrides) about1903* The          industry is regulated by&apos; the Whalo Fisheries (Scotland)          Aot, 1907.  UMs prohibits whaling operations in any part          of Scotland except under licences granted by tho Fishery          Board for Scotland.  Under the $revisions of that Act the          powors of tha Fishery Board to cancel or suspend without          compensation licences which have been issued Is ^limited to          the case in yjhioh tho holder has inffinged the conditions          of the licence or beon ooaviotod of en offenco undor tho                                            existing          Act.   Accordingly, under tho present/law lioonoees aro          entitled to retain their licences during good behaviour.3-             In Shetland there was so mo opposition to the oon-          tinuance of whaling oporatdons in the poriod before the          War.   Such operations wore suspended by orders of the Havel          Authorities from 1914 till 1920.  In 1919, in view of          representations against the resumption of whaling, the          Fishery Board appointed a Committee cf tboir members to          roport on tha question.

f&quot;      there had been a great dcoline in tho herring fishery in tho        years before the War and that this decline was coincident        with the development of the  whaling industry in Shetland,        The Committee dia not hold it proved that the two events were        related as cause and effect.  They found, however, that a        belief was general in the fishing industry that tho two events        wore so related and the Committee regarded this belief as in        itself a sufficiently deterrent influence to prevent tha        revival of the herring fishing industry In the waters in        que s ti on.4.           The Committee recommended upon this ground that        whaling operations from stations in Shetland should be pro-        hiblted by legislation.   The annexed Bill does not go so far        as the reoommendation of the Report.   Its essential object is        to enable the Secretary for  Scotland without compensation to        canoe 1 or suspend existing lioecnoes if the allegation that        whaling operations are prejudicial to the fisheries is proved        to his satisfaction.   I have adopted these proposals after        convening a confer once between Mrssrs. Salvesen and Company        (the party mainly interested in whaling operations) end        representatives of public bodies and the inhabitants of Shetland        a majority of whom desire the prohibition of whaling.  The two        parties failed to arrive at any modus Vivendi and I have        Intimated to them that I have instruoted the drafting of the        accompanying Bill.  The powers of tha Bill are not limited to        Shetland.  Although there Is no agitation against the whaling        station established In Harris it appears desirable to take        general powers for use if required.  5,          I request sanction for the introduction of tho Bill.

TERMS  OF   REMIT.THE  FISHKRY BOARD  FOR SCOTLAND,  at  their Meeting  on 18th July 1919,appointed a  Committee consisting of  W.  LYON  MACKENZIE;  Esq., K.C.,Sheriff  of  Ayrshire,   Deputy  Chairman;  Ex-Provost  MALCOLM  SMITH,Professor D&apos;ARCY W.  THOMPSON,  C.B., F.R.S.,  and  the Secretary (Pay-master  Lieutenant Commander DAVID  T.  JONES,  C.B.E.,  B.N.R.),  toexamine the  question of what evidence,  if  any,  exists  in   support  ofthe  contention  that the  Scottish herring  and white  fishings  have  beeninjuriously  affected by whaling  operations.IN pursuance of their remit the Committee sailed from Aberdeen on Saturday, 23rd August, on board the Fishery Cruiser Norna  for  Shetland.   Enquiries  were held, and twenty-nine witnesses  were examined in  Lerwick, Hillswick, and at  01 nn Firth.   The derelict curing stations at Balta Sound,Ronasvoe,  and  Scalloway, and the whaling  stations at Collafirth and Olna Firth, were inspected.Enquiries  in  Shetland were  concluded on Saturday,  30th August, on which  date the Committeeleft for the Smith.    On 16th  September the enquiry was continued  at Peterhead, where eleven witnesses, including anumber of representative curers,  were heard, and in  the following week ten  further  witnesseswere examined in  Edinburgh, which concluded the evidence  taken.    The Committee did not visit the whaling station at Bunaveneader, Harris, as  all the members were already  personally acquainted with it, and the witnesses from that  locality were among  thoseheard in Edinburgh.    The agitation against whaling is  not of recent growth.  It  dates practically from  the  establish-ment  of whaling stations  in  Shetland by Norwegians in  1903, and although regulations  were laiddown with  a  view to  eliminating the objectionable features of  the industry, representations againstwhaling continued to be  received  until  the outbreak of war  in 1914, when  it was  prohibited bythe Naval  Authorities.   These  protests  were  not confined  to Shetland, but  were received  frompractically  every Fishery Association in Scotland, and,  in  addition, from the  National HerringFisheries Protection Association, which   represents  large English as well  as Scottish  interestsprosecuting the  fishing in Shetland.    After the  conclusion, of the Armistice  in November 1918, the strong  feeling against whalingled to  representations  being  made  that  the  prohibition of whaling in Shetland enforced as a warmeasure should become permanent, and the Board came to the conclusion that a further investigation into the whole question had  become necessary.    The complaint against whaling is based at the present  time  mainly upon its alleged  detrimentaleffect  upon the herring  fishing  in  the  waters in  which  both  industries are  prosecuted, and it istherefore relevant  to  any enquiry  into  the  question to  consider  the comparative magnitude and importance of the  interests  involved.    The Shetland  herring fishing  has been  prosecuted for centuries, but,its  enormous latter-daydevelopment  may be said  to  date from 1876, when fishermen and curers  from the Scottish mainlandfirst  began to  resort  to  Shetland.   During the  years which  followed  not only  did  the numberof local boats  increase, but  Scottish and English drifters were  attracted in  increasing numbers,until Zetland  ultimately became, and still is, by  far the  most  important herring  fishing centre inScotland.   In  1879 the number of  barrels cured was only 8755.   Six years later  the numberhad increased to 370,000 barrels, and the annual  average during the decade prior to the  war was041,000 barrels, the average  value of which  was   697,000.    While the Shetland herring  fishery, considered as an entity, has  continued  to develop, there hasbeen a marked  change in the incidence of operations since the  introduction of  the  whaling industry.Prior  to 1903 curing stations were  distributed all round  the Islands, and the herring  boats, bothlocal  and  Scottish, worked  from  these  stations  under the  engagement  system, i.e.  they engagedthemselves to a curer  to  deliver a  certain number of crans per week for a certain period, at a fixedprice per cran.  The usual practice was for crews to  engage during  the months of May, June, and july for a  period of from four  to six weeks for  the west side  or  early fishing, in which a superiorclass of fat herrings was obtained, and thereafter, for the remainder of the season, to proceed to the later and quite  distinct fishing on the east side, where the herrings  are more  akin to  those taken on the east coast of Scotland.
     Shortly after tho beginning of whaling operations (about 190&quot;)) herrings began to disappear fromthe usual grounds  on the west side, and carers consequently ceased engaging  fishermen  to  fish  fromthe stations there.   Soon afterwards Bulta Sound suffered in the same way, and  the industry tended to concentrate at  Lerwick,   A number of factors  operated  to bring about this concentration, but itwas  undoubtedly  hastened  by the failure of  the  west and north-west grounds.   The question of whether, and to what extent, this movement would have beemretarded had the grounds  on the westside  retained their productivity is discussed in  a  later part of this report, but  whatever the causes ofthe  movement it  has unquestionably operated  greatly to  the  detriment  of the  fishing along thewestern and north-western  seaboard.     The extent to which the west and north-west of  Shetland has been affected by the desertion ofthe stations there will be more readily realised  when it is stated that at the beginning of the presentcentury (in 1903) there  were no less than 111 curing stations, representing a capital of fully  100,000,on that section of the coast, which employed 1523 boats, with crews numbering 8000 men, in additionto a large  number of shore workers, whereas  ten years later only IS stations and  93  boats were atwork.   The average annual catch during the period 1898-1903 was 184,144 crans, valued at  137,794.In  the years immediately  prior to the war,  herrings  had  practically  ceased  to be  landed,  andconcurrently the assessable rental of the curing stations had declined  from a  maximum  of  3769 to 1198 a reduction which would have been much more pronounced but for the fact thai; for  several years a number of  curers- kept up their stations at a dead loss in the hope that the early fishing onthe  west and north, would  eventually revive.     The Scottish whaling industry, on the other hand, whether  judged  by  the annual  value of the produce, the amount of employment it affords,  its capital-value, or any other criterion,  is relativelyinsignificant.     The products derived from whaling are oil  principally, cattle  food, bone meal, manure, whalebone,and  spermaceti, and the average annual value over the period since it was introduced does not exceed 60,000.  The total number of persons to whom it gave employment was 410, and of these againonly 91 and 55 were natives of Shetland and Harris  respectively, engaged in unskilled labour, theremainder  being Norwegians.     In Scotland  the whaling industry has had two distinct  phases, viz. the old Greenland  whalefishery, which  is  now practically extinct,  and the  modern Firmer  fishery  prosecuted  through the medium of capturing steamers and shore  factories.     For a long period  the new form of  whaling, started  about 1866, was confined to  Norway, thecountry of its origin, where it was carried on from stations situated along the  northern coast, and, as has  been stated, its  establishment  in  Scotland dates only from 1903, in which year two Norwegianwhaling companies erected factories at Eonasvoe,  Shetland, which was then the centre of a flourishingherring fishery, and made that locality their base of  operations.  The starting of this  enterprise ontheir part was largely due to the passing by the Norwegian  Legislature of an Act prohibiting whalingoff  the northern  coast  of Norway for a  period of  10  years  from 1903; whaling operations, it was alleged, having had a detrimental effect upon  the Norwegian cod  fishery.  It has been stated  thatthis  allegation  had little foundation iii fact, and that the agitation  against whaling in  Norway was largely political.  Whether  this was the case  or not, it is  the fact that on  its  expiry  in  19.14 theprohibition was continued by legislative enactment for a further  period of 10 years.  In  any case, the embargo placed upon whaling in  that  country was responsible in great measure for driving  thewhaling companies to seek  fresh  spheres  of operation.     The Norwegians started operations in Shetland  with  two steamers, and in the  following yearlive companies four in  Shetland and  one  in  the Hebrides employing ten  steamers, were at work.The  number  of companies  engaged   has  remained  unaltered since, but  the  number of steamersemployed  was  increased to  thirteen in 1905.     Very soon after the commencement  of operations complaints  began  to be heard, which very soon developed into a  strong  agitation against  the new industry.   The  agitation  was  based on two  grounds, viz.:      (1) That  the  treatment of the carcases  was a  source  of  nuisance, and  danger to public  health           and even  to navigation;     (2) That  whaling would  and did injure the herring fishing.     As a result a Departmental Committee on. &quot; Whaling and Whalecuring in  the North  of Scotland,&quot;composed  of  Messrs. Crawford,  Haldane,  and Leash,  was  appointed in 1904 to enquire into  thewhole  question of  whaling in its  relation to other branches of  the  fishing industry.  The termsof its  remit were as follows: &quot;To  enquire into  the new whaling and whalecuring  industry  aspursued or  proposed  to be pursued  at stations on the  coast  of  Scotland  and  in   the  adjacentwaters, and to report generally  thereon, and  specifically as to  the allegation that other forms ofthe  fishing industry are injuriously affected thereby.&quot;     The Committee reported in  1905.  Its findings, inter&apos;  alia,  were:      (1) That  on the whole, under proper regulations and inspection, the industry  was  not open           to  objection on  the ground of nuisance or clanger to public health ;t     (2) That  there were  no valid  grounds for the  prohibition of whaling  on the score of its danger           to  herring fishing.
     Tt  stated,  however, that  whaling,  though it should not  be.  suppressed, ought  to  bo regulatedand  limited, although  this recommendation was made  not  so  much in  the  interests  of  herringfishing as in those of the industry  itself.     The report concluded  with  a series of recommendations for the  regulation of  the industry,most of  which  were embodied in the  Whale Fisheries (Scotland)  Act, 1907, which  prohibits theexercise of  the whaling industry without a licence  from the  Fishery Hoard  for Scotland, prescribesthe  condition-:  under  which the  industry  may  be carried  on,  ami  the  penalties  which  may be imposed  for infringement  of the  regulations, and empowers  the Board to collect statistics relatingto the. industry.   A  copy of  this Act is included in the Appendices to  this Report,  and the onlypoint which calls for remark  is  that the  partial close  time  which  the  Board were empowered toimpose by  section 3(6) was fixed at five weeks from the first of  June, and  has remained unalteredsince.     The Committee  further laid great stress on the importance  of limiting each company to theuse  of only one  steamer.   But this stipulation  was modi lied in tho Act  by a proviso that if onesteamer were insufficient  fully to employ  a  factory as  it existed at 1st  January 1907, additionalsteamers might be authorised  up to a  maximum of four,  All  five companies in existence  applied for additional steamers  in  terms of this section of the Act, and  in three cases the applications were granted, with the result that, from 1908 to  1912 inclusive, 11 steamers (8  in  Shetland and3  in Harris) were engaged in  the industry.     In  1913  the two  companies whose applications were refused  in  1908 renewed  them, and inview of  the greatly  diminished  catches obtained during the two preceding years, the employmentof an additional  steamer  was sanctioned  in  each  case, so  that finally  .13 steamers  were  againemployed.     A further and  very important recommendation of the  Committee  which was not  embodied in the Act was  that  the duration of  licences  should  be  limited  to three years.    As the Actstands the  Board have  no power to withdraw  or  suspend  licences so long as the regulations arenot  contravened.     The capture  of the herring hog or lesser rorqual (B.  Roslrata) is prohibited by the Act, but mostof the other species present in British waters are  taken, and a  table showing the annual  catch  of eachspecies in Scottish waters since  1903 will  be  found in the  Appendices  to this Report.     In the Shetland area the principal whaling grounds lie from 50  to  SO  miles off shore, extendingfrom a line  to the westward of  Shetland round to a direction bearing      of the north of the  islands.Very few whales are caught within 30 miles of the  shore, and comparatively few between 30 and 50miles off, the great bulk being  taken between the 50 and 60 mile  radius.   The Hebridean groundsextend over a  wide area,  stretching to  St. Kilda, and  to 120 miles N.E.  of the Flannan Islands.     It is not surprising that  the British  herring fishing industry should be bitterly opposed  to anexotic industry which,  rightly  or  wrongly, they believe  to be steadily destroying one  of  their most valuable assets, and they consider  that, in view of ths great difference in the relative importance ofthe  two industries,  and  the  paramount importance of the  Shetland herring fisheries to  Britishfishermen,  they have a  strong claim for its total prohibition.     The reasons  which have been advanced by the herring fishermen in support  of their contentionhave now to be considered, and in order to judge of the validity of  these reasons it is necessary tohave a  clear conception  of the modus  operand&apos;!,  of  whaling.     The whale-catching vessels are small screw  steamships  of about  90  feet in length by  18 feetbeam, steaming from 10 to 12 knots  per hour, built with hurricane decks and provided with the  usualcrow&apos;s nest, from which a look-out for whales is kept.  The harpoon is a heavy weapon, with  a  stocklike that of an  anchor, whose point consists of a shell timed to explode some five seconds after entering the  body of the whale.   It is provided  with heavy flukes, which lie  alongside the shank  before theharpoon is fired, but which spring out umbrella-wise when the shell explodes, and  thus firmly hold the  whale.   To the harpoon is attached  a heavy hawser  made of the  finest hemp, which is paid out from a  steam  winch.     The harpoon is never fired until the steamer has approached sufficiently near to its victim  as torender a hit a reasonable certainty, and  if the gunner is a skilled man a vital spot is usually struck,and death is instantaneous.     After the  whale has been killed it is brought alongside the steamer, a pipe with hose  attached is passed into the body cavity and the carcase is inflated with air until it rises  high out of the water.The pipe is then withdrawn and the orifice plugged, after which the whale  is towed  to the station,fastened either alongside or astern.  Several whales may be  towed at once if the steamer has beenfortunate in capturing a number within a short interval of  each other.     Questioned as to effusion of blood and oil during these operations, the whaling witnesses examinedwere unanimous  in stating that the loss  of blood and oil from the wound made by the harpoon wasslight, for the reason  that the blubber immediately closed up tightly round the shaft.  They admitted,however, that a considerable amount of  blood was &quot; spouted &quot; by the whale during  its death flurries.     Before proceeding  to weigh the evidence it must be  premised  that very little precise knowledgeis available as to the  habits of  the herring or the causes which influence its movements.   It is known that herrings  are very sensitive to physical conditions changes of temperature,  salinity, and so on,
and further,  that their movements are largely governed by these of the minute  forms of life uponwhich they feed, which again are dependent upon currents and the physical conditions of the water,but the investigations which so far- have been carried out have only touched the fringe of the problem.    Another factor, which cannot be left out of account in considering this matter, is the notoriouslyfluctuating character of the herring fishing wherever it is carried on.   No fish is  mure erratic in itsmovements than the herring, and many instances of prolonged  failure followed by recovery could headduced.  For instance, in  Boeces Cosniogm-pMe of Albion, speaking of  Inverness, the author  says: &quot; Inverness where sumtym was grit plenti of tak of herring, howbe.it, they he now evanist for oflVnceagainst sum sanctioned.&quot;  In  more recent times the great failure of the Bohusland fishing (Sweden) for aperiod of seventy years, the failure of the Barra fishing followed by record catches, the visits of greatshoals of herrings to the Kyles of Bute after an absence of thirty-seven years, the temporary resuscita-tion of  the Loch Broom fishings in the beginning of the present century after a long period of failure,the reduction almost to vanishing point of the Shetland fishings themselves in  the  &apos;60&apos;s  and &apos;70&apos;s, allmight  be cited as illustrating how little is known  of the causes which govern the  movements of  the herring&apos;.     it  is therefore  apparent that tlie post, hoc argument of the opponents of whaling is not necessarilyconclusive, and that the  causes of  the  failure of the west-side grounds  may  be much more reconditethan those suggested to us  in evidence.    The fisherman&apos;s case is that whaling has everywhere been followed by the failure of the herringfishery, and that, if their explanation of this circumstance be questioned, it  rests with tlie other side to furnish an alternative  one;  that the  whalers cannot  do this;  that  though  they may advancehypotheses their evidence is entirely negative;  and that they cannot  give any positive explanation ofwhy herrings should have left the waters in question if not because of whaling.    The. reasons  advanced in support of the  statement  that  whaling affects the herring fishery areas follows:            (1) That the whales are a guide to  the presence of herrings, which, in their absence, are                  difficult to locate;           (2) That blood and oil escape from the whale, both during its struggles, and when it&apos; is                  being towed to land, pollute the water, and either drive the fish away  altogether or                  cause them to sink to the bottom;           (3) That this blood and oil attracts dogfish and sharks;           (4) That carcases of dead whales do the same;           (5) That the whale, in its struggles  to escape breaks up the herring shoals;           (6) That the, noise of gunfire frightens the shoals, and causes them to sink or scatter.    As regards most  of&apos; these, reasons, they are to a large extent matters  of opinion.  The gunfiretheory is put forward on the analogy of the thunderstorm, which will cause a shoal of herrings to sink,hut it is  seldom  that more than one  shot is fired, and  the  average number of whales  killed is only about four per day, so  that gunfire cannot be considered a very important factor.    The alleged  pollution of the water by blood and oil, and the  attraction of dogfish and sharks,appears on the face of it  a more feasible explanation, and a large mass of  testimony was submitted onthis point.  It was  stated that large areas of the sea were covered  with blood, and that the track of awhaler  towing whales was discernible for a distance of  three miles owing to the film of oil left on  thewater.   In the earlier years of whaling, too, it was stated  that  &quot;krangs&quot;  (the flensed  carcase), whichhad been set  adrift, were to be seen surrounded  by hordes of sharks and  dogfish feeding upon  them,although it was not alleged that this occurred after the introduction of  machinery for utilising theentire carcase.  It was further stated  that  the swarms  of dogfish and sharks thus attracted to  thecoast  remained throughout the whaling period, and have only now begun to show signs of diminutionas the result  of the cessation of whaling throughout the war.   The oil has also the additional effect ofrendering the water obnoxious to herrings, and so driving them away.    It  is not denied  by the whalers  that a certain amount of blood and oil escapes from a woundedwhale.  They aver, however, that it is much less than stated, and is  in  any case so small  in com-parison with the extent of ocean ranged over as to be negligible.     Dogfish  have  often been a pest  in  Shetland waters, but to what  extent they have increasedthere is,  in  the  absence of any  quantitative  statistics, no  means  of knowing.   If  they are more numerous than formerly, then it is  easy to understand what  a great nuisance they must  have become.    For example, in the Boards  Annual Beport for  1887, the failure of the herring fishing in theUnst  section of the district is ascribed to the presence of immense shoals of dogfish on the fishinggrounds throughout the whole season.    Two years later dogfish were so great a  plague  that the Board were petitioned  to  conduct  ascientific  investigation into the matter with  a view  to the mitigation of the evil.    Although  therefore these facts  do not  dispose  of the  contention  that  dogfish have increased as the  result of whaling operations, they  are sufficient to render  it doubtful whether the  increase, ascompared with the pre-whaling period, has been so  great as is  averred by the  herring  fishermen.Moreover similar  causes ought to produce similar results, but it is not claimed that there has been any increase in the number of dogfish in Hebridean waters.
    The alleged  increase in the number of sharks is a different matter, and it is quite possible thatthe flensed  carcases of whales  drifting about  in the sea, as was the case in the earlier years ofwhaling, attracted these scavengers; and although the practice of setting the carcases adrift ceasedafter  machinery was installed at the whaling stations for utilising  them, it is possible that  sharks arestill  attracted in  this way, since it was  admitted that, owing to the employment of unskilled gunners,a certain  number of whales  escape after being struck.   Some at least of these whales will succumbto their wounds,  and their dead bodies will  doubtless drift about to be  preyed  upon  by sharksand dogfish.    On the  question  of the pollution of  the sea great stress  has been  laid upon  the fact thatthe herring  is a very cleanly and  sensitive  fish, quickly responsive  to  change  in the physicalcondition  of  the  sea, and with a strong aversion  to  dirty or polluted water.  This statement is notchallenged;  but  it was  not alleged that the film of oil in the wake of a whaler with  a whale into is visible for more  than three miles, which, as  these vessels travel at some twelve knots perhour,  means  that  the oil  has been dissipated in about one  quarter of an hour.   Moreover evidence was  led that small  quantities of herrings  have been  caught  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of thewhaling stations  at  Olna Firth and  Harris.    In so far as  the importance of whales  as a guide to the herring shoals is concerned, referenceneed  oidy be made  to the  great North Sea herring fishery, which is carried on  in waters  whichwhales  rarely visit.    Frequent reference  was  made  to the  Shetland herring  fishing  statistics  in  the  course ofthe enquiry,  and  the representatives of the whaling interests endeavoured to show  that, while thetotal  quantity landed had declined, the average catch per boat was greater after the commencementof whaling than  before.    The  Committee  are  satisfied that the official returns  cannot  be used tosupport this  view, inasmuch as, according to official  evidence, herrings  landed at  the  stations on theWest and North  might  be, and frequently were,  brought from  the East side  or  Lerwick  whensufficient fish could not be obtained locally to keep curing stations there at work.   The boats at work-on the  West side were  thus statistically credited with fish  taken  elsewhere by other vessels, andany  conclusions  founded on the average  catch  per boat  at these stations are consequently un-reliable for  the  purpose  of this  enqttiry.   that the statistics  definitely prove  is  that there wasa continuous decline in  the landings of  herrings  on  the coasts near which  whaling was  carriedon until vanishing point was at last reached,  and  this  they  do in no uncertain fashion.    The statistics of the Norwegian fisheries require also to be subjected to careful scrutiny, in  so  faras they bear on this question.  A reference to the  table given in the Appendix will show that  a most striking increase  took place in the catch of  cod in Finmark after  whaling was prohibited, and  as, in norway, whaling was suppressed on the score of its alleged harmful  effect  upon the cod fishery, this increase might at first sight be taken  as amply vindicating the  contention of the  cod fishermen.   but here again no correct conclusions could be drawn without taking into account the fact that this periodof expansion coincided with the introduction of  the motor boat, which enabled fishermen from  distantparts of Norway to proceed to Finmark, where previously the fishery had been a purely local one, andthat simultaneously the market for dried cod fish  underwent a, steady development, and provided an inducement for  increased activity.     It may  be  urged, therefore,  that  the  reasons advanced to  support the  theory  that  whaling is directly injurious to herring fishing are not convincing.  Yet, when  all has been said, there remains theindisputable fact that in those  Shetland waters where whaling has been carried on the herring fisheryhas coincidently  declined.     It was stated in evidence that  when  whaling,  was confined  to the western  waters  only  thosewaters were  affected; that the extension of  operations northwards  to Flugga was speedily followed bya similar  disappearance of  herrings from those waters ; and that, as whaling operations extended tothe north-east, so did those waters in their  turn become unproductive, until finally out of all  the arearound Shetland, herrings were to be obtained only in  that portion to the south-east of  Lerwick whichhas been immune from whaling.  It was stated  further that since the cessation of whaling the herringsare showing signs of returning to their former haunts.  If all this is merely coincidence, then it mustbe admitted that such coincidence is very striking.     It was  urged on behalf of  the whaling  industry that  the abandonment of the western andnorthern stations and the concentration at Lerwick have been due to causes other  than the failure ofthe early fishing, and would have occurred in any  case, irrespective of  whether whaling had beencarried on or not, but no evidence by any curers or fishermen  was  led  in  support  of  this contention.In so far as steam drifters are concerned, there is probably some force in it, but as regards sailing boatswe do not think that the same causes have been operative in the same degree.     The main factors which have led to centralisation at Lerwick are said to be the superior facilities available  there for steam fishing Vessels, and the existence of an auction mart.   Coal, water,  oil, and stores of  every kind can readily be obtained there, whereas the contrary is  apt to  be  the  case  at theremote stations  on the west.  At Lerwick  the  fish are sold  by  auction, competition  is  keener and prices higher, skill and enterprise are rewarded to a greater  degree, and steam drifters, particularly the English vessels, which are in most cases  owned by companies, will not sacrifice these advantagesby engaging themselves to curers at remote stations at fixed prices for their catches.     The disabilities referred to would, in any event, not account for the abandonment of Balta Sound,which is an ideal harbour, with ample ground for curing stations, and where formerly coal hulks&apos;were
                                CONCLUSIONS.The  Committee  accordingly find: 1. That the herring fishery on the west, north, and north-east coasts of Shetland was formerly a       prosperous industry, but has of recent years diminished and finally disappeared.moored, and a hulk was used in latter years as an auction mart.  The reason must therefore in this-instance  be sought elsewhere,   It  is to be found  to some extent in  the development of the,earlyfishing on the south-east grounds, following upon  the growth of a demand in the Eussian markets forthe young and immature herrings (matties) which  were formerly not  fished for  as they were  thenunsaleable.     These considerations do not, however, apply in  the same degree to the sail boats which constitute the bulk of the local fleet.  The great  congestion  of shipping in  Lerwick harbour during the fishing-season,  and  the resultant  difficulty of  manceuvring  vessels not  yet  provided  with mechanicalpower, impose a great handicap upon them.  The local fishermen who gave evidence, were unanimous in their preference for working from their own home stations, and there is not the slightest doubt, thatthey would return to the stations on the west  and  north-west provided the fishing revived in  thoselocalities.  There  was also  evidence from curers  that  they  would willingly  reopen  those stationsif the fishing revived, owing to the superior quality of  the fish taken on  the western grounds.   but one and  nil are  so deeply imbued with  a  conviction that the herring fishing will  never revive  whilewhaling continues, that it is hopeless to expect a return to the former methods and conditions unless and until  this deterrent  is removed.     The fact must therefore be faced, that whether or not whaling is the  actual and direct cause ofthe disappearance  of  the  herrings,  if  is   the  general belief  that  it has brought about  theabandonment of the early herring fishing, and, starting from the position  that the two industries areincompatible, it has  to be considered what is best to be done in the National interests.   On this  pointthere can be no two  opinions.   On  the one hand  we  have an industry  which, at  the  zenith of its:success,  gave employment  to  some thousands of people in a district whose natural  resources areseverely limited, and whose one asset is the wealth  of fish with which its waters teem.   In  the words of  one  of  the witnesses, the stations on the west  and  north-west were at one time &quot; simply hives ofindustry.  There was an  enormous  fleet fishing  from each of these ports.  1  refer to  the ports fromScalloway  right  round  to  Balta  Sound:   Scalloway, Walls,   Hillswick, Ronasvoe, North   Eoe,Westsandwick, Whaltirth, ditcher,  Gullivoe,  TJyasound, and Balta Sound.   There were  large fleets ofvessels there.  Fish  were abundant.   A large number of cargo steamers were coming and going to andfrom the harbours, and  loading for the Continental and American markets.   Numbers of steamers weredischarging salt.  There were an enormous number of fislrworkers  ashore.  All local merchants andothers were  doing a great trade.&quot;   All this is now changed, and where once thriving communitiesflourished all is desolation and ruin.   In all these bays and voes, station after station which were oncecentres  of activity,  were  seen  by the Committee lying derelict in various stages of decay, and no one who has witnessed these scenes  can  fail to appreciate  the depth of feeling with which the natives ofShetland regard these  altered conditions.   The  intense feeling against whaling, which&apos; pervades thewhole community, deeply impressed the Committee.     On the  other side we have, a comparatively unimportant industry employing a mere handful ofBritish subjects, while the plant is mainly, and the  skilled labour, both afloat and ashore, is exclusivelyNorwegian.     The prohibition of whaling in  Shetland would undoubtedly constitute  a hardship to the whalingcompanies, who have expended a considerable amount of capital in erecting stations  and providingsteamers, on the security conferred  by  an Act passed by the British Legislature.   There are, however,a number of circumstances which may be set on the other side of  the account.  Forbidden  to exercise their industry in their native  country, they  established  themselves in  Shetland,  where, they  havebenefited by an Act of Parliament which, by  sanctioning the employment of more than one steamerper company, and  by not  limiting the  duration of  licences, went  far  beyond  the   scope of  therecommendations  of the  departmental Committee which  enquired  into  the industry in 1904.   Theleases under which  the Shetland stations are held expire in two  or  three years at longest, and the stations could not now be put into working order again  except at considerable expense.    -  it  has  been suggested that if whaling  is done  away  with in  Shetland the stations will  be transferred  to Faroe, or, alternatively,  that floating factories  will be  employed on the edge of the territorial waters, and that, inasmuch as whaling operations will then be  outwith  British jurisdiction, the last state will  be  worse  than  the first.   This suggestion does not impress the Committee.     Whaling operations in  Scottish waters are not, however, confined to Shetland.   There is also the station in Harris, and it will be urged that the objections to whaling, however valid in Shetland, do not apply to the Outer Hebrides.   We  are satisfied from the evidence put before  us that this is the case.  The operations  carried  on  from Bunaveneader  do not conflict with any sea-fishing interests. The station, the lease of which does not expire till  1927, appears  to  be  conducted with  due regard to the welfare of the local  population,  and its  presence in  their midst is apparently welcomed by them.
   o                                           72.  That numerous and costly  curing  stations  existed  at Balta  Sound, Hillswiek,  Eonasvoe,       Scalloway, and elsewhere which have now for the  most part been utterly abandoned, and       whose abandonment  has been attended  with great financial  loss.3.  That the  decline of the  fishing  in question  was coincident with  the  development of the       whaling industry in  Shetland and began  soon after its introduction into the islands.4.  That a  belief is strong and universal among fishermen  and curers, is unanimously maintained       by the County Council of Zetland, is general among the whole population of Shetland, and       is  furthermore  concurred  in  by curers, and owners of drifters, visiting tfhese areas  from       Scotland  and England, that the introduction of whaling and the decline  of the herring       fishing on the west,  north, and north-east  of  Shetland are  directly related  as  cause       and effect.5.  That this general and unquestioned belief is in  itself a deterrent  influence upon tin.1 herring-       fishing and is enough to  prevent the revival of the western  and northern stations or the       resort of fishermen to waters frequented  by the whalers.6.  That there is a vast disparity between the magnitude and importance  to the Shetlands of the       two industries the one  constituting the real wealth and being essential to the prosperity       of  Shetland, and the  other small,  new,  and  alien to  the islands.7.  That all the leases of the whaling stations in Shetland  expire not later than Whitsunday 1923,       and that  of  the station in Harris  in 1927.S.  That the case of the whaling companies that the failure of  the herring industry  in the areas       in  question is wholly due  to economic  causes and to the concentration  of the herring       fishing industry  at Berwick is  not proved.9.  That no specific complaint was proved or even  made of any detrimental effect on the herring       fishing arising from the operations of the whalers from Bunaveneader  in  Harris, and  that       no  evidence  of  local feeling in the Hebrides against the whaling industry was adduced.                           RECOMMENDATIONS.The  Committee  recommend : 1.  That, having  regard  to  the practically unanimous belief  of  the  fishing industry and the       inhabitants of Shetland generally, concurred in by the fishing and curing interests of both       Scotland and England, as to the injurious effects of whaling operations, such  operations       from stations in Shetland should now be prohibited.2.  That the Whale Fisheries (Scotland) Act, 1907, should be amended so as to prohibit whaling       operations being carried  on from any part  of Shetland.    The  Committee desire to express their appreciation of the assistance rendered with great ability and interest by Mr. A. A. Norris, one of the staff of the Board, in discharging  the duties of  Secretaryto the Enquiry.    A. A. NORMS, Secretary,EDINBURGH, 12th December 1919.W. LYON MACKENZIE,  Chairman.DAVID T.
