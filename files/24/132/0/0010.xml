[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]               Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1922.SECRET.C.P.-3610.                             CABINET.PROVISIONAL  GOVERNMENT  OF  IRELAND COMMITTEE.    AS Chairman of the Provisional Government of Ireland Committee Icirculate to the Cabinet the draft of a Bill to implement Article 17 of theTreaty. As the Cabinet will see, the procedure  proposed  is  that  anAgreement should be negotiated between British Ministers and the  IrishMinisters  of the new Provisional Government, and that this Agreement,when signed by both parties, should become a  Schedule to the Bill, andthat the Bill itself should take the simple form of confirming the Agree-inent set out in tho Schedule  and of authorising His Majesty in Councilto make the necessary Orders.     In reaching the unanimous view that the necessary Bill  should take this form, the  Committee have had the  advantage of the advice of theLord Chancellor and of the Attorney-General,both of whom endorse strongly the course proposed.  The form of the Bill would restrict the proceedings in both Houses of Parliament to &quot; second reading&quot; debates, and would avoid lengthy  discussions of amendments in detail upon the  many points that the Scheduled Agreement should cover.     The proposed form of  the Bill rests, of course, upon the assumptionthat  the  new Irish  Ministers will  be prepared to enter  into such anAgreement.  It is hoped that very shortly Irish Ministers will be coiningto  London to settle the  arrangements for the  transfer  of executive responsibility to  the Provisional Government, and it  is important thatthe question  of a  signed Agreement should be raised  with them  at the outset.  The immediate authority of the Cabinet  for the course proposedis therefore required.                                                          W. S. C.     January 12, 1922.
