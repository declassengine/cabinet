Ajgpr^ed,Set conference of Ministers and despatched       by. Secretary of &quot;State for Foreign Affaire T .24* h                      &quot;January , 1922[NOTagX&quot;.   Your telegram 27   of January 22nd.     Government, are most anxious both to retain  advantageof your services to which in present  critical  situationthey attach highest value, and also to  obtain  a  peaceful solution  of the present difficulty by installation  of an egyptian  ministry  under a minister as loyal  and  capable asSarwat Pasha.   For do they think that this  should be found impossible, if  all parties act with a due appreciation ofthe feelings and convictions of the others,  and  with a firmdesire to find  a solution that will be  equally honourableto Egypt  and Great Britain.      Whilst giving full weight to yoisr explanations andto the assurances  which you have received,  the Cabinet feel strongly  that His  Majesty&apos;s Government  might be  surrenderinga position which they consider vital  to the  Empire. Ifthese assurances are  sincerely pr off erred and. if  thoy are  tohave a binding  value, there  should  not  be any  insurmountabledifficulty&quot; in putting them in  an acceptable and  tangibleform. - In their present  shape  they  imply an obligation-Which might afte.rifra.rds be disputed  or even  repudiated, andwhich might expose His majesty&apos;s Government to the  justcharge of having abandoned  our main position withoutsafeguards for  the future,   For if  the  abolition of the protectorate and the  recognition of Egypt as a sovereign state be  conceded  without any  clear undertaking  as  to  thesequel, we might find ourselves confronted  with  conditions                                                which/
which neither His Majesty&apos; 3 Government. nor Parliament  &quot; -would he prepared to ratify ;.later on,  thus leading to a breakdown even more disastrous than that which you con-teEplatvr. - In such a case the sanction of the presence ofBritish troops within the country, though an effectiveguarantee against formidable disturbance., might be impotenttc secure us the peaceful, solution which all desire.      His Majesty&apos;s Government, are quite willin- thatthe reserved subjects should.provide the basis of free and friendly discussion between both parties..  But thisshould be subject to a clear understanding.on the points to which due importance has been rightly attached in yourconversations with the ministers, but which  should admitwithout difficulty of a more concrete,..definition.      These are the following:-      (l)  A formal recognition by the Egyptian Governmentthat the advice which we  are prepared to offer to parlia-ment shall be the prelude to the institution of relations of perpetual friendship and  close alliance between thetwo countries.      (2)  The exclusion  of  foreign intervention or&apos;influence by any  foreign  power in the internal affairs of v&quot;gypt, as willingly admitted  in the interview ofClayton and Selby with the members of -Wafd.      (3)  A full recognition by the  cigyptian government,in return for the concession as  regards  foreign, repre-sentation, of the superior  diplomatic position and influence of Great Britain.      (4)  A full recognition by the- Egyptian governmentof the vital importance  of.Egypt  as a part  of our Imperialcomraunications, and of the  resultant  fact  that in any arrangement which may be  proposed we must  be at liberty to take  such steps as may be required to maintain anddefend that position.      If the Egyptian Ministers  hold  the views upon  allthese points which may be inferred from  your conversations
with then, they should experience  no difficulty in givingthe- explicit assurances for which we ask.  In their absenceI am afraid that we could not justify nor would parlia-ment approve a proposal Which would certainly be represented  anas/unconditional surrender on our part and &quot;which we ourselves feel provides insufficient security for vitalImperial interests.  Egyptian Ministers should consider our position as well as their own, aril should reflect thata rebuff in Parliament would be as bad for Egypt as itwould be unwelcome to His majesty&apos;s Government.  If egyptian government is prepared to give these assurances, HisMajesty&apos;8s Government will then engage to ask the consentof parliament early in tho forthcoming session to aresolution which will declare the willingness of HisMajesty Js Government formally to  terminate the protectoratejand to recognise Egypt as a Sovereign  State, so soon asan  agreement has been reached on  the reserved subjects in  acoordance with the above assurances.      In  the interim, the Government of Egypt would, asindicated by you in your personal telegram of January 20th,revert in practice to the status  CJMOI ante- bellum, withthe difference  that Turkish Suzerainty would of course have disappe ared.      His Majesty*s Government would in  these circumstancesalso gladly agree  to  the conditions named in your proposedletter  to the Sultan, namely (l)  that steps shall be takenby  the Egyptian Government forthwith to  set up a parlia-ment (2)  That martial law irish.ll be abolished cr suspendedas  soon as Egyptian Government and yourself are agreedto  recommend this  and  (3) That an Egyptian Ministry  ofForeign Affairs should be re-established which will prepare the way for the creation of diplomatic and consular representatives- sentation.                                               I most/
     I most earnestly request you to use yo\zv influence withthe Sultan and. the Egyptian Authorities to obtain their acceptance of these conditions^  which represent a sinceredesire on our part to meet Egyptian aspirations,  and tofollow your advice.      If you are able to communicate to us their assent,terms of final letter to Sultan will need revision andwill of course be considered by the Cabinet.      We could settle later on the precise time forresumption of negotiations on the reserved points.Whitehall  Gardens,  S.  24th  January,  1922,
