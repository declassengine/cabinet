                   0  A 3. I H a T(Proposed Amalgamation of the Royal Dutch,Shell, Bumah and               Anglo-Persian Oil Companies.)         Memorandum by Minister in Charge r*f* Petroleum.          Proposals have been made to the Government for thefusion of the interests of the above companies in a manner which would secure British control of all tho operatingoompanies except those actually working in Dutch colonial territory.  The scheme is one of great importance and ofconsiderable complexity.  Tho details of the proposals and the issues raised by them are set out at length in theattached memorandum,          I suggest that the most convenient course wouldbe to appoint a Cabinet Committee to report on the whole matter.           The following Departments are mo2x5 directly interested:-  The Treasury, the Foreign Office, thos&amp;air&amp;lty, the India Office, the Colonial Office, andthe Board of Trade 9                                ?. LLOYD-GRSAI.SE.                                       6 January, 1922.
sgpjET        PROPOSED AMALGAMATION  OP THE ROYAL DUTCH,  SH3LL,  BURMAH                  AND ANGLO-PERSIAN OIL COMPANIES.             1,    A fusion of  interests of the  Royal Dutch Company,        the Shell Transport and Trading Company, the Burmah Oil        Company, and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has been proposed,        and the  Burmah Oil Company, on behalf of themselves and  the        Royal Dutch and Shell  Companies, has submitted the scheme  for        the sanction of H.M.Government.  These  proposals  briefly are        that the Burmah Company should purchase the shares of H.M,        Government in the Anglo-Persian Company, that the Royal  Dutch,        Shell and Burmah Companies should retain their identity  as        holding companies and should each acquire  an interest in all        the operating subsidiary companies.  This  would provide  for        a permanent British majority holding and,  therefore, for        British control of all the activities not  only of the Burmah        and Anglo-Persian Companies, but of the Royal Dutch-Shell        combine, except those  actually carried on  in Dutch colonial        territory.                  The constitution of the Royal Dutch-Shell group  and        the proposed basis for the formation of the new amalgamated  ;        group are dealt with in Appendix I. and the effect of the        exclusion from the amalgamation of Royal Dutch concerns        operating in Dutch territory is explained in Appendix II.                  A memorandum by the Managing Director of the        Burmah Oil Company outlining his proposals 13 also attached        (Appendix III).             2.    It has always been considered very desirable that        the Royal Dutch Shell group should be brought under effective        British control.  With this object in view the Board of  Trade        initiated negotiations in 1916, and the Harcourt  Committee in
1918-19 after reviewing the whole field of pet role is?.policy devoted the greater part of its time to an endeavour to bring the group under British control.  Thegroup and its subsidiary companies, which are over 100in number and the value of whose assets was some time ageestimated at  300,000,000, are at present Dutch controlled,60 per cent, of the capital In each subsidiary beingsubscribed by the Royal Dutch Company and the remaining40,per cent, by the Shell Company.  The Royal Dutch Companyhas, therefore, absolute control anr&quot; could at any timetransfer the whole direction of the group to the Hague,Some of the moro important operating companies are atpresent British registered and most of its large fleet,estimated at half a million tons of shipping, fly the british flag.  For various reasons, and particularly owing to their desire to escape heavy British taxation, the Duttrfa might at any time be disposed to exercise their rights as the predominant partner and transfer the companies and ships to Dutch register.  At present, the personality and strongBritish leanings of Sir Henri Deterding, the leadingfigure In the group, render any such step unlikely;  buton his retirement the nationality question might well become more acute.  The management of the group has been marked by great enterprise, ability and success, end it isno disparagement of the purely British oil companies tosay that they are at present considerably its inferiorsin experience and in knowledge of all phases of thepetrolevm industry, and that for this reason alone the                        2*
suggested concentration -noulc! turn to their advantage .     3,   The present proposals would prevent any transfer-to foreign territory of the activities of the group at thecost of the   absorption with it in a single entity of theBurmah and Angle-Persian Companies, and it is apparentlyonly by such an absorption that British control of the groupby majority shareholding, which is the only satisfactory  -form of control, can be secured.  Even then, on the draftfigures submitted the British holding is enly 51 per cent.giving a bare though sufficient British majority, but it isprobable that in the working out of the details this figure would be somewhat increased.    4.   If the proposed amalgamation is approved inprinciple, it will be neoessary with the assistance of legalexperts to determine the conditions upon which H.M.Governmentwill insist, in order to make British control permanent and effective.  Some of these conditions are considered later in para,13.  But it is essential to decide in the first instance,whether, assigning that these conditions are fulfilled, H.M.Government should approve in principle of the amalgamation.     5.   It will be convenient to consider the relativearguments as they affect the various interests and branchesof policy concernsd*  These may be grouped, under the FightingServioes, the Private Consumer, Foreign Countries, theTreasury, and India.     6.   Of the Fighting Services the Admiralty is chiefly concerned.  About 40 per cent, of its requirements of fuel oil are at present met under the contract with the Anglo-Persian Cempany and the remainder of its supplies are obtained under short term oontraots or yearly purchases fromthe United States, Mexico, Trinidad, Borneo, &quot;and Scotland.It has also a perpetual contract for a small quantity of  oil
with the Buimah Oil Company.  It would, be a fundamentalcondition of consent to the -present proposals that theAdmiralty contracts with the Anglo-Persian and BuraahCompanies should, remain in full force.  The Admiraltydoes not favour the suggested amalgamation because it considers that Its contract with the Anglo-Persian company is better secured under the present arrangement, and because it fears that with reduced competition it nightfind greatex1 difficulty in filling the balance of its requirements at reasonable prices, particularly in the East.It is considered, however, that as a condition of approvalof the amalgamation, terms could be made which would fullysecure Admiralty supplies and would even improve its position as regards the balance of its need  not nowcovered by contracts  If the scheme in general is approved,the Cabinet might fix the minirawm which the new group should concede, as regards additional Admiralty supplies,and the Admiralty could then negotiate for terms at leastequal to and,if possible,bettor than this minimum.          The Admiralty proposals on this point are dealtwith in Appendix IV.          Similar conditions apply to the other fightingservices.   Their peace requirements of petroleum productsare much smaller than the Admiralty&apos;s and are not secured by long term contracts.  It could, however, be made acondition of the amalgamation that their needs were meton a reasonable price basis.  In time of war, the wholeresources of the amalgamated groups would be  placed at  thedisposal of the State,     7 *.  ,Th3i Private Consuiner.          One direct advantage of the amalgamation would bothe great saving in expense which would result from doing  away with the necessity for maintaining duplicate  distributing
                         i,                       i          163organisations and staffs.  This can bo well illustrated by  thepresent situation in regard to petrol distribution.   It appearscertain that the costly and wasteful method of marketing petrolin this country in two gallon cans will be substituted withinthe next few years by a system of bulk delivery by pumps, theonly method of distribution to the small consumer which is  nonemployed in the United Spates,  The result of this change will eventually be a substantial reduction in costs, but in the  mean-time the companies are faced with the expense of installing thenew plant and scrapping the old.  Each company will, under thepresent arrangements, have to spread a complete network of pumpsover the United Kingdom at a cost estimated at  5,000,000.   Asingle company could do the work now performed by two,  and theconsumer should reap the benefit of reduced capital and running costs.  Further, economies would be effected by the fact thatconcessions would be obtained on better terms if the competition for these concessions were reduced, and the expenditure onexploration by a single corporation will, of course, be much less than if competing companies are exploring independentlyin the same regions.  It will, naturally, be asked whether theconsumer will actually secure the advantage of such economies and whether any system could be devised to ensure that they donot all go to swell the profits of the oil companies.-.  Thisquestion of price regulation is extremely difficult, and. thefollowing considerations are advanced in regard to it:-(a)  Price agreements and delimitation of markets now exist and      will continue to do so whether the amalgamation takes place      or not,  It is true that, while they trade as independent      undertakings, any company can break away if it considers      the price arrangements unreasonable, aricl the interest which        it- has in maintaining its own production and distribution      on as large a scale as possible i3 an important factor      in enforcing the observance of a policy of maximum sales
    and fair- price,  Generally apoaklng., the- object -of the    companies is to fix a price high enough to return a    substantial profit and low enough to keep the demand In    line with available supplies.  There has been a great    ,deal of criticism, much of it ill-informed, of the prices    charged for oil products  in this country.  The ordinary    consumer cannot expect to obtain supplies of a foreign    produced article on a more favourable basis than the    prices current in other countries.  The Anglo-Persian    Company&apos;s production of light oils  is at present    handled by  the Royal Dutch-Shell group under a contract    which expires at the end  of 1922, and there is no doubt    that the general public cherishes hopes that when the    Anglo-Persian Company is  able to distribute its own    products it will, as a Government controlled company,   &quot;&quot;sell at much lower rates  than those now ruling.  It    is improbable that the company has  any such philanthropic    intention and H,M,Government has, under its pledge to    respect the company&apos;s commercial freedom, no power to    enforce such a policy.  Moreover, it would take the    Anglo-Persian Company a considerable time to I&quot;Orce its    way into British and other markets  as a distributor  of    all or even a large proportion  of its potential oil    production.  In the meantime, it would have to sell    its surplus at the best possible prioe to the Royal    Dutch-Shell or Standard,                               t(b)  The-question whether advantage  could be taken of the    amalgamation now projected  to secure preferential    temns for the British consumer  has  been carefully    considered, but It has not &quot;Men found possible to    frame any really effective  acheme.  The Burmah Oil    Company has sold keroserte %xt&apos; India  for a number of
              i                                    165years at a fixed r$te agreed with Government, but thishas only been maintained &quot;beoause of the specialcircumstances existing in that country, and. such anarrangement would not be applicable in the UnitedKingdom.  Nor does the periodical revision of prices by Government appear practicable or desirable.  Theimpotence of the two Committee a on Trusts and theimpracticability of taking any action on the reportsof the Sub-Commit tee on Motor Fuel appointed underthe Profiteering Act showed that Governmental control was recognised, to be ineffective and even harmfulwhen the commodity in question was mainly produced inforeign countries,          It has been suggested that the system adoptedin the case of gas undertakings, by which an increasein dividend must be accompanied by a fall in price,might be applied to the operations of the combine,but the advantages of such a proposal without furthersafeguards are more apparent than real because it wouldbe perfectly simple te keep the profits of the distribute-Ing company, which would alone be affected, down to a low level and to make a corresponding increase In the earnings of the producing or transporting companies,whose operations may cover many other countries.  Thecompanies would, I think, agree to a most-favoured-nationprovision, under which this country would be as favourablytreated as any other in regard to the prices at whichpetroleum products were landed in this country andtransferred to the distributing company.  Due allowance would, of course, have to be made for the difference inoost3 of ocean transport to the various countries fromthe producing fields.  The additions to these prices                     7.
     subsequently made by  the  distributing company to cover     the  co3t  of internal  distribution  could then be limited     as  suggested above  on the  same  principle as charges by     gas  undertakings.   If the  amalgamation is approved, it     would probably  be well to provide  for the double     safeguard of a  most-favoured-nation  agreement coupled  .   with the  sliding scale of distributing company dividends     and prices.(c)   An  amalgamation of  the nature  suggested would reduce     the  number of large independent marketing groups in     this country from three to two, and  the only effective     competition would be  between the new combine and the     Standard subsidiary,  the  Anglo-American Oil Company.     The  latter has  at present about thirty per cent, of     the  petroleum trade of thi3 country, or fifty per     cent. If fuel oil is  omitted and account taken only     of  the more valuable  refined products, and it may  be     anticipated that the  efforts of the  combine to secure     a substantial share of this market would lead,for  a     time at least,to keen and effective  competition.   As     already indicated,  the amalgamation  3hould result  In     a considerable  economy in organisation, and competition     should be real  enough to ensure sane of this advantage     reaching the  consumer.  It cannot, however, be over-     looked that there would be strong  and hot unreasonable     prejudice in  the minds of the public against the     amalgamation, and that due weight  would not be given     to its undoubted advantages.  The  charge not merely  of     permitting, but of  definitely approving  the formation     of a great trust would have to be  met, and  this  action     would be contrasted with the successful efforts made  In     1914 to keep the Anglo-Persian Company independent.
    Against this it may be urged that  the commercial    advantages of fusion,  in which the consumer must    eventually share, are  too strong to be ignored,    and that no monopoly ii3 being created.8.   Foreign Policy.           Ths effect on foreign opinion of the formationof a powerful British petroleum, corporation would be no less important than the domestic reception of the scheme.  the amalgamation would be interpreted in the United States as evidence of a determination to build up a British organ! sc. -tion strong enough to fight and beat the Standard Oil Company.The latter has, in spite of anti-trust legislation in America,been extending its interest in other American oil groups, iswealthier and more powerful than ever, and has been makingits influence felt to our detriment In various countries where it is by no means scrupulous as to the weapons itemploys.  The announcement of the amalgamation would,therefore, probably excite angry criticism in the UnitedStates and considerable friction might result for a time:but if a disposition was shown to cone to terms with theStandard in countries where they desired participation,such as Worth Persia, Roumania, and Mesopotamia, any active irritation would probably be only short-lived.  Theattitude of other foreign countries is, by comparison,unimportant.  There is, perhaps, some danger that the greataggregation of capital which the combine would representmight be viewed, particularly in the smaller states, withsomething of the distrust and fear at present felt for theStandard.  This is, however, largely a commercial risk andit would be for the combine, by avoiding the unscrupulous
methods of the Standard, te ensure that it is not hampered by similar ill-will.          It may be urged that the foreign position would besimplified If H.M.Government Cea3ed to hold shares in theAnglo-Persian Company, and to have any financial interestwhatever in the combine.  Diplomatic difficulties might wellbe lessened if H.M.Government avoided becoming partners withforeign Interests in a vast commercial conoern with world wideramifications.          Apart, however, from their bearing on foreignpolicy, the financial relations between the Treasury and theAnglo-Persian Company need special consideration.  If that company retains its independence, it must find very large sxxmsfor the development of its various enterprises, and K.U.Government must either take up its share of this capital oragree to the issue of ordinary shares to the public.  Theseshares might be without voting rights, bat the effect of theirissue would be rapidly to reduce the proportion of the total capital held by H.M.Government, which might ultimately become a minority shareholder with only a nominal, as distinct froma financial, control.  The magnitude of the capital require-ments of a large petroleum company is indicated by the factthat a single one of the Royal Dutch-Shell subsidiaries, theAnglo-Saxon Petroleum Company, has a capital of  25,000,000,and that the Standard Oil Company ef New Jersey, one of theStandard Oil group, is credited with spending  60,000,000in new developments In two years.  The Anglo-Persian Company,as a separate commercial entity, must strain every nerve todevelop it3 production and distribution.  The early expiry of Its contract with the Royal Dutch-Shell group will render
it essential for it to create a vast new distributingorganisation, which can only bo established at heavyoapital cost.          It is understood that the treasury would be disposed to cell its shareholding if an adequate pricecould be scoured, and the Burmah Company has claimed that,if the sale of the Government share is decided on, itshould have the first refusal.  Apart from the generalquootion of policy, there are strong reasons against animmediate 3ale, as the present is the wor3t possible timefor realising an adequate price.  The markets are in thetrough of a slump wave and it would be Impossible to getanything approaching full value for this great asset.  Itwould be particularly unjustifiable for H,M,Government tosell under such conditions because it can afford, far better than the ordinary holder of mil shares, to wait fora rise and the return of a normal market.  I think these views as to the value of the asset and the unpropitiousmoment for a sale would be generally held.  But I am bound to say that the Shell Company have expressedstrongly the view that the Anglo-Porsian Company is atthe beginning of its difficulties;  that it will losemuch money in forcing its distribution in keenly contestedmarkets, and that in the immediate future  its shares willdepreciate in value.  This view is, however, put forward by a company 7diosc contract with the Anglo-Persian company is on the point of expiring, and who are naturally anxiousto see an amalgamation on term a advantageous to themselves.If the amalgamation proposals are accepted on other grounds,as 3ound. and defensible, I should be inclined to favour acourse of action under which the risk of diplomaticdifficulties would be accepted and the chares held for a
&quot;better price, HiM-Government being in the meantime franklya consenting party to the formation of the combine.  Itis evident that it would not,in any case,be possible for itto sell out and disclaim responsibility for any amalgamationinto which the Anglo-Persian Company chose to enter.10&apos;   Objection to Government Participation.          Very strong exception is taken by the Shell company to the Government retaining  its holding In the Anglo-Persian               la cterCompany and to the/Company entering the combine on the same footing as the other three controlling companies.  Indeed,the Shell Company informed me that they would not be a partyto the combine on these terms.  They refuse to be partnerswith the Government irl the marketing and distributingbusiness.  They would agree  to the Government holding shares in the Anglo-Persian Company if it were reduced to the levelof a subsidiary producing company, controlled by the combine.This would be an impossible position, as the combine wouldbe able to milk the Anglo-Persian at will.  If the Governmentretain its holding, it must  share in all the advantages ofthe amalgamation;  and the Anglo-Persian must enter thecombine a a. a. partner, drawing its --agreed? proportion of theprofits of all the combined undertakings.  I am not satisfiedthat this refusal on the part of the Shell Company is finaljand that, if faced with no alternative, they would not cometo terms rather than let the amalgamation fall through.Sir Henri Deterding, while not committing himself, was much less hostile to the idea.  He was clear that theGovernment could not have any share or control in actualmanagement.  (It has not at present).  But I do not thinkhe would reject the Government as a sleeping partner if this were Insisted upon,
11*   India.         Steps have been taken to abtain the opinion of theGovernment of India, which is principally -concerned dhiHyugh  theoperations of the Burmah Company,   That company holds a special position as a producer in India and foreign participation inthe Burma fields has been rigorously prohibited.  While theattitude of the&apos; Indian Government is very important, it doe3not appear to be neoessarily a determining factor in theconsideration of the proposals.  It is understood that, ifH.M.Government agreed to the Anglo-Persian Company joining the proposed amalgamation, the Government of India would be unlikely to object to the Burmah Oil Company doing so, with proper mafeguards for the development  of  Indian petroleumresources and maintenance of  the  present  favourable positionof the Indian consumer,12,   Scottish Shale Mines.          The Scottish shale industry has been carried on bythe Anglo-Persian Company at a heavy loss.  It is doubtfulwhether a company, actuated merely by pecuniary considerations,would carry on this industry.  In the event of an amalgamation,it will probably be necessary to get the combine to agree tocontinue    to work these mines.13.   We should next consider what would be the result of prohibition of the amalgamation and in particular whether inthat event there would be any risk of rapprochement betweenthe Royal Dutch-Shell group and the Standard to the disadvantage of the Anglo-Persian in particular and British interests ingeneral.           It has rather been assumed in the past that unlessthe Royal Dutch Company come into a British -combine, the
Angle-Persian Company would remain In Isolation in competition with both the Royal Dutch-Shell group andthe Standard.  In fact, I de not think that this wouldbe the result,as I am confident that the Anglo-Persianwill enter into closer relations with the Standard.  TheStandard needs oil;  the Anglo-Persian will have anabundance of oil and will need purchasers.  The parties are, in fact, already in close touch and negotiations for collaboration en a large scale may develop rapidly.Arrangements with the Standard will,In my opinion,besound and inevitable business and will, I think, be goodpolicy as well.  Such an association would automaticallyreduce the likelihood of an alliance to our disadvantagebetween the Royal Dutch-Shell and the Standard.14.   It is  ,however, desirable to consider what would bethe prospects, assuming that the Anglo-Persian Company failedor declined to enter into associations with the Standard, or that these associations were for any reason interrupted.There has hitherto been considerable jealousy and competition between the-Royal Dutch-Shell group and the Standard in many parts of the world.  While the Royal Dutch-Shell has been particularly successful In its producing eperations, theStandard has constructed an unrivalled selling organisation.Fusion does not appear Immediately probably.le, but conditionsmight easily change, and if the commercial attractions ofco-operation become sufficiently strong to outweigh oilrivalries, it might come about quickly.  Should the RoyalDutch-Shell group decide to transfer its operations fromthis country,, it would be anxious to establish friendly relations with another first-class power and as it hasImmense interests in the United States and Mexico,                        i A
Jin Amerloan alliance might well seem sound policy.  Itis always dangerous to prophesy, especially in business,  wherethe keener the rivalry IN greater the incentive to an association;  ^wit on the whole I think that, so long as SirHenri Deterding is 1n active control, he would oppose suchan alliance.  If he retired, the danger would be real andconstant.  A close combination of interests between theRoyal Dutch-Shell and the Standard would,apart from itsother consequences, mean for the Anglo-Persian Company an opposition which it would have great difficulty in meeting.Such a combination, with a strongly entrenched position in practically every -market in the world, could attach theAnglo-Persian in the particular spheres in which the latter was operating, and could force it to trade on disadvantageousterms, while prices were fully maintained in the markets whichit did not4share.15.   The Burmah and Anglo-Persian Companies are undoubtedlymost prosperous and they are operating fields of provedproductivity, but on the sound business prinoiple ofapreading risks and operating on the widest possible basis,their interests ought to be geographically more extensive.That the Anglo-Persian Company&apos;s directors recognise thisis shown by the fact that,during the last few years,theyhave been endeavouring to secure rights or have beenprospeoting in Hungary, Haoedonia, Albania, Borneo, Arabia,Timor, Canada, Honduras, Bolivia, Venezuela, Mexico, theArgentine and elsewhere *  tti none of these countries has acommercial production yet been obtained, and in the case of only two or three can there be said to be as yet definitehopes of success.  The aggregate cost of these expeditionsand researches is very great and they are being financed by a company whose whole revenue is at present derived from
an area of a few square miles In Persia,  Any Interruption,either from natural causes or through hostile action,of theoutput of this small field would he disastrous, and thebroadening of the basis of the companyxs producing interestsis, therefore, imperative.16.   If an amalgamation is approved either on the basis of  thesale by H.M.Government of its shares to the Burmah Company,or by the entry of the Anglo-Persian Company as a partnerin the combine, I suggest that it should be referred tothe legal advisors of the Government to frame the safeguards for maintaining the permanence of effective British control.The following conditions should be considered among others(a) There should be no new amalgamations which would result  in   any diminution of British control in any branch of the   business of the oombine without the definite approval of   H.M.Government.                                    *(b) The British majority holding in the various subsidiaries   should be fixed and unalterable.(c) The permanent British character of the Shell, Anglo-Persian   and Burmah Companies should be secured by means of voting   trusts and there should be a majority cf British directors   on the boards of each Company and of all their British-   registered subsidiaries.(d) The requirements of the Admiralty and other Sighting   Services should be safeguarded.(e) There should be a binding provision that companies now   registered in Great Britain should not be transferred to any   other country.  The basis of the amalgamation is to stabilise   the position as it exists at the date of the union.17.   As the future dispositions of the companies will bevitally and immediately affected, It is essential that
an early decision should be taken.                i18.   If the decision is favoirrablc,  I suggest that Itshould not be published until after all the proceedingsof tho V/ashington Conference are completed, as it wouldgive rise to a long controversy which might jeopardise thesuccess of the various other o^questions.   It may even bedesirable that it should not be communicated to,the headsof the companies, though I do not press for this.   It could be explained to them that any publication of theprovisional approval might well give rise to a situationin which H.M, Government would find it difficult, if not impossible, to carry out its intention.

                       APPENDIX  I *Constitution of Royal Dutch-Shell ^roup and proposed basis of             formation of new amalgamated group.          The Royal Dutch-Shell group consists of two parentholding companies, the Royal Dutch Company registered in holland, and the-Shell Transport and Trading Company registered in England.  The virtual control of the latter company is atpresent vested in the Samuel family.  The group, which was formed in 1907, has two main subsidiaries, the BataafschePetroleum Uaatsohapplj, and the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum C-rnipony,and there are innumerable smaller companies.  In all the enterprises of the group the same proportion of shareholding -60 per cent. Royal Dutch and 40 per cent. Shell - is maintained,so that the control of the group and of all its subsidiariesis at present definitely Dutch.

Burmah Company, are at present tentative only (the actualmarket values have since fallen considerably though theproportion is not appreciably affected) and do not in any wayprejudice the right of His Majesty&apos;s Government to claim ahigher value than  4 for its Anglo-Persian shares.  Tho RoyalDutch and Shell holdings should also be cut down in Virtue ofthe exclusion of the undertakings in Dutch colonies from theagreement.  These are, however, details which have not beendiscussed pending consideration of the principle of the scheme,which is based on a valuation being agreed which will give adefinite British majority.          The three members of the new group would becomeparticipants in all the enterprises which they at presentcontrol, and the profits would be shares in the proportioncorresponding to the agreed ratio on which the amalgamationis based.           The  permanence of British control would be secured by special provisions in the Articles of Associationj by specialvoting shares or in whatever way the legal advisors of theparties agree is the most effective method of making theBritish control permanent and irrevocable.
                       APPENDIX,  IIEffect of exclusion of Royal Dutch-Shell concerns operating                     In Dutch territory.          It has always &quot;been recognised that any scheme for bringing the Royal Dutch-Shell group un.der British controlmust omit oompanle3 operating in Dutch possessions.  Even ifthe Dutch shareholders were to allow such a change, the dutch government would almost certainly refuse consent and, If such astep were taken without its knowledge, it might annul thegroup8a concessions.   The Dutah East Indies fields were thefirst to be operated by ths group and are still ita most valuable source of supply, the oil being of high grade.  Thsoutput In this region ia about 2,300,000 tons out of &amp; total production by the group of about 10 million tons.  While this seems an important proportion, It has to be borne in mind thatexcept for supplies to the Dutch Government, Dutch shipping lines and other local consumers, the whole of this oil wouldbe handled and distributed by other companies of the group which would become British controlled,  A largo proportionof the oil, therefore, though produced on Dutch territory(and for this reason tho producing operations cannot bebrought under real British control by any manipulation of companies) would come under British control as soon as itwas shippedo

Besides these Imperial advantages the attractionto the Burnishn.011^ Co.i Ltd. of such an arrangement - assumingsatisfactory terms being securable - is that it broadens thewhole basis of their business and of their security in thatit gives them an interest in world wide Oil Fields andmarkets in place of their dependence en ths Oilfields of burma, India and Persia whoasgeographical position practicallyif not entirely, limits their marketing powers to ths Eastand, in a war of rates, largely isolates them there while their aggressors are compensating themselves in other partsof the world for the cost of their attacks In the Sast.   (h)  In one of  ths ways suggested below, the Government,        while not  only securing but actually strengthening        the objects they had In view when they made their        investment in the Anglo-Persian $il Co, Ltd,,        would rid  themselves from tho diplomatic and ether        complications - whether real or imaginary it Is not        tho business of this Memorandum to decide, but in        any case vocal -  which have arisen and will centime                                                as a
              as a consequence of their direct financial interest             in and,  a fortiori, natural special.sympathy with a             particular oil group, viz;- the Anglo-Persian Oil Co.Ltd.)(2)   The Combination now being considered has been previously     examined by Government and in principle had the support of     the Board of Trade but was altlmately not proceedei with     largely because, as then presented, it gave merely a pater     control to British interests owing to the fact that the     purely  British  assets to b9 combined had a lower value,     than the Dutch  assets. (3)  In any  case, so setisfied are those who control the Burmah     Interests of the great advantages which their combination     with the Rcyal  Dutch-Shell would yield to their  Share     holders both in financial results and in actual oil security     through the resulting broadening of the basis of their     operations that the Burmah Company on this occasion Intend  -     actively and on their own behalf (which they did net do     on the  last occasion) - pursuing conversations in this     direction both  with the Royal Dutch-Shell and the Imperial     and Indian Governments to the point where, If not com-     plated, the proposition may be turned down either because     of terms or of  Governmental; veto or of both. (4)  But if  in principle the Imperial Government are prepared     to contemplate, and /or in any case not v*to such an     arrangement it  Is desirable, if at all possible, that     suvh a  combination should take the wider scope necessary to     secure  to British interests not merely a paper control     but an  actual financial preponderating British.share majority                                                            (5)

Merely, thorefore, for purposes of   Illustration it Is assumed here that the combination of   the Burmah with the Royal Dutch-Shell might not be   securable  on a more favourable basis than  65/8 per issued   Burmah Ordinary Share and  5g per issued Shell Ordinary Share.   On  this basis the following would be the position, vi?,t:-     5,143,500        1/- Burmah Ordinary x  65/8 -   &amp; 34,075,687   19,521,296         &quot;  Shell     &quot;     x  5i   .    106,267,128   Royal Dutch * 50% (i.e. 6Q$/40$ in present          Royal Dutch-Shall combine) more than          Shell. s*                                t.    159,400.692                                                       iiHtffenblt- .,r.&apos; i&apos;J.o*   Wclt-niu) ilr*    Total  Combination -                    ** IQOff..      299,743,507    *  *  Burmah 8  11*37%        Shell  ss  55.45a             Total British -                 46.82;&apos;    *  ,       Royal Dutch   -               ......iirS3.18j                                           . 1.00/t(6)  It will thus be seen that a combination with the Burmah    alone  would I*ave ths Dutch interests with an actual share    majority over  the British interests of over 6$ and British    control could  be secured only on paper in some such manner    as was not, at least generally, considered sufficient when    the  proposition was previously oxamined.(7)  But, if the Government&apos;s holding In the Anglo-Persian Oil    Ci., Ltd., were brought into the combine either                                                        (&amp;)

For instance, all the parties involved fully        appreciate that Government have the interests of oil        Consumers also to consider and that ostensible, however        Invalid, objections on the score of suggested monopolies        may have to be carefully weighed in any decision arrived        at.  Actually there would be ne monopoly; because apart        from other Independent orgainsations the Standard would        always remain as a powerful competitor. But on this        point - and the possibility of safeguards for tho consumer-        It is not considered  Impossible for the parties concerned        to formulate effective and reasonable proposals and they        would,therefnre, like to bo consulted if and when it may        threaten to be  a difficulty with Government In coming  to        n  decision.(10)     The more restricted combination of the  Shell-Max and        British Petroleum U.K. distributing companies which was        touched upon at the Conference on 27,7,1921 would  auto-        matloally result from the larger scheme  and is therefore        not meantime discussed here separately.

                    APPENDIX . IVNote on proposals tentatively put forward by the Admiralty       with regard to additional supplies from the new       group If the amalgamation scheme is approved.          The Admiralty considers that its position as regardsrequirements of fuel oil outside its contracts with theAnglo-Persian and Burmah Companies would be met by a perpetualcontract for 250,000 tone per annum with the option, ^n givingdue notice, of talcing loss than this quantity or of increasingit to 400,000 tons.  The price to approximate to 20s/- per ton,the net price payable under the contract with the Anglo-PersianCompany (30s/- less a maximum of 10s/- rebate from surplusproducts).   The oil to be supplied from sources of supplyapproved by the Admiralty and minimum stocks to be maintained at each loading port and also at specified bunkering ports.On the other hand, the Admiralty would accept oil of equallysatisfactory quality from other producing fields in partsatisfaction of the Anglo-Porsian Company&apos;s contract.          These conditions are very stringent, fixing as theydo a very low price (about one-third of the present market price for oil of this grade) with a very wide option to theAdmiralty as to the amount of oil it will draw.  It is notanticipated that the new group vould be prepared to accept these terms 7/Ithout some modification.
