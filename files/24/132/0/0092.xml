February  1922.SECRET.G.R C.  (D.D.) 4.                               APPENDIX I.MEMORANDUM BY ADMIRALTY CN REPORT OF GEDDES COMMITTEE                      ON NAVY ESTIMATES. 1922-23.             ADMIRALTY PROPOSALS FOR REDUCTION OF EXPENDITURE.     THE Admiralty fully realise the need for  the  most stringent economy in thepresent condition of the national  finances, and  have considered very carefully the interim Report of the Committee on National Expenditure,  with the earnest desireto adopt every recommendation for economy which may be practicable, and to effectsuch other economies as may be consequent on, or consistent with,  the policy of theGovernment in respect to our standard of  naval security.     They are, however, bound to state, at  the outset, that a very large part of theconclusions of the Committee appear to have been based on a misconception of thecharacter and requirements of our Naval organisation, and of the  effect upon thoserequirements of our experience in the late war,  so complete as greatly to diminishtheir value as the basis of practical suggestions for economy.  The Admiralty are equally bound to  draw attention to  the  fact  that whereas the  Interim Reportrecommends a reduction in the Navy  Estimates additional to the substantial reduc-tions decided upon  by  the Admiralty in the summer, and irrespective of  reductionsmade possible by the Washington Conference of 21 millions,  the detailed suggestionscontained in the Report itself, including alike those which are practicable and thosewhich are based  on  misunderstanding,  could  only account for  a  reduction  of14 millions, leaving the further 7 millions entirely &quot; in the air.&quot;  It  is submitted thatsuch a procedure hardly constitutes a very helpful contribution to  the efforts of theAdmiralty to secure practical economies.     2. The field for possible  economies is to be found partly in the actual organisa-tion and  administration of  the Naval Service,  which  has  been the  main subject matter of the Interim Report, but still more in the domain of  policy.  In thisconnection the Admiralty think it only right to insist that they cannot  accept theview expressed by the Committee on p. 4 of the Interim Report that the time hascome when the Government must say to the Fighting Departments how much moneythey can have, and look to them to frame their proposals accordingly.  The  Admiraltysuggest that  such  a  procedure  would throw  an  unprecedented and improperresponsibility upon them.  It is for  the  Government to lay  down  the policy whichis to govern the provision of Naval and Military power for the defence of the Empire.The duty of the Admiralty is to give effect to the Naval policy of  the Government,and to produce estimates for  doing so as economically as possible.  It is then for theGovernment to decide whether the policy is too costly to carry out or not, and if itis too costly to decide upon an alternative policy.                 PART I. ECONOMIES CONSEQUENT ON POLICY.     3. The policy laid down  by the Government  for  the guidance of the admiralty was, before the war, the maintenance of a 60 per cent, superiority in Capital Shipsover the  next  strongest  Naval Power, viz., Germany, and that  standard  Avasinterpreted in the light of the ever  present possibility of war.  Since the  war theGovernment has defined its  policy  to the Admiralty as the maintenance of  the&quot; One-Power  Standard &quot; to be interpreted in accordance with the conclusion that no great war was reasonably to be anticipated until after 1929.  It is on the lines of thisdecision, which involved the  acceptance of temporary insecurity in many respects,more particularly in the long delay  in beginning the construction of post-JutlandCapital Ships to match those of the  United States of America and Japan, that theAdmiralty have framed their estimates.   A  comparison of the Sketch Estimateprepared last summer with the Estimates for 1914-15 will  show how far-reaching       [7720]                                                          B
 has been the reduction both in naval strength and also in expenditure, when allowance has  been made for the  altered value of  money, as expressed in the form of higher pay, and costs of materials and supplies  of all&apos; kinds (see Statement III).  It may be worth noting that the percentage of naval expenditure to total  national expenditure (omitting  debt  charges and  pensions)  fell  from 27-75 per  cent, in  1914-15 to 12 per cent, in 1921-22.     4.  On p. 6 (paragraph 4) it is  suggested by the&apos;Committee that the Estimates provided that in the year 1923 with a broken and exhausted  Europe and  with no German menace, we woe to have far greater fighting power, with a larger personnel and  greater preparations  for  war, than  ever  before  in our  history.   This is emphatically not true of the Navy, whether the test taken is the size of the Fighting Fleet, or the number of men, or any other reasonable test of what constitutes  fighting power.   That certain weapons have been improved in efficiency beyond what  was the case before the  war  is of course obvious, but this advance applies to our  possible enemies as well as to ourselves, and we are not placed in any better position relatively to other Powers by  this  inevitable progress.  On the other hand the  relative strength of certain other Powers was being increased to a most formidable extent by the rapid construction of large numbers of vessels embodying all the experiences of the war, and  capable of entirely outclassing  anything  we could put into line against them. including the only  partially post-Jutland &quot;Hood.&quot;     5.  It is necessary to make it clear that if the  naval and international situation had  continued to develop as it developed during  the years  1918-21 the admiralty could not have recommended any further  material reduction in the Sketch Estimates for 1922-23, and would have been obliged to face the provision of considerably increasedestimates in subsequent years, unless the Government had definitely decided to abandon the &quot; One-Power Standard.&quot;  If  the Washington Conference were now to breakdown, or the agreements arrived at should fail to be ratified by the Powers concerned,the situation would inevitably he more serious than if the Conference had never been held, and would demand the acceptance of correspondingly  increased sacrifices or risks by the Government.    6. On  the  assumption,  however, that the  agreements provisionally  secured atWashington will be ratified, the Admiralty have re-examined the whole of their estimates with  a view to securing the largest  possible reductions warranted by the improved international situation and by  the definite fixing of the standard of naval strength as measured in Capital Ships.  But  it is their duty to point out, that theacceptance  by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the Washington proposals involves theincurring of risks to our  security at sea which, though mitigated  by many of theprovisions  to  which  our  representatives  have  secured agreement,  still   remain tremendous.  In particular the acceptance of the ten years&apos;  holiday in construction and of  the limitation of the size of  Capital Ships, which the Admiralty have been forced to accept,  implies a break in the  continuity of our naval development, fromthe point of view alike of construction and of naval tactics and training, so  serious as to place  in uncertainty the whole future basis of  our sea power. :   7. These risks are, no doubt, worth incurring for the sake of great national  and Imperial ends.  But the Admiralty,  in complying; with their instructions, are boundto take care that these risks should  be   reduced to a reasonable  minimum  by  an organisation which will secure  for  our  artifically restricted battle fleet the most efficient personnel and material that training and  research can supply, an adequate provision of the varied new auxiliary instruments  and services which experience has proved  to  be so necessary,  and  carefully thought out  measures  for the inevitable expansion  Avhich will be required in the event of  Avar.  The standard aimed at in these respects  has, however, not  been full  and complete  preparation   for  the probability of Avar, but  the maintenance  of efficiency in essentials through the yearsof peace.                        Economies in New Construction.     The first and most substantial economy consequent on the Washington proposals will  arise out of the countermanding of  the four  new Battle Cruisers to have been laid down  in the present financial year.  In the Sketch Estimates   10,557,800  Avas assigned to these vessels under  Vote 8,  while another   1,259,000  Avas included in Vote 9  for guns and mountings.  It was also expressly mentioned that the progress on these four ships during 1922-23 might inA^olve  payment of a further   1,000,000, and  there was also  the probability of further Capital Ships having to be laid downin that year.  Only t\vo vessels  of considerably over tonnage are  UOAV  to be built.These will  not only cost less apiece,  but  in view of the  necessity for modifying  and
 redrawing the designs, actual work upon them is not likely to  be begun  for another nine months, so that the total expenditure upon them in the next financial year can be  reduced to  1,006,500  under Vote  8 and  421,5.00  under Vote  9.   The  total saving accruing under this heading in the Sketch  Estimates will amount to at least   10,000,000.     8.  It  lias been suggested that the construction of one  or both of these two new Capital  Ships should  be deferred in  order to secure a still further economy in the next financial year.  The  Admiralty are of opinion that to do so would involve an unjustifiable measure  of risk.   They  would point out that at  the close of 1922 the United States will have ten Battleships of over 30,000 tons, three of which will be of post-Jutland  design, Japan will have  six  over 30,000  tons, of which two will be post-Jutland, while we shall only have  one vessel,  the &quot; Hood.&quot; of over 30,000 tons, and partially redesigned after  the experience of  the Jutland battle.  Even if the present programme of construction is maintained, our two new Battleships cannot be  completed  until the end of 1925.  A still further prolongation  of the period of inferiority could only  be justified, if at all, by very large financial savings.     9. Such savings could not, in fact, be secured.   Compensation will,  in  any case,  have to  be given to at least two of the firms who  were allotted the contracts for the original four ships, but it is hoped to avoid this in the  case of the other two firms by assigning to them  the two new  ships.   It is also  hoped that if two ships are built, the  present orders for  armour, guns and mountings can be  reduced  without serious rise in cost and still spread over the firms to which they have been assigned, thus keeping  up their experience and  avoiding any necessity  for  compensation or subsidy.   With  one ship  this would be  impossible, and increased cost, as well as weakening of  national productive capacity, would be  the consequence.  Without being  in  a position to give exact figures on matters which would have to be the subject of bargaining, the Admiralty do not believe that the savings to be secured by  delay  would make up  for the losses clue to additional  compensation and more costly contracts.  There is  also the consideration, from the point of view  of national, as  apart from Admiralty finance,  that, in the present industrial situation, the men not employed upon these vessels will, in the absence of  productive work, still be a charge upon the tax or ratepayer as recipients of relief of one kind or another.     10. As regards the other  items of new construction, the Admiralty  do not consider, in view of the decisions of the Washington Conference and the great and growing importance of Submarine and Mining warfare,  that they  can afford not to  continue the  work  on  the new  experimental Submarine  and Minelayer now building. Scrapping of  Existing Vessels.                                                 .-     11.  Apart from their effect upon new construction, the Washington proposals will involve the immediate  scrapping  of three Battleships of the &quot; Orion  &quot; class and the &quot;Erin,&quot;  two &quot;Lions&quot;  and the  &quot;New Zealand&quot;  and the further scrapping, upon the completion of the two  new Battleships, of  three &quot; King George V&apos;s &quot;  and &quot; Thunderer.&quot;  The effect  of these measures will be to reduce in 1922-23 our peace and war requirements in men by 2,746 and 4,822 respectively.  There can obviously be  no question  of reducing ships  to  the  sale list,  as  suggested on p. 9  of the Interim Report, other than those agreed upon to be scrapped at the Washington Conference, whose definite  and impartial conclusions may fairly be  assumed to have superseded the tentative suggestions of  the  Committee on this subject. Reduction of Capital Ships to Reserve.    12. In regard  to  the  Committee&apos;s  suggested reduction of Capital  Ships  with full complement to reserve,  the only step in this direction that the Admiralty consider possible to take is to place IT.M.S. &quot;  Renown &quot;  in reserve on the conclusion of her present cruise.   The  Atlantic Fleet  will then consist of one  Fleet  Flagship, two divisions  of Battleships, each composed of four  ships,  and two Battle Cruisers. Any reduction in these numbers would entirely upset  the tactical  efficiency of the Fleet, thus rendering  Fleet  exercises of little value.    The Mediterranean fully- commissioned  Fleet consists of four Battleships, every unit of  which is  continually employed.  Here, again, a reduction would preclude all chance of real  Fleet training.But apart  from the question of tactical efficiency, the Admiralty are convinced thatthe  number of Capital Ships in commission  is the minimum necessary for  thetraining  of personnel.   War may be  unlikely for many  years to  come, but  the      [7720]                    &quot;                                    R 2
younger Officers of to-day are the Captains and Admirals of the future, and, even under existing conditions, these Officers have less opportunity of gaining experience in Fleets at sea than could be desired.Light Cruisers.     13. The number  of Light Cruisers attached to the Atlantic  Fleet is  based  onthe  tactical  requirements which  war  experience  showed to  be  necessary.   TheseCruisers are also  required  for showing the  Flag,  and for  political  cruises in theBaltic and Northern  and  Western European Waters and Atlantic Islands, and are constantly  being detached from the Fleet for  long periods.  For this reason, and owing to the incidents of refits, it has frequently happened during the last two yearsthat only three or four out of the  ten Light  Cruisers of  the  1st and 2nd  light cruiser Squadron  have been present with the Fleet when the latter is carrying outimportant  exercises.   The Admiralty  cannot,  therefore,  recommend  any reductionin the number of Light Cruisers attached to  the Atlantic Fleet.Light Cruisers Abroad.     14. These vessels are  required to carry out  a variety of duties in peace.  Apartfrom the general stimulus which their presence  gives to British prestige and british trade in foreign countries,  their  services are frequently  requested by  the  ForeignOffice or Colonial Office for the direct protection of British interests or maintenanceof order.     From the naval point of view these squadrons  are  well  placed to take up their war  stations, and  afford invaluable opportunities  to Officers and  men of becomingacquainted with the water.which, at some future date, may be the principal theatre of naval operations.   In any case, it is difficult, with the number  of  ships  in commission  at present, to give adequate seagoing training to Officers  and men, andany further reduction in these vessels would be  most harmful to the efficiency of theFleet.    The only  reduction in the number  of Light Cruisers  abroad which  theAdmiralty  can see their way to effect is to reduce the Light Cruiser strength of the african Squadron to two  ships  by keeping  1T.M.S.  &quot;Birmingham&quot;  in reserveat home.Destroyers.     15. The tactical  necessity for large numbers of Destroyers  is as  great as ever.and the present number in full commission cannot be called by any means excessive,bearing in  mind the  important part Destroyers play in all modern  Fleet  exercises(e.g.,  anti-Submarine  exercises, C.M.B. and Torpedo Plane attacks, &amp;c),  and thatDestroyer work is the best possible general training for  Officers  and men.   It iswell worth  noting  that the number of Destroyers we maintain in commission is verymoderate as compared with the United States.   In view,  however,  of the urgent need for retrenchment, the Admiralty  are prepared to  recommend the reduction ofone flotilla  (probably  the 6th) to two-fifths complement (with the addition  of  a fewspecial  ratings), thus reducing the total number of Destroyers  in full complementwith the Atlantic  Fleet to forty.     16. It  has not been found possible to reduce the number of Destroyers in fullcomplement with  the Mediterranean Fleet.  But  in view of the general politicalsituation, the Admiralty consider that they can.  without undue risk, reduce  to reserve  twenty-three  Destroyers of the Local Defence  Flotillas,  now on a reducedcomplement.Submarines.     17. It  is proposed  to reduce the number of Submarines  by  abolishing  the&quot;Material  Reserve&quot; of  27 older Submarines, and to reduce *the number in fullcommission by 6 (on China station).Other Types of Vessels&apos;.     18. As  regards  other  craft,  the Admiralty  are prepared to  make certainreductions,  but must  emphasise the necessity of a sufficient  minimum remaining  oncommission &apos;to  complete tactical  formations, fulfil peace requirements and  affordnecessary sea-going training to personnel.  The relative  increase in the number ofthese vessels, as  included under  Group  2  (p. 11 of Interim  Report),  has been criticised by the Committee, but  it is suggested that criticism based  on elementaryrule of  three principles is not really very helpful.   A  reduction of 37 per cent, in
the main sea-going Fleet does not, in fact, enable  a corresponding reduction to bemade, for instance, in the number of  Gunboats  patrolling the rivers of China.Again, in regard to Sloops, it has been  found possible, in the interests of economy in fuel and personnel, to substitute  for various  purposes  Sloops carrying  about100 men and costing about  5,800 per annum for fuel and stores for Light Cruiserscarrying about 400 men and costing about  34,000 per annum  for fuel and stores,and  to use Sloops instead of Battleships to tow targets.  Similarly, Trawlers havebeen  substituted for Gunboats  on Fishery  Protection  and other duties solely onaccount  of the economy thereby effected.  It is no more  reasonable to assume thatsuch  a rearrangement  is an evidence of extravagance  because the  proportion ofSloops, &amp;c.,  to  Cruisers has increased than it would be to infer extravagance fromthe reduction of a domestic establishment of  five Rolls-Royce&apos;s and five Ford cars toone of two Rolls-Royce&quot;s and three Ford cars on the ground  that there had been a-50 per cent,  increase in the proportion of purely ancillary vehicles.     19.  There has undoubtedly been a very  considerable  increase in Minesweepers,due to the experience of the war.  But it is worth pointing out that out of a total ofsixty-one only seven are in full  commission and forty-six are in charge of care  andmaintenance  parties.   Many of them were only delivered after the Armistice  andhave never been used.  There is no market  for them, and they will  be as vahrableten years hence as  now for either mine-sweeping or anti-submarine purposes.   Thesmall  number of men  looking after these vessels or assigned to them as  the  active service nucleus of their  crews on  mobilisation is, it  is suggested, by no  meansuneconomically  employed in view  of the great importance of  their duties in war.     19A. In  Statement IT will be found Comparative  Tables  showing Fleets  and Personnel of the  three Principal Naval  Powers,  (A)  prior  to the washington conference,  and (B) after the Washington Conference, and taking into account the reductions accepted by  the Admiralty  in  this Memorandum.   In view  of   the criticisms levelled against the Admiralty  of employing man-power lavishly onAuxiliary Services and  in Shore Establishments,  attention is called to the  factbrought out  by these  tables that  even  on  the basis of  the  July Sketch Estimate (i.e., prior to the Washington Conference) a larger proportion of our personnel is employed in Fighting Ships, and a smaller proportion on so-called Auxiliary Servicesand in Shore Establishments, than is the case in either of the  other great Navies.     The comparison is :                                        -	Great Britain. (July Sketch Estimate).	U.S.A.

Total       ...       ...    98,500    It must not be forgotten, moreover, that neither  the United States of Americanor Japan have,  as  we  have,  to  provide amongst  &quot; Other Services&quot; for somethousands of men  for crossing reliefs for  ships on Foreign Stations.Reduction of Complements.    20. While unable to reduce the active battle and training fleet or its auxiliary services beyond the point indicated, the Admiralty have come to the conclusion thatthe improved international situation will now make it possible to reduce, in peace,the complements of the ships of the Atlantic Fleet below the increased establishmentlaid down as the result of  war experience.    21. Similar reductions are not possible in the Mediterranean Fleet, whose ships are already on a reduced complement, and are difficult for outlying squadrons where
a certain percentage of the men are always at any time sick.  The whole question of-complements  is  being scrutinised in order  to  reduce  them to  the lowest  figure-compatible with reasonable efficiency, and it is hoped in this way to make a totalfurther reduction of  3,800  men  on Vote A.   It may, perhaps, be worth  whilepointing out that this economy, in so far as  it involves a decrease in  the proportionof men with the main vessels of the Fleet as compared with men in other categories,would,  on the  principles of  the Interim Report&apos;s criticisms  on the  Admiraltymanning  arrangements,  lay  the Admiralty open  to  the charge of  yet  furtherextravagance in those categories.Research and Training.    22. Of all  the  lessons of  the  war, none  stood  out more clearly - than  theimportance of scientific research.  Even the most trifling additional expenditure on research and experiment on such a comparatively well-known subject as the construc-tion of shells might have made the Battle of Jutland an immediate and annihilatingvictory.  A little more thought and expenditure in peace on mines might have saved.tens of millions.  The anti-submarine war  brought home to us  the possibly vitalimportance of even more recondite and unforeseen investigations. The admiralty would have been guilty of criminal incompetence if they had not taken measures tcgive effect to the lessons of the war in this respect.  They claim that the measureswhich they have taken the development of  the various Signal,  Mining, Gas  and.Anti-Submarine Schools (see Statement  IV), and of the Department of scientific research, with the laboratories at Teddington, West Drayton and Greenwich havebeen sufficient, but certainly not  more  than sufficient, to  establish research  andexperiment on a sound and at the same time moderate and economical basis.    23. The Interim Report, it is true, suggests that the expenditure on scientific research (Vote 6) can be reduced by one-half, viz.,  from  400,000 to  200,000, onthe ground that even  this reduced amount is four times the provision made beforethe war.  The Admiralty  cannot accept this suggestion,  which not only ignores thefact that the Vote now includes many important items formerly included under otherVotes (see Statement V), but also  entirely disregards the lessons of the war..    24. Apart from the creation of special new schools, there have been temporarilyincreased requirements for training in shore establishments owing to the necessityof overtaking arrears of training of Officers and men which had to be deferred  owingto the exigencies of war service.  Some delay in overtaking these arrears was created by the coal strike last summer, when the  whole of the training had to be  shut down for three  months to enable Officers and men to  be formed into  special provisionalbattalions for  maintaining order.  The numbers required at Queenstown  have also,for obvious reasons,  soon, it  is hoped, to disappear, been higher than they  wouldhave been under normal conditions.   The Admiralty can now see their way to order the Torpedo School at the Nore and the  Signal Schools  at Devonport and the Noreto be closed, to  reduce one of the Mechanical Training Establishments during theyear, and to make various other  reductions  in Harbour Establishments which  will reduce Vote A. materially.  The final figures are dealt with in paragraph 55,  seq.    25. With these  reductions^ the training establishments will be clown to the lowest level compatible with the efficient training of the Navy for modern  war.  TheAdmiralty feel bound once more to insist that arrangements in this respect must be governed  by actual requirements, though kept within the most economical limits,and cannot be  based on any imaginary fixed  proportion as  between  training establishments and Battleships.Training  on Mobilisation.     26. Before  the war it was  generally assumed that the Naval struggle before us would  be  of short duration or would, at  any rate, not call for a continuous further expansion of the Navy after mobilisation.  The policy, therefore, was to  reckon thewhole staff of the training establishments as available for mobilisation  and to ceasetraining altogether on the outbreak of war.  Experience proved the grave disadvan-tage of this policy, and showed  that for the Navy, as well as  for  the  Army, theneeds of expansion and the unforeseen emergence of new methods and instruments of warfare made training no less important a factor after mobilisation than in  peace.If  this is true  of a  war in narrow waters for which we  had  made unrestricted:preparation, it  will be still  more true of an oceanic war,  upon  which, both sides;will enter with  artificially limited fleets but  with great unused resources.
&apos;.  - 27. The policy of keeping open the training establishments on the outbreak ofwar undoubtedly involves a larger provision of men on mobilisation and might involve(although  this does not necessarily  follow)  some increase in Vote A in peace.   TheAdmiralty do not consider that they would be justified in reversing  a decision takenupon such strong grounds of war experience.   But, in view of the  urgent need for economy and of the general improvement in international relations  results from theWashington  Conference, they have decided, as a temporary measure, to base  theirmobilisation  arrangements on the immediate release, for  active service from  these establishments of all except the most essential skilled staff.  Even these, it should be pointed out.  can be replaced  gradually, as  war goes on, by Officers and men not fit for active service.  By this means it will be possible to release 4,000 men. i.e., about40 per cent, of the fixed complements of the training establishments on mobilisation,and as explained later, in paragraph  55B, the retention of the 1,500 &quot;Key&quot; menwho  will  remain  in  the schools  as  a nucleus on mobilisation  does  not involve any increase on Vote A.The Coastguard.    28-. The Committee&apos;s comments upon the  change of  policy in regard to theCoastguard convey an entirely  wrong impression  of the facts.  The Coastguardbefore the war was  an active service force mainly employed on non-Naval  duties,and  on mobilisation one-third  of  its numbers were  withdrawn for  the Fleet.It therefore  not only absorbed active service men upon  non-Naval duties to a verylarge extent in peace, and to a lesser but still serious extent in war,  but on mobilisa-tion  the  performance  of  its non-Naval duties was interfered with  owing to thewithdrawal of much of the experienced personnel,  ft was decided to diminish  thesedisadvantages by organising the  Coastguard as a Pensioner Force, so  that it shouldneither absorb active service men  in  peace  nor have its efficiency lessened on theoutbreak of war.    29. But the  fact remains, which evidently impressed the  Committee, that theCoastguard can no longer be considered a Naval requirement. All that  the Admiraltyrequire in peace are complements for certain W/T and Signal Stations amounting to&apos;345 Officers and  men (pensioners).   All that the Admiralty would require  in war would  be  an  expansion of this number  for additional stations, and also an orgahisa-tion, such as was extemporised during the last war. for coast-watching,  &amp;c.  these numbers and duties transferred, the Coastguard would become a  non-Naval  forceperforming important but non-Naval -duties for the Board of  Trade  and Customs,and the expenses and numbers of the force would no longer improperly swell Vote 1and Vote  A  of the Navy Estimates. Should it be considered that a force composedof men of Naval  experience can fulfil  the  requirements of the  Board  of  Trade and customs more economically and efficiently than a force of any other character, itshould be quite practicable to retain  this and  other good  features of the  present-organisation without any longer doing the Navy the injustice of charging it with  asum of well over half a million pounds per annum which  is not spent on the service ofthe Fleet.Reduction of Commands.    30. In view  of  the reduction and definite  limitation in the number of  Capital Ships, and of the general situation, including  the hope of an  Irish settlement, theAdmiralty are prepared to abolish the appointment of Commander-in-chief, Western Approaches, as well as that of the Commander-in-chief, Coast of Scotland, the local duties of the latter being amalgamated with  those of  the Superintendent of the Dockyard.  As regards the suggestion in the Interim Report that it might be  possible for the whole Command ashore in this country to be exercised by one Commander-in- chief, it must be pointed out that the administration of a large Dockyard Port with the many establishments stationed there can only be carried out by a Commander-in-chief present on the spot. Reduction of Dockyards.    31. The closing of both Haulbowline and Pembroke Dockyards was decided upon some time ago.  The katter proposal was not approved by the Government in view of the serious hardship involved in the district, where there are no alternative industries. The Admiralty are still prepared to abolish Pembroke, and desire to make it clear that the  maintenance of this Dockyard costing even on a reduced scale  150,000 a year, can only be justified by general considerations of national economy and not by- naval requirements.
b    32. The  question of the reduction of Rosyth or  Chatham has been carefully considered.  There are certain ships which cannot be docked in the Southern Yards,and must therefore go to Rosyth.  A nucleus staff  must consequently be retainedthere, and this being the case it is in  the  interests of economy that certain refittingwork should also be undertaken at that yard.  It has, however, been decided to reducethe dockyard considerably and  it is contemplated that an annual saving of  at least 250,000 can be ultimately effected.  This saving includes not only the reduction ofdockyard staff and workmen, but the abolition of &quot; inconvenience money &apos;&apos; and expendi-ture on train  services (estimated at  90,000)  among other economies.   In additionmany new works items at present under consideration will become unnecessary.    33. The  question of the reduction of Chatham  Dockyard has also been  con-sidered, but under present conditions the small docks  at that yard  are necessary.The loss of the storehouse accommodation at Chatham, moreover, would necessitateequivalent  storage being built elsewhere.  No  considerable  saving  therefore  ispossible at present, though the scheme for making some part  of the yard availablefor commercial purposes  is  now  more  practicable   and  is  being re-examinedaccordingly.    34. It is not considered that more  than  160,000 a year would be saved by closingGibraltar.  The Board are averse from reducing this yard right down to a care andmaintenance  party,  because  its strategic position  may at  any moment  lead  tounexpected calls upon it, and if the good workmen once left,* it would be exceedingly difficult to recruit labour in an emergency. On the other hand the Admiralty agreethat Gibraltar and Malta at present are more than sufficient to  deal with the  require-ments  of  the Mediterranean  Station,  and  they  propose to make  reductions  at gibraltar and  to curtail the programme  of work at that yard with  an estimatedsaving of  58,000 a year.  It should be borne in mind that to reduce the output of adockyard  beyond a certain  point is  not  an economical proposition owing to  thedisproportionately large  cost of establishment charges which  ensue.    35. The Admiralty propose that if and when it is decided  to return the territory of Wei-hai Wei to China, the Naval Establishment shall be closed, and in the mean-time they are taking steps to reduce it as  far as possible.    36. Beyond the reduction in the number of dockyards indicated above, the effects of the Washington Conference will not be nearly as marked  upon the work of theRoyal Yards as upon the work of private contractors.  The Dockyard Programme for1922-23 may  be broadly classified  under the  four  headings of New Construction,Reconstruction, Repairs. Miscellaneous and Experimental Services.   The followingtable  shows approximately the percentage of  cost represented by  each of theseheadings in the total provision for Vote 8 I and enumerates the items of work underthe headings of New  Construction and Reconstruction &apos; 2 Frobishers  2 E.

of bulging, veannouring of decks and  shifting of  magazines,  will be necessary toreduce the vulnerability of Capital Ships which would otherwise have been replaced.The questions, however, of Dockyard numbers, of the actual efficiency of the work done in the Dockyards, and of the possibilities of further economies in this respect is dealt with in Part II of this memorandum.                                     Fuel.(i.) Reserves and Storage (Oil).     37. The Interim Report  makes no recommendations  on  the question  of  theprovision of Oil Fuel Reserves for the Fleet or for its storage on the ground that theyare  matters of  high  policy,  but  calls  attention to them  as possible fields  for thereduction of expenditure in 1922-23.     38. The present  position, it  may be recalled, is that the Admiralty s modifiedproposals in regard to Reserves of Oil Fuel were concurred in  by the Standing defence sub-Committee  of the C.I.D. on the 28th July. These proposals were limited to theprovision during the course of seven  years  of the minimum  storage and  reservenecessary for  the Singapore route.  On the  hypothesis that the Dominions would co-operate,  the  Admiralty proposals  involved an  annual  expenditure  of  about 2,000,000, but the Committee of  Imperial  Defence stated that  in the absence of theChancellor of  the Exchequer the recommendation that this sum should be allowed in1922-23  must  be subject to any criticisms  of his when the  matter came before theCabinet, since the Chancellor of the Exchequer at a previous meeting had expressed,the view that   1,500,000 could probably be found,  but on that occasion  did not go further.  The  Sketch Estimate for 1922-23  included the  2,000,000 as recommended,but in subsequent correspondence  the Treasury stipulated that the total expenditureon storage and  reserves for  1922-23 must not exceed  1,500,000, which limit theAdmiralty did not feel able at that time to accept.     The Admiralty  have now considered the  matter further in the light  of  the changed situation resulting from the proposed Pacific agreement, and are of opinionthat the postponement in the  completion of the reserve implied by the provision of 1,500,000 instead of  2,000,000 can be accepted without undue risk for next year only(see Statement VI).  They  are prepared, therefore, to make  a reduction of  500,000in the Sketch Estimate (Vote 8 IIK) on this account.     With regard to  the provision under Vote 10  for Oil Fuel Storage, the commit-ments on account of approved works already amount to  777,396, and  the  further sum of  230,000  is required to  commence essential installations on the Easternroute.    If they are not started in 1922-23, then the mobility of the Fleet will be seriously affected.   The fact that it takes at least two years to complete  storageshould be emphasised.(ii.)  Current Consumption (Coal  and Oil).     39. To contemplate any further postponement of the Oil Fuel Reserve is, in theopinion of the Admiralty, impossible, owing to the magnitude of the risks involved.Recognising, however, the urgent  need for the reduction of expenditure next year tothe utmost extent possible, they are prepared to make a saving of  180,000 on current consumption of Coal and Oil by a further reduction of the steaming days allowed tothe Atlantic and Mediterranean Fleets.    39A. It should be pointed out that the provision for expenditure,  that is, for theSteaming of the Fleet, as thus reduced, is less in steaming days than the provisionfor 1914-15, which was the lowest hitherto made.    In  1914-15 the  total  approved provision amounted  to  4,275,000, when theFleet was mainly coal-burning, and the total amount  of  fuel on an oil fuel  basisprovided that year as compared with next year on a similar basis was as follows                                                             Tons.            1914-15      ...       ...        ...       ...     1,584,000            1922-23      ...       ...        ...       ...     1,163,000               Decreased provision for fuel in  1922-23      421,000    39B. A complete overhaul of the Vote has again been made to explore any morepossible avenues where economies might be effected.    Although no further reduction in steaming  can be entertained, it is consideredthat some restrictions might be placed on the fuelling facilities of  the Fleet.   The      [7720]          &apos;                                               C
                            Total reduction      ...       ...     485,000    These reductions, with the savings due to modifications in prices and wages oflabour, will  bring the total  proposed provision for next year down to  4,753,000,as against  10,041,000 in 1921-22. and  7,075,500 in  the July Sketch Estimate.    39c. A  further cut could not be made without eliminating the small remainingreserve provision  and still further reducing steaming expenditure of the Fleet.    The following are some of the arguments against any  further reduction of the fuel provision for reserve :    . (1.)  The mobility and operational powers of the Navy depend upon an adequate          reserve of oil fuel.    (2.)  We have practically no natural sources of supply  of  oil  fuel in Great          Britain, and until sufficient stocks are built up  in this country we shall          be dependent upon the goodwill of the United States of iVmerica  in time          of emergency.    (3.)  Dependence upon the United States of America is undesirable, as it places          in the hands  of that country a  diplomatic  weapon of considerable          importance.   This weapon may operate in. peace time as well as  in war,          as illustrated by the fact that since the Armistice there have been threats          from time to time of prohibition of export from the&apos;States.    (4.)  It must not be lost sight of that there is now a strong indication of a world-          wide combine of  all oil interests, and unless the British Navy is  in such          a position as regards stocks of oil  fuel to operate  freely during such          periods of stress  as may arise,  a situation  is created by which the power          of the Government would be compromised by its  total dependence upon          the goodwill of the oil interests.    (5.)  The accepted policy has been that the reserve of oil fuel must be available          within a prescribed period.    (6.)  The most economical method of building it up is by means of regular annual          instalments.    (7.)  Largely varying annual provision would make it impossible to obtain the          most advantageous terms for purchase  and transport.    (8.)  On the basis of regular annual instalments,  the Admiralty have arranged           long-term and other contracts for oil  on  terms most favourable to the           State, and have provided tanker tonnage which enables them to transport           at a minimum cost.    The cuts which have already been accepted bring the  amount of oil fuel downto a figure below the contract commitments already made,  and therefore no further reduction is possible in this direction.   PART  II. ECONOMIES  POSSIBLE AS THE RESULT OF BETTER  ORGANISATION OR                               AD M INI S TRATJ ON .    40.  Apart from the questions of Naval and general policy raised in the Com-mittee&apos;s  Report  which  have been dealt with  in  Part I of this Memorandum, the inconvenience caused may, of course, amount to something more serious, in certaincircumstance-, but the risk must be accepted.                                                                       In  this direction, by laying up  a  number  of Royal  Fleet         Auxiliaries,  it  will be possible to  reduce expendi-         ture by        ...       ...       ...       ...       ...     285,000    Included in  the provision for  expenditure a  margin of         25.000  tons  of  Oil   Fuel  has  been  provided  for         unforeseen contingencies.    It is proposed to eliminate this  margin and take the risk         of being able to meet  any such expenditure from the         aggregate provision for the  year.    The Vote can thus be reduced by a further sum of     ...     100.000    Consequent on the saving in bunker expenditure of the         Royal  Fleet Auxiliaries proposed to be laid up and         the  abolition  of the  contingency provision, oversea         freighters  will  lie unemployed, with a  saving in         running expenditure of ...       ...       ...       ...     100,000
Committee suggest that enormous reductions should be made in the sketch Estimate,on the strength of certain criticisms and recommendations in regard to matters of organisation and  administration.    These recommendations and suggestions,  which now remain to be dealt with,have all been very carefully considered.  In many cases they are due to misconcep-tion or can be shown to be impracticable.  In the remaining cases, the Admiralty aretaking steps to effect economies along these lines.                 General Criticism of Manning  Arrangements.    41. The  Committee  makes the  formidable  charge that in the Estimates for1922-23 man power is provided for on a lavish scale, 33,009 more  Officers and men being proposed than are  actually required for Naval Service.    42. This criticism is based on a table showing only the Mobilisation allocation of the active service personnel  in 1914-15 and 1921-22 respectively.    43. The  numbers for the  Fleet,  however, have to  take into account not onlyallocation on mobilisation, but also  the numbers needed  in peace-time  to  allowOfficers and men to go through  their courses in the training-schools, ships&apos; companies to be  relieved  periodically both at home and abroad, leave to be given according tothe regulations. &amp;c, in  addition to  provision for  sickness both  in peace and on mobilisation.    44. These numbers (which are quite separate from the numbers of men formingthe peace complements of the  ships  and establishments) represent  definite require-ments that can in the main be calculated arithmetically.*  They  depend upon thenumber and length of the  Training Courses,  the  number of men  to be relieved onforeign service, &amp;c, and  have no direct relation to the numbers required on mobilisa-tion to transform the Fleet from a peace to  a war footing which latter depend upon  the  additional ships and services to be manned  on mobilisation.   Obviously,unless the number of  additional ships and services to be so manned is very great, thenumbers of men  required for  training and for the other  purposes  mentioned will tend to exceed those required  immediately for mobilisation purposes thus creating a &quot;margin &quot;  which  is needed for peace organisation  and training, but is not immediately allocated on mobilisation.    45. Although the Committee can scarcely have been unaware of this, it workedentirely on mobilisation allocation and  made no  investigation  of  the  numbers required in peace for  a Fleet of any given size to admit of training, reliefs, leave, &amp;o,and to provide for sickness, and its calculations of manning requirements cannot  beaccepted  by the  Admiralty for the  following reasons,  which are more  fully dealtwith in.the separate statement  on Manning (Statement VII) :       (i.)  The committee&apos;s  calculations start  with an  incorrect figure, viz., 122,700           instead of 121,700.      (ii.)  They make no allowance for men sick and on passage to and from foreign           stations at the moment of mobilisation an omission of some thousands.           (Actual number sick, in prison, and on passage in November last,  5,993.)    (iii.)  Although it is claimed that the calculations would provide  a &quot;margin  &quot;           of 12,841  men for  training, &amp;c, in peace, this again is an error of some           thousands, due mainly to  adding to the 8,494. men whose posts  are fixed           in war but not  in peace,  and who  are consequently  available for the           &quot; margin &quot;, 4.347 men in. Groups  II  and III, whose posts are fixed in           peace  and who  therefore cannot  be  used  for  training,  &amp;c.   Even  a           margin of 12,841 would be inadequate to enable training to be carried on,           leave  to be given, &amp;c.   (Actual numbers absorbed by training, &amp;c,           in November  last, 14,016.)     (iv.)  The Committee proposes an altogether  illogical reduction in the number           of men required for what is termed &quot;  Group II &quot; (Sea Service in ships           other than Capital Ships. Light Cruisers, Destroyers,  Submarines and           Aircraft  Carriers), apparently treating this as only  another section of           Harbour Service.   As pointed out, however, in Part I  of this Memoran-           dum,  the chief constituents of this  group are the  crews of (a) Sloops,           vessels  which for  reasons of economy  are performing  duties performed           by Cruisers and Light Cruisers  before the war; (b) Trawlers, which are           similarly  performing the duties of Gunboats;  (c) Minesweepers  and                            * For actual numbers, set below.       [7720]                                                        C 2
                              Numbers of Officers.    .46. A charge of extravagance in the  numbers of Officers borne is based by theCommittee upon     (a.) The increased ratio of Officers to men.    (b.) The actual increase  in numbers of  Officers in the Executive  and Engineer           Branches.as compared with pre-war.    47. As regards  (a), a full explanation of the  increased  ratio  is given in aseparate statement (Statement VIII). The preponderating cause is the substitution of oil fuel for coal, which has greatly reduced the number of Engine Room ratings, but does not affect the number of Engineer Officers.  In a  lesser degree, new requirementsdue to new methods, weapons and instruments,  and the development of the policy of promotion from the lower deck, have contributed to  the increased ratio.    48. As regards  (6), the  Committee  overstate by  about 300  the increase inExecutive Officers by (i) omitting the Supplementary List -Lieutenant-Commanders,Lieutenants and Sub-Lieutenants, as well as Acting Sub-Lieutenants and Mates, and(ii) overlooking that 124 Officers in 1921 are borne  for Engineering duties under theCommon Entry Scheme, as against thirty-three in 1914. The statement that a similarsurplus applies in the case of the Engineer  Officers is also an error due to not realisingthat in this Branch  Warrant Officers and Commissioned Officers must be countedtogether, since both are employed as Watchkeepers.    48A. That the war (like that of 100 years ago)  left the Navy with  a considerablenumber of Officers surplus to future requirements is no new discovery. The Admiralty        Anti-Submarine  vessels, the need for  which in larger numbers than in        1014 is tine of the clearest lessons of the war.  The proposed reduction of        37  per cent, on 1014 numbers in this group because the large ships have        been reduced in this proportion  is quite unjustifiable.  (v.) The proposed reduction of 37 per cent, on the 1914 complements of Harbour        Establishments does not allow for the fact, already dealt with in Part I,        that        iblishments, mainly in connection with Anti-Submarine and        Mining  and  Anti-Mining  work, have become  essential,  without  the        importance of the Gunnery, Torpedo  and other  pre-war1 establishments        having at all diminished.   The importance of all experimental work has        increased as  a result of the war, and must increase still further as  a        result of the  Washington agreements, and the experimental  estafolish-        ments must necessarily have larger staffs than before the war. By cutting        down services wherever practicable,  reductions  can  lie made in  this        group, but not to the extent proposed by the Committee. (vi.) The Committee quote  as  an  instance of extravagance,  and propose to        cancel,  the decision to keep  the  Training Establishments in working        order on a future mobilisation.   This  decision was arrived at, however,        for cogent reasons, as explained  in Part  I of this Memorandum,  where        it is  also stated that although the Admiralty cannot agree to alter the        decision to keep the Training Schools  in working order on mobilisation,        they can, by applying the decision only to the more important instructors,        &amp;c, make 40 per cent, of the peace complements available for mobilisation. (vii.) The Committee overlook  the  fact  that the Coastguard is now a pensioner        force, and cannot  provide  any  active-service  ratings  for  mobilisation        purposes.   Their calculation that it  can supply 1,500  such  ratings is        therefore erroneous.(viii.) The Committee propose  to  restrict the  numbers of Cadets and Boys to        4,000, which total is arrived at by reducing the 1921-22 figure pro rat a        to the rest of the personnel.  This is not a practicable way of fixing these        numbers,  which  must be  based  on a  proper  calculation  of the entries        necessary to produce  the required numbers of Officers and  men for the        Fleet at a. future  date.  So far as can be seen at present,  the numbers        normally necessary for the reduced Fleet resulting from the Washington        Conference will be:  Cadets,  700 (i.e., an entry  of 210  a year); Bovs        (Seaman,  &amp;c.  Classes), 4,000; Boys (Artificer  Class),  800; total,  5,500.        The numbers required in 1922-23 are: Cadets. 640: Bovs (Seaman.  &amp;c,        Classes), 3,600; Boys  (Artificer Class), 950: total, 5,190.&quot;
have been dealing with this problem ever since the war ended, and the surplus hasalready been reduced by over a  thousand.   Further measures for  dealing with theCaptains&apos; and Commanders&apos; Lists have been before the Treasury for more than twomonths, and the Admiralty trust that the remarks of the Committee will enable theTreasury to deal rapidly with these proposals, and also the further proposals that willbe made in regard to other ranks.    49. Tlie  recommendation that Officers  should not  be brought  back  from theunemployed and half-pay lists on to the full-pay list so as to prevent their retirementfor non-service is dealt with  fully in  Statement VIII.    If the  intention is thatin the absence of any Treasury decision as to the Retirement Schemes, the lists shouldbe cleared  by an  unsparing and indiscriminate application of the non-service rule,the Admiralty submit that this is contrary to all ideas of justice.                    Officers  Stewards and Cooks.  Retinues.    50. The committee&apos;s remarks on Officers&apos; Stewards  and Cooks are based upon-two entire  misapprehensions :     (i.) The relation in which such ratings  stand to the fighting complement of the           ship  is misunderstood.  The ship&apos;s complement is based entirely on the           number of men required to fight her.   The regulation number of Officers&apos;           Stewards and  Cooks, all of whom have definite duties in action, comes           within this total number, and should a reduction be made in these  ratings,           Seamen ratings entailing a much increased liability to the  public would           have to Lie added in place of them to make up the fighting complement  of           the ship.  The idea,  therefore, that 1,800 men could be saved on  Vote  A           by abolishing this class is quite fallacious.    (ii.)  it seems to have been supposed that all Officers&apos; personal servants are drawn           from this class, whereas, except in the case of the Admiral or  Commanding           Officer, personal servants are all drawn from the Royal Marine complement           of the ship.  In the case of  the Navy, moreover, an Officer below the rank           of Commander  (Lieutenant-Colonel  in the  Army)  shares a  Marine           servant.    51. The Committee further suggests that  allowances in lieu of servants  toOfficers serving on shore should be restricted to pre-war practice and subject, in anycase, to a maximum as for one servant.    52. As to  this it  is pointed out that the increase upon  which the Committeecomments  in the  number of Officers in receipt of the allowance is to a great extentmore apparent than real.   Before the war all Officers serving at the Admiralty andthe majority of those serving in shore establishments unprovided with quarters werein receipt of consolidated salaries or consolidated  allowances, which  included  an element for servants&apos; allowance.    53.  In 1919  consolidated salaries and allowances were abolished, and since thenall officers receive full pay  and allowances.  The latter,  in  the case of  Officersunprovided with service accommodation include an allowance in lieu of  servants.   In1919, as  the result of  the report of  the Committee on  Officers&apos;  pay  the rates  ofservants&apos; allowances were increased by  50 per cent., and it was laid down that, exceptin the case of Flag Officers, or Officers in command of an establishment, an allowanceas for one servant only should be paid.   Out of 1,484 Officers in receipt of servants&apos;allowance  at home only 41  receive an allowance in respect of more than one  servant.    54. In regard to the staffs of Commanders-in-Chief, the Committee has,  perhapsexcusably,  been misled by the use of the old Naval term &quot; retinue,&quot; and has treatedthem as being the personal following of the Commander-in-Chief.  A  record of theduties of all the Officers and  men included  in Appendix (F) of the  Interim report has been drawn up as a separate statement (Statement IX), from which it will be seenthat most  of them are  borne for Naval duties, which must necessarily be providedfor at a Port containing a number of Naval Establishments, and have nothing to  do with the dignity or personal  comfort of the Commander-in-Chief.  The possibilityof effecting reductions in these staffs, whether Naval or personal,  is being carefullylooked into.    55. Taking into account all the  reductions  possible, the loAvest total to AvhichFleet numbers &quot;can be reduced in 1922-23 is 98,571.  This total excludes (a) Coast-guard not  required for Naval purposes, to be transferred  to the Votes of the  Depart-ments by which they are required as from the  1st April next (2,755), and (b) surplus
Naval Officers for whom a  retirement scheme  must  he approved so  that they can begot rid of within the year (600).  This is a reduction of about 23,000 as compared withthe reduction of 35,000 arrived at by the Committee on the erroneous bases indicated.This reduction  of  23,000  results  mainly from  the  decisions on policy included inPart I as consequent upon  the Washington Conference and only a small portion of itwould otherwise have been  practicable.  Further, it cannot be effected suddenly, andthe full financial saving will  not be secured  in 1922-23.   This  would of course havebeen  true to  a  far greater extent of such a  reduction  as 35.000,  had this been  a practicable  figure.     55A.  A table showing the allocation of the  1922-23  numbers, as compared withthe allocation of the 1914-15  and 1921-22  numbers,  is given below.     All requirements  have been reviewed and  rigorously cut  clown.    In order toreduce the numbers required  for crossing reliefs, the Board have decided to abolishtwo-year  commissions  for  ships abroad and to  keep  ships  two and a  half years ontheir stations (time away from Home Port not to exceed  three  years).Table  showing Approximate Allocation of Numbers Afloat and Ashore on a                              Normal Peace Day.

Harbour Establishments at Hume.       Reasons why the reduction in these has not been in proportion to the reduction in Vote A:          1. Since 1914 no less than  1,560 ratings have been absorbed in the opening of new Schools, i.e., Mining,            Anti-Subinarine, Anti-Gas, &amp;c.         2. The iercentage of  non-substantive ratings, both in gunnery and torpedo, to the total number of            seamen borne has increased out of all proportion, and it is now over 50 per cent.         8. All gunnery material has become far more complex, and, in addition, a number of new subjects have            to be taught, such ns director, raugelinder and anti-aircraft gunnery.  Consequently it is more than            over necessary-                fa.)  To give all ratings a thorough grounding in Gunnery subjects ; and                (b.)  To requalify them periodically.           it is impossible to afford the requisite instruction in seagoing ships, as facilities do not exist nor can            time be found.         4. Outside the Torpedo Schools,  which  wore the sole Torpedo Establishments before the War,  there are            now the Mining School an extensive experimental and Design Establishment the Anti-Subraarine
     55B. The  position in  regard  to  the Schools is that the  Admiralty  propose to.retain  1,500 Instructors and  &quot; Key men,&quot; who  would  not have been retained on mobilisation under the 1914 arrangements.    But it  should  be explained that  thepoint in making reductions has  been  reached when the total of Vote A will  remain the same whether these 1,500 men are retained on mobilisation or not.   The numbersshown  in the Allocation  Table  are absolutely the lowest on which the Navy can be worked in  peace time so  as to provide training,  relieve ships, give leave,  &amp;c.   they also provide  for  mobilisation,  with  a very narrow  margin  (but  one  which  theAdmiralty are prepared  to accept) for men sick  or on passage.  If  1,500 more menwho have  a fixed  duty in  peace were  made  available on mobilisation, they  would merely increase this  margin.   They  cannot  be deducted from  the peace allocation.and therefore cannot reduce the total of Vote A.     The reduction of Vote A below  the present figure can  only be carried out by areduction of the War Fleet or  a disregard of its requirements as regards trainingof personnel.     The margin to work and train the present Fleet in peace has now been cut until it is less than it has ever been in the  past.Suggested Substitution of hi aval Ratings for  Civilian Personnel, Dockyard Police,                           Coastguard, Dredger Crews,  &amp;c.     56. The  statement that there are at all times available  large numbers of menbelonging  to  the  crews  of  ships refitting, who might be  used  for  these purposestemporarily,  and  obviate the  necessity of making any definite  provision for  such services, is a complete error. ,  &apos;  57. When a ship comes  in hand for a long refit she is paid off, and another ship is brought  forward from reserve to  replace her.   In  the  case of a  short refit, theopportunity is taken to give the ship&apos;s company the leave due to  them.  Even if theperiod of refit slightly exceeds the period of leave, the drafting of small bodies ofmen to different duties for brief periods would involve  much labour and expense andwould not provide for the continuous, much less the efficient, performance of thoseduties.            School and the O.M.B. Base.  Torpedo ratings have now to be instructed and requallfied in the use            of paravanes and depth charges and modern  mines, besides which the complications in electrical            and torpedo work have increased enormously.         5. Wireless instruction has developed enormously since before the War, and some ships have as many as            nine installations, including Directional, Aircraft Signalling,  Fire Control, &amp;c, and, in addition            to this, W/T installations have become revolutionised to such  an extent that requalifi cation has            become an absolute necessity, and instruction of young ratings has become much more complicated.         ft. At the end of the War, practically all the men whose time for pension was completed during the War            held higher non-substantive  ratings.  These all left, and left a legacy of a very great shortage in            these ratings, due to lack of opportunity of training (luring the War, and that arrear has not been            made up.  The estimated actual number of non-substantive ratings short of requirements  even            after the reduction of some 20,000 men, is 500.(B.)-^-Coast Guard (Pensioners).       These are the only men of the Coast Guard required by the Navy in peace.  They would be augmented by         Pensioners, Coast Watchers, &amp;e., in War.(C.)-Boys Training.       3,000 Seaman Boys.        950 Artificer A pprentices.(D.) Marines in Barracks.

Crossing Reliefs.       The men required to man ships in foreign waters are now  -1,000 more than in  1914-15, and the figure for         reliefs should really be 4,000, but it is hoped, with  the increased length of commissions, to work on this         reduced number.  At the present time there are actually 3,650 men going out to, or coming home from,         foreign service, as against 3,200 last November.(G.) Foreign Service Leave and Inoculation.       Foreign Service leave is to scale, of numbers on Foreign. Service, and every man going abroad now is         bound to be inoculated.(H.) Preliminary Training.

                      Yachts and Special  Service  Vessels.    58. The figures given by the  Committee  in  regard to the cost of manning,.maintenance and running of the Royal Yachts and the  Admiralty  Yacht are mostmisleading,  as they suggest that  these amounts would be saved by the abolition of theYachts.  In reality, the greater  part of the cost mentioned in  each case is the costof  the  crews  (viz.,  &quot;Victoria  and  Albert,&quot;   87.880:  &quot;Alexandra,&quot;   45,195;&quot; Enchantress,&quot;  53,610), and this cost would not be saved, as the crews are includedin the numbers required for the War Fleet.His Majesty&apos;s  Yachts.    59. If the &quot;Victoria and Albert &quot; were reduced to  Care and Maintenance, she could not be kept  at all times in the condition which is  considered  suitable  for theKing&apos;s Yacht, and ready to go to sea, if required,  at short notice.    It is  understood that His Majesty has  no objection  to the &quot; Alexandra &quot; being -&quot;disposed of.H.M.S. &quot; Surprise.&quot;    60. This vessel is largely used for the convenience of diplomatic personages andother non-Naval purposes.  The Admiralty  agree  to her  abolition.H.M.S.  &quot;Alacrity.&quot;    61. Unless the Commander-in Chief, China, has the &quot; Alacrity &quot; or other suitablevessel at his disposal he is precluded, by reason of the small depths  obtaining, fromvisiting a large number of important places on the China station.    62. It is essential that the  British Commander-in-Chief should constantly paythese  visits.  Owing to the fact  that a certain standard of ceremony and comfort isnecessary, and  that sloops and gunboats,  even  were those suitable  for the purpose,cannot be relied  upon to be available whenever  required, it is  considered thata special vessel is  a necessity.    63. It is proposed, however,  to substitute a vessel requiring a smaller complementfor &quot;Alacrity,&quot; which can then be disposed of.H.M.S. &quot;Enchantress.&quot;    64, A statement with  regard to the &quot; Enchantress&quot; is attached (Statement X),and it is  suggested that a decision in this  case be deferred until  the First Lord&apos; return.Hospital  Ships.    65. The Admiralty have already decided that the &quot; Berbice &quot;  shall be paid oft&apos;when the &quot;Maine&quot; is ready for  service, and the latter will then  be the onlyHospital Ship.                               Medical  Services.    66. A separate statement (Statement  XI) has been prepared detailing the chiefreasons for  the increased cost of these services.     67. From  this it will be seen that, apart from the increased  cost  of surgicalinstruments, &amp;c.  (roughly 80 per  cent,  to 100 per cent,  all round), the  greaterexpense as  compared with pre-war is  due to  the much greater care bestowed on medical diagnosis  and treatment, e.g., X-ray treatment, bacteriological examination.improved treatment of  venereal diseases,  &amp;c.    68. The justification of this extra cost  will be found in the improved health ofthe men, and the reduction of wastage due to invaliding.    69. The Committee&apos;s suggestions as to  the pooling of Hospitals with the Armyhave  been the  subject of conferences between  the two Medical  Services,  and it  isconsidered  that after certain initial difficulties  due  to different  regulations androutines in  the two services have been overcome, it will  be practicable to carry thispooling into effect in many places, both  at home  and abroad, and that importanteconomies will  result.  The necessary steps  to this end will be taken.    69A.  The Vote has been very  carefully reviewed, and by  the  adoption of thispolicy, the reduction of staffs at Hospitals, and of working stocks of medical stores,&amp;c, a saving of  100,000 can be made in 1922-23.
Edu cation a I Services.    70. As  stated  by the Committee,  the Admiralty had already  initiated  an enquiry with the object of reducing the cost of education at Dartmouth, and fullyrealise the desirability of making a substantial reduction therein.    70A. The July Estimate provided for an estimated saving of  30,000 to be madeon the cost of Cadets&apos; Education as the  result  of an enquiry by a Committee whichwas then appointed, and also  4,500 by  increasing the fees.    The Committee&apos;s recommendations  which have now been received  will actuallyeffect a saving  of about  43,000 a year, but   30,000 of this having  already been allowed for, only  13,000 can be reckoned as new  savings over the July Estimate.    71. The question of the scale  of fees  is regarded by  the Admiralty entirely from  the standpoint that it is important that the career of a Naval Officer  shouldbe open to all classes of  the community.  Provided that the power of  granting  the reduced scale of fees ( 40) in  necessitous  cases up to 25  per cent, of the entriesremains, the proposed increase of the  normal amount to  150 is agreed to.    71A. The increase of fees will only bring in about  4,500 in 1922, but the savingwill be much greater in subsequent years.    In order further to reduce expenses  at Dartmouth,  the Board have  it in contemplation that in future Cadets shall leave Dartmouth for the training cruiserat the end of their ninth term  instead  of  after eleven terms,  the  training cruisertime  remaining  as  at  present.   Owing to  the  necessary  rearrangement  of  theDartmouth curriculum,  it will  not  be possible to bring this change into  operation now late in 1922-23, but  a considerable economy both to Navy Votes and to  the parent will result in subsequent years.    The item for expense of  training Naval Officers  at  Cambridge ( 37,500) is really a terminal expense due to the war and  will disappear in future years.    Whilst these changes  will  effect material savings in the Vote in subsequent years, it is not  seen  how any  further reduction can be made in  1922-23  withoutentire dislocation of the educational work of the  Navy.     The  numbers  of Instructors  and  Schoolmasters  for  the Fleet are  alreadyseriously below  requirements (see Statement VIII).  In the case  of the latter thisis due to the fact that the Naval rates do not  compare favourably  with those of the profession on shore under the Burnham Report.     The Board  feel  that any  arbitrary cutting of  the educational  and  scientificVotes would be  inexcusable at a time when we are forced to rely more and more onthe hope  that the Navy will make up  in  quality of personnel and superiority oftechnique for the lead that has  been surrendered  in respect of material.                               Dockyard Police.     72. As already indicated,  it  is  impracticable for Active Service Marines or naval Ratings to be provided out of Vote A numbers to replace Metropolitan Police.The Admiralty, however, accept in principle  the Committee&apos;s recommendation thatMetropolitan Police  should  in future  be  employed  only  in  such numbers as theCommissioner considers  necessary for detection of crime.     73. A special Committee is now sitting  at the Admiralty to  enquire  into there organisation  of the arrangements  for policing  Naval Establishments  at home,and it is hoped  to arrange :        (i.)  That  the  protection  of  the  Naval Ordnance  Depots,  Magazines  and           Factories  should in  future be undertaken by a new force of Royal Marine           Pensioners,  thus reducing the cost by at least  50 per cent,  per man           employed.     (ii.) That a drastic reorganisation  of the duties of the Police at the Dockyards           should be effected  on  a  model recommended  for  Chatham Dockyard,           which might  be applied, mutatis mutandis, to the other  Naval Dockyards.           The   proposed  reduction at  Chatham  is  obtained   in  the  main  by           amalgamating  the  Police beats and closing&apos; certain  of  the  Dockyard           gates at stated  times.     (iii.) To substitute civilian  Stokers  and  Engine  Drivers  foi  Metropolitan           Police in the Water Police Boats.    74. With regard to the Water Police, it is the emphatic advice of the scotland yard Authorities that  the retention of the Metropolitan Police as the Water-Guard       [7720]                                                         D
is  absolutely  essential  for the  detection  of crime;  the  water  boundaries  ofHis  Majesty&apos;s Dockyards  being  those most in  need of  protection  from  thispoint of view.    75. The substitution, however, of lured Engineers and Stokers for MetropolitanPolicemen, who at present run the Police Boats, appears to be practicable and will reduce the cost substantially.    76. It is  hoped&apos; that,  by proceeding on these lines,  a very  large reduction -probably  100,000 a year-will ultimately be  obtained  in the  total cost of thePolice Service, but the saving in 1922-23 is not likely to exceed  4-0,000.                                    Stocks.(i.) Victualling Stores.    77. The  stocks at the  Victualling Yards are not  being, and  never  have been,regulated on the  basis of holding ;&apos;six months&apos;  war consumption,&quot;  or  even threemonths&apos;.  If stocks were to be increased to  this level,  the amount required underVote 2 in 1922-23 would be very much larger.    78. The  principle underlying the Committee&apos;s remarks  about  stores which canrapidly be obtained in the  commercial market in an emergency is, in fact,  the onewhich has always been acted upon.    79. The  position before the war, speaking broadly, was that the supplies whichhad to be made from the Victualling Yards during the first month of Mobilisation,together with the stocks carried in His Majesty&apos;s Ships, would provision the WarFleet  for a  period of  between three  and four months;  but only a  part  of these supplies were actually kept in stock at the Victualling Yards, the balance having to be obtained from the trade, at the time, by dormant Emergency Contracts, advanceorders,  early purchases in  the open market,  and acceleration of delivery of storesalready on  order.   For all  supplies  after  the  first  month  of  Mobilisation, theDepartment depended entirely on purchase.    80. At the present time, owing to the uncertainty of future war requirements,the provision of  the  more immediate reserves  is limited to  completing ships in commission and in reserve, and maintaining  bedding and kits  for Reservists called up on Mobilisation.  Apart from this, stocks are being regulated on a purely peacebasis, which  has  for  its broad principle  the maintenance  of a minimum  workingstock  of not  more than three  months&apos; average peace issues.   The Vote 2  sketch estimate  for  1922-23 was prepared  on this basis,  and full  allowance  ( 540,000)was made for the  working down during the year of surplus stocks remaining over from,  the war;  but in view  of  the serious financial  situation, it is proposed totemporarily  work  upon a smaller  margin of  working  stocks,  that  is  to  say,two months instead of three months- this margin to be reviewed annually in thelight of experience gained.  A saving  of  150,000 will result in 1922-23.(ii.) Naiwal Stores.    81. As  in the case of  Victualling Stores, the Committee&apos;s recommendation ismade under  a misapprehension.   The Committee appear to  have been under  theimpression that the stock  of  these stores ordinarily maintained  is  based  on war consumption, but this is not the case.  The provision made is influenced by a variety of circumstances, and in only  a few cases is  the possible war consumption  taken asa  basis.  In  the case of stores which can be readily obtained in the  commercialmarket, it  is the Admiralty practice  to maintain  about  three  months&apos;  peaceconsumption, experience having shown that  this is the shortest period that can beaccepted, having  regard to  fluctuations in consumption  and time  necessary  for review  of stocks and for making purchases.  If the Committee&apos;s recommendations were  adopted it  would  be necessary  to  considerably  increase stocks, as  the war consumption must obviously be many times greater than that of peace.    82. The whole question of the  sufficiency or otherwise of the  working stock of Naval Stores is too complex to be dealt with in a brief explanation, but in orderto satisfy themselves that the  bases  are reasonable  on which  these  stocks  are maintained,  the  Board have  decided to set up a Departmental  Committee  to investigate the matter.  In the meantime, pending the result  of  this Enquiry, theAdmiralty are prepared bv working on smaller stocks in 1922-23 to effect a saving of 150,000.
                             Dockyard Economies.(i.) Numbers of Men in Dockyards.    87. It is estimated that at the end of the current financial year we shall have atthe Home Yards 44,000 men on Naval work and 5,000 on repayment work.  It hasalready been proposed to reduce the number of men on Naval work to 38,000 by theend of 1922-23 and to reduce about 1,000 men on repayment work, a total dischargeof some 7,000 men during the year.  Allowance was made for this reduction in the sketch Estimate of July last.  A further reduction of about 450 men at Rosyth  is contemplated, as a result of the policy indicated in paragraph 32.    In the Foreign Yards the number borne at present is about 10,000.   By the endof 1922-23 the number is expected to  be 9,250.    88. The total number to be worked to by the end of 1922-23 at home and abroadis  therefore 50,800, as compared with 50,350 employed before the war.    89. In the ordinary course, the reductions would have been made in the springand summer months so as to mitigate  hardship as much as possible,  but,  if  thiscourse be adopted, no material saving on Vote 8 (I) over that already shown in the sketch Estimate  can now be made.    In  view, therefore, of the urgent need for reducing expenditure,  the Admiralty  propose to take  the  following  exceptional measures, which will effect a further  reduction of  800,000 :     (1.)  To commence  as  early  as  possible, i.e., on the 15th February next, the           discharge of the 6,000 men on  Naval  work  who will have  to  go,  and           continue discharging them at the rate of at least 300 a week until they           have all gone.    (2.)  To allow for a further  10 per cent, fall in wages during the year;  a fall           to at least this extent is generally anticipated.    The total effect of all  these  steps will be to reduce  the  figure proposed forVote  8  (I) in the July  Sketch Estimate bv  968,050. making a  total reduction  of 3.600.000 on the 1921-22 Estimate for Vote 8 (I).    It must be clearly understood, however, that it will only be possible to keepexpenditure within this reduced  Estimate provided that political considerations arenot allowed to interfere with the rate of discharges,  and that the expectation of a10 per cent, fall in wages is realised.       [7720]                                                       D 2ft                             Clothiny Allowances.    83. The Committee&apos;s recommendation to reduce Clothing Allowances has beenvery carefully considered.  Such a reduction would have to be made in one of two ways.   Either the regulation kit must be reduced, in which case the  reduction ofthe allowance  for its upkeep would naturally follow,  or the articles of kit must beassumed to  have a longer &quot;life&quot;  and the  upkeep allowance be reduced on  this assumption.    84. The  Admiralty  are  unable  to agree  to  any reduction in  the presentregulation  kits  of Naval Ratings,  which,  in  their  opinion, now  represent the absolute minimum required under the conditions of Naval Service;  or to an extensionof the period of replacement on which the present  rates of Kit Upkeep Allowanceare based generally, viz.,  the complete replacement of the kit every two years, exceptbedding, overcoat and waterproof, for which replacement is allowed every four years.    85. The financial saving effected by any such drastic reduction in the kit of men would be more than counterbalanced by the very bad effect on the  personnel  whowould resent it; and the suggestion to extend the life of the kit  in order to reducethe amount of  Kit  Upkeep Allowance would  certainly  create  a bitter  sense of grievance on the Lower Deck.  Also, it would entail the men having to wear overallsuits  to preserve what clothes  are left them and  this would  have a  very adverse effect on discipline.    86. With regard  to  the suggestion that further reductions should  follow inthe rates of Clothing Allowances &quot; to meet falling prices,&quot;  it may be remarked thatthe information available, so far, goes to show, however,  that the contract  prices for clothing articles generally in 1922-28 are not likely to be much less, if any, thanin the current financial year, and that the reduction of 10 per cent, already allowed for in the Sketch Estimates may not be realised.
     90. With regard to the remarks of  the Committee to the effect that with a smaller Fleet than  pre-war a  smaller number  of  men should  be sufficient, thefollowing points should be borne in mind :      (1.)  The Dockyard  at Rosyth DID not exist before the war.     (2.)  The greater complexity of ships, with a resulting increase, not only in the           number of repair items per ship, but also in the number of those items           which are of a specially intricate nature.   The labour necessary for the           efficient upkeep of ships of every class has therefore largely increased.     (3.)  The general introduction of oil fuel burning in the Navy.  Although the           advantages of liquid fuel over coal are unquestionable, the ships so fitted           frequently develop leaks  in their  fuel tanks which prolong the  period           during which they remain  in  dock.   A  large  increase has  also  been           necessary in the number of oil-carrying vessels,  the crews and upkeep of           which entail proportionate increases in personnel.     (4.)  The increased  number  of moorings.   During the Avar,  large numbers of           moorings were laid in all parts of the world, and, although the Avork of           raising all moorings  not now required has been continually in progress,           the retention of many more than existed before the war is still necessary           for the use of ships for disposal.  The upkeep of these moorings and the           raising of those no longer  required involve great additions to the mooring           craft necessary before the Avar.     (5.)  Increased  size of Capital  Ships.   Double the number of tugs are  IIOAV           required to handle our more modern Capital Ships during movements in           the Dockyards.  This entails  the  maintenance of a  larger number of           powerful tugs at each of  the yards.     (6.)  It is an actual fact that the output per man is not more than 70 per cent.           of Avhat IT might be.  This reduced  output is general throughout the           country  and is not peculiar to  His Majesty&apos;s Dockyards, although the           latter  have  possibly suffered to a greater  extent OAving to  the  large           reductions that have already been made.   The men have no incentive to           work, as they feel that by doing their work quickly they will merely pave           the way for  their earlier discharge.     (7.)  The working week is now 47 hours against 48 hours pre-war.  This means           that well OA-er 1,000 more men are required to do the Avork in the reduced           Avorking hours.     90A. The question  of the effect  of further  reducing the Dockyard Estimate(Vote 8, I  and II) by either   1,000,000 or  500,000 has been  very  carefully considered.     The  reduced Estimate proposed  above (para. 89)  involves, as already stated.the  discharge of approximately 6,500 men. from  Naval  work  in addition  to  a1,000 men on repayment work ;  total  7,500 men, to be discharged at the  rate of300 a week from the middle of February until August.     As regards work, this reduced Estimate is framed on the following  basis andassumes a considerable improvement  in  the output of the Dockyard Workmen : -     (1.)  New Construction. To complete the outstanding  New Construction whichhas  already been in hand some five or six years,  and to  continue work on the experimental submarine and minelayer.     (2.)  Reconstruction. To  commence reconstruction  of either  one or two of thelatest Battleships  and  to continue  conversion of &quot;Furious&quot;  Class to aircraft carriers (both items have become of  vital importance as  result of washington conference).     (3.)  Ordinary Repairs  of the Fleet. To  cope  AVITH these as far as possible.In this connection, it is to be noted, that even with the numbers originally providedfor in the  Sketch  it is  very doubtful if there would not  accumulate considerablearrears, as even with the existing numbers of workmen  refits take six weeks insteadof a month.     (4.)  Miscellaneous Dockyard Services.-To cope  with  these as far as possible.They include not only essential Dockyard Services such as upkeep of machinery andYard plant,  moorings,  caissons, tug  work, lighting, heating,  cleaning, &amp;c, butsimilar services for other Shore Establishments, and various important experimentalitems such as reconstruction of obsolete  ships to be used as targets for shell fire andunder-water weapons.
    90B. The further reduction of  500,QUO on Vote 8 would  entail the  dischargeof a further 4,000 men,  making a  total  discharge of 11,500 men.    To effect thisPembroke Dockyard must be closed at the earliest possible moment, as previously proposed by the Admiralty,  and the weekly reduction of men from  the other Yardsmust be increased from 300 a  week to 400 a  week.    As regards the  effect on the work, this  reduction on the  Admiralty Estimatemust entail serious effects under each of the heads detailed above.    The &quot; Effingham,&quot;  &quot; Frobisher.&quot; &quot;Enterprise,&quot;  minelayer, and Dock  Sectionfor Malta,  as well  as  Torpedo-Boat Destroyers and Submarines, will be very considerably  delayed.   Work on &quot;Royal Oak.&quot; &quot;Renown&quot; or &quot;Glorious&quot; mustbe stopped.  Two of the Sloops promised to the R.N.V.R.  as  training depots and&quot; Cordelia  &quot; will have to be omitted from  programme, and the work on the remainingships must be considerably delayed.    The sum provided for ordinary  repairs will preclude the spending of money onany  except the most  essential alterations  and  additions,  and it  is practicallycertain that the refits of the  Fleet will fall into arrear.    The Miscellaneous items will  have to be extensively cut, but it is not possibleto give exact details  until the Superintendents of the Yards have been consulted.    This wholesale abandonment or retarding of  work cannot be recommended aseconomical or sound  policy, as it means that we shall neither keep our ships efficientnor start the reconstruction of ships necessitated by the Washington  Conference,which  will take fifteen years even on  the basis of the  Estimate submitted inparagraph 89.  Should it be considered that the need  for immediate reduction of estimates  is so great that these disadvantages must be accepted, additional work must of necessity fall on future years in order to  make up  arrears, and it must be clearly  understood   that the  progress  of reconstruction must be  accelerated infuture years.    There is one other point upon which the Admiralty must insist.    Although it is not their concern, they are aware from previous experience that political considerations  will  make  it  extremely  difficult  to  carry through  thisformidable programme of discharges.  The difficulty will be all the greater  because it will be  apparent to the  men  that while  they  are being discharged  to receiveunemployment  doles, important work such as  New Construction,  &amp;c,  is awaitingcompletion, and that the delay in  the work is most uneconomical.  The Admiraltymust beg that this aspect of the case be  considered, and settled once for  all, at the start, and  that when once the  policy of reduction has been decided upon, and theprogramme of Dockyard work drawn up on  this basis, there shall  be no  alterationof the policy.  If. as has occurred in the last two  years, the policy of discharges iscommenced and then reversed,  all the efforts which are being made to  arrange thework of Dockyards on methodical and economical  lines will again be frustrated bythe impossibility  of working to  a definite  programme,  and this has  a mostdisheartening effect on the Officers and a demoralising effect  on  the men.    The Admiralty  do not  feel that they can  undertake the responsibility for theproposed reduction,  unless they receive an assurance from the Government that thereduction  represents the definite and  final  policy of the  Government.  If thereduction is  to be made orders for  the  additional discharges  must be sent out atonce,  and  the  Admiralty  must  consequently receive  their  formal  instructionswithout delay.    The Board of  Admiralty must state quite frankly that the vacillations ofHis  Majesty&apos;s  Government  on   this question are  largely   responsible for the unsatisfactory  conditions of working in the Dockyards  at the present time.    90c. The further reduction  of  1,000,000 instead of   500,000 on  Dockyardwork would entail  the  further discharge of  8,000  additional men, i.e.,  a totaldischarge of  15,500 men in all,  or over 600 a week from  February until August.    This would be  a  discharge on  a scale  such as has never  been  known in the dockyard towns, and coming simultaneously with a large  reduction in  the Fleet,the effects would be felt all  through the adjacent counties  of Devon,  Cornwall,Hampshire and Kent.    The effect upon  the programme of work would be as follows :      All work on New Construction must stop, except &quot; Eagle,&quot;  &quot; Hermes,&quot; &quot; X. 1 &quot;and  &quot; K. 26,&quot; or alternatively all  reconstruction and  large repair  work must be postponed  with the  exception of &quot;Furious  &quot; and &quot;Tiger,&quot; which will be  furthervery considerably delayed.    Not only would  such a policy be most uneconomical, as it is well known that the longer the construction  or  reconstruction  of vessels  is prolonged  the  greater the

To effect thisPembroke Dockyard must be closed at the earliest possible moment, as previously proposed by the Admiralty,  and the weekly  reduction of men from  the other Yardsmust be increased from 300  a  week to 4.00 a  week.    As  regards the effect on the work, this  reduction on the Admiralty Estimatemust entail serious effects under each of the heads detailed above.

The further  reduction of  1,000,000 instead of   500,000 on Dockyardwork would entail the  further discharge of  8,000  additional men, i.e.,  a totaldischarge of  15,500 men in all,  or over 600 a week from February until August.    This  would be a discharge on a scale such as has never been  known  in the dockyard towns, and coming simultaneously with a  large  reduction in the Fleet,the effects  would be felt all through the adjacent counties  of  Devon, Cornwall,Hampshire and Kent.    The effect upon the programme of work would be as follows :      All work on New Construction must  stop, except &quot; Eagle,&quot; &quot; Hermes,&quot;  &quot; X. 1 &quot;and  &quot; K.  26,&quot; or alternatively all reconstruction and  large repair work  must be postponed with the exception of &quot; Furious  &quot; and &quot; Tiger,&quot; which will be  furthervery considerably delayed.    Not only would such a policy be most uneconomical, as it is well known that the longer  the construction or  reconstruction of vessels  is prolonged  the  greater the
expense;   but,  further, it could not possibly be reconciled with any  profession of keeping the Fleet reasonably efficient or maintaining  it on anything approaching a one-Power standard of strength.(ii.)  High  Ratio of Wages Bill to Material used.     91. The Committee&apos;s criticisms under this head are dealt with in Statement XII.     92. Briefly it may be stated here that the comparison which the Committee seek to make between the cost of work in the  Dockyards and the Private Yards appearsto be vitiated by a number of disturbing factors which the Committee did not take into  consideration.  Examination of a large number of actual building  and repairingaccounts, where these disturbing factors do not operate, shows no great difference inthe ratio of labour  to materials as  between Contract  and  Dockyard New Construc-tion, nor yet as between. Contract  and Dockyard repair work.  In the  case of repair work, indeed, the Private Yards appear to show a higher ratio than the Dockyards,and this is in accord with  Admiralty experience when  the experiment of putting outNaval repair work  to Private Yards was tried twenty years ago,  and proved verycostly.(iii.) Piece-work in the Dockyards.     The  Committee&apos;s statement  that no  systems  of payment by results  are inoperation  in the Dockyards  is incorrect.  Both piece-work and  job price  worksystems are in operation, and the total payments  expected to be made for this classof work during the present financial year will amount to about a million pounds.(iv.)  Yard Craft.     93. A special enquiry is being held into this question with a view to making allpossible reductions, but the basis  on which the Committee suggests dealing  with  itis not  considered  a  practicable one, as the greater  size  of  the ships in the  Fleet(necessitating more  yard craft to move them) counts for more in this particular casethan the reduction in numbers of ships.   This has already been referred to inparagraph 90.(v.) Motor Transport.    94.  A  separate Statement (Statement XIII) has been prepared in  regard to thisquestion, from  which it will  be seen that the Admiralty, whilst they have no doubt as to the economy and. efficiency resulting from the use of Motor Transport, proposeto save  4,500 by the reduction of twenty cars, leaving only, the following :                                                      Running-.   Reserve.            Great Britain ...       ...       ...         19        6            Abroad        ...       ...       ...         10        in addition to  four in Ireland, which will shortly be withdrawn, and fourteen at berlin  and Belgrade, which, although Admiralty cars, are a charge  to  other thanNavy Votes.    95. The Admiralty also propose to defer purchases of  new vehicles to the extentof  22,300, and to limit the provision of reconditioning and overhaul of vehicles to 10,250 instead of   20,500.   They cannot, however, regard the recommendation to eliminate  all expenditure on  reconditioning  and overhaul as consistent with trueeconomy.                                  Armaments.    96.  A  detailed Statement (Statement XIV) with regard to the Armaments  Vote,and the comments made upon it by the Committee, has been prepared.     97. All possible  reductions  in the  expenditure provided  for  in the  sketch estimate  have  been explored, with the  result that,  in addition to  the saving of 412,700 due to the modification of the Programme of New Construction, a  furthersaving of  391,500 can be made on other  items of the vote.     97A. This  reduction will bring the Estimate  down to the lowest figure that theAdmiralty can  recommend :  (a) if the proper maintenance of approved reserves ofammunition and explosive material for the Navy is to be  provided  for, by which is meant  their maintenance in a state  which  ensures reasonable safety to the  ships of the Fleet, the ordnance depots and the towns in their vicinity;  and  (b) if essentialprogress  is to  be made in experimental  work, so that  the material  for the much-reduced Fleet can be kept  up to that state of efficiency which is necessary  to meet
modern requirements, and (c) if the training of  the personnel is to be carried out at the  minimum  cost.    Any  further  reduction can only be  effected  by takingconsiderable risks which can only  be justified to  meet  the acute financial situation,and  on the clear  understanding that  increased  expenditure  will  be  necessary atsome future date to make up the leeway that will result, and particularly to completereserves of mines and depth charges to the number necessary on  the outbreak ofwar  to tide over the time during which manufacture is being built up.     97B. The utmost further reductions than can be recommended on  the aboveconditions amount to   710,000, and the principal items that will be affected can bebriefly summarised as follows :  (1.)  Deferring Work  of Reconditioning of Ammunition Stocks in the Depots and        reducing the Approved Reserves of Alines and Depth Charges.     (a.) In addition to the maintenance of the ammunition for the post-war Fleet,there are still very large  stocks of surplus  and obsolete ammunition which  requireto be overhauled, examined and reconditioned for use  in the post-war Fleet, either for service or for  practice.    This  work  serves a, double purpose and  cannot be deferred indefinitely, as  on  it depends  firstly  the safety of  the Fleet and the ordnance Depots,  and  secondly,  the provision  of practice  ammunition to avoidlarge sums being spent for this purpose.   (The  total  practice ammunition for theFleet costs annually about  1.250,000;   the amount which it is  intended to spendduring this year is   350,000,  which clearly indicates the saving that is being effected by reconditioning surplus and obsolete ammunition).   A  cut will be  madein the labour employed on this work, subject to its being fully appreciated that thiswill  increase the risk  of accident involving loss of life, both in His Majesty&apos;s ships and  at and in the neighbourhood of the depots.     (b.) If the present approved  reserves of mines and depth charges are  reducedby scrapping  those requiring large repairs, say,  up to a total of from 30 per cent.to 50 per  cent.,  one depot could be done away with and a second depot reduced toCare and Maintenance Party during the year, but this  reduction can only  be carriedout on the clear understanding that these reserves ivill be built up  again  before theend  of the ten years&apos;  holiday.     If  the  above  risks are accepted,  a  reduction of  130,000  can  be made onSubhead B by the discharge  of approximately 1,500 men.(2.)  Guns.     By deferring the manufacture of the guns  for the new  ships, a reduction of 300,000 can  be  made on Subhead F., but  this can only be done at the risk of the guns not being ready  for the&quot;ships, and it is certain that very strong objections willbe raised in other quarters on account of the loss of work at Woolwich.(3.)  Projectiles and Ammunition.     A  reduction  of   200,000 can  be made on this Subhead  by spreading thecompletion of 15-inch Armour  Piercing Shell over two years instead of completingthem during 1922-23.  This will necessitate ordering only 1,200 of these  projectilesduring the financial year, and will only be sufficient to employ one  of the two firms,either Hadfield or Firth.   The disadvantage of this is obvious.  It absolutely doesaway with  cmy  competition, and the  price  of  the  shell will  be increased to  aconsiderable extent.  Any further reduction beyond that suggested would necessitate a subsidy which is calculated at about  50,000 per annum and cannot be  recommendedas economical or  desirable.(4.)  Small Arms, Torpedo Material, &amp;c.     This Subhead includes the provision of material for  cordite,  the maintenanceof Ordnance Vessels, and a very large  number of miscellaneous items for improve-ment of material in the Fleet.  The  redistribution of armament material  to carryout  the policy of reducing the number of depots (as  above) will be a heavy extracharge to  this Subhead,  and it is not considered that a reduction of more  than 40,000 can be recommended without  either the stocks of cordite material  being reduced beyond the safe  limit or the development of material in  the Fleet  being allowed to fall behind that of other nations.
(5.) Inspection, Proof and Experiment.    This Subhead includes the inspection of new material for  the  Fleet,  and the experimental work on which the efficiency of the armour, guns and ammunition forthe new ships will depend, also the experimental and  research work in connectionwith  the  production  of a new  propellant, the importance  of  which cannot  be exaggerated.  Any large  reduction of this Subhead is,  therefore, impossible, but,in view of the delay suggested above in providing new  ammunition, it is consideredthat a reduction of  40,000 might be made on this Subhead.    97c. As before stated, this  further  reduction amounts to  710,000, making atotal  reduction on Vote 9 of   1,539,200.   No  additional reduction on this  Votecan be made without  taking quite unjustifiable  risks in connection with the safety of the Fleet and the Ordnance Depots, and lowering  the efficiency of the material in the Fleet and the training of the personnel to a degree than cannot be acceptedunless our Fleet is to be considerably inferior to  the Fleets of other Naval Powers.                                    Works.    98. A detailed Statement (Statement  XV) with regard to this Vote has also beenprepared.    99. The Committee proposed that, apart from Oil Fuel storage, only  1,000,000instead of  2,000,000 should be allowed for continuation  works, maintenance anddredging, and that all new works should be deferred.    100. It will be seen that,  in place of this reduction of  1,340,000, the utmostsaving &quot;that the Admiralty think it possible to effect is   525,000.                  Travelling  Concessions  to Officers  and Men.    101. The Committee state that there is no sufficient reason why the Governmentshould give to Naval Officers and men a  concession of return tickets  at single fare,involving the payment of  390,000 to the  Railway Companies, which the  Govern-ment  did not give before the war.  This  statement does not indicate  as clearly as itmight that the concession is one which the Services enjoyed for many years beforethe war, having been granted by the Railway Companies after negotiation with theAdmiralty and War Office, partly as a matter of business in order  to increase the traffic on their lines.    102. The financial  relations existing between the  Railway Companies  and theTreasury during the war led the  Treasury to rule that payment for  this concessionmust  be made by the Departments to the Railway Companies.    103. As the Committee includes a large proportion of gentlemen  connected withrailway management,  it is hoped  that they speak with authority, and consider thatthe Railway Companies could and should resume the pre-war practice of grantingthe concession without payment.    104. The concession cannot otherwise be withdrawn by the Government withoutdepriving the Services of a privilege which they have enjoyed for a great many years,and which, in the case of the Navy, has done a good deal to prevent  the greater  useof Northern Waters by the Fleet from becoming a severe financial strain upon Officersand men.  Apart from  the reduction of   390,000 that would result  from the Avith-drawal of  this concession, the Admiralty  will  effect   a  reduction of  22,000  onTravelling generally, and a. reduction of   18,000 on Lodging Allowances.                               Admiralty Staff.    105. The Committee  propose that the Estimate for  1922-23 should be reducedto  1,000,000 including Officers borne on Vote I, i.e., a reduction of about 38 per cent.,and that by a continuous process of reduction during next year the Admiralty shouldbe reduced to the pre-war number of 2,072, any new branch of work since 1914 being-offset by the presumed reduction in work due to the smaller number of Naval personnel and ships.     .106. Comparisons with 1914 do not make allowance for the fact that the strengthand cost of Admiralty Staff in the years  immediately before the Avar Avas abnormallylow,  as the expansion of staff had not kept pace with the great increase  in navalexpenditure and activity.  The strain, particularly on the higher staff, was extreme,and had almost reached breaking point in 1914, when proposals for largely increasingthe staff were either before the Treasury or under consideration at  the&quot; Admiralty.The  Naval Staff  particularly was  on  an altogether  inadequate scale,  and  wasadmittedly only a nucleus which Avas intended to be deA&apos;eloped.
     107. At the present time, in addition to the increase of the Naval Staff (costing 128.500, as against  33.000 in 1914). there is a Staff costing  66,633 engaged ondistribution of War Medals and Naval Prize, which will not be finished until the endof 1922-23; a  staff costing  46,707 dealing with Naval Marriage Allowance, which did not exist before the war; and the Costings Investigation Stall, also non-existentbefore the war, and still engaged on liquidating war liabilities, costs  25,110.     108. The  Electrical Engineering Department and the Naval  Ordnance Depart-ment have necessarily expanded very largely, and the Torpedoes and Mining Depart-ment and  Signal Department  have been  separated  from  the  Naval OrdnanceDepartment and largely developed.  These developments are inevitable, having regardto the  progress made with Naval material.     109. It is not considered that any Naval reductions  now in contemplation willmake it practicable to reduce the Admiralty Staff to what it was in 1914, but in viewof the  Washington agreements a complement not more than 400 or 500  in excess ofthe 1914 figures may eventually become possible.     110. A period,  however,  during which  large  reductions  are  being made involving,  as they will, the  discharge and pensioning of large numbers of  naval personnel,  the retirement  of Officers  under  special schemes,  the  closing down ofDockyards, the reduction of  labour&apos; staffs, and the handling of surplus stores throwsan immensely increased amount of work on the Admiralty Staff.  A reduction of the vote 12 Estimate  to  1,000,000 next  year would simply mean that the  department would break down, and that the other large economies dealt with in this Report wouldprobably not be secured.     111. After  very careful  consideration, the Board  are  prepared to aim at  areduction of  100.000  as  compared with  the July Estimate,  but  it must be under-stood that  even  this  reduction is  in no way  justified by any diminution of work tobe expected during 1922-23 (when, on the contrary, everything will  be turned upside-down and rendered much more difficult),  and it will almost certainly involve      (a.)  Considerable  loss of public money, owing to the staff not being adequate           to deal properly  with  matters involving large  sums.     (&amp;.)  Considerable delay in the issue of war medals and naval prize, which will           cause great complaint.     (c.) Discharge of many hundred disabled and other&quot;ex-Service men,  since, if the           staff is to  be  reduced below  the true requirements  of  the work, the           Admiralty  must insist on experience and efficiency as the sole tests in           the retention of  staff,  and cannot undertake any longer to carry  out the           spirit of the recommendations  of the Lytton Reports.                      Wages Subheads of Votes generally.     111A. By  assuming the  same further- 10 per cent, fall in wages on  other Votesas on Vote 8, and other  adjustments, the Admiralty  expect to  be able to save afurther-  100,000.                      Omission of Fleet Reserve Training.     111B.  In order to  reduce expenditure, the Admiralty have also decided to omitin 1922-23  the training of Class A of the Royal Fleet Reserve, which  will effect a saving of  80,000, spread over Votes 1,  2. 7 and 11.   (The training of  Class B hasalready been omitted.)                                   SUMMARY.     112. A table is appended (Statement I) showing in detail the various items inrespect of  which the Admiralty can see their way to effect  economies in personnel and in general expenditure beyond those already contained in the Sketch Estimates.Roughly  speaking their proposals will secure a further  reduction of about  23,000Officers and men in  Vote  A and of over 19f millions in total estimates, bringingthese down to about 98,570 Officers and men and about 61  millions  (net) respectively.     11.3. It will be seen that the larger part of these economies belong to the category of  economies  consequent  on policy, and  more  particularly  consequent  on theWashington proposals.  Some of these were, it is true, also suggested in the InterimReport, and the Admiralty have been glad, wherever possible, to avail themselves ofthe suggestions of the  Committee.  They  cannot, however, accept  the contention ofthe Committee that, so far  at any rate  as economies of policy are concerned, their suggestions can be treated,  independently of  the conclusions of the  washington conference, as definitely attainable economies to which the results of the Conference       [7720]                                                          E
can then be super added.   On the contrary they must insist that it  is only in thelight of the Conference that most of the reductions indicated have become possible,and that breakdown or non-ratification would compel a  reconsideration not only ofthe shipbuilding programme,  but of  most of the other  reductions  which  theAdmiralty are at present prepared to accept.    114. As regards economies due to improved organisation or administration theAdmiralty regret that  they have not been able to find themselves able  to accept  someof the mam conclusions of the  Committee,  more particularly those in  regard tomanning, as these conclusions appear to them to have been based  on  an  insufficientcomprehension of the necessities  of Naval organisation,  perhaps inevitable in  viewof the  pressure under which the enquiry was conducted.    .115. The total  economy effected  undoubtedly falls  short of  tlie  21 millionsrecommended by the Committee plus  the many  additional millions by which,  it issuggested, that figure might lie increased as the result of the Washington Conference.But it is necessary to  keep in mind that the actual suggestions of the Committee,both  as to policy and as to administration, could not have effected a saving, of morethan 14 millions, of which at least  one-half were  based, on erroneous assumptions and could not in fact have been carried ont,  and that the remaining 7 millions have noother apparent foundation thorn,  a general desire to  attain globular  results.   It is submitted that these somewhat optimistic adumbrations should not  be  allowed toobscure the very substantial character of the economies actually effected economies which  go as far  as is compatible with the minimum  standard of security  at sea forwhich  the Admiralty can hold themselves responsible.

This large reduction is almost certainly greater than can be effected in one yearby wastage and the offering of free discharges; special retirement  terms must there-fore be considered.   If the Admiralty  can be  assured of the cordial co-operation ofthe Treasury in settling schemes for retirement without delay,  it may be possible to accelerate the rate of discharge represented by the above average for the year, but theAdmiralty do not consider it  safe to reckon on any more rapid reduction of numbers.    2. These numbers exclude (a)  Coastguard not required for Naval purposes, who should be transferred to the Votes of the Departments by whom they are required asfrom  the 1st April next (2,755 men); (b)  surplus Naval Officers, for whom a retire-ment  scheme must be approved so that  they can be got rid of within the year.                                                                         .

The figures assume that the settlement of the Marconi Company claim(for which  550,000 is provided in  the current year&apos;s estimates)  will be arrived atbefore the end of 1921-22.  This depends upon the Royal Commission on Awards and upon the Treasury.     Vote 8 III. No provision is made for payment of compensation to  Contractors inconsequence of cancellation of orders for Battle  Cruisers, but it may be difficult tosettle these claims before the end of  1921-22.

                                STATEMENT IV.                             Shore Establishments.    The following are the main reasons for the increased requirements for ShoreEstablishments :     1. The necessity for overtaking  the arrears of training of Officers and men,which should have been carried out, but lapsed on account of the war.    2. The change of policy regarding the continuing of training on the outbreakof Avar.    3. The necessity of fresh Training Establishments and Centres of Research,owing to the necessity of applying the lessons learned during the war and developing the various methods of  warfare  which then came  into existence.  A list  of  theseshowing  the additional personnel involved is attached.    4. The requirements of Officers are also apparently increased by the fact thatin many  branches  of Naval ratings it has been necessary to concede during the warfacilities for promotion to warrant rank and above as one of the measures (approvedby His Ma jesty&apos;s Government) for the improvement of conditions of service generally.These Warrant Officers and Officers promoted from warrant rank (who  take the placeof senior ratings)  are employed,  in the great majority of cases, in Shore Establish-ments, and therefore swell the total of Officers  in them.

Scientific Services.                                    Vote 6.    The Committee remark that the total expenditure in 1913-14 was  53,375, and recommend that  200,000, which is four times what it was in  1913-14, should beallowed for 1922-23. instead of  400.000 proposed in the Admiralty Sketch Estimate.    The Committee have  failed to  report that  it was clearly explained to them bythe Admiralty  that before the war the  Vote included only the two  Astronomical
[7720]Observatories  at  Greenwich  and  the  Cape, the  Hydrographic  Department, theNautical Almanac Office and the Greenwich Naval Museum, and that the presentVote provides  in addition for     1. The  Compass  Department,  the expenses of  which were  previously found          under  Votes  8 and 12;    2. Tiie  Scientific  Staff of the Signal School, which was formerly part of the          &quot; Vernon &quot; Establishment and paid for under Vote 4;    3. The  Scientific  Staff of the Mining School, which is an entirely new creation          to deal with  tiie development of the mine weapon since  the war; and    4. The  Department of Scientific Research, with its Laboratories at Teddington          and West Drayton and Greenwich, ail entirely new creations since 1914.This last Department  and its Laboratories are on a scale very much smaller, both in size and scope, than those created or projected as permanent necessities by Sir eric geddes when First Lord of the Admiralty.  .    The war showed the necessity for research in the Navy, and the Board of Inven-tion and Research was instituted as a temporary measure.    At the end of 1918 Sir Eric Geddes decided upon the appointment of a scientific adviser and  the retention of the Experimental Station at Shandon for  research.    A  Cabinet Committee on  a physical  research  institution for the Navy also recommended  the retention of Shandon as a Naval Experimental  Research Station,and, in addition,  the establishment of a central research laboratory.   The Presidentof the Royal Society,  in his address in November 1918. speaking on behalf of scien-tists,  urged  the need of  a Naval Research Laboratory.    Shandon  has been abandoned as a result of the need for economy, and a smallresearch laboratory at Teddington has replaced it.    After the war a Cabinet Sub-Committee, under the Presidency of Mr. Balfour,considered the question  of  co-ordination of research in the three fighting services.    As a result,  Co-ordinating Research Boards  were  set  up. upon  which  thefighting  services and   the Department  of Scientific and Industrial Research are represented.  The Cabinet Committee considered the research  and experimentalstations under the Admiralty,  including the establishments of Mining School andSignal School. There was no adverse criticism against these establishments and theCo-ordinating Boards have made no such  criticism.     As a result  of the  criticisms which were levelled during the war against theNavy for the  neglect of research, the Royal Society was in 1920 asked and agreed to nominate two of  its Fellows to  serve on an Advisory Council to the Controller of theNavy.  In January 1921 this Council passed the following resolution :-         &quot; That this meeting passes a resolution that, after considering the agenda     put forward and the report made by the Director of Scientific Research, it is of     opinion there is  ample  evidence that the  progress made in  scientific research     work has been most satisfactory, that it approves of the programme drawn up     for future investigation, and that the arrangements made as  to&apos; the number and     distribution  of staff are satisfactory in view of present  conditions.   Further,     the meeting  urges that no reduction in staff should on any  account be made, as it     is the  minimum  sufficient to make  a commencement on  urgent  and necessary     work included in the programme.&quot;     The figure of  53,375 taken by the  Committee as their pre-war  comparison is,in fact, much below the pre-war normal  figure, for a purely temporary cause.  Theaverage net figure for  this Vote for the ten years prior to the war, including  theone quoted  by the Committee, is  67,930.     To carry out the   recommendation of  the Committee,  that expenditure  for 1922-23 should be limited to   200,000, it would be necessary to  destroy  entirely the Department of Scientific Research and its Laboratories, and to discharge a large part  of the scientific  staff  of the Signal  and Mining  Schools.  The rest of the Vote is made up of the cost  of the pre-war staff of the Royal Observatories, the Nautical Almanac Office,  the Compass  Department, the Greenwich Naval Museum  and  the Hydrographic Department, as increased by the extra cost of pay and wages, which are governed  by  general decisions and cannot be reduced in detail. The work of the Experimental and Research Departments cannot be reduced  without  deplorable results, and the  abolition of the Astronomical Observatories, or the cessation of the work of charting the  seas, or  of  repairing and  adjusting compasses, could  not seriously be suggested as a means of economy.
statement I-;XT Y I        British Oil Fuel Policy us A fleeted by the  Washington Conference.    1. British Naval Oil Fuel Policy is designed to provide a  war reserve both for naval and trade purposes at home and abroad, and to alter the serious state of affairsarising out of the conversion of a coal-burning fleet to one burning oil, whereby ports of strategical importance lying on the sea routes of the Empire are unable to meet thebunkering requirements of a fleet on passage.    2. In past years bunkering  facilities existed at all  important British and dominion ports, and  it was always possible for a British Fleet to proceed to all theimportant centres of the Empire.  It will be remembered that a squadron of Battle-ships was maintained on the China  station.    3.  The establishment of reserves of oil  fuel offers far  greater difficulties thanreserves of coal.  In an emergency it was generally  possible  to dump a large amountof coal wherever it was wanted.  Oil fuel requires tanks which take time to build.Again,  most types of cargo ships  could be taken up  as coal carriers.  Oil requiresspecial tankers, and the world&apos;s supply of tankers will always remain far below war requirements.    4. The  greater part  of Adnriralty&apos;s  oil fuel programme during the next fewyears is designed to provide such oil  fuel reserves in and on the route to the Far Eastas will enable Great Britain to move a strong fleet as far as Singapore, and exert herNaval jjower should her Far Eastern interests, India or the  Australasian Dominionsbe menaced.    5. The  mobility  of  the British  Fleet  is probably one  of  the most  potentguarantees  of peace.  The Admiralty are  strongly of opinion that  the  presentsituation  in which the British  Fleet is practically  tied to European waters shouldnot be allowed to continue a day longer than possible.    6. Original Admiralty proposals, as put forward in C.I.D. Paper  145 C, were designed to  make it possible to move a fleet to Singapore by  192.5, although sufficientoil fuel reserves to ensure the freedom of action desired in a war with Japan wouldnot have been available until 1929.   The Admiralty accepted that risk in accordancewith  the  spirit of the  Government policy wmich lays  down that  no war is to  beexpected for ten years.   The Admiralty programme was endorsed by the Committeeof Imperial Defence.    7. Although the Admiralty  deprecate most strongly  any  departure from theprinciples underlying this policy,  certain factors  arising  out  of  the washington conference, namely, those in connection  with the reduction of Capital Ship Fleetsand: the altered  international  relationships which will result if  the  QuadrupledAgreement  is ratified, make it possible for them to contemplate certain  reductions in the provision of oil fuel storage.    8. As stated in paragraph 38 of the Admiralty Memorandum, therefore, theyare prepared to agree to a reduction in the Estimate for oil fuel reserves for 1922-23from   2,000,000  to  1,500,000, and consequently to spread the completion of total requirements, both as regards oil fuel  reserves at home  and  those abroad, over a slightly greater number of years, the date of the completion of the programme beingdeferred from 1929 to  1932.  Their agreement, however, is subject to the provisoscontained in paragraphs 10 and 12.    9.  It should be observed that the original Admiralty  intention was to  spendapproximately  3,500,000 on oil fuel reserve in 1922-23; this sum was reduced at alater  date to  2,000,000, and the Admiralty are now prepared to accept reduction to 1,500,000.    10. The above drastic reduction has been effected to meet insistent demands foran immediate reduction in expenditure, and, unless the mobility of the fleet is to beplaced  in jeopardy for an indefinite number of years, such reduction can only bemade on the  understanding  that  the  Estimates for  1923-24  and  immediately following years will  be proportionately increased.    11. While adhering to the principles underlying Admiralty policy  in regard tothe establishment of oil fuel reserves, it must be left open to the Admiralty to vary the application of those principles from time to time, to meet fluctuating economicand technical conditions (e.g.,  supply and price of oil fuel, availability of tankers,labour conditions as affecting erection of accommodation, price of material, size andspeed of fleet).    12. In  addition  to the above considerations, the Admiralty recognise that the
                               STATEMENT  VII.                                   Manning.    On p. 12 of the Interim Report,  the Committee state that          &quot; Although in the principles laid down by the Admiralty which  we have    detailed above, no mention is made of a margin over  and above the necessary    complements to bring ships and establishments up to their war crews of active    service ratings, we find from this disintegration that in 1914 there was a margin    not otherwise accounted  for of  7,200 men, which has now, with  a reduced fleet    and with increased provision in all establishments ashore, increased to 9,050 not    accounted for or justified in  any way whatever: &quot;    The Admiralty (in addition to much verbal explanation of the system),  suppliedthe Committee with  full details of manning  in 1914-15 and  1921-22,  and theCommittee reprinted the Admiralty tabular statement on pp. 31 to 33 of their Report.    The margin  is clearly shown,  see the  last item  in  the  table on p.  33;  nodisintegration was needed on the  part of the Committee to  discover it          300 Officers H-6,900 men  for 1914-15 = 7,200.         900 Officers-i-7,150 0^ = 8,050.Note No. 2 below the table explains a surplus of 700 Officers.    The difference between  the 8,050 and 9,050 is explained  by  the neglect of theCommittee to take any notice of the  note at the beginning of the table on p.  31.    They should  have taken 121,700  the  Vote  a figure to be reached  on the31st March,  1922, but neglecting the note they took the average for the year 122,700.    The shorter Admiralty statement referred to (which appears as Appendix (E 1)to the Interim Report) was in reality a reply to a specific point put by the Committeeto the Admiralty  in the form-of a presumption, as follows :           &quot; Any reduction  in the numbers  of  ships  in  full  commission  would    presumably reduce the numbers of Naval personnel.&quot;    The Admiralty reply was an explanation of what would ordinarily become ofthe balance  of the crew of a ship reduced from  full commission to reserve, and forthe purposes of that question was complete.    As regards the table  on  p. 11 of the  Interim Report  which forms the basis ofthe Committee&apos;s subsequent criticisms, it should  be pointed out that this table dealssolely with Mobilisation Allocation,  i.e., it shows how the  Active Service personnel of the Navy would in each of the  two years 1914 and 1921-22 have been disposed ofimmediately upon Mobilisation occurring.    The Tabular Statement provided by the Admiralty which appears on pp. 31  to33 of the Report (Appendix (E 2)  ) gave both  Peace Allocation and MobilisationAllocation, but the Committee appear to  have devoted no  attention to the former.Consequently  their  criticisms show no appreciation  of  the  fact that  PeaceAllocation and Mobilisation Allocation have doth to be considered in a service whichhas to provide in peace time for passing Officers and men through the various courses of training,  and giving them their due periods of home and foreign service, as wellas making allowance for such incidental matters as leave, imprisonment or detention,sickness, &amp;c.    It is necessary to lay stress on this point, as the table on p. 11 is liable to mislead,.unless  its meaning is clearly understood.  It might, for instance, at first sight, besupposed that the numbers shown for Harbour Ships under Group III indicate thatthe total complements of Harbour Ships in 1914 were only 4,000, and in 1921-22 had       [7720]                                                       F  2developments in the political  and international orientation may,  during the next decade,  introduce factors which will affect the foundations on which present  policyis based, and may necessitate drastic alteration of the existing programme. For thisreason,  the  present  proposals must be  regarded  as provisional,  and  in  no waycompromising  the  Admiralty&apos;s   freedom of  action in  recommending increased provision for the storage or accumulation of oil fuel in years to come.
risen to  11,600.  This  would be an entire mistake,  as  the actual numbers (easilya seer tamable from Appendix (E 2)) were:              1914   ...       ...      ...       ...       ...    12,100             1921-22         ...      ...       ...       ...    12,600     The figures on p. 11 only relate to the number of Active Service  Officers and menwho would, under the arrangements existing in  1914 and 1921-22 respectively, havebeen retained in these establishments on  mobilisation, the large difference being dueto the change of policy  explained in paragraph 26 of the Admiralty Memorandum.     Tlie fallacies underlying the  Committee&apos;s proposition that  the  numbers ofOfficers and men  employed on the services which they classify as &quot;Group II &quot;  and&quot; Group III &quot; should bear a fixed proportion to the numbers employed in &quot; Group I,&quot;have already  been  pointed  out in paragraphs 18 and  22-25  of the admiralty memorandum.     It is necessary now, however, to point out that, even if their own premises are accepted, the  Committee&apos;s  calculations  on pp. 12 and  13 of the  Report containarithmetical and  other  errors, which would render, necessary extensive correction intheir conclusions.     These  calculations  are based on the  following allocation of Naval personnel: Fleet (Group I)Smaller  ships  and  auxiliaries  (Group II)Harbour  ships  (Group  III  ex  Coastgtiard)CoastguardCadets and boysMargin for  sick, crossing reliefs,  training, &amp;c.

The 1914  numbers  (Peace Allocation) of  these  two  Groups, however, wererespectively 11,300 and  12,600,  as shown in Appendix  (E 2) total  23,900, and,853 is not a 37 per cent,  reduction on  23,900.   15,057  would be a  37 per cent.reduction on 23,900.  8,853  is a 63 per cent, reduction.-    Either, therefore,  the Committee are not providing the 12,841 men whom theyclaim to have provided  for employment for crossing  reliefs, training, &amp;c, or elsethey are effecting a reduction of 63 per cent, and not 37 per cent, in the 1914 PeaceComplements of Groups  II  and III.   The origin of this error will be  found in thesecond paragraph of p.  13  of  the Report,  where  the  Committee make the obviousmistake of adding together          8,494 men whose posts are fixed in war, but not in peace, and         4,347 men whose posts are fixed in peace,  but not in war.and treating the latter,  as  well  as the former, as available in  peace  for crossingreliefs, training,  &amp;c.    When divested of arithmetical errors, the allocations proposed by the Committeeseem to be as follows: Fleet (Group I)Smaller   snips  and   auxiliaries     (Group II)        ......Harbour  Ships  (Group  III)   ex     CoastguardCoastguardCadets and BoysMargin  for sick,  crossing  reliefs,     training,  &amp;c.Allocation in Peace. 60,106  7,119*  7,938*  2,600  4,000  6,637 88,400Mobilisation Allocation. 68,600 11,340*  2,960*  1,500  4,000   Nil88,400These figures are a 37 per cent, reduction on the corresponding 191-1 figures.
    These allocations are impossible  for  the  following  reasons, apart  from the inadequacy of the numbers in Groups II and III :-    (a.) The Committee  allow  no margin for sick and crossing  reliefs in the          War Allocation.   Consequently, full Mobilisation could only take  place          at some &quot; selected moment,&quot; when no one was sick and when no crews          were on passage either to or from abroad.   In actual fact, such a moment          never occurs.    (b.) The Peace Margin of 6,637 to cover sick, crossing reliefs, training, &amp;c, is a          quite  inadequate  working  and training  allowance  for  the  Fleet,  as,          indeed, is also the margin of 12,841 which the Committee intended but          failed to  allow.    The following figures give details of the requirements under this heading  :                Employment  of &quot; Margin &quot; during November 1921.Crossing reliefs         ...       ...       ...       ...      3,200On Foreign Service Leave, and Drafting Leave      ...      1,500Sick            ...............      2,673Prison and detention    ...       ...       ...       ...       120Training, all branches,  R.N.      ...       ...       ...      5,651Marines in Barracks, including all training ...       ...      4,150Men within three months of completing engagement ...      1,415Trial crews,  firing trials, &amp;c.     ...       ...       ...       750On Leave  from Depots  (excluding  permanent com-    plements)   ...      ...       ...       ...       ...       550                                                                20,009    (c.) The Committee&apos;s proposals in regard to  Coastguard overlook the fact that           the  Coastguard is not now, as it was in 1914, an Active Service force.           It has been transformed into a Pensioner force,  and it cannot therefore           provide any Active Service ratings for allocation in war.    (d.) In judging of the practicability of the Committee&apos;s recommendations, it           must not  be overlooked that they have taken no account of the necessity           of  a reasonable alternation between  shore  and  sea service  for  Naval           personnel.    The general standard  laid down for very many years has been that men  shouldhave one year of shore service (including training courses) to  two years of sea service.    In practice, the proportion has tended to become one year of  shore service toabout three years of  sea service, and this has been a  standing grievance on the partof the men.    Now, roughly speaking, sea service  is represented  by Groups I and II  in theAllocation Table and shore service by Group III (ex Coastguard) and by the Margin(ex crossing reliefs).    The Committee&apos;s Peace Allocation assigns 67,000 men  to sea service and onlyadmits of 11,500 men being assigned to Group  III (ex Coastguard) and the Margin(ex crossing reliefs).    This  would necessarily result in men having nearly six years&apos; sea service toone year of shore service.   It would be impossible under such conditions to  expect the men of the  Navy to be  anything but stale and discontented. STATEMENT VIII.Number of Officers.                   (a.) Comments on Criticisms of Committee.    1  The  number of Officers in the Royal Navy is  not, and never can  be, fixed on a proportionate system based on the number  of men.   In ships, the number  ofOfficers is determined by the duties for  which Officers are required in  action.  Assea warfare becomes more complicated by  new  methods and  new weapons andinstruments, more Officers are required.    -2. A comparison between the ratio of Officers to men now and in 1914-15 is just as misleading as it would be to make a comparison between now and in 1805, if  no
allowance is made for modern progress in ships and weapons, and the steady additionof more scientific appliances.    3. As an  instance,  it may be worth referring to  the reduction of 24,000  menreferred to by the Committee.  This reduction is very largely accounted for by thereduction of engine-room ratings clue to the substitution of oii fuel for coal.  Beforethe war there were 1.616  Engineer Officers and  44,906 engine-room  ratings,  and while the number of engineer Officers has remained about the same, since the  amountof machinery, the number of boiler-rooms,  &amp;c, in  oil-burning vessels necessitatesmuch the same supervising stall  as in  coal-burning vessels, the number of  ratingshas fallen by  about 20,000.   This alone accounts for most of the increase of the ratio  in the Fleet  of Officers to men,  since the total  number of Officers  has not increased to any large extent.    4. In addition, the  greater proportion of small craft  in  the Fleet leads  to ahigher  proportion of Officers, since the proportion of Officers to ratings in thesecraft, particularly in Submarines, is higher than in the large ships.    5. Another  contributing factor is  the increase  in  the facilities for promotion to the lower deck since  1914-15.   Prior to the  war  facilities for promotion to warrant rank existed (to any but a small extent) only in a few branches; since  then it has been the policy of the Board of Admiralty (with the approval of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment) to extend  such facilities, until  at  the  present  time practically all branches of  the Service have the rank open  to them.    6. Also since 1914, owing to the experience gained during the war, many newrequirements for Officers have arisen.   Take, for example,  the Naval Staff.   At thecommencement of the  war Admiralty War Staff  had only been in existence  some two years and consisted of a skeleton organisation, which had to be expanded  withuntrained Officers as the war proceeded.  Throughout the  war the  Admiralty was heavily  criticised from  all  directions  for  their  unpreparedness  in  this  respect.Officers trained  in staff  duties are an essential to any war organisation, and  suchtraining must be carried out in  peace.   It follows, therefore, that there  must bemeans of training them,  and for this reason alone  a Naval  Staff organisation at theAdmiralty and  corresponding staff organisations, even if  only  on a very modest scale, in the various commands, are required.Marine Officers.    7.  As regards the Royal Marines, the  increased proportion of  Officers to men now borne as compared with the pre-war proportion is due to the fact that, owingto no entries of Officers in  the Royal Marines being made from 1908-12, the numberof Royal Marine  Officers  on the list  immediately before the war  was from 70to 100 short of the number actually required.Flag  Officers.     8.  The number of Flag Officers is, it is true, the same as before the war, but this number  was fixed as far back as 1903, or eleven years before the commencement ofthe war.  The Admiralty recognise, however, that  the Flag List as at present consti-tuted is in excess of post-war requirements, and are in favour of a reduction of thenumbers on that list, as soon as this can be done  without detrimental effect on theCaptains&apos; and Commanders&apos; Lists.  But while these lists are much overborne, any reduction in the Flag List would only increase  the difficulties  which   are  being experienced with regard to them.Executive Officers below Flag Rank.     9.  In their table the Committee omit the following ranks :                                                         August 1,                                                         1914.         Lieutenant - Commanders,  Supplementary             List     ...       ... &apos;     ...                 23         Lieutenants, Supplementary List         ...        64         Sub-Lieutenants,  Supplementary List    ...         4         Acting  Sub-Lieutenants       ...       ...       123         Mates       ...               ...       ...        61October 1.  1921.  28  12  21  1327574
    These  additions to the  numbers quoted give totals of 3,587 and 4,311 respee-tively, i.e., the increase in 1921 is 724.  Further, of this 724, 124 are Officers bornefor or qualifying for engineering duties under the Common Entry Scheme, as corn-pared with only 33 in  1914, when the scheme had not come fully into operation, sothat the difference is properly 633 and not 925, as stated by the Committee.  More-over, this number includes a number of Officers from warrant rank promoted addi-tionally during the war, who are not subject  to the regulations for retirement fornon-service.    10. The  remaining excess  is entirely  due to a  surplus of Officers borne overrequirements, owing (1) to the fact that the number of  Officers retiring voluntarilyunder the special terms of retirement offered in 1920  was not sufficient to clear the lists completely, in spite of the fact that a reduction of about a thousand Officers was effected; and (2) to scrutinies of the lists subsequently to the operation of the schemeof retirement having resulted in further reductions in requirements.    11. The Committee, after remarking  that a surplus of Officers cannot but leadto increased expenditure and that the matter should be  dealt with, even though the remedy may result in  a considerable increase in the non-effective vote, and afterexpressing an intention to refer  to the point  at a later stage, recommend that theAdmiralty should not bring back  Officers temporarily from the unemployed  and half-pay  lists on to the full  pay list, with the  result of preventing them from beingretired for non-service.    12. The intention  of the Committee is not very clear ; they may mean either thatthey recognise that any Officers to  be compulsorily retired must be granted specialterms of  retirement as compensation, and that the Admiralty should take action in anticipation of such terms of retirement being sanctioned by placing the Officers tobe got rid of on half-pay, or  that Officers should be placed on half-pay and kept thereuntil retired  under the ordinary  regulations for retirement for non-service.    13. This latter course,  however, would be entirely contrary  to  all  ideas ofjustice.  The great majority of  Naval Officers were entered  as Cadets  at a  very early age, and from that time received a special training and education designed to fit them for their duties in the Naval Service.  They are therefore in an exception-ally disadvantageous position  if their Naval career is cut short  and they have tofind a position for themselves outside the Service.    14.  In the case of temporary Officers  entered only for service during the war,on the clear understanding that they would then have to return to civil life, it was thought necessary by His Majesty&apos;s Government to provide them with a substantialwar gratuity and also to make liberal arrangements for enabling&apos; them to complete their education or to undergo training for various occupations and professions incivil life.  The Naval  Officer has  served, not only during the war, but also, in manycases, for a considerable time previously, and he is in most cases of too advanced an age to enter a new profession with  any prospect of success.    15.  It is  inconceivable, even  under  present conditions,  that  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment could contemplate dealing  with such Officers in a less generous mannerthan that in  which the temporary Officer,  who has far  less claim on  the State, hasbeen dealt with.    16.  There is something to  be said for the other alternative, but in this connec-tion it may be remarked that  the  proposals of the Admiralty with regard to thereduction of the Captains&apos;  and Commanders&apos; Lists are already before the Treasury,and that the  approval  of that Department, which has not yet been given, is all thatis necessary to enable the schemes to be brought into operation.  The Admiralty havealready taken certain steps to anticipate retirements by arranging that every Officerof Commanders  and Lieutenant-Commander&apos;s rank who has earned by service themaximum rate of retired pay of his rank,  shall, on completing his present appoint-ment, be informed that he will not be employed again, but apart from this, the policy adopted  is that appointments  should be  shared  between all Officers on the list ofgood service  and character.    No further steps  can  be  taken  without  involvinginjustice.    17.  The proposals already made to the Treasury would result ultimately  in  areduction of about 272 (90 on the Captains&apos; List and 182 on the Commanders&apos; List).In addition,  the  Admiralty are considering the Lieutenants&apos; and Lieutenant-Com-manders&apos; List, and hope shortly to be able to propose a scheme for making a substa,n-tial reduction in that list, which would reduce the total numbers of Executive Officersbelow that of 1914.     18.  In this connection, however, it must be pointed out that the requirements of
the Fleet cannot be met solely  by a total number of Officers of a particular  rankbeing available, since a surplus of Officers of certain ages and seniorities does notcompensate, except within certain narrow limits, for a deficiency of Officers of otherages and seniorities, even although of the same rank.&apos; It is necessary, therefore, toconsider separately the  requirements of Officers of  certain  ranges  of  age   andseniority, a matter of some complexity and difficulty.  Proposals will, however, be framed and put before the Treasury as quickly as possible,    19. The Committee  are in  error in thinking that a similar surplus applies inthe ease of the Engineer  Branch.  Owing  to Warrant Officers and  Officers  fromwarrant rank  being  employed  as  well as  Commissioned Officers as watchkeepingOfficers,  the establishment  of the Engineer Branch is  a  combined  establishment,including Warrant Officers and Officers from warrant rank.    If these Officers are  included, the total numbers are :              August 1.  1914  ...       .......       ...    1.591             October  1.  1921 ...       ...       ...       ...    1,536             January 1, 1922 ...      ...       ...       ...    1,513a decrease, and not an increase.    There is in this branch a small surplus of numbers borne over numbers required,but this surplus is too small to call for any special arrangements for getting rid of it.(b.)

                                STATEMENT IX.                    Commanders-in-chiefs Staffs and Retinues.     1. An analysis of the  duties of  the  &quot; Stalls and Retinues &quot; is attached,  which shows how misleading is the use which the Committee has made of the information contained in Appendix (F)  1, 2 and 3.     2. It will be apparent  that the expression &quot; Staffs and Retinues&apos;- is really used in a very comprehensive sense, and  includes all Officers and men within the Command serving  for convenience of  administration more or less directly under the orders of the Commander-in-chief. It includes not  only the War Staff of the command and the Officers  and men attached to the Commander-in-chief personally, but also a number of Officers and men engaged on duties which in no way depend upon the existence of the command as a separate command.  The necessity for the employment of these Officers  and men, therefore,  will continue in any case.     The numbers are being carefully reviewed, and such reductions  as are possible will be  made, but apart from  those due to the abolition  of  the  Commands  of Queenstowm and Rosyth, no considerable  savings are to be expected.     3. The  Committee  comments  upon  the  high rates  of  allowances  granted to Commanders-in-chief, and points out  that with a salary of  2,500 a year over  3,000 is  drawn in cash allowances.   As  to  this, it may be said that Table Money, which accounts for about five-sixths of the allowances, is granted for the purpose of meeting the entertainment expenses  wdiich have necessarily to be incurred by the Commander- in-chief of a large port.  The  present rate is 50 per cent, in excess of the pre-war rate, whereas the increased cost of this particular class of expense is still far more than 50  per cent, in excess  of pre-war cost.     Far from this allowance being at an  extravagent rate, it may be  stated that no Flag Officer can  possibly  accept  a  command such as Portsmouth  unless he  has considerable private means  upon which to draw.     4. This may be the most convenient place to deal with the Committee&apos;s comments on  the  number  of  Officers&apos; Stewards and  Cooks authorised  for  Flag Officers, Commodores and Commanding Officers.     The Admiralty are inclined to  think that no great inconvenience would probably he  caused if the number of  servants allowed to an Admiral afloat were the same as allowed  to a Vice-Admiral  (i.e., seven instead of ten), and  are  investigating this. As a rule, only two Admirals will be  concerned, and it is known that in some cases an Admiral has not actually availed himself of his ten servants.  The  other numbers are considered to be reasonable, having regard to the  facts that they are based on the needs of a Flag Officer or Commanding Officer serving afloat, so that all require- ments  have to  be marketed on shore  and brought off to the  ship, and that a Flag Officer, by the Regulations of the Service,  also messes his personal Staff.     5. Although  not specifically mentioned in  the Report,  it is understood from other sources of information that the Committee  lay great stress on the fact that the Commanders-in-chief are provided with bands.  It is understood also that  the existence of Naval bands afloat is not objected to, their value  in assisting discipline, encouraging morale, and generally promoting a good Service spirit being recognised.     6. It must, however, be pointed out that if Naval bands  are to exist afloat it is a  necessity to have some means  of utilising  their services and  maintaining their musical efficiency on shore, since Bandsmen, no less than other ratings, require and are entitled to terms  of  home service. If the Commanders&apos;-in-chief  bands were to be  abolished, the  Bandsmen would  still have to be utilised somewdrere during their periods of shore service.     7. Moreover, in this, as in other  cases connected with the so-called Retinues of the Commanders-in-Chief, -  the Committee has failed to  recognise that  the bands, although attached to the Commanders-in-chief, are in reality used for general port purposes.  They are lent very freely  to the Naval Establishments in the port, and are, of course, used on all occasions of ceremony, e.g., the reception of foreign officers or  distinguished persons, and at Naval funerals, ceremonial  drills and reviews, &amp;c. Further, they are constantly in request for the various charitable functions in which the Navy is interested.  They thus play a  part in maintaining the popularity of the Naval Service in the Home Ports from the  neighbourhood of which so large a propor- tion of the personnel is still recruited, and also serve, in those Ports (where a  large number of ratings is always training), the same purpose, which the Naval  bands serve afloat, of promoting pride in the Service and the instinct for discipline.     8.  In regard to the position of Commander-in-chief  generally, the Admiraltycannot refrain from adding  that in  the case of many of the most august institutions
of this country a certain amount of dignity and display is still retained which might easily  be attacked  in the  same spirit  in which  this portion of  the Interim Reportappears to be framed.  The general good sense  of the community, however, realisesthat the relatively  small  amount of money expended  in this way is well spent, andthis is particularly true in the case of the Navy, where, as  in every disciplined service,a certain outward&apos; and visible emphasis on the gradations of  rank is essential.

H.M.S.  &quot; Enchantress.&quot;    The estimated  approximate  cost of  running  and  maintaining  H.M.S.&quot;Enchantress&quot;  during 1921-22 is  28,090, made  up as follows:-                                                                           Repairs and alterations  ...       ...       ...     17,000            Fuel and  other consumable stores ...       ...      9,700            Personnel  (6 men for Care and Maintenance)      1,150            Non-effective liability     ...       ...       ...       240                           Total     ...       ...       ...     28,090    The estimated cost  of the crew  of  H.M.S. &quot;Enchantress&quot; for 1921-22 is 58,610, made up as follows :                                                                            Pay, victualling,  &amp;c.     ...       ...       ...     43,950            Non-effective liability     ...       ...       ...      9,660                            Total    ...      ...       ...     53,610     It is pointed out, however,  that the cost of the crew  ( 53,610) would not be saved in the event of H.M.S. &quot;Enchantress&quot; being abolished; as the  Officers andmen are required for  the  War  Fleet.   In other words, the  abolition of  H.M.S.&quot; Enchantress &apos;&apos; would not admit of a reduction in Vote A  numbers, except the sixmen for  &quot;Care and Maintenance&quot; duties.     In  connection with the duties  on which the  &quot;Enchantress&quot; is employed,attention is called to the attached copy of an Admiralty  Letter contained in theReport of the Select Committee on Remuneration of Ministers (1920). During 1921,the First Lord used the &apos;&apos; Enchantress&apos;&apos; for visiting the Fleet at sea, following the squadrons and Ships at their various exercises.  He was also  able to carry out his desire to get in close personal touch, not only with  the Flag Officers, but with theprincipal Executive Officers of the units composing the Fleet and with as manyOfficers as possible representative of the other  branches of the Service.   Without the&quot;Enchantress &quot; this programme could not have been carried out.   The party couldnot have been embarked in a fighting ship owing to the absence of surplus accom-modation;  it is perhaps hardly necessary to state that accommodation  in a  modernShip-of-AVar is confined to the narrowest possible limits, being barely sufficient forthe ship&apos;s crew : Sir,                                                      November 25,  1920.     In reply to your letter of the 24th November, I request you to place before theSelect Committee on Ministers&apos; Remuneration the following information concerningHis Majesty&apos;s Yacht  &quot;Enchantress&quot; :      1. His  Majesty&apos;s Yacht &quot;Enchantress&quot; is mainly  used for official Board-inspections of Naval ports and establishments in the United Kingdom.   Before thewar it was the practice of the Board of Admiralty to make official visits of ceremony
every year to each of the principal Naval establishments, spending two to tour daysat each port,  according to the amount of business to be transacted.  These ports werePortsmouth, Devonport, Chatham, Sheerness, Queenstown and Pembroke. Portlandand Dover would generally be visited as well, and, when the normal routine in peacetime is resumed, no doubt Rosyth, which was completed as a Naval Dockyard during .the war, will be added,  it has also been the practice for some members of the board to pay similar visits to Gibraltar and Malta in the *&apos; Enchantress &quot; about once every two years.   The full  Board cannot,  for  administrative reasons, take part in suchdistant inspections, but two members  of the Board  with  a Secretary constitute  aBoard of Admiralty for official  purposes.  The First Lord with other members ofthe Board have also made a  practice  of visiting other ports in the United Kingdomwhere there are Naval establishments or where Naval interests are affected, such asCowes for  Osborne  College, Dartmouth, Invergordon, Sea pa Flow,  and the ship-building centres on the Dumber,  the Tyne, the Clyde  and the Mersey.  On very rareoccasions,  by arrangement  with  the  Foreign Office, the First Lord, accompaniedgenerally by  other members of the Board, lias paid special visits to the ports ofAllied and friendly Powers.  In this way Naples was  visited in 1907, Bizerta  andGenoa in 1909, and this summer Ostencl, Heligoland, Copenhagen and Christiania.Ministers who take part in these visits are, as far as  official visits to Naval ports athome are concerned, confined to those who are members of  the Board  of Admiralty.For the less formal  inspections it is sometimes convenient  for other Ministers to beinvited to join the party if the  work  of their  Department is  concerned, but theseoccasions are infrequent.    2. It cannot be said that a Minister who travels  on board His Majesty&apos;s Yacht&quot;Enchantress&quot; has any pecuniary advantage  over  a  colleague who  is repaid hisout-of-pocket expenses when travelling on official duty, though no doubt by travellingon the &quot;Enchantress&quot; he is able to  proceed with  Tar greater personal convenienceand to reach  places that would otherwise be  practically inaccessible.    3. The First Lord has  for many years  exercised the  privilege of entertainingpersonal guests on board the &apos;&apos; Enchantress&apos;&apos; when the whole of the  cabins are notoccupied by members of the Board  to whom they should be  assigned.   He refunds tothe Crown  the total extra expenses incurred by the entertaining of these guests bythe payment of an inclusive  rate, which more than covers the actual cost.    4. I do  not  think airy reasonable case can be made out for  regarding the privilege of travelling in the &quot; Enchantress &quot; as a  form of emolument  any more than can be urged in respect of a Minister travelling or visiting on public duty in another way.  It is,  of course, true that  the  Minister who  has his maintenance expenseswhile so travelling  refunded to  him in full  escapes the cost of actual subsistencewhich would fall upon him were  he not so travelling,  but the position in this respectis precisely the same, whether,  for instance,  the Minister is attending a  PeaceConference in Paris or visiting Naval  ports  in the &quot;Enchantress.&quot;                                               Believe me. &amp;c.                                                       V.  W. BADDELEY.                               STATEMENT XL                               Medical Services.    1. The increase in the Medical Vote apart from Vote 1 is due to (1) increase in cost of Surgical and Dental Appliances, X-Ray Apparatus and Laboratory Gear,which has  advanced from 80 per cent, to 100 per cent, all round.   Details are asfollows:                 INCREASED Costs due to Medical Appliances, Pay, &amp;c.Cost in 1913-14.		Cost in 1921-22.	Proposed for 1922-23.Surgical and dental instruments and appliances, X-ray apparatus and lahora-tory gear Salaries and allowances Wages, &amp;c, ot Hospital servants and sick berth staff Wages of police	  7,500 66,569 77,960 5,347	  23.600 141,781 238,910 8,446&apos;	  20,200 139,000 218,810 2,260
    2. The increased  cost  of  Surgical Instruments,  &amp;c., is due  to  advance inprices roughly 80 per cent, to 100 per cent,  all round and  increased supplies of dental Stores and Appliances,  X-Ray and Laboratory Apparatus.                            Salaries and A llowances.    3. The numbers  borne  in 1913-14,  1921-22 and  proposed  for  1922-23 are215, 357  and 253 respectively.  The large increase of numbers between 1913-14 and1921-22  is mainly accounted for by the provision for Reserve Nursing Sisters, Headand Assistant  Massage Sisters, Masseuses and V.A.D.&apos;s 114 in all.  These are for the most part temporary appointments.   An  increase  of  3 Junior AccountantOfficers,  7  Commissioned and Warrant Wardmasters,  13 Pensioner and TemporaryClerks and 1 Senior Station Supervisor (a transfer from the Hired List)  has alsobeen made.    4. The total proposed for 1922-23 is 253, no provision being made for ReserveNursing  Sisters or V.A.D.&apos;s.             Wages, &amp;c., of Hospital Servants and Sick Berth Staff.    5. The number borne in 1913-14, 1921-22 and proposed for 1922-23 are 1,339,1,465 and  1,457 respectively.  The increase in numbers borne is due mainly to theemployment of Dental Mechanics  and Assistants, 31  Civilian Warders (in lieu ofPolice),  Ambulance Drivers and  15 Sick Berth Staff, in addition to the  numbersborne 1913-14.   The  other  increases are due to employment  of  increased  generallabour at the various establishments.                               Wages of Police.    6. The decrease of numbers is due to the employment of Civilian  Warders in lieu of Metropolitan Police.                                    General.    7. The treatment  of Medical and  Surgical Diseases has gone up  in cost andlabour during the last few years  to an unthought-of degree.   As examples of theincrease  in the work of medical diagnosis and treatment as compared wdth pre-wrarmethods, the following are cited :     (a.)  In pre-war  days  the  X-Rays were  used solely  to  locate fractures  and           foreign bodies.  To-day with patients admitted  for diseases of the lungs           examination is not considered complete until the chest has been X-Rayed.    (&amp;.)  Diseases of the stomach and  intestines now require extensive X-Ray photo-           graphs to watch the passage of a bismuth meal.    (c.)  Venereal  diseases:  Syphilis  in  pre-war  days was  treated   by  the           administration of pills or inunction, whereas to-day Syphilis is treated           in addition by  the  introduction  of  powerful arsenical  preparations           injected into the vein,  requiring elaborate preparation and  considerable           skill in technique in addition  to repeated  bacteriological investigations.           The treatment of Gonorrhoea to  a great  extent used  to be left to the           patient to carry out himself, but now has to be carried out by the Medical           Officer or by  Sick Berth Stewards specially trained under  the Medical           Officer.     (d.)  The apparatus for this runs into appreciable increases in expenditure.  The           bacteriological examination of blood, urine, sputum and other specimens,           e.g., pus is now very extensive, and takes a great deal of exacting and           lengthy labour.     (e.)  During the war a staff of Massage Sisters and Masseuses was  inaugurated           and employed at Naval Hospitals.   It is the  intention that when the           Sick Berth staff are sufficiently trained they will replace these Masseuses,           but it is considered as part of the permanent  complement  of  Haslar,           Plymouth  and Chatham  one  Massage Sister for  educational  purposes           should be retained.                      Pooling of Hospitals with the Army.     8. On the 28th December a meeting was called at the  War Office to consider towhat extent the two Services could combine in the hospital treatment of the sick of
the Naval and  Military  Services.   The Medical Director-General and  the deputy director-General represented the Naval Medical Service.    9. It  was  considered  that   after  the  initial  difficulties  due  to differentregulations and routines in the two Services had been overcome, it would be practicable for one  hospital to cater  for the requirements of both  Services in many places.  Forinstance, it was considered that the R.N. Hospital, Chatham, could accommodate the sick of both Services at Chatham and Gravesend and relieve Deal to a great extent;also that Dover and STiorncliffe could be combined at Shorncliffe; that R.N. Hospital,Haslar,  could take the patients from Hilsea, Cosham and Gosport.    10.  Eastney  and Forton have only infirmaries attached to the barracks, andalready  send all their serious cases to Haslar.   The)&apos; are very economically run and could not be completely shut down.  Netley is the clearing station for troops fromabroad,  and also has a  hundred  beds for mental cases.  This would  have  to beretained.  At first sight it seemed  probable that the R.N. Hospital. Plymouth, could take the Military cases in Devonport.  Further investigation is being  made.    11.  South  Queensferry  before the war was a small  sick quarters.   As Rosythgrew a number of huts was  built to compete with the extra requirements of Rosythand Port Edgar.   It was given the title of a hospital, but is really only a glorifiedsick quarters with huts added.  It was not considered that Military cases could be accomodated  there, nor  that  the Naval  eases could be taken  into the MilitaryHospital in Edinburgh.  The Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh is  always full and hascases  waiting of the civil population, and it is only very occasionally  that they canspare a  bed for a Naval case of some special character.    12.  Pembroke Hospital can be surrendered at any time, and only  its disposalremains for consideration.                                    A broad.    13.  No difficulties were evident in combining the two forces  at Gibraltar, butdetails were left for later consideration.  Amalgamation at Malta presented many difficulties as regards numbers and geographical distribution.  In Bermuda, again,the geographical distribution of the two forces made a combined hospital practically impossible.  The Naval  hospital at  Hong  Kong could accommodate some Militarycases, but  this question  required information  which was not at hand, and was referred for. future discussion.    14. The combination outlined above would effect economy in many  of the over-head  charges,  but in no case  would it represent a clean cut.  Although Haslar iscredited with  having beds equipped  for 72 Officers and  934 men the medical and nursing staff are calculated  for 500, the remaining accommodation represents closedwards which could be opened, in an emergency.   It was roughly estimated that theMilitary would require 200 beds,  and when sent to Flaslar would necessitate extramedical and nursing staffs, extra cooks and clerical staff and baggage store labourers.     15. When  a sailor or soldier  is sent  into a Naval or Military hospital it is  amuch more complicated affair than a civilian  going into a civil hospital; the latterpresents himself  or herself  with a night shift and washing and  toilet  necessaries.A bluejacket takes all his belongings, personal  and service, viz., his  bag, his  dittybox and hammock.  These all have to be taken official charge of and the bag sealed.In a big hospital this baggage accommodation and staff is very considerable?     16. He also brings official medical and accountant papers with him which areregistered  and  checked; this requires the clerical staff.  These offices,  which are notapparent on the  surface,  all help considerably to  make up the  12 per  headreferred to.                               STATEMENT  XII.            Dockyards:  High Ratio of Wages Bill to Material Used.     The Committee&apos;s criticisms under this heading require and are receiving carefulexaminrtion, but they are based, as the Committee admits, on a very rough and ready-generalisation, which leaves room  for grave inaccuracies.     Some  of the factors which enter into the question, and which the Committeedo not seem to have duly weighed,  are  the following :       (a.) New  construction work differs essentially from  repair and  reconstruction           work.  The  ratio of labour to  material in the last two is much higher       [7720]                                                           H
          than  in the former, whether the work  is done  in a dockyard  or in a          private yard.    (b.) New construction work varies, in respect of the  ratio, in the different stages          of building a ship,  in the completing stages the labour expenditure is          proportionately  much  higher than  in  the  earlier  stages  when  the          structural materials are issued.   The new  construction work provided          for in  the  dockyard programme  for 1921-22  was  mostly upon vessels          which had been very far progressed in private yards and then transferred          to the dockyards for completion.  The materials for  these ships had been          mostly  covered  previously by the contractors&apos;  claims.    (c.) The dockyards charge direct to labour certain expenses which private yards          treat as establishment charges, e.g., wages of draughtsmen.    (d.) Private yards include under materials all payments to sub-contractors and          numerous miscellaneous payments, eg., hire of  plant.  Dockyard  charges          for &quot;materials are  limited to the  cost of stores  actually expended on the          ship or for  running the plant used in connection with the work upon her.          All  materials manufactured in  the  dockyards for the ship are again          divided into labour  and materials.  Further, the values of the materials          shown in Navy Estimates and Accounts are the net values after deducting          returns, which in the case of repairs often equal 30 per cent, of the value          of materials issued.    An attempt has been made to obtain the cost of ships of a somewhat  similartype built during the war by contract and by dockyards respectively.    The accompanying Statement marked (A) shows the actual expenditure incurred on the hulls of a number of  contract  built  Cruisers and  Torpedo-Boat  Destroyerswhich have  been taken at random.    Save  in a  few  special instances  propelling machinery  for dockyard  ships is supplied and fitted by  contract, and comparisons covering both  hull and. machinery,as between contract and dockyard must therefore be  confined to hulls.    So far  as dockyard new  construction is concerned  the figures on Statement  (B)show the actual cost of dockyard labour and materials for a number of Light Cruiser?built during the war.  The ratio between labour and materials  is 1-8 :1.    The difference between the contract and  dockyard ratios (Statements  (A)  and(B) ) is probably clue to the inclusion under the materials heading for contract ships of amounts  for sub-contracts, and further  to differences of accounting procedurealready referred to.    As regards repairs, the Admiralty had, during the war, ample experience  of workof this nature being done by  contract,  and the claims as sent in by the firms may betaken as sufficiently accurate for the purpose of showing the ratio between labourand materials for contract work of this nature.    A number of contractors&apos; claims have been casually selected and examined.   Itis, however,  necessary  to omit all sub-contracts and  certain  other charges to enable a reasonable comparison to be made  with costs of  labour and materials for similar work in the  dockyards.    On the  basis of the accompanying Statement (C), the ratio between labour and materials  for contract  repairs is found to be 4-3:1.    Particulars have further been obtained  as to the cost incurred in the dockjrardsfor carrying out &quot; large &quot; and  &quot; periodical refits &quot; to a number of vessels which, asin the other  case, were selected at random.  The particulars are shown on Statement(D), from  which it will be seeen that the ratio between labour and materials  on such work is 3 :1.    As the  ratio in the case of similar work done by contract is shown on Table (C)to be 4-3 :1,  the comparison is not unfavourable to the dockyards.    With the evidence  at present before them, therefore, the  Admiralty  are  notprepared to accept the criticism of the Committee  as being justified by facts.    It may  be recalled that an experiment was made on a large scale a little less than twenty years ago in the direction of putting out Naval repair work to private yardsinstead of dealing with it in the dockyards.    The results from  the point of view of economy were extremely unsatisfactory,and were condemned by the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Commons.

The number of Motor Transport vehicles employed by the Admiralty  has  been steadily  reduced since the Armistice  as the decrease in work has permitted.   InNovember 1918, there were 1,030 such vehicles as against the 481 referred to by theCommittee.    The working  of these  vehicles is kept  constantly under review, andfurther  reductions  to  the  extent  of twenty vehicles  have  been made since  theinformation was furnished to the Committee.     The committee&apos;s reference to the Admiralty claim that  economy and efficiencyhave resulted  from the  introduction of  modern  methods of transport does  not adequately express the  position.  The Admiralty did not place  a complete expensestatement before  the Committee because  the intricacies of accounting preventedthem from doing so, but they furnished  a  full and complete  statement showing the directions in  which the introduction of motor  vehicles&apos; had reduced  expenditure.A copy of this statement is attached for information.     The recommendation of the Committee that  careful cost  figures should be worked up for the information of  the Treasury has, in effect, been complied withfor  more than  a year during  which the  Treasury  have been furnished  with aquarterly statement showing  in detail the  cost of operating the Admiralty motor transport Service.                                             ,     The Admiralty have reviewed  the  proposed expenditure  of   35,400 on  newvehicles,  and have decided to  defer purchases to the extent of  22,300.   They havebeen  enabled  to  do this by postponing  provision  of certain vehicles proposed inconnection with  war organisation  plans and  further  by reducing  expenditure onexperimental  work.  But they are not prepared to  accept the  recommendation to eliminate all  expenditure on  the reconditioning and overhaul of vehicles, as  theycannot reconcile  such recommendations  as  being in  the best interests of economy.They have, however,  reviewed  the  figure  again  and can limit  the  provision to  10,250.     The question of the retention of motor  cars is one that has continually engagedattention, and the numbers have been reduced from time to  time as  circumstanceshave permitted.  The Admiralty have again reviewed the position, and are satisfiedthat no further reduction is at  present possible  without incurring greater expensein other  directions.  The  numbers now remaining are as follows :                                                       Running.    Reserve.

STATEMENT XIV.   A armaments.                               General Remarks.    Since last June various  modifications  have been  decided upon by  the Board,allowing for which  and for changes consequent on the Washington proposals therewill  be a  reduction  on Material  Subheads  of  approximately  1,000,000,  or anet reduction of  700,000, after allowing for the   300.000 &quot; cut &quot; decided upon bythe Board in June.    The reduction  on Vote 9 as a whole would probably be  less, owing to cost of handling and disposal of surplus stores from His Majesty&apos;s  Ships  proposed to be scrapped,  but until  the rate of clearance and disposal  of these ships is  decided an accurate  estimate   cannot   be  furnished.    (See   revised  Sketch   Estimate,22nd January.   Net total, Vote 9,  5,878,780.)    The reduction in subsequent years would be considerable.Comments on Section (I) :      The figures  1,148,550 and  810,000 were  furnished in June  1921.   (Theestimate of  810,000 for New Programme Ships would, at the  present time, in thelight of recent actual tender prices, have to be increased to   975,000.)    Allowing, however, for subsequent  modifications  in  requirements and for  theeffect  of Washington proposals, it  is now  estimated  that the amount required in1922-23 under Vote 9, Subhead (F), will be approximately  976,000.    This figure is made up of :                      635,000 for guns for two New Capital  Ships.          30,000 for other New Construction.          80,000 for War Liabilities.        226,000 for  General  Post-War  Fleet  requirements  and  Experimental                    Services.           5,000 for repairs,  overhaul, &amp;c, of guns for Merchant Ships.         976,000    (i.) The Committee state  that included in the subhead  for guns is an item of 60,000 for reconditioning reserves of 2,000 guns and mountings for the defensive armament of Merchant Ships with  an annual charge of  6,000 for maintenance and storage, and suggest that this item should be carefully reconsidered, as in theiropinion no disadvantage would ensue if this work were retarded.    This is incorrect.   The estimated cost of  the proposed  reserve of  2,092 gunsand mountings  for the defensive armament of Merchant Ships is as follows:                        Mountings (chargeable to Vote 8).

Reconditioning and alterations    ...       ...      ...      9,800*        Annual cost of upkeep     ......       ...      ...      6,600    It is already proposed to spread the cost of the reconditioning, &amp;c. (see figuresmarked*) over approximately eight years; consequently the amount included in theisketch of Vote 9 for. this service &apos;s a very small amount indeed.       [7720]   &quot;&apos;                                                   12       &apos;

Allowing for various modifications and for the effects of Washington proposals,the figures now stand, at (the 18th January, 1922) : 	Normal Services.	New Programme.

Shell is due to the decision not to order 13-5-inchShell  in view of the Washington proposals,  but to  confine manufacture  to 2,00015-inch Shell required to complete equipments of 15-inch guns.    This quantity is only half the quantity originally ascertained to be necessaryto keep the minimum of plant and  trained  staff  of Messrs.  Hadfield  and Firthemployed.  It is considered that to spread the order over a longer period would not besound policy and would result in higher prices having to be paid.    The main  items included under &quot;Other Items&quot;  966,000 are:  For New Construction (other than  Capital  Ships) ...Practice AmmunitionReplacement of Obsolete Types of  Shells, Fuzes, &amp;c.Replacement of inefficient stores  ...Improvements in existing Equipments, Experimental    Services and General Upkeep...Liquidation of War Liabilities   ...     73,000304,000287,000 68,000 79,000 30,000842,000    Showing a reduction  from the figure of June 1921 of  218,470.    The Committee&apos;s reference to large surplus stocks  of ammunition held in excessof authorised reserves illustrates the difficulty of generalising accurately from such astatement as that the Navy only fired half an outfit during the war.  It was explained to the Committee that, generally speaking, the surpluses existing were not of typessuitable for guns of the Post-War Fleet.    Such surplus stocks  as  can  be utilised  are being used  in  aid  of  currentrequirements, e.g. :      (a.)  Surplus cordite  for  particular guns is  being reallocated to other guns           wherever possible.    (b.)  Surplus shells are being emptied  and issued  for practice.Comments on Section (III).    The Committee have grouped all types of 21-inch torpedoes together,  whereas inthe newer types of torpedo (Mark IV  and V), which are  required  for the more                    Projectiles and Ammunition,  1,800,000.    The above figure, prepared in June 1921, was made up as follows :  
                                      0.1efficient part of the Post-War Fleet there is a deficiency of 415 at present.  Thispoint was brought out in a statement supplied to the Committee.     The manufacture of one new torpedo a week or equivalent completion of partlymanufactured Mark V torpedoes at present being carried out was approved for two reasons :      1. To make up the deficiency of Mark IV and V torpedoes and to allow of annual           wastage (approximately 55 per annum).     2. To allow of a reasonable nucleus of specially trained men in torpedo work to           be retained, as Greenock  is now the only Torpedo Factory.     In next year&apos;s Estimates it has been approved in the interests of economy for (1)to be suspended as soon as torpedoes for New Construction are commenced. This would allow (2) to be retained, although it  would mean that our deficiencies in reserves ofMark IV and V, which will increase through annual wastage, would  have to be made up with the older 21-inch Mark 11-11**** torpedoes.     It is also pointed out that the  older 21-inch types of torpedo are being, and wallcontinue to be, used by the Fleet in lieu of the newest 21Tinch types in all the  exerciseswhich involve more than an ordinary risk of loss of torpedoes.     Greenock is now the  only Torpedo  Factory in the country,  and to allow7 of amaximum output of twenty torpedoes a  week in an  emergency the factory is  beingreorganised.     As already pointed out to  the Committee, the  present total staff of the Factory(850) is only about  40 per cent,  of  the pre-war staffs of Greenock and Messrs.Whitehead&apos;s.  The amount of  staff employed on manufacture of one new torpedo aweek is approximately 25 per cent.     The effect  of stopping the present manufacture of new7 torpedoes would be  thedischarge of  about 200 men, who would  probably be lost to the factory permanently,together with their specialised training.     If  the Washington Conference  proposals are ratified all these men  would berequired for manufacture of torpedoes for New Construction in about twelve months&apos;time.     With regard to  3,058 &quot;older type &quot;  torpedoes, these are actually not older typetorpedoes,  but  modern 18-inch torpedoes for Submarines.  1,143 are required  for post-War  Fleet; the remainder have been  painted and  stacked and the  expenseincurred by their retention is inappreciable.  In any case their retention or disposalcannot affect the Committee&apos;s recommendation  which  deals with 21-inch  torpedoesonly.Comments  on Section (IV) :       Cordite. As stated under (II) surplus stocks of cordite are being utilised, wheresuitable, and proposals are under consideration which would make  a considerable reduction in requirements  next year.   The rate of  manufacture has already beenreduced to 15 tons per week 750 tons  per year and the requirements in  1922-23may be even  smaller.     The only present requirement  is for  6-inch XII Guns, for Light Cruisers under construction  and for practice,  and manufacture will be restricted to this  size andto experimental cordite,  Manufacture for the new- Capital Ships will not commenceuntil 1923-24.     As regards the  question of reduction of present  stocks of  cordite, the normal practice expenditure of the Fleet amounts to some 1,900 tons  per  annum and  no reduction other than by this means appears desirable, especially as the saving inexpense for storage,  &amp;c, Avould be trifling.     There are  strong objections  to  an entire  cessation, even  temporarily  ofmanufacture,  e.g. :       (a.) Deterioration of plant if not kept going.     (P.) Dispersal of trained  staff.     (c.) Lack of facilities  for  continuous manufacturing research.     Id) Difficulty of restarting when requirements for new Capital Ships mature in           1923-24.
                               STATEMENT XV.                                    Works.     The Committee point  out that of the total net Sketch Estimate of  4,756,000,.  1,344,000  is for  the  Naval Works Act annuity which cannot be  altered,  and  1.000,000 is for the provision of Oil Storage which they suggest the Government may wish to reconsider, although  they make.no recommendation.      340,000 is in  respect  of New Works other than Oil  Fuel Storage.  This sum is made up of  200,000 for major New Works  of  2,000 and over,  100,000 for Minor New Works  and  40,000 for Foundations for Machinery which is provided  under Vote 8.  The Committee  recommend that  the whole  of these amounts should be entirely deferred.     The proposals  for New Works items have not yet been reviewed by the Finance Committee, but a rough survey of the list shows that certain items of work will have to be done if danger or disaster is to be avoided.  The following are typical items :  Portsmouth :  SmitheryChatham: Ropery roofSheerness:  Oil jettyPortsmouth Dockyard : North Wall ...Devonport: Fixing rubbing timbers ...Glasgow: Dredging oil jettyWoolwich Arsenal:  Dredging pier and    wharvesPortsmouth      No. 0 Dock gates    No. 4 Dock entranceMalta : Underpinning wharves    These items amount to  . 48,1.00.     There  are other items  of work which ought to be carried out at once, e.g. :  ,                                                                           Devonport: Renewal of railways and roads,  which are             in  bad condition     ...       ...      ...       ...     10,000        Bermuda :   Mosquito nettings  in residences; essential             for health of  occupants       ...      ...       ...      1,000     14,900  is required for completing Minor Works begun this year which have gone too far to  be  stopped; and if  the local Senior  Officers are allowed only thediscretionary  amounts they were given before  the  war for Small Works,  26,000will be wanted for  that.     35,000  for Foundations for  Machinery is necessary unless machines alreadyordered are to be unusable.     135,000 therefore, is  the minimum sum required for New Works,  if nothing else beyond what is mentioned above is  undertaken.    The Committee propose that  for  the remaining items  of  the  Sketch  Vote,amounting  approximately  to  2.000,000, only  1,000,000 should be allowed.    Items  to  which the Admiralty  are  committed by  legal obligation, such  asGrants-in-Aid of Works,  Purchases  of Land, Reconditioning of Properties,  andRedemption of Rent Charges, amount to  118,000.    Of the  950,000 provided in  the Sketch for  Continuation Services other thanOil Storage, the items have been reviewed, with the result that :                ;&apos;    (a.) If all the services on which little or no work has been clone are forthwith           cancelled;    (b.) If all those which can be stopped, without  regard to economy or  the           necessity for them, are  also forthwith stopped; and    (c.) If all possible savings are made on Continuation Services which are too far           advanced to be stopped;a reduction of  366,000 can be made.  This involves abandoning expenditure on naval Welfare Items (about)  119,000, besides deferring improvements necessary for     5,0001 3,000 I All  in a dangerous condition, and 4,500 \-   will collapse unless the work  is10,000 I   taken in hand at once. 2,100 J        These are silted  up and cannot 5 000 f   mucft longer be used.10,000 \ Both Docks have recently gone out 5,000 J   of action owing to dilapidation. 1,000  Necessary for safety of structure.
the  safety of  Magazines,  and items  for  improving  the  Dockyards which  were included in Vote 10 of the current year as being most urgently required.     Dredging item of  280,000 can be  reduced by  120,000 if the dredging work is limited to essential maintenance dredging  of  the Lock  and  Dock  Entrances  atRosyth, Chatham, Portsmouth, Devonport, and to Berth for Floating Dock at Malta,and constructing berth alongside Dockyard Wharf at  Gibraltar, together  with  themaintenance of the plant laid up.     The sum  of  504,000  recommended by  the Works  Department for  ordinaryrepairs and maintenance is reported to be the minimum required to keep the establish-ments  in a reasonable state of preservation.  The  Admiralty  are advised  that any failure to spend the full sum is bound  to result in  grave detriment to government property,  but  in  view of  the urgent demand for  reductions, they  have  decided toreduce the provision by  62,300.     The remaining subheads, Miscellaneous and Stores, could, with great  pressure,be brought down from  57,000 and  65,000 to  42.000 and   20,000 respectively,making a savins.&apos; on these two subheads  of  60.000.A mount recommended   by Committee.&apos;possible Net Amount.New works-Continual ion  works,  dredging  and  the rest of the  Vote  items Nil1,000,0001.000,000New worksContinuation ..DredgingObligatory itemsMiscellaneous and StoresCost of Staff ..Repairs and Maintenance,Less Appropriations-in-Aid   135,000584.000160,000118,000 62,000160,0001,229,000 441,7001,680,700  75,0001,605,700    Whereas,  therefore,  the  Geddes  Committee  recommended  a  reduction   of 1,340,000 on  Vote 10, the actually possible reduction,  if the most drastic orders were  given  at  once to stop expenditure  regardless of  consequences,  amounts  to 826,300.  The Admiralty, however, wdrile anxious to curtail and postpone expendi-ture wherever  such  a course is reasonably practicable, cannot consent to take  theaction this extreme course requires.    The items  of Continuation Works and of  the most  urgent proposals for new works have accordingly been again reviewed with the  result that     (a.)  On Continuation Services a reduction of  193,280 could be made instead           of  366,000 given above.    (b.)  With  regard  to New Works,  the following -services are considered to  be           essential with the money provision  quoted  against  each ;-                                                             Howden:  Gun-Mounting Store   ...       ...       ...     14,200Holton Health     Plant for the exclusion of coal  dust    ...       ...     13,000    Building for denitration of waste acids ( 500) and        new7 plant for Cellulose ( 500)    ...       ...     1,000Portsmouth     Housing  for  Rotary  Converter  for supply of        compressed air to Floating Dock   ...       ...     2,000    Dockyard Coping Fender for C. and  D.

With regard to the dredging item,  the Admiralty consider it necessary to carryon without intermission the work at Gibraltar of dredging the harbour,  which  isnow much silted up,  to its original depth so that modern Capital  Ships can use  itfreely, and  a further sum of  16,000  is thus required, making the lowest figureadmissible  176,000.    Apart from the  Naval Works  Act Annuity, therefore, the  following is the lowest provision the Board can accept :                                                                            New Works  ...       ...       ...      ...      231,385             Continuation Services ...       ...      ...      757,000             Oil Fuel Storage Schemes      ...      ...     1,007,400             Dredging    ...       ...       ...      ...      176,000             Repairs and Maintenance      ...      ...      441,700             Obligatory Items     ...       ...      ...      118,000             Miscellaneous and Stores      ...      ...        70,000             Cost of Staff         ...       ...      ...      160,000                                             2,961,485Less Appropriations-in-Aid    ...       ...        75,000Total    ...       ...       ...     2,886.485    With the Annuity of  1,344.407 this makes the total  4,230,892 as against the july Sketch of  4,756,000, or  a reduction of  525,108.

OBJECT OF THE ARMY&apos;S EXISTENCE AND CONDITIONS  GOVERNING ITS SIZE.        &quot;The Estimates provide that in the  year 1923,  the  fifth  year after the     Armistice is signed, with a broken and exhausted Europe and no German menace,     we are to have far  greater fighting power, with a larger personnel  and greater     preparations for war, than ever before in our history.&quot;*and again                                &apos;        &quot; We have suggested that by limiting our oversea garrisons and reducing the     corresponding units at home,  a great reduction  could  be  made in  the  size of the     Army.&quot;t     The Committee have been careful to avoid any discussion of the  purpose for whichthe British Army exists but these extracts from their Report throw  an  interestinglight on what their conception of that purpose appears to be.     It  not  only  reveals  a  complete misconception of the  reasons for  the Army&apos;sexistence,  but  ignores  the responsibilities  Avith which  it  is entrusted, so  that  it is               * Part I., paragraph 4.      f Chapter 2, paragraph 20.(B22/54)  50  2/22  H&amp;S, Ltd 9688wn
useless to attempt the discussion of details without first pointing out these dangerousfallacies : -     For the last hundred years the British Regular Army has been maintained, not forintervention in a European war,  but for the protection  of our  overseas territories, andfor the support of the  Civil Power in the maintenance of law  and order throughoutBritish  territory at  home  and abroad.    The  size of the Army has been regulated by our oversea  commitments,  and  not  by  the  threat of  any  Continental Power.It is true  that as the  German menace became more and  more imminent  in the yearssucceeding the South  African war, the possibility of our  being involved in a Europeancampaign had  to  be  increasingly taken  into account.   Consequently, those  militaryunits that we were obliged to provide at borne for the maintenance, relief and supportof our oversea garrisons were gradually organized in such a manner as to allow them,such  as  they  were,  to  intervene  in support  of our Allies, should His Majesty&apos;sGovernment decide so to act.  But the&apos; size of the Expeditionary Force bad no relationwhatever  to the strategical problem of a Franco-German conflict.    This force consistedmerely of the spare parts of our oversea military machine, assembled to form a provisionalweapon with  which to meet the  threatening emergency.     Thus the  disappearance of  the German menace in no way affects the size of theBritish  Army,  which  is conditioned by our oversea commitments.   The elimination  ofany European campaign does, however, enable, us to make certain  modifications in ourorganization  and equipment, giving us for the present a freer hand than we had before1914 in designing our military forces for their primary  task.   This new  situation hasbeen fully taken into  account by the General Staff in estimating our requirements.     During the last  two  years  the General Staff  have frequently drawn attention tothe serious increase in our oversea liabilities as compared with the situation before thewar.  But as these commitments appear to have escaped the notice of the Committee,I make no apology for once more bringing them to notice.                                     2. INDIA.    The present situation in India gives rise to far greater anxiety than in 1914. then we had a working agreement with Russia, a strong and friendly ruler  in  afghanistan and the danger of internal revolt was in  no way comparable  to  the proportions whichit has now assumed.  To-day we have to reckon with  a  Russia whose most markedcharacteristic is a bitter and professed hostility to British ideals  and everything forwhich they stand.   While  lacking  the organized military force  of the  old  PrussianEmpire, her methods of insidious propaganda and treachery are even more difficult to cope with, and the inflammable races of the East  are more  difficult&apos;, to protect  from suchcontamination than from more tangible forms of attack.    Afghanistan, instead of the benevolent buffer state that she used to be has become a potential  enemy, maintaining  the closest  relations with  Russia,  and  possessingunlimited powers of injuring us by fomenting trouble  amongst the tribes of the frontier and conniving at Russian intrigue.   We have, indeed, recently come1 to some sort ofagreement- with the Amir,  which may  temporarily alleviate  the situation,  but thepractical value of the &quot; neighbourly treaty &quot; is so far. open to question, in view  of theserious acts  of aggression by Afghan raiders that have occurred  since it was signed.    Internally the  situation in  India has been getting steadily worse, especially duringthe last six months.  Serious  efforts  have been  made by the  hostile  organization totamper  with the loyalty of the Indian Army, and although  it  is believed  that their efforts have  hitherto met with no great amount of success, it will be remembered that up to the very  last moment  in 1857, British officers  had absolute confidence in the loyalty of their Sepoys.  A notable  aspect  of the activities  of the &apos;&apos; Volunteer &quot;  and&quot; Non-co-operatbrs &quot; generally is the similarity of their methods to those of Sinn Fein.Distinct effects have been produced by tho intimidation, social boycott and propagandathus employed  against the Police.   (Indian Intelligence Summary,  13th  December,1921.)    To  further complicate matters, the state  of  Indian finance gives  cause for seriousmisgivings for the future.    The call that may be made on us by India  has recently  been estimated by theCommander-in-Chief as follows :     There are four  contingences to be taken into account:     (1.)  War with  Afghanistan :    (2.)  Serious and widespread  conflagration amongst the frontier tribes;
     (3.)  Sedition  and disloyalty in the  Indian Array amounting to mutiny among a            portion of that Army ;     (4.)  Internal rebellion consisting of simultaneous  co-ordinated outbreaks in several            places, similar to Malabar.     In the  event of all  four  contingencies happening simultaneously or within a few months of one another-and although perhaps unlikely this is a possibility that cannot be lost sight of India  would require  reinforcements  of at  least 6  divisions  and 4 cavalry brigades.     In the  event of either  (1)  and (2)  or  (3) and (4) happening together as they probably  would, 4  divisions  and 2 cavalry brigades would be wanted.     A most  important point  to be borne in  mind  is that  it is the promptness with which the trouble can be  crushed in its early stages that  will determine the extent and gravity of the emergency.                                      3.  IRAQ.     Our   commitments  in  Iraq, which did not exist before  the war, constitute an entirely fresh charge upon our military  resources.    The policy now  being adopted by  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  in this  territory,  for which we  have   accepted responsibility,  is  admittedly  a gamble.    For, as  it   is  manifestly  impossible  to provide  a regular military garrison  large   enough  to protect the  country  from external   aggression   or   internal  revolt,   the   experiment  is  being   tried   of defending it  by  means   of   local  Arab  troops  supported  by  a   powerful  air force.   The  results  of this experiment  remain a   matter  of  conjecture  for, pace the  assertions  of the  Air Ministry, they are so  far  only  assertions and remain to be proved.   In the event of  failure we  are given to understand that we shall accept defeat and make no serious effort to restore  our  control or prestige.  But is this really a practicable proposition ?   Nothing in our experience  would justify us in assuming it. Even  if we are prepared to repudiate our obligation to King Feisal, is it conceivable that we can abandon the  isolated  British  officers and political officials who will be scattered  throughout  the  length and breadth of the country  and leave them to their fate without an  effort&apos;!   I venture  to  think not,  for the lesson of  Gordon and Khartoum has surely not yet  faded entirely from our minds ?     It should further be realized  that  the scheme is far less promising to-day than when it was conceived at Cairo nine months ago.  The chief hopes (it  had  no  more secure foundation)  on  which the scheme  was based have proved  abortive.  For that scheme assumed a friendly Turkey and no risk of aggression or serious internal intrigue by her.  Far from being friendly the Nationalist Turks are now mere hostile and  more truculent   than  ever,  and  as  a result  of their military  and  diplomatic  successes have now a free hand to concentrate military forces on the northern march.   Added to this, the Arab army, which was an essential factor in  the scheme, is giving  cause for grave anxiety on account of the Turkish intrigue with which its loyalty is sapped.   So much so, that the War Office is even now  being pressed to consent to three battalions (including I Indian) being  stationed in Baghdad to protect the  Air  Force and  the  seat of Government there, in absolute contradiction  to the whole  principles on which the scheme of control by the Royal  Air Force  was based.     Therefore, I maintain that so long as we retain any form of control in  Iraq,  direct or indirect,  which involves  the  presence of  British  armed  forces,  officers  andadministrators, so  long is  there a  direct liability on the  British Army to providesupport.   It is impossible  to assess  this liability at less than 2 divisions and 2 cavalry brigades.                                   4. PALESTINE.     This, again, is an entirely fresh commitment,  which, like Iraq, has no strategicalinterest for the British Army, yet constitutes a serious  potential  drain on its resources. In this territory His Majesty&apos;s Government is committed to a policy which is repugnantto 90 per  cent, of the population and bitterly resented by them.  So much so that the Administration have  so far  felt unable to inaugurate  representative Government, thefirst act of which would be to sweep away  the Zionist organization and ideals.   In thesecircumstances it is only the presence of sufficient numbers  of British troops that securesthe lives  and property of the  Jewish minorities, and the present garrison is barely     (9683)                                                                    A 2
sufficient for the purpose.  In tlie event of co-ordinated attack by the Arabs, assistedas they might be by their kinsmen from Trans-Jordania, the garrison would be insufficient,and reinforcements would be required.  These might well amount to the  infantry  of a division and a cavalry brigade, though artillery might be on a reduced scale.                                     5. EGYPT.     The present situation in Egypt is very different from that of 1914.   It is to-day evenmore difficult than a year ago, when tlie publication of the Miluer Reporthadgivengroundsfor hope that a settlement satisfactory to all but the most violent extremists was in sight.The Milner Report has now virtually been repudiated by the Government and the Nation-alist feeling proportionally stirred.  At the same  time, as Lord Allenby has pointed out,these anti-British elements have not been slow to appreciate the means by which the Irishrevolutionaries have achieved their ends, i.e., by murder and arson, and they may be ex-pectecl to adopt-methods of terrorism in order to convert the more moderate sections of thepeople to their views.   Should  this policy  succeed we shall be faced with  the  ^organizedhostility of the whole  country, including  the Sultans Government and  the  egyptian army with the  result  that  reinforcements  of at least 2  divisions and  1 cavalrybrigade would he  urgently needed to maintain our position in the country and protect the lives not only  of the British but of the other European communities for whose safetywe are responsible.  In any  case  the minimum  garrison with which the situation cannow be secured  is  9 battalions of infantry besides  the necessary cavalry and artilleryunits a clear addition  of 4 battalions to the pre-war garrison.                                 6. CONSTANTINOPLE.     At the present  moment we have to  maintain  a force of 6 battalions at  Constanti-nople,  2 of which at least must  be British, as part of the Allied Forces  of Occupation.Although this  commitment is understood to be  temporary it constitutes a very seriousliability while  it  lasts.   More than once  in  the last two years the situation there hasbeen  extremely difficult  and might easily have become critical, as the Allied forces have not been, and  are not now,  sufficient to  protect Constantinople and the Darcla-nelles  from a determined attack in force by the Nationalist Turks.     As long as this  commitment lasts we must  be  prepared to reinforce up to thestrength of 1 division and a cavalry brigade ap least.                        7.  UNITED KINGDOM AND GERMANY.     The situation at home has changed altogether  for the worse since  1914.  Beforethe war the question of internal security in Great Britain hardly existed as  a militarypre-occupation.   During the last year  it is true  that the  revolutionary forces  havereceived a decided check, but the snake is only scotched and  not killed.   We have toreckon as a permanency with organized forces of disruption subsidized and abetted by our enemies abroad, whose purpose is to destroy the whole  fabric  of society  and make all government  impossible.   Since the armistice the  country has been subjected to a succession of industrial  upheavals, chief among which  were the Railway Strike in theautumn of  1919  and the Coal Strike of  1921, which all but  precipitated  a general strike  of the &quot; Triple Alliance.&quot;  While giving every credit to the common-sense andgood citizenship of the  majority of the  inhabitants of the country, it is quite certainthat it was only the  firm attitude  taken up  by the  Government, bached by tangibleevidence of military forces adequate to protect people from the violence of extremists,that prevented  these crises developing into far more disastrous conflagrations.     In the Railway Strike of 1919, tiie  troops  actually employed were equivalent to43 infantry battalions and 3 cavalry regiments, while in reserve were a large  number of units which were  in process of demobilization.     During the  recent  Coal  Strike  the equivalent of 56 infantry battalions and cavalry regiments were actually employed on strike duty, while in reserve were anadditional  194.  weak  battalions which the Government found it expedient to have inhand.   To provide these the whole of the Regular  Preserve had to be called out, and animprovised Defence Force of over 60,000 had to  be hurriedly created  in addition  to the units provided by the Navy owing to the  absence in Ireland of a large proportion of theRegular Army.     It is not the  province of the General  Staff to forecast the political conditions of thefuture, but unless His Majesty&apos;s Government can give us a categorical assurance that no
                          8.  SUMMARY OF  COMMITMENTS.    Summarizing  the foregoing survey of our commitments at home and abroad, we see that the Army may have to meet a call for reinforcements as&apos; follows : &apos;             For India  ...     ...     ...  6 divisions and 4 cavalry brigades.             For Iraq   .........-2       ,,       2t             For Egypt and  Palestine...  3       ,,       2        ,,             For Constantinople      ...  1       ,,       1        ,,             For United Kingdom    ...31-      ,,       2        ,,    It is obvious that even with an Expeditionary Force of  6 divisions  and 3 Cavalrybrigades capable of immediate mobilization the margin of safety would  be dangerouslylow,  seeing that the whole of 6 divisions might be  required, in India  alone, whileif -trouble  arose  in the  Middle East  at the  same time, we should want at least a. total  of 8 or 10  divisions  and 5 or  G  Cavalry brigades.  Now  we have definite evidence of a  world-wide conspiracy  fomented  by all  the elements most  hostile to  British  interests   Sinn   Feiners  and   Socialists  at   our  own  doors,  RussianBolsheviks,  Turkish  and  Egyptian Nationalists,  and  Indian  Seditionists.   Up  tothe present we  have  been lucky  in not having experienced  trouble in more thanone theatre at the  same time, but when it is remembered that the hostile combinationis working  with the connivance if not  under the  active direction of -the german foreign Office, it would be  folly to ignore  the probability of better co-ordinated attacks in the future.   Yet  the  effect of the geddes  Committee  proposals is to  reduce there reinforcements available  in the critical  initial stages to  3 divisions and  less than2  cavalry  brigades, since the 4th and  5th  divisions  could  not reach the theatre of operations for 5 or 6 months after the outbreak had begun.    (9683)serious industrial unrest is to be contemplated for a period of years, the Army is boundto assume that it may be called on to perform similar tasks at any moment.   But whatmoment is more likely to be selected by the forces of anarchy as a favourable opportunityfor extorting blackmail than when  we  are  in  the throes of  some  crisis abroad,necessitating the despatch of reinforcements from this country ?     Asa result of past experience it is estimated that for the maintenance of law andorder in the face  of the revolutionary forces, a  minimum  of  40 Infantry battalions,totalling 30,000 bayonets, with  cavalry, armoured cars and tanks, &amp;c, in addition willbe required.     It has been shown that our commitments abroad  involve us  in liabilities which weare quite unable to meet even by stripping the United Kingdom bare of troops.     The  Committee^  proposals reduce  the  total  number of  battalions  at home,including Ulster and tin; Rhine, to 67.  Thus the despatch of even the 3 divisions now contemplated as the only Expeditionary Force immediately available would  reduce  the battalions  at home  to  27, and  of  these  only  19 are in the  United  Kingdom,  theremaining  8  being  on the Rhine.   Not even this total  would be available in  GreatBritain, for, even supposing it possible to withdraw  the whole  of the  Rhine garrison,we should still  have to leave at least 4  battalions  in Ulster,  where their presence  isessential for the prevention  of bloodshed between the opposing racial and religiousfactions.   Thus not more than 23 battalions could  be counted on for use in this country as against the 40 that are required.     It will be observed that nothing is allowed for liabilities  in Ireland beyond the fourbattalions for Ulster.  Whether this bold  assumption is justified  or not is not for theGeneral Staff to say, and only time can prove it.     It is further  for  consideration  whether it  is justifiable to  count on the  RhineGarrison permanently as part of the Home  Forces.  Up to the present we have beenable to draw on it, when required, because  the situation in Germany permitted it.  Butwe have no assurance that  as time goes on the Germans will remain  equally tractable,and the very fact of British troops being in occupation of  the Rhine  means that theyare for use in case of necessity.     Since  the above was  written, news has been received of  an agreement proposed at Cannes by His Majesty&apos;s Government  to  come to the  assistance  of France in theevent of unprovoked attack  by Germany.   Although such a  contingency may seemremote  at the  present  moment, this undertaking  adds definitely  to  our  potentialcommitments, and cannot be altogether ignored.
* Memorandum by General Staff, India, 10th May, 1921     The  Committee,  as already  pointed  out,  make  no  reference whatever to theincreased liabilities which the Army has incurred since 1914, but proceed to recommendarbitrary reductions in units on the ground that the  increased fire power of modernweapons will compensate for lack of numbers.     Tins argument will not bear serious examination.                                ,     It might be correct to state that  if  10  British battalions were drawn up  opposite10  German battalions, and the British  had the monopoly of modern  armament, theywould be more than a match for their opponents.  But  this in no sense represents thestate of affairs as it exists to-day.   All civilized  countries  are equipped with  weapons and engines of war unknown to armies in 1914, and therefore the superiority of the battalions alluded to by the Committee disappear.   One nation at  least is superior tous in numbers, equipment and readiness for war,  and infinitely superior in the,  air.  Inthe case of the uncivilized nations, when  the distance  to  be  traversed, the length of lines of communication, the  difficulties of  the country, whether from mountain, river ordesert, are considered,  the balance  of recent improvements in arms and equipment  isprobably in favour of the uncivilized nation and against us.     For the Indian frontier  we have to  provide a Field Army capable of dealing withthe  organized  forces of Afghanistan and  the  warlike tribesmen.   The armament andtactical training  of these forces has made great strides within the last few years, andthe  new  political  status of  Afghanistan  gives  her every  facility for  equipping  their forces with the most  up-to-date weapons, including aircraft.  Taking  everything intoaccount, the Afghans  and the tribesmen  are relatively  more formidable opponents thanthey were.  So much so, that Lord Roberts&apos;s famous  march from Kabul.to Kandaharcould  not be  carried out to-day without a verv much lamer force than he had at his disposal.     Apart from the Frontier, the main business  of the  Army in time of peace  is to actas an Imperial police force throughout our Eastern Dominions.   The real nature of this task  has  been well stated  in a, recent memorandum  by  the Chief of General  Staff&apos;,India :          &quot; The Lewis gun may be considered equivalent to 10 rifles, and the Vickers gun     similarly  represent the  power of 20 riflemen ; the armoured car and the aeroplane     too are, from  the  same  point  of  view,  admittedly very  powerful instruments of     death.  But the primary duty of troops  told off for the maintenance of  law and     order is to prevent bloodshed-mainly by show of numbers, which gives them the     moral as well as the physical power to arrest murderers. -  In other words,  it is the     man  and - not the  machine  which  is  more  valuable for  maintaining  internal.     security.&quot;&apos;&apos;&quot;     It is  not until disorder has reached the stage of actual war that the full power of modern weapons can be brought to bear.     This elementary fact, jvhich is a truism to all who have any experience of the Eastor West, has been entirely ignored by the Committee, who have  nevertheless  taken  itupon themselves to lay down in great detail the size of our various oversea garrisons.Another point which has escaped the Committee  is that their argument cuts both ways.If a, machine-gun crew is the equivalent of 20 riflemen it is also 20 times more vulnerableas the  fire  power  of 20  rifles  can be annihilated by one lucky bomb.   Similarly, a battalion  of infantry  or smaller  unit  isolated  and  split  up  into  detachments  ispeculiarly vulnerable to the  ravages  of  disease, and  may find  its effective  fighting strength diminished by a half or more  through some sudden epidemic.   In any case the&quot;overhead charges &quot; in the shape of employed men, furlough, courses of instruction, &amp;c,fall even more heavily on detachments than on complete units.     The Committee point to India  as having reduced the number of British and Nativetroops on account of the increased efficiency of modern armaments.    ITere again the argument is ill founded.   The reductions in  the Indian  Establishment were  made inorder to provide, on a proper basis,  those essential ancillary services and reserves which under  the old  and vicious system had to  be improvised, from the ranks of the  fightingunits on mobilization.  &quot; This arrangement,&quot; as pointed  out  by the Commander-in-chief in April,  1920,  &quot;benefited  neither party, as not only were the  fighting strengthsreduced, but the administrative services had to employ men unversed in their  methods.It is essential  that in future the administrative units should be separately  constituted in peace.&quot;
                 .1.0.  SUBSTITUTION  OE NATIVE FOR BRITISH TROOPS.     One of the expedients proposed by the Committee to justify reductions  in  british units is the substitution of native troops for British  in  oversea  garrisons.   There are three great objections to this policy, which is the exact opposite of that  for  Avhich theGeneral Staff must  continue to press.     In the first place, the same degree of reliance cannot be placed on native troops forthe  purpose  of quelling  sedition.   Since the regrettable mutiny at Singapore at thebeginning of the War, and certain troubles in India itself last year, the civil authoritiesin the Far East have lost confidence in Indian troops.   As au example of this, it  is sufficient to  recall  tiie strong  protest made by the Governor of Hong-Kong at theprospect of an increase in the  Indian troops to  be stationed  there.   In his letter  of8th  September, 1920 (083/5258), Sir  Edward Stubbs states that the civilian membersof his  Executive Council regard with apprehension an increase  in the strength of theIndian  troops, and he himself  fully  endorses their  views.  He also points  out  that apart  from  the  possibility  of a seditious outbreak the Indian  troops  stationed  at hong  Kong  have  for years past had a  bad reputation for committing  outrages onthe local poprrlation.     Secondly,  there  are  serious political objections  oil  the part  of India  to keepingIndian troops serving outside India, and the Legislative Assembly is making  capital outof this grievance.     Thirdly,  the insurance value of an Indian or native  unit from the general aspect ofImperial Defence is  infinitely  less than that of a British unit, which is available to  do anything  and go anywhere at a moment&apos;s notice and  is far better value for money fromthe British taxpayers point of view.     All these things are either unknown to or ignored by the&apos; Committee.                   11. REPLACEMENT OP CAVALRY BY  AlRCRAET.     The Committee  advance no valid  reason for the  drastic  reduction  proposed incavalry regiments, but from the general tenor of their  remarks  it appears to be the advent of the Air Force which has influenced them in this direction.     Certain of the functions formerly discharged by cavalry are now more efficiently per-formed by aircraft, viz., the so-called strategical or long distance reconnaissance.   It was this  consideration which influenced the General Staff in  agreeing to the reduction of 4Cavalry Regiments, which has already been carried out.   But to assert that the place of cavalry can entirely  be taken by aircraft in the work of  close reconnaissance protection and  support  is a complete fallacy.   Aircraft  in its  present state of development is  only  effective against  an  enemy  presenting  a tangible and extensive  target,or for  bombing  women  and children.  They  can,  for instance,  operate  decisivelyagainst  a  large column  of troops or transport  packed  in  a  defile or  assembledin  close  formation.    But  they   cannot  replace  cavalry  in  advanced  or  flank-guard actions;  they cannot push forward  and seize vital tactical  points ahead ofthe  troops or  protect a column on the  march from snipers  on the flank.  They cannottake  prisoners or requisition supplies or escort convoys or interrogate  inhabitants, to mention only a few of the everyday tasks which cavalry have to perform.   Nothing ismore certain than that in any of the operations which the  British Army may be calledupon to undertake  in the  East the need for cavalry  Avill be  most urgent,  and theCommittee&apos;s  proposals  will  disastrously cripple  the efficiency of  our ExpeditionaryForce.    When  it  is  a  case  of war  another  factor  comes  into  play.   No  civilizedadministration  Avoulcl dare  to send its troops into battle without the most up-to-dateequipment that  science  has evolved, for  to  do otherwise  would be  deliberately to sacrifice lives.  Such criminal parsimony would no more be tolerated in these days thana colliery  would be allowed  to send its men  down the pits  without the most efficientsafety appliances.   It is obvious  that  all  our foreign garrisons must stand  readyequipped for Avar in its true sense.   But, as I  have pointed out, the full  power of this equipment does not come into  play during the  everyday routine work of the  Armyabroad, which,  for its deterrent action to be effective, demands a  minimum  number ofactual men to restrain evildoers by their bodily presence.
                                     12. TANKS.     The Committee take objection to the fact that tanks are provided as an addition toand not in substitution of rifles and bayonets.  The General Staff are fully alive  to  thenecessity  of economising men by.the use  of machines to the  fullest possible extent.But it has already been shown that for the  normal police work of the Army abroad it ismen that  we must have in adequate numbers.  Moreover, we do not at the present timepossess any  tanks  that are suitable  for operations in a hot  climate, and the whole matter of tank design  and  tactics is  in the experimental stage.   It will probably beseveral years before a sufficiently satisfactory type  is produced to warrant adoption,for the money is not available to permit of experiments and research on a sufficient scale.At the same time it is essential to begin to build up the personnel of the Tank Corps sothat they may be ready for service when the equipment is provided, and this  personnelconsists for the most part of highly skilled  men, who take a long time to train.  In themeantime they are performing valuable service in manning armoured car units, whichhave been indispensable in Ireland, Mesopotamia and India, and could not  be provided from any  other source.                           13. THE TERRITORIAL ARMY.     Wo less  remarkable than their disregard of the -Regular Army&apos;s responsibilities isthe manner in which the Committee have dealt with the Territorial Army.   They havenot hesitated light-heartedly to abolish regular fighting units that aie essential for  thepreservation of our security but they pass over almost in silence  the policy of spending5,000,0007.  a year on  a force which under  present conditions is of no practical value inupholding the authority of the  British Government  at home or abroad.  The onlysuggestion which the Committee have  to make on this  question  is a reduction, of 50%in the  permanent staffs, thus ensuring  that the military value of the force shall be even less than ir is at present.     It must not be thought that the General Staff are  hostile to the Territorial Army;-no body of men realize better than the General Staff what the Territorial Army  did inthe late war, and if the Territorial Army could be constituted  in some other way, suchas suggested by the  General Staff in   1919-20, there  would be much  to  be said  forspending a certain amount of money on them.     The General Staff  have already pointed out  that the whole raison cVetre  of  theTerritorial Army has  been definitely  ruled out by the Cabinefs decision that a great war is  out of the question for 10 years or more.  This wipes out any chance of invasion.The Territorial Army  cannot  find our oversea garrisons, it cannot provide drafts, itcannot furnish reinforcements  for an Eastern campaign,  and it cannot  be used for  thepreservation of internal order.  It therefore, fulfils none of the essential tasks  whichthe  maintenance of the British  Empire demands.  On the contrary, it is  absorbingmoney to  find which regular units are to be abolished.  It is, therefore, impossible tojustify the retention of the Territorial  Army in its present form on military grounds.On the other hand, if they  are to  be so retained for political reasons it is only  fair tothe Army Council that the  fact should be made public.     If the conditions of service in the  Territorial  Army can be so modified as to  permit of their being used in an emergency to reinforce  or  relieve our hard-pressed RegularArmy  in defence of  the Empire, there would be less objection to the expenditure upon it  of Army Funds.   But this whole  question  was exhaustively discussed before  theTerritorial Army was reconstituted in March, 1921, and the difficulty of reconcilingsuch an obligation with the limitations inherent  to the  recruiting of  the  Force  was found to be insuperable.     The Committee suggest that the  Territorial Army should be considered in relationto the danger of aerial  attack,  and  the  General Staff aeree  that this is  a  looicaldevelopment of the duties to be undertaken by a  force originally constituted for HomeDefence.  With  this  object in view,  an organization  of two Territorial Air DefenceDivisions  has already be approved by the Army Council, but has so far not materializedowing  to lack of funds.     It is  undoubtedly  true that  in the event of war with a Continental Power the campaign would probabty open with  a, most formidable aerial attack on this country,far exceeding in severity anything that was experienced in the late war.   It is  also possible- that for a considerable period, at. least, operations might be confined entirely tothe aerial and naval spheres, as it might prove impossible for  either ourselves or our opponents to engage military forces in each other&apos;s territory.

The above distribution gives Egypt 7 battalions and 3 cavalry regiments in placeof 9 battalions and 1  cavalry regiment which is the minimum garrison compatible withsafety under present conditions ; 2 cavalry regiments  being withdrawn from  Palestinebeing substituted for  2 infantry battalions.    In this connection it would be instructive to know by what process the Committeearrive at the  conclusion that  the  safety of  Egypt  can be  secured  by 6 battalions,whereas the&apos;civil and military authorities, who are responsible for the lives and propertyof Europeans in that country, have  constantly stated that 9 is the minimum.    It will be seen that nothing  is allowed for Iraq.   After careful  consideration theGeneral Staff have been forced to the conclusion  that  under  the scheme of reductionscontemplated it is  impossible to lock up one cavalry regiment  and two  battalions in thiscountry which has no strategical interest for us, where they will not only be  of no use     If, therefore, any forces are to be maintained purely for home defence it would be wiser to organize them  for air defence than  for defence against invasion as formerlyunderstood.     It is agreed that the predominant share in air defence must be undertaken by theAir Force,  but it has also been pointed out in various recent General  Staff papers thatthe Air Force requires a very  elaborate organization  of  ground  troops to provide the anti-aircraft guns, searchlights and communications,  without which the Air Force cannotexert its full power.   If this organization can be provided on an efficient basis by theTerritorial  Army it would justify considerable expenditure upon it, and might take theplace of some of the infantry,  cavalry and artillery units  at present maintained.     To sum up, the expenditure of Army Funds on  the  Territorial Army in its present form cannot be justified.   But in so far as it can  be  reorganized in such a manner as toprovide reinforcements  for service abroad in&quot; a &quot; small  war,&quot; or to undertake the air defence of the  United Kingdom, the  General  Staff would  welcome its  continued existence and development.                  14. DETAILS OE DISTRIBUTION AND ORGANIZATION.     The reductions proposed by the Committee leave us a total of 19 cavalry regiments(including  3 Household) and  130 battalions of infantry (including  10 Guards) at homeand  abroad.  From  what has been  said  above  it  is clear  that  this  total is  quiteinsufficient to meet the  calls that may at any moment, be made upon  the Army.  Onthe grounds of  sentiment and.  esprit de  corps those  potent factors in the fightingefficiency  of the British  Army the destruction of 8 more cavalry regiments, making12 in all, is even more to be deprecated than that of the 28  battalions.   For the third and fourth battalions of an infantry regiment can  be reduced without destroying theregiments individuality  and traditions, and it is possible that in any event we may losemany regiments  now territorially  based  on  the Irish Free   State.   But a cavalry regiment cannot be abolished  without annihilating its existence.     If these proposals are to be enforced the following distribution is preferable to that given in the table on page 40  of the Committe,e&apos;s  report : 
as a military asset, but will constitute an additional liability in case of trouble.  If theColonial Office wish to press for British troops they must obtain Cabinet sanction forthe additional units required over and  above the 19  cavalry regiments and  120 huebattalions now left to us.    The General Staff take the  strongest objection to  the  committee&apos;s proposal toscatter half battalions throughout the Far East and the West Indies.   The fallacy ofthe increased fire  power  argument  has  already  been  pointed  out, while from theadministrative point of view such dispersion is uneconomical and vicious in the extreme.Allowance  has, therefore, been made for full battalions in Hong Kong, Singapore, and north China, though  the latter  serves no military purpose and is retained  merely onForeign Office account.   If released from there it should be stationed in Ceylon, which,until that happens, must go short of British troops.  GENERAL STAFF,         WAR  OFFICE,             10th January,  1922.Secretary of State,     May I, in addition, add a few personal  words,  not of criticism, but  of  friendlywarning and advice.     I have perhaps had more experience of the working of the War Office and of its relation to the Cabinet and the C.I.D. both in Peace and in War than has fallen  to the lot of any other living  soldier.  My experience, indeed, extends over many yrears andembraces many interesting and many critical moments, and I trust, therefore, that theCabinet  will  not take  it amiss if I record in as few words  as  I  can  the  nett  resultof the knowledge thus gained and of the impression made on my mind.     So far as  my recollection carries me it is  the custom, of successive governments to decide on Policy without sufficiently considering  whether they possess the  powerand force to carry it into execution.     In  the past I need  only mention the South African War and the Great  War  in  all its theatres as examples of my contention, and in order to show that this habit stiilprevails I recall that Lord Milner&apos;s Commission  on Egypt sent in  their report without consulting the War Office ;   I find that the geddes Committee completed their  reportfor the  drastic reduction of the Army without any knowledge of, probably wholly inignorance of, the fact that a strong OLD.  Committee, with Mr. Austen Chamberlainin the chair, is  at this  moment considering  the strength of the Army in India  and the liabilities of the Home Government for sending reinforcements ;  and to the  aboveexamples, which I could add to  indefinitely, I may mention that only a few  nightsago, I received a copy of a telegram from Cannes to  Mr. Chamberlain which indicated that a military convention of far-reaching consequence  and of vast potential  militaryliabilities was to be entered into by England and France on the following afternoon, theGeneral  Staff not having  been consulted,  and  indeed  being wholly ignorant of this great change of Policy ; and to-day I see by a series of telegrams that a further and separate  agreement  of  a  like  nature  has  been  entered  into  with  the  BelgianGovernment, and even communicated to the Belgian  Press, without  the General Staffhaving any knowledge of the subject.     1 am afraid that  if our great problems  are treated in this,manner it is not possible on the one hand to maintain  contentment and efficieno)&apos;&apos; in His Majesty&apos;s Army, and  onthe  other  hand  to supply to His Majesty&apos;s Government an instrument capable ofcarrying out the Imperial Policy.     I had hoped that  the lessons of the  Great  War  would have  made  so  deep  an impression on  the people and Government of  this  country, that a repetition  of themistakes before the war, and  of the terrible losses and  disasters both during  the warand since the war would have been impossible.     If on the one hand High Policy ignores High Strategy and on the other hand HighStrategy is ignorant of  flight Policy then I am afraid  the lessons and the losses  of thelate war and the present peace will all have been in vain and our  terrible  experienceswill be repeated in the not distant future.                                                        HENRY  WILSON, F.M.,                                                                           C.I.G.S..20th January, 1922.
This  document is the  property of His Britannic Majestys Government.55                        PAPEE B. ADMINISTRATIVE.     Attention should be drawn to three main points at which the Report is seriously inerror.     1. In the summer of 1921 the Secretary of State for War  conducted, an examina-tion of the future course of Army expenditure, with the object of establishing a normaltotal of Estimates for the next  5 or  G years.   This was an entirely different problem from that of framing Estimates for 1922-23.  On the one hand large war stocks of clothing,ammunition and stores still exist, on the other hand the Army Reserve, the Militia andthe Territorial Army are at present very largely depleted and have to be built up again,and the state of Ireland was entirely abnormal.     As the result of  this examination a block total for future Army Estimates was arrived at, on an assumed establishment of the Army, and  some attempt was  made to forecast how far the Estimates of 1922-23 in their main features might diverge from thisnormal total.  With such points as the strength and composition of British garrisons inIndia, Constantinople  and the Middle East (all of which depend on matters outside the sphere of the Army  Council)  still  undecided, it was  impossible to prepare definiteEstimates for 1922-23 for review by the Geddes Committee.     The Secretary of State, therefore, communicated to that  Committee and to theTreasury the results of his investigations, and  at  a later stage  the  Treasury obtaineddepartmental^ from the War Office rough divisions of the block total for 1922-23 overthe various Arms of the Service and the Parliamentary heads of War Office estimates.These are the  papers  printed as Appendices A, B and C of the Geddes Report, and thelast  explicitly states  that the  details of the Establishments  have not  received theapproval of the Army Council.  In the calculations no attempt had been made to fore-tell 20 months in advance the course of  recruiting up  to  March, 1923,  on  which theactual strength of the Army at  any time  naturally depends.  It was explained to theCommittee in evidence that in the preparation of formal Estimates  the  invariablepractice  was to limit the money provision to the probable average strength, but theReport nevertheless conveys the impression that it is the practice of the War Office toask Parliament for money for the full nominal establishment, and to divert the extrafunds so obtained to purposes undisclosed in  the Estimates.  For this suggestion thereis no foundation whatever.     2. In  paragraph  15 the Committee propose sweeping reductions in the amount of mechanical Transport held by the Army, and appear to be under the impression that inthis  way  the  figures  laid before them can be largely reduced.   But those figures were clearly stated to have been prepared on the assumption that Ireland was in a normalstate, and do not  therefore contain provision for the maintenance of the very largequantities of Motor Transport  which  have up to the present time been  necessarilymaintained in Ireland.  The figures the  Committee  give  in Appendix F., for existingnumbers of vehicles additional to normal establishment,- have thus no connection with theEstimate for 1922-23, and were separately furnished.     Again,  the  comparison made with 1914,  in  which year  motor transport for  theArmy was still in  its infancy, is for  this reason illusory ; and moreover it makes no allowance for the very large number of horse-drawn vehicles put  out of commission bythe extension of mechanical transport.   The  light lorry, which the Committee appearto regard as in some sense a luxury, is required for a very important further extensionof the same process.     With the changed position in Ireland, it has become possible to  adopt the recom-mendation to reduce by 50 per  cent, the vehicles maintained for use in peace, but  it isnot  possible to  surrender, as the Committee propose, all the vehicles in mobilizationreserve.   They consist  entirely of  technical  vehicles (in  some  cases bodies withoutchassis) such as gun tractors, searchlight  lorries, wireless telegraph vans and ambulancebodies, without which no mobilization  can take place, and which cannot be  obtainedfrom civilian sources by impressment.     3. In  paragraph  20 the  Committee put  forward &quot; an  accurate  mathematicalcompilation based on actuals&quot;  which purports  to show that of the  total garrisonsabroad some 35,000  are  to be considered  abnormal  and should be  found from  thenumbers  normally at  home, and  that  some 54,000 men more  than are necessary areborne on  the  establishment of the Army; and the Committee  appear largely to rely upon this table  to support  their  opinion that the Army could be reduced by 50,000men, without any reduction in the forces abroad.     - (B22/72)  50  2/22  HAS, Ltd 9671-4wo
     Owing to misunderstandings, the figures contain two errors affecting the garrisonsof India and Constantinople, the correction of which reduces the abnormal garrisons to31,000  and the so-called excess to 40,000.   Apart from this, to hold up  such  purelyarithmetical  calculations as  showing that &quot; the staffing  and use  of man-power  in  theArmy &quot; are uneconomical is fallacious.  The argument assumes that (1) the sole purposeof the Army at home is to find drafts for that abroad, (2)  the various arms of the service should  consequently exist in  the  same proportions  at  home as abroad, and  (3) no special  provision need be made for  the  mobilization of any expeditionary force.   but owing to the military conditions in India and the  Colonies,  Artillery, Engineers and departmental troops  generally  do  not  exist there in the proportions required for aField Army, and  consequently the home forces, if modelled on the  principles  of  the geddes Committee, would be incapable of taking the field.   This is clearly seen as soonas the  calculation is applied, not to total strengths, but  to each Arm  separately.   the cavalry and Infantry at home, far  from  being in excess,  fall  short of the Geddesstandard by  5,000 and  2,000  respectively, and still must somehow find out of thesedeficiencies abnormal foreign garrisons of 3,500 Cavalry and  12,500  Infantry;  Tankscould not  exist at home, because  there are none abroad ; the Artillery  of the field army would  be short by some 2,500 men, and so on.     Regard being had to the requirements of each Arm of the Service and the obviouswaste of power involved in maintaining  troops at  home  without  reference to the  dueproportions required  for war, the largest reduction practicable is about 33,500 officersand  men.     4.  Less important points upon which the savings proposed by the Committee  are definitely impracticable are      (i.) In paragraph  10 the  figure of  2,217,000  for  Maintenance of Buildings,           which the Committee propose to reduce by at least 40 per cent., is that for           1921-23, and not that proposed for 1922-23, which is  1,950,000.     (ii.) In paragraph 13 the proposed saving of  500,000 a year,  to be  effected by           making uniforms wear  longer, cannot be made in the Estimates of any year           until  the time comes when money is provided to replace the consumption of           clothing.   In 1922-23, owing to the existence of war stocks, no such saving           is possible.    (iii.) In paragraph 14 the Committee say it is obvious that if the  strength of the           personnel  of  the  Army is  14,000 to 20,000  below establishment, there           should  be at least a  corresponding reduction  in  the strength of horses.           This is not the   case.   A shortage of  infantry or other dismounted men is           no reason  why mounted  men  should  go short of horses.  The statement.           that horses had  been  bought  in 1921-22,  sold again, and  76,000 then           provided to replace  them in the  Estimates  of 1922-23 is contrary to fact,           and must be due to misapprehension.

February 1922.SECRET.G.R.C. (D.D.) 5.APPENDIX  III.COMMENTS OF AIR MINISTRY ON REPORT OF GEDDES COMMITTEE.The comments of the Air  Ministry on the  Report of the Geddes  Committee are    divided into two parts.  The first part  which is  appended immediately below    consists of the substantive proposals of the  Air  Ministry in response  to the    recommendations of the Geddes Committee.   The  second part  (annexed as    Statement I) contains observations in detail by the Air Ministry on the Report    of the Geddes Committee.     TFIE Geddes Committee Report recommends the reduction of the Air Estimates by b\ millions, and indicates roughly the lines upon which savings could be made.     In the  first  place-the Committee recommend a  reduction of eight  and a half squadrons, and estimate that a saving of 2% millions would result.  If this amount could be saved, at  least half of it 1^ millions would have to come  off  Vote 3. Later in their Report the Committee recommend an additional cut of 1 million on Vote 3.  The gross  reduction of 2\ millions would wipe out altogether any provision under Vote  3.     It is clear that any possible savings on Vote 3 have been counted twice over,  and the total  reductions proposed by the Committee, even if  they  were all otherwise fully realisable, would,  therefore, amount  to 4^, not b\ millions.     2. Secondly, it must be remembered  that this reduction of 4-^ millions would have to be  made almost entirely  by cutting down  the  Air Force  in  the United Kingdom, the only  cuts which the Committee recommend abroad being a reduction of two squadrons in Egypt and half  a squadron in the Mediterranean.     3. The  Geddes Committee&apos;s recommendation that eight, and a half squadrons should be disbanded would still further reduce the proportion of &quot; fruit&quot; to  the &quot; tree&apos; &quot; a  proportion which it is in any case difficult to  maintain at a satisfactory level in view of the small size and highly  technical character of the Air Force as a whole.  It is impossible without killing the  tree to pare  away the trunk any more, however attenuated the  fruit, except to the extent indicated hereafter.     The Air Council  are not, however, of the opinion that  the adoption of  the full recommendations of the Geddes  Committee would effect a  reduction even of 4^ millions.  They consider that the total of the reductions would be in the neighbour- hood of  2,900,000, of which about   1,050,000 would be due to  the  elimination of the eight and a half squadrons and  the  remainder to reductions  under other heads (for further details  see Statement II).     The Council have not prepared any estimate of the size of the Force which could be provided  on the assumption that the full cut of 5\ millions was made. A cut to that amount would  involve a reduction of the net Estimates from 13 to 1\ millions, and would necessitate an  entire reconstruction of  the existing organisation  and administration of the Air Force.     4.  The  Air CounciF-s own proposal, as  set out below,  would, on the contrary, increase the  &apos;&apos; fruit,&quot; while still oroviding for considerable reductions on the central organisation and overhead services.     It appears to them  to be a doubtful and dangerous form of economy, when  theAir Force  is admittedly being asked to take over increasing responsibilities, to impose a further reduction in the few squadrons which are now maintained ; the result sooner or later is  bound to be that the Force  will be unable to carry out the duties entrusted to it.     The Balfour Memorandum (C.I.D.  Paper No.  149)  lays it down that  the Air      [7784]                                                          B
 Defence of England is an Air Ministry responsibility.*   The  C.I.D. have, more- over, lately set up a Committee to enquire into the question of what measures would be required to deal with a continental air attack on the assumptions      (a.) That the Navy will keep the command of the sea, and secure the country           from invasion from the sea, and     (/;.) That the Army will not  be required to operate on the continent.     6.  This responsibility was not dealt with before the  Geddes Committee except by a passing  reference to the Auxiliary Air Force in connection with the mainten- ance of Territorial Army.  This will be an increased responsibility and a source of increased expenditure.     7.  The Air Council think that  it  is impossible to  dissociate the question of provision  for home  defence from the  scheme  which, under  the directions of the Cabinet Committee,  they are required  to put  forward,  arising out of the recom- mendations of the Geddes Committee,  and they  feel compelled  seriously to  recon- sider (as, indeed, they have had in their mind to do for some considerable time) the basis on which the allocation of air units is at present framed.     8.  If a nucleus for  home defence  is to  be provided  concurrently  with  any appreciable reduction on the sketch Estimates  for 1922/23, a radical alteration of view in regard to the position of the Air Force in regard to the older services and to its own responsibilities is required.     The great majority of air units should not continue to be allotted,  as at present, for duties which are purely auxiliary to those of the Navy and Army; they must be used so far as practicable as a  substitute for instead of as an  addition to the forces of the Navy and  Army.     9.  While, however, of opinion that the definite allocation of an undue propor- tion of squadrons to the other services  ties them  down to a  restricted role,  which reduces both  their actual and potential value, the  Air  Council are, nevertheless, strongly of opinion that the art of co-operation with the Navy and Army must be kept alive. To reduce the squadrons co-operating with the Navy at home to  one, as the Geddes Committee propose, would not  provide for the maintenance of  the art of co-operation with the Fleet in even one single aspect,  with the possible exception of spotting for their guns.     10. In the Report of the Geddes Committee reference is made to the five squad- rons  allotted  to  the  Navy in the  United Kingdom.    This number is exclusive of squadrons, or the equivalent of squadrons, entirely utilised for training purposes for naval requirements.  The total allotment to the Navy in the United Kingdom is, in fact, in the neighbourhood of seven squadrons.  The Council are of opinion that this number could be reduced without risking the continuance of development and of co-operation between the two services.   The  question as  to how the  net reduction could be most conveniently arranged is one for settlement  between the Admiralty and Air Ministry.  The result  should be that the total active service units at present with the Navy could be  reduced by the equivalent of two squadrons.     Similarly they consider that the two squadrons hitherto allotted to the Army in Ireland could be withdrawn and that the Army quota in the United Kingdom could be reduced to one squadron.     The Air  Council do not anticipate that either the Admiralty or the War Office will willingly accept these proposals, but, in all the circumstances  of the case, they think that they should be adopted.     11. If the four  squadrons so withdrawn were employed to  form the  nucleus of a home defence force they would still remain  available for work  with  the Navy and Army for some particular operation if  not required at the time for home  defence. They would also be able to undertake some of the work in  connection with the flying training of pilots.    * OLD. No. 1-19. &quot; Are there or are there not military operations of first class importance in which the main burden of  responsibility  is thrown  upon the Air  Force, while the  other services play either an insignificant part or no part at all ? The Air Force claim that there  are, and it  seems to me that their claim. must, be allowed.  Of these operations the most striking is home defence against air raids.  The Air Force assert that if there is another great war the first and most  formidable danger which these islands will run will take the form of great air attack directed against London and other vital spots .... Here again we have a military operation which could not  only be carried out independently by the Air Force, but which cannot be carried out by anything else.&quot;                                        , r ,
    12. Similarly in the case of the squadrons now allotted to the Army in egypt and Palestine, which the Committee suggest might be reduced by two, the  council are of opinion that, in view of air commitments in the East generally, reduction isnot feasible.  They consider, however, that two of the squadrons should no longer be definitely allotted to co-operation with the Army, but should be held  in reserve, sothat they can be utilised for any purpose as required,  including co-operation withthe Army,  if necessary.    13. The Council have put forward this scheme with  some diffidence,  becausethey realise that it does not meet the Geddes Committee recommendations for directeconomy by a reduction of squadrons.  They are, however, prepared to carry it intoeffect  while at the same time  making a total reduction of  500,000  distributed between Votes 1, 2 and  3, and are of opinion that this reduction can be  made withoutany great loss of efficiency,  wdiile the proposed reduction of squadrons could not,for the reasons they have given above.    14. The Council also urge most strongly the raising of five Auxiliary Air Force squadrons,  which, added  to the four regular squadrons withdrawn from co-opera-tion with the Army and Navy at home, as recommended above, would provide a goodnucleus for a Home Defence Scheme.    The cost of this Force, which they estimate at  200,000 for 1922/23, would bean offset against the  reductions  proposed  on  air expenditure, but  should enablereductions  at least equal in amount to be made in the expenditure on the TerritorialArmy.  The Air  Council  look upon aerial attack as a much greater danger thaninvasion by sea, which  they can hardly conceive as possible under present conditionsof relative  naval strength.  Even granted, however, that such a  danger existed, thesame Home Defence Force would be  able to deal equally with invasion by sea or byaerial attack.    15. The Council consider that Vote 4 (Works Services) could have been reducedby  550,000 were it not for an estimated increase of  250,000 since sketch estimates were presented, on liquidation of war liabilities, compensations and reinstatements,over which the Council have no control, which will make the net reduction  300,000.This will  mean that practically no new building can be undertaken.    The Council  feel  that they  must press  for  provision  to be  made  for  thecompletion of Halton.  This is essential, and is, moreover, financially  sound in viewrof the large sum  already expended,  since it  is  estimated  that it will only  cost 100,000 more to complete than to stop work.    They wish to make it clear  that their plans for boy  training provide ,for thoseskilled trades only which it is impossible to fill by direct enlistment of trained men.It is not,  and never has been, proposed to train boys for any trade for which menrecruits are obtainable.    16. The Council consider that it is not possible to reduce Vote 5 (Air Ministry)by more than  80,000.  In the Air Force,  in place of having a large number ofcommands  spread over the United Kingdom, as in the  case of the Army and  Navy,work  is largely centralised in the Air Ministry.  This can be done in  a small force.Any greater reduction would necessitate changing the system altogether,  which inthe long run wrould inevitably be more expensive.    17. As regards Vote 8 (Civil Aviation), the Air Council are prepared to acceptthe recommendation of the Geddes Committee  that expenditure should be limited tothe subsidy scheme and other existing commitments, and that  the cost of  meteoro-logical services should be reduced, such specifically Air Force Services as are  requiredbeing charged against  service Votes.  But the utmost reduction on the sketch Esti-mates  which they calculate  can be made on this basis is  350,000,  instead of the 400,000 which the Committee suggested might be possible.    18. Under Vote 9 (Supply and Research), the Council consider that a total reduction of  227,000 can be made, of which  80,000 is a cut on the actual programmeof experimental machines and engines.    The full reduction of  494,000 suggested by the Geckles Committee is impracticable-able owing to  existing commitments, and any large  reduction beyond that  nowproposed would mean that there would be no research on machines or engines for ayear for certain,  and  that the following year,  in the absence of orders, practicallythe whole industry would  disappear.  The Air Ministry would then be compelled toset up designing and manufacturing staffs of its own, which would certainly  not beeconomical, and would  provide no non-official nucleus for expansion if  required       [7784]                                                    .

    19. To sum  up, the  maximum reductions  which, to the Air  Council, after-consideration, appear possible, are : Votes 1,  2 and 3Vote 4Vote 5Vote 8Vote 9Offset by  additional War  Liability           Net  reductions       500,000  550,000   80,000  350,000  227,0001,707,000  250,0001.457.000     The effect of these reductions would  be to reduce the provision  in  the sketchEstimates for the year 1922/23 from  a  gross  total  of  15,542,700  to one  of 14,085,700.   This amount includes  750,000 for war liabilities ( 250,000 more thanin the sketch Estimates),  and  1,720,700 cash provision for Irak and  Palestine,neither of which items have been affected by or contributed to the further economiesproposed.    20. It is necessary to point out that     (1.)  As regards equipment, the scheme outlined above rests essentially on the          policy of drawing on war stocks without present replacement, and of          reducing the scales of authorised reserve machines for existing squadrons.          The effect of this will be that within the next few  years large  orders for          new machines  will be necessary.  When  this will be depends  mainly on          the duration of life of the reconditioned machines.    (2.)  The figures of  1,720,700 for  the Middle East  in  the sketch  Estimates          purported only to cover the cash cost in  1922/23  of the air units (eight          squadrons, repair  depots,  area and group headquarters, &amp;c., in Irak,          and one squadron  in Palestine); it did not include (e.g., provision for          tanks or armoured cars or auxiliary services), at  present borne on War          Office  Votes.   Their transfer to  Air  Votes  will  represent an entirely          new liability, and will involve corresponding additions to Air Estimates.    Air  Ministry, January 16, 1922.
                                 STATEMENT I.(Secret.)   Observations in Detail on Report of Committee on National  Expenditure.      (Prepared by the Air Ministry for Mr. Churchill&apos;s Cabinet Committee.)[The references are to the pages and paragraphs of the Report of the Committee on National Expenditure.]Note. The Air Council have thought it necessary to set out in detail the reasons why    in their  opinion the full recommendations of  the Committee are not in all    cases capable of adoption.  They wish  to  make  it clear,  however,  that the    proposals of the Committee in their various aspects are  being, and will be,  fully    investigated with a view to securing all possible economies.Page 62, Para. 2.    1.  The proposals for expenditure for 1922/23 as already put forward by theAir Ministry in the sketch Estimates presented in Julv, 1921, showed a reduction of 3,491,167 on the expenditure  for  the  year 1921/22, the figures  being  1921/22, 19,033,867, and  1922/23.   15,542,700.  This saving was  budgetted  for, althoughdefinite increases  of responsibilities had to be provided for in order to carry out theGovernments policy for the substitution of air for military power in the Middle East.The figures on which the saving is calculated  include the amounts repayable for air services  from  the  Middle  East  Department,  i.e.,  they  show  the  Middle  Eastexpenditure and ordinary expenditure lumped together so as to show  the full cost forair  services to the British Exchequer.  The sketch  Estimates  were framed with  aview to producing  the  greatest number  of active units in  proportion to  the  totalexpenditure,  and to that  end overhead expenditure in the widest sense of the term(i.e., training and repair establishments,  works supply and technical services)  hasthus already been drastically reduced.  No wide margin for further  reduction existsexcept on the condition of reducing the central organisation to an extent which would imply that this country would be content to be both actually and potentially a second-class Power in the air.     2. The Air Council cannot but feel that this factor has been obscured by theadoption on the part of the Committee of a ratio of expenditure in the proportion of21  per cent,  &quot;for active service  squadrons,&quot; and 79 per cent,  for  :&apos;other airexpenditure.&quot;  The Air Council consider that a division of expenditure on this basisis misleading, and is entirely inapplicable to  a highly technical service, which mustnecessarily have a large organisation for training, maintenance and administration,to enable  it to produce its operational  units.   It would be just  as logical to take thecost of the railway trains run by a railway company, and of the engine drivers, stokersand  guards actually running them, and to compare it with the sum spent on theremaining personnel of the  company, permanent way, stations, signal boxes, enginesheds,  &amp;c.  A division  of  expenditure on this  basis was only put forward by the air council at the specific request of the Committee, and with a note which pointed out itsfallaciousness.Page 63, Para. 3.     3. The Air CounciFs proposals as regards the reduction of squadrons for  work with the Navy and Army are set out in the Memorandum above.*  They note that theCommittee estimate that the adoption of a scheme of reduction of squadrons from 32^to 24 would effect a saving of  2,500,000 per annum.  This  figure appears to rest on two misconceptions :       (i.)  It has apparently been arrived at by adding the cost of 32^ squadrons on a           basis of the figure of  3,511,000 to the cost of other establishments on a           basis  of  the figure of   7,912,000  (see paragraph 2 of the Committee&apos;s           report), and dividing this total by four.     For the  reasons already indicated, this  method is entirely misleading, as it  isimpossible to reduce the  foundations  of the  edifice in the same proportion as thesuperstructure.     (ii.) That the  saving of 2\ millions  is  additional to  a saving of 1 million on           Vote 3.                               *  See paragraphs 10-14.
     If the 2- - millions could be saved, it would, to the extent of something like 50 per cent, come off Vote 3.  The net Estimate, however, for Vote 3 for 1922/23 (excluding provision for squadrons in Middle East and India,  which could contribute little, if anything, to the proposed 11 cut &quot;)  is only  1,352,000,  of which   250,000 is for war liabilities.  The Vote would, therefore, be wiped out altogether.  It would therefore appear that the full reduction  recommended by the Geddes Committee, even  if  all the reductions proposed under the other Votes were possible, would be in the neigh- bourhood of 44 millions rather than of b\ millions as  suggested. Page 64. Para. 4.   &apos;     4.  As regards the  proportion of officers and men  engaged in  operational units, the observations on paragraph 2 apply. Page 64, Para. 5.     5.  Training and Education. The figures quoted by the Committee require some analysis.  The numbers engaged in connection with education and  training are  made up as  follows :                                                   Officers.     Other lianks.             (a.) Flying Training       ...         192        2,126             (b.) Higher Training      ...         122        1,350             (c.)  Other Ranks Training ...         180        1,854             (d.) Cadet College ...      ...          58           339     6. As regards (a), this necessitates training a large number of pupils  annually, 280 on the above basis.  The training is lengthy and  must obviously be very carefully carried out  to  avoid accidents.  A detailed analysis of training experience during the war was made immediately after the armistice  with  a view to reducing to the utmost  the high casualty rate which had prevailed, and the present establishments are based on that analysis and the further experience since gained.  One of the  chief lessons  learnt is that plenty of  dual control tuition is of the  very first importance. This is  most wearing  work,  and  consequently the number of pupils each flying instructor can deal with is small.   Another factor  is  that  it is unsafe to have too many machines in the air at  once  when flown by pupils whose whole  attention is absorbed in  flying.  This limits the number of pupils at each school and increases the number of separate schools necessary\y.     The proof of the pudding is in the eating, and it is an undoubted fact, that the care exercised  in this matter  has  greatly reduced the number of accidents during training to a mere fraction of the number that occurred during the war.    Again, these short service officers do not have the benefit of a Cadet College course, and must be taught a good deal besides flying  at the Flying Training Schools, e.g., the running of engines, rigging, armament, if they are  to take  their place in units at the end of the course.    As regards other ranks,  the number of aeroplanes must be considerable owing to the number of  pupils, and it  is essential that they should be maintained in first- class  condition by men  who  are  personally  responsible for  each machine.   In addition each  school  must have its workshops to deal with  the  continuous minor repairs necessary unless great waste of material is to take place.  Some instructors on ground subjects are required. A supply  of  spare parts of almost infinite variety and stores of all kinds must be maintained and accounted for; and lastly, administra- tive personnel, such as cooks, clerks and the like cannot be dispensed with. Page 64, Para. 5.    7.  The  numbers under (b) Higher Training are  to deal  with 186 officers, and in view of the multiplicity of subjects which have to  be taught cannot be considered excessive.   These  subjects comprise, aerial  navigation, aerial  gunnery and  bomb dropping, photography, wireless co-operation with the  Army, including spotting for the  artillery,  reconnaissance  and  co-operation  with  the  infantry  and tanks, co-operation with the Navy including spotting for naval artillery (quite&apos;different  fromspotting for land artillery), Naval  reconnaissance, torpedo dropping, flying on andoff the  deck.Page 64, Para,. 5.    8.  Similarly the numbers under (c) who deal with the training of over 6,000 other ranks are not unduly large when it is remembered that practically the whole of the
 6,000 have to be taught  a trade, in most eases a highly technical one, necessitating very small classes under  each instructor, and that the administration of this number of men alone must absorb a considerable proportion of the officers and men. Page 64, Para. 5.     f). The number under training is at present abnormal owing to the need of filling up the large gaps left by demobilisation  in  a  force of which practically  the whole personnel was serving on temporary war engagements. Under normal circumstances the numbers under training for the*Royal Air Force, at its present strength, would be more in the region of 4,000 than 6,000. with,  of course, a  corresponding reduction in the number of officers and other ranks employed in  training them. Page 64, Para. 5.     10.  As regards the Cadet College, the bulk of the personnel, viz., 41 officers and 265 other ranks are required to enable the cadets to be taught to fly.   The cost bi these annually,  per  cadet, works out to   380  per  cadet,  so that  the cost of  the remainder of the education comes to  850- 380- 470 per cadet, per annum, an almost identical figure with the cost at Dartmouth.  The cost of a Royal Air Force cadet, owing to the technical and scientific nature of his training, cannot be compared with that of a cadet at Sandhurst, nor of an artillery cadet at Woolwich.  It is only comparable to that of an R.E. cadet at Woolwich or of a naval cadet.  It has been shown above that the  cost apart from flying of cadets at Dartmouth  and Cranwell is practically identical, while in the case of an R.E. cadet, the Committee do not appear to have taken into account the fact that after leaving Woolwich R.E.  cadets do a further two years&apos; course of instruction at the S.M.E.,  Chatham,  on  officer&apos;s pay, before joining service units. Pages 64, 65, Para. 5.    11.  The question as to  whether parents  should  pay  a larger proportion of  the cost is open to argument. On the face of it they should, but practical objections at the moment are :      (1.)  That the supply of cadets is  not meeting the demand and is unlikely to do           so for some time, owing to the  doubtful prospects always held out by  the           Fighting Services after a great war.    (2.)  That the cry would  undoubtedly be raised in  certain quarters  that  the           services were  being made a preserve for the well-to-do. Page 65, Para. 6.    12. The Committee  say that R.A.F.  officers,  in comparison  with officers  of equivalent rank in the Army, receive  additional pay of roughly  5s. to 10s. a day. They presume that this is for flying risk.    The  difference  in substantive pay alone is  not  in any case as  much as 10s.Apparently the Committee have reached their figures by comparing the emolumentsof the two services as stated in the tables recently prepared by the  Treasury.  the differences as thus calculated include :           (i.) Estimated value of prospective retired pay,  and         (ii.) Lodging allowance.    It is considered that bo,th these factors  should be eliminated, and that in anycase neither has any reference to the element of risk.  The value of (i) is estimated at6s. Id. a day for the Air Force, and 5s. 9c?.  for the Army.  These (as explained by theTreasury) are very rough and  ready figures,  and it remains for experience to showwhether the difference is as great as they suggest.  Moreover, a flat rate for all rankshas been  taken, and this means that a more ,exact comparison would  show a lesserdifference in the lower ranks, and the value of  possible retired pay as  relatively small.It is in the lower ranks only that the  emoluments of the R.A.F. exceed those of theArmy; in  the  rank  of  Wing  Commander  (Lieutenant-Colonel)   and  above,  theadvantage lies  with the  Army.   The reason for the exclusion of  (ii)  is  that theunmarried officer only receives the higher rate of lodging allowance in  a minority ofcases where accommodation in kind is not available.   On the other hand, the marriedArmy officer is available for furniture allowance, while the R.A.F. officer is not.  Ifthese factors are eliminated, the comparison can be confined to substantive pay.
Page 65, Para. 6.  &apos;     13. As regards substantive pay, it is observed that the Committee have comparedR.A.F. with  infantry rates.  It is suggested, however, that  the R.A.F.  is a technicalservice  more nearly  comparable  with the Royal  Engineers.  On  that standard of comparison the  difference in favour of the Air Force is much less as  will be seen from the following table :                              GENERAL Duties Branch.Rank.Infantry.R.E.t.A.F.2nd lieutenant (pilot officer)Lieutenant (flying- officer)   ,,    after 2 years in substantive rank   ,,      ,.  7 years&apos; total service..Captain (flight lieutenant)  .,   after 15 years&apos; total service  ..Major (squadron leader)  ,,   after 5 years in rankLieutenant-colonel (wing commander)..Command pay   6&apos;.

The Committee, moreover, make no allowance for the absence from the R.A.F.scheme  of emoluments of staff  pay or extra duty pay  (e.g., 5s. a day  payable toAdjutants in the Army).  In the Army, staff appointments  are more  or less normalin ranks above Lieutenant-Colonel and not at all uncommon in lower ranks.  Outsidethe Air Ministry we have nothing corresponding to such appointments.     The  Air Council  hold  strongly  that the non-provision of  staff pay is botheconomical to the State and advantageous to the efficient administration of the  AirService.   If necessary a paper can be prepared dealing in detail with the pay question in all its aspects.Page 65, Para. 6.     15. The Committee refer to the higher rates of pay of certain ranks of the R. A.F.Medical Service as compared with the R.A.M.C.   The respective rates are shown inStatement (B), attached.  The differences in the lower  ranks are due not only toflying risk, but also to the absence of charge pay and specialist pay from the R.A.F.scheme.   It may be mentioned,  also,  that the R.A.F. Medical  Officer is on a short service  commission only,  during  the  first  years of his service.   This  drawback,however, has been partly adjusted by an arrangement with the Army that they  willtake some of our short-service officers for whom we cannot find room on  our permanentlist.

Clothing   and   Travelling   Allowances. (a.)  The  quarterly  clothingallowance  rates are periodically reviewed to take account of variations in the costof garments and of changes in the approved scales.  Every care is taken to see thatold uniforms are retained for use on  working  parties, &amp;c., as long as possible, butit is essential  for a voluntarily enlisted force to maintain a reasonable standard ofsmartness  and to be in possession of uniform fit for wear on public occasions.  It isobvious that the quarterly allowance  for the R.A.F. must be on the same basis asthat  for  the  Army  and  that a reduction can  only  be made  in both  servicessimultaneously.   As much larger numbers  are  involved for the Army, the  pointmust be decided first  for that&quot; service.  No reduction could be made for the  R.A.F.unless the Army make a reduction.  The sum  involved in the case of Air Votes isabout  100,000;  offset, however,  by  a reduction  in  the receipts from airmen o&apos;f 50,000.     (b.) Concession Vouchers. -The issue of return tickets at single fares  appliesonly to cases when the officer or man is granted leave periods of seven days or over,and in the case of the officer  only  when  travelling  to  and  from London.    Theestimated cost  of these concessions for a full financial year is   40,000, which  will bereduced by about  3,000 if units are withdrawn from  Ireland.Page 65, Para. 8.     17. Technical Equipment. The  reference to expenditure on converting andreconditioning suggests a  misapprehension on the  part of the Committee as to whatis involved thereby.   The object of that expenditure is not to incorporate  recentimprovements  in machines, but merely to make them safe to  fly.   It is a necessarycorollary to the present situation in which the Air Eorce is living  almost entirely on war stocks (out of  a total of 3,700 machines  only 300 have been ordered  since thearmistice)  the  bulk of which have  been  in  storage for three or  more  years.   TheCouncil&apos;s policy is to  make the utmost use of war stocks, and with this end in viewthey are working on a duration of life basis which has been progressively increased.It is, however, necessary to bear in mind  that all machines deteriorate in store, andthat some  are  found to  do so  to such  an extent that reconditioning is not  justified.Others, again,  may  be of  types which, owing to the small number of squadrons ofthose  types  maintained  or  to  a low rate  of   wastage, will  prove surplus to requierements.   Lastly, it is essential to guard  against any ground for suspicion on       [7784]                                                             C
the part of officers or cadets that their lives are being risked in order to retain oncharge  machines that have passed  the  age of safe usability.    Subject to these considerations, and having in mind the desirability of  not  retaining war stocksbeyond  a  point  of deterioration when  reconditioning becomes impracticable oruneconomic, the  policy  of the  Air Council is now to make the  fullest use of warstocks,  though (as the  Committee  themselves  have pointed, out)  the  process of drawing on these reserves without present replacements hastens  the  day when largereplacement orders will have  to  be  given.   It  should be  borne  in  mind also thatthe Vote for machines  and engines  has  already been reduced from  1.681,000 for1921/22 to  1,021,000  for 1922/23.   Apart from the  necessity in the  interest of safety of reconditioning machines which have been held in stock for some time, thework involved helps to keep the aircraft industry  going.&apos; on the rapid  expansionof which the country would be dependent in case of emergency.     The Committee seem to  have  been  under some misapprehension as  regardsconversion.    They  have added   together  forty-five Nighthawks,  which  requireconversion  to  take  the B.E. 2  engine, and twenty machines  to  be  &quot;converted&quot;  todual control.   The latter item only represents   6,000, and  both items are clearlywithin  their  own  stipulation  that  action  &quot; should be  restricted to cases wheresatisfactory machines of  a  particular  type required,  or some other  reasonablysuitable type,  are not available.&quot;Page 66, Para. 8.     The Air  Council will not press their proposal to  spend  500,000  for  extramachines for  emergencies, but  His Majesty&apos;s Government must  recognise that theabsence of  this provision will increase the expenditure which will be required for new stocks as  the war stocks become exhausted or in the event of air operations ofany magnitude being required  in  any part of the world.Pages 66, 67, Para. 8.    18.  Motor Transport. An average  cost of   475 for overhauling vehicles bythe makers is considered reasonable.  It may be observed that  it is in  any  eventmuch below the price quoted by the  Slough Trading Company.    The Air  Council defer any  comment on the suggestion  that motor  transportrepair work  for the three services would  be  more economically  carried out  ifcentralised under one control, until a definite proposal to that end is  put forward.    As  regards the scale of motor  transport establishments, the Council considerit essential that  squadrons abroad,  which have  to be prepared  for  active or semi-active service  conditions at any time, should be supplied with establishments on awar basis.    As  regards squadrons and other establishments at home, the Air Council aretaking  steps  to  effect  considerable reductions in the  establishments  of motor transport, and in particular as a result of  the Irish settlement they now propose to put the squadrons  stationed  at home on a reduced and peace establishment. Reductions inmotor transport, however, while they would effect minor economies in personnel, wouldhave no effect on the expenditure under Vote 3 for the next financial year.   TheAir Council, however, dissent most  emphatically from the proposal that  the wholeof&quot; the vehicles now held surplus  to establishments should be surrendered.   Theythink that  such a policy would have  disastrous financial  results.   At  presentserviceable vehicles are retained in use as long as they can be regarded as reasonablyefficient.   As and  when they become worn out  they are replaced by reconditionedtransport and disposed  of.  The Committees are probably unaware of the steps which have already been taken to dispose of vehicles  since  the armistice.   Theactual number notified for disposal since January 1919 has been 18,900 vehicles ofall types.   The numbers (2,200) at present retained above establishment represent only some 10 per cent, of the total surplus upon final establishment figures, but ofthis number at least 600 will be disposed of before the end of the present financialyear.    As regards the remainder,  the  numbers for retention will  be carefullyreviewed,  but the  entire and  immediate surrender of  the  whole surplus  aboveestablished figures  would be the reverse  of economical,  as it  could  involve  making provision for  new  purchases instead of overhaul during  1922/23 and subsequent years.   The Council are confident that  their policy of retaining some  margin of vehicles to  meet normal replacement requirements is far less costly than orderingnew vehicles.    The Committee recommend &quot;using  up&quot; the stock of aircraft and  disposing of the stock of motor transport, but the argument for &quot; using up  &quot; is really stronger
 as  regards these vehicles as their rate of deterioration in store is much less rapid than that of aircraft. Pages 67. 68, Para. 9.     19.  Boys  Training. The Report presses for the abandonment of boys&apos; training at  Halton owing to its  cost and the retention of a maximum of 1,300 boys under training at Cranwell, the decreased annual output to be met by the direct enlistment of skilled men.     The proposal must be examined from the point of          (a.) Practicability.  i.e., whether it is  possible  to enlist skilled men.         (b.) Economy.         (c.)  Efficiency.     It is only proposed  to fill  a limited number of trades bv boy training, viz., the following :          Carpenter riggers and other specialist carpenters,         Pattern makers,         Aero-engine and other fitters,         Turners,         Instrument makers,         Coppersmiths.         Electricians.         Wireless mechanics.         Draughtsmen, and the numbers borne on the establishment, as put forward in the sketch Estimates for  1922/23.  are approximately 7,500.   Assuming  that men are  enlisted  for eight years&apos; colour service, it  is obvious that they could not be drafted  direct to units.   They must all be given some previous training, and  carpenter riggers and aero-engine fitters, at least,  who account together  for  some 6,000 out of the 7,500, must also be given some  further technical training, as these trades  are practically non-existent in civil life. Pages 67, 68, Paras. 9-19.     20. If we allow, on the most favourable basis, six months as the average training required, the useful life of such recruits would be seven  and a-half years, and, to maintain an establishment of 7,500.  1,000 would have to be  enlisted yearly on  the assumption that extensions of service balanced wastage.     These men  would have to come  up  to  the highest standard of skill  and reliability of the best-trained civilian mechanics.    All  the  available evidence  proves that it would be impossible to  obtain a sufficient supply of such  recruits. Pages 67, 68, Para. 9.    21. The original decision  to&apos; adopt a system of boy  training for these trades was based on the conviction, already fully proved in the case of the  Navy, that  the highly-skilled mechanic who had passed through a long civil apprenticeship would always command wages  which, in conjunction with the other advantages of civil employment such as freedom of movement and the avoidance of service discipline and constraint would, except in a comparatively few cases, outweigh any advantagesoffered by the R.A.F.    If this conviction is mistaken, the  error would inevitably have been brought to light  by  the acute trade  depression  of  1921, during which, if ever,  recruits woiddhave  been  forthcoming.    Yet all  three services failed  altogether  to obtain  the desired quota of such recruits.    The R.A.F.,  owing to rapid demobilisation of personnel  enlisted on temporarywar-time engagements, has been  in urgent need of skilled recruits in the majorityof trades, but, although cooks and clerks have offered themselves in large numbers,the intake of skilled recruits for the long apprenticeship trades has been negligible.On this point figures  can be produced, if necessary.    The  Admiralty  have onlyrecruited twenty-five  skilled ratings,  and rely entirely on boy entries,  while  theWar  Office have not been able to recruit sufficient men to  maintain more  thanone-third of their establishment of skilled men.      [7784]                                                         C  2
     The fact is  that  the main inducement to  enlist in the fighting services hasalways  lain  and  still  lies  in the  necessity  of obtaining an immediate livelihood.Highly-skilled  mechanics are  sure of  their  livelihood even  in  times of  trade depression,  and  for  dealing with  machines on  which  the safety  of the flyingpersonnel depends, none but the best can be relied upon.Page 67, Para. 9.     22. From the financial point of view the abandonment of Halton as a boys&apos;training establishment would result in heavy nugatory capital expenditure, as thereis no strong case  for its retention  for other  purposes.     The following expenditure has already taken place :       (a.)  Purchase of Estate:  124,000.  -This was the price the  house and estate           of 3,000  acres, half of  which  has  been placed in the  hands of  the           Disposal  and Liquidation  Commission.    Purchase avoided reinstate-           ment,  which would otherwise have been very costly.    The house would           be difficult to resell  under present  conditions,  and  a great deal  of           reinstatement would be required to restore the agricultural value of the           land.  The huts will be sold in any case as they become surplus.     (b.) Erection of Permanent Buildings, Roads, Drainage, Water, Sec.;  560,000.            Over  500,000 of this was expended during the war.  The technical           workshops,  which cost   152,000. are  essentially instructional shops, and           are not laid out or equipped for production.   They would, therefore,  be           unlikely  to sell  as a  going  concern.   The disposal  value of  other           permanent  buildings would be  very  small, while expenditure on  roads           and drainage would be a dead loss.     (c.) Erection of New Barracks.  350,000  has already  been  expended.   Flalf           are  practically  completed and  the   remainder are far  advanced.           Contracts for the  whole service are let, all materials are on the site, and           heavy  compensation would no doubt have to be paid for cancellation.     As  against this, completion is estimated to cost approximately  370,000, partlyprovided  in  1921/22 Estimates,  and  would  result in excellent modern barracks,specially designed for the accommodation of 2,000 boys, and the work is  so  far advanced that if  it were  stopped with effect from  the 1st February, it is not antici-pated that, after paying for the materials actually on the site or ordered, a saving ofmore than  100,000  could be effected.     The existing hut accommodation  is quite unsuitable,  wasteful  of personnelowing to its dispersion, and costly to maintain.     Any temporary  reduction of squadrons which may be decided upon would only slightly reduce the number of boys under training, as the number of  men in thesetrades in a squadron is comparatively small, the bulk being employed in repair depotsand  flying training units.Page 68, Para. 9.     23. As regards  recurring expenditure, the cost of boy  training is admittedlyhigher, but as an  offset against any saving in this direction must be put      (a.)  The cost of training men in their place, and     (&amp;.)  The increase of pay which would be necessary to attract skilled recruits, if           any-reasonable increase would do so,  which is doubtful.     As  regards (a),  with an  annual intake  of 1,000 men requiring training  for  anaverage of six months, 500 men would always have to be under  training.  The cost per head of administration and instruction is lower in the case of a man than a boy,but  any  resultant economy in  administrative or  instructional personnel would  be offset by the higher rate of pay even under existing scales of  the men as  against theboys. Accordingly, the amortisation charge in respect of the cost of training maybe taken to be about Is.  Id.  a day, as against the  Committee&apos;s  figure  of 7s.  Id.  inthe case of a boy.Page 68, Para. 9.     24.  On the other hand, this figure  of 7s. Id. appears to be unduly large.  In thefirst  place, the amortisation  of the capital  cost of training on an annuity  basis,reckoning 6 per cent, on the capital over a period of seven years, appears a somewhat
unreasonable calculation  when applied to a national service  in  a  case  where theso-called &quot; capital &quot; expenditure is, in fact, met out of current Estimates.  Apartfrom this, the useful service of the trained man is not limited to seven years with thecolours; there is a liability for two years in the reserve, and in  a proportion of casesthe man will re-engage for pension.   In the absence of  actual statistics as to theworking of this scheme for a long period, it is  admittedly difficult to make an exactcalculation, but the Air Council are confident that  the figure of 7s.  Id. per diem isexcessive, and that something in the neighbourhood  of 5s. or even 4s.  per diem wouldbe a fairer figure.     The net saving  on a  man over a boy would, therefore, be approximately from3s. to 4s., or, if the Committee&apos;s figure be accepted, 6s. per diem.  Even if the savingamounted to the  latter figure, however, it is  considered that it would be more  thanswallowed up by  the necessity of an increase of pay to attract skilled recruits.  Suchan increase could not, of course, be confined in  practice to the trades primarily con-cerned, but would inevitably result in an all-round increase in every R.A.F. skilledor semi-skilled trade,  and  this again would entail  a more or less corresponding increase in similar trades in the Army and Navy.Page 68, Para,  9.     25. It may also be observed that  in calculating the &quot; cost to the  country of boystrained by the  Air Force &apos;.&apos; on p. 68, the Committee have apparently been misled.The  item of 2s.  5d. for rations  is the value of  the  cash allowance, until  recentlypayable in cases  where rations are not drawn in kind.  This sum  has lately  beenreduced to 2s. 2d., but in any case the cash allowance is  drawn only in very excep-tional circumstances, e.g., during leave, whilst the actual cost of the rations in kind,commuted and  cash equivalent allowances, is approximately Is. 6d.  per diem inclu-sive, so that an over-all average figure of Is. Id. should be substituted for the 2s. 5d.shown by the Committee.     The figure of 9d.  for lodging, fuel and light is also apparently based on the cash allowance  rather than on the cost of accommodation in barracks,  plus the normalissues in kind.  The proper figure would, however,  be approximately  lOd.  Further,the daily cost of  clothing is slightly  understated, no account having been taken ofissues of clothing at the public expense.  If these items are offset against the excess-sive  figure shown for rations, the result is that, quite apart from the question ofamortisation, the figure of daily cost is in other respects approximately Id. too high.Pages  67, 68, Para. 9.     26. From the point of view of the future efficiency of the R.A.F., the system ofboy-training is vital.    Under this  system  we  exercise considerable control  overenlistment by obtaining the large majority of the boys on the individual recom-mendation of local education authorities  throughout the country, and have chargeof them for three years during the most impressionable age between 15 and 19^.   Wecan thus improve them both mentally and physically, and can imbue them  with anesprit de corps  and pride in their service, which will not only be of the greatest valueduring their subsequent career in the R.A.F., but will make them  better citizenswhen they return to civil  life.     If, on the  other hand,  we rely on the enlistment of skilled men, assuming wecould obtain them, they would have already  imbibed the  spirit of trades unionism,which, in its present form, at all events, is neither  conducive to keen endeavour noreasily compatible with the necessary discipline  of a fighting service.     27. The arguments in favour of  the Committee&apos;s proposal cannot, therefore, bemaintained.  The Air  Council  are absolutely convinced      (a.)  That  skilled men could not be enlisted  in  anything like the  numbers           required.     (b.)  That even assuming they could be enlisted, there would be a large capital           loss by the abandonment of Halton  and no  compensating economy, but           rather the reverse in  recurrent expenditure.     (c.)  That,  even if skilled men could be enlisted and economy result, the curtail-           ment  of boy-training to the number  which  can  be  accommodated at           Cranwell would have a disastrous effect on the future of the R.A.F.Page 67, Para. 9.     28.  Works Services. The  Committee  observe  that, &quot; like  the  two  seniorservices, the Air  Force asks for considerable sums  for works and  buildings.&quot;  The
Air Council must reiterate that whatever may be the requirements of the Navy and army in that respect, the position of the Air Force is in no way comparable to theNavy and Army, in that, unlike them, the Force has no pre-war barracks, but  isalmost entirely housed in war buildings of temporary construction.   Heavy reduc-tions, moreover, in new works for 1922/23. as compared with the present year, havealready been provided for, the actual reduction being  900,000 on an expenditureof  3,298,000.Page 67, Para, 9.    29. The interim report states that  600,000 &quot; represents works which have notyet been commenced or in respect of which  no commitments have been entered into,&quot;and instances the following items :                                                                             Reconditioning         ...      ...       ...     120,000             Recreational  facilities  ...      ...       ...      10,000             Married quarters       ...      ...       ...     200,000             Miscellaneous  services  ...      ...       ...     200,000which are taken from the  sketch  Estimates of July  last.   The  statement  that nocommitments had been made as regards these items was given to the  Committee inevidence, but since that date the position has been somewhat changed, and it wouldnot be possible to save the  whole of this total.    The Air Council are nevertheless prepared to make further reductions in theirprovision for works services of a gross amount of  550,000; the balance between this and the net saving of  300,000 is due to an  increase of  250,000 in provision  for warliabilities.  These latter items are  entirely  outside the administrative  control of theAir Ministry.Page 68, Para. 10,   - 30. Air  Ministry. The relation of the expenditure  at  the Air Ministry to expenditure on the service outside is part of the problem of the tree and the fruit.It is impossible to expect that the volume of work can depend directly on the actualnumbers of  the  Air Force.   The  numbers  engaged in research and inspection, forexample,  depend   to  a   considerable   extent   on  the   actual money   devotedto experiment  and reconditioning,  but do not  vary  fro  rata.  The  extent ofthe personnel engaged upon civil aviation depends more upon organisation than onthe actual expenditure under that head.  It must  be borne in mind that very largereductions  were effected  in the Air  Ministry soon after the armistice, and have continued since that date.  The officer staff of the military departments, for example,has been reduced by an all-over average of over 80 per cent, on  a basis  of  currentEstimates,  and on the Air Staff proper  a  reduction of over  80 per  cent, has been effected in the officer staff, as compared with figures understood to be under 60 percent, for the Naval and General Staffs.   Meantime, the Air Force has been built upde novo on a programme providing for a gradual increase in the number of servicesquadrons and for the assumption  of new responsibilities.   It must also be observedthat  any process of reduction and re-allotment  of  expenditure  with consequentchanges&apos; of organisation in the Air Force or other establishments controlled by theAir Ministry, throws large extra work  upon headquarters staff. The Committeeobserve  in regard to the War Office : &quot; We recognise that if our suggestions as to thereduction in the size of the  Army are adopted, considerable additional  work of a purely temporary character will be unavoidable.&quot;  It  is obviously not possible tomake any definite recommendations as to the figure to which it may  be possible towork for Vote 5 until the policy  and commitments abroad embodied in the  otherVotes is settled, but the Air Council must make it clear that a reduction to  a figureof  600,000 in 1922/23 is, in their view, absolutely impracticable.Page 69. Para. 11.    31. The Committee recommend that Vote 8 should be strictly limited.to existing commitments and that a reduction should be made in  the cost of meteorology.  TheAir Council  are prepared,  with  regret, to act  on these  recommendations,  on theunderstanding  that it may  be made plain to Parliament and  the public, who are greatly  interested in this matter,  that these limitations have been imposed by theGovernment on the Air Council as a consequence of the need for drastic economy.  .
    The Committee suggest that a consequent reduction of  400,000 can be made inthe sketch Vote, which was  700,000.  A close examination of existing commitmentsshows that this is unduly sanguine.  The Council believe that a reduction of  350,000may be practicable.  To attempt more than this would be to wreck the modest exist-ing ground organisation, to which the Air Ministry is, in effect, committed, not only by statements made in this country, on the basis of which existing private  interests have planned their activities, but also,  to a  considerable extent, by international obligations.Page 69, Para. 13.    32.  The Committee recommend that the Research Vote should be reduced to 1,000,000, including the cost of  the staff at  the Air Ministry engaged on directionof research.    After most  careful consideration, the Air  Council are of opinion  that  themaximum economy which  can be effected under this head  is  a sum  of  227,000,which will reduce the total amount taken in this Vote from  1,494,000 to  1,267,000.    The Air Council would point out that the scope for savings under this Vote isnot nearly so large as it appears at first sight.  Of the original  1,494,000, nearly-half, or  650.000, falls under Vote .9 D (1). in which provision  is made for experi-mental machines and engines.  The  widest field for economy is clearly to be foundin this item of sub-head D, but, at the same time, it is seriously restricted by existing commitments, no less than  330,000 representing &quot; carryover&quot; from the present financial year.    33. The Committee mention in especial the cost of the Royal Aircraft Establish-ment at Farnborough.    The Air Council propose to reduce the  360,000 provided for this establishment in the Estimates to  338,000.  This represents a net reduction of  22,000, but is really equivalent to a reduction of  56,800 or approximately 14 per  cent.,  since  the-transfer of the Instrument Design Establishment at Biggin Hill to Farnborough will entail an addition to the cost of the Royal Aircraft  Establishment  of  34,800  perannum, for which no provision was made in the Estimates.    Any further curtailment of the funds allocated to the Royal Aircraft Establish-ment  would  entail a decrease in the amount of  production  work which can beundertaken at Farnborough, and a consequential decrease in the appropriation-in-aidin respect of this work.Pages 69, 70, Para. 13.    34.  The Air Council feel most strongly  that any further reduction of  the sumallocated to Research would entail disastrous consequences  to the efficiency of  theR.A.F.,  and  indeed  generally  to  the  future  of aviation.  It would  moreoverinevitably result in a disproportionately increased expenditure  in the future.    The aircraft industry to-day is mainly  dependent  on the orders placed by  theAir Ministry for experimental machines and for standard  machines for use by theR.A.F., and it must be borne in mind that to the reductions in  experimental orders under the present Vote outlined above must be added the reductions already proposed under Vote 3.  The cumulative effect of these reductions will react very seriously on aircraft manufacturing firms; any  further  curtailment  of orders would  almost certainly result in the collapse of the few firms which still remain, with the possible exception of one or two wealthy undertakings such as Messrs. Vickers and Armstrong-Siddeley.  Apart from the undesirability of concentrating  the manufacture of  air-craft in  the hands  of  one or two firms and thus eliminating competition,  the dissolution of design  staffs is greatly to be deprecated.  It would be a  serious set-backto progress, whilst the development of improved types of aircraft is vitally  necessaryto the R.A.F. if it is to maintain its present technical superiority over the air servicesof foreign powers.  Finally, the almost entire disappearance  of the aircraft industry would leave no  sufficient  nucleus capable of  expansion  on emergency,  and  wouldsooner  or  later  entail  the  setting  up  of  governmental designing  staffs  and manufacturing establishments on a considerable scale, which would not be conductive to economy.

Allowing  for the &quot; carry over&quot; of a number of con-    tracts and commitments  which cannot be  liquidated before the    1st April, 1922, the reduction  possible on the basis indicated by    the Committee is      ...       ...      ...      ...              350.000Vote IX.-The Committee suggest limitation to  1,000,000. i.e., a    reduction of  494,000. The basis which they indicate, however,    is &quot;that some reduction in these activities should be  possible    without permanently injuring the development of the Service.&quot;    On the assumption  that they desire to indicate  a reduction of,    say. about 40 per cent, on the already reduced programme  of    Research projected for  next  year and  the carrying out  of    existing  commitments, the reduction could only be about     ...     250,000                 These savings amount in all to  ...       ...       ...    2.900,000and  allowing for the extra war  liability of  250,000 presented since  the SketchEstimates, to a total net saving of  2,650,000.  Of this saving the portion attributable to the reduction of Units may be taken as  1,050,000.   It is, of course, also true thatin 1923/24  and subsequent years assuming that there is no effect in the shape of necessary replacement  of  stocks  (and there  must  be  an offset  of  this  kind), thereduction would be appreciably greater, as the full effect of many of the savingsindicated cannot mature in-the first vear.    * As regards other Votes, the effect of attempting to enter men instead of boys can only be conjectural;in the opinion of the Air Council there could be no probability of a saving in 1922/23, but rather the reverse.Details of Savings which in the Air Councils view might be expected to result            from Sir Eric Geddes&apos; Committee&apos;s Recommendations.

Geddes&apos; Committee.  1.  (Page  9.)-Government  to  discuss with their Naval Advisers the reductionof number  of  Capital  Ships in  fullcomplement, and  reduction of ships in reserve to Sale List.  2.  (Page 9.) Proportionate reductionof all  classes of their  ancillary craft,i.e., Light  Cruisers,  Torpedo craft  and submarines.  3.  (Page 10.) Reduction of number of light  Cruisers  showing   the  flag  invarious parts of the world.  4.  (Page  10.)-Reduction  of   Fleetnumbers  for 1922/23  from 121.600 to86,600.  5.  (Page 12.) Coastguard to supply1,500 Active Service ratings for the Fleeton Mobilisation.  6.  (Page 13.) Reduction of  Cadetsand Boys in training to 4,000.  7.  (Page 13.) Crews of ships refittingin the  Dockyards  to  be employed  in harbour Ships, Coastguard, &amp;c. Observations and Recommendations of          Cabinet Committee.  1. Tonnage  of Capital  Ships  to beretained has been fixed at the washington conference.  We recommend that numbernow kept  in full  commission be reduced from 16 to 15 by placing &quot; Renown &quot; in reserve at end  of her cruise.  The  costof maintenance  will  be  diminished by reducing the complements  carried  in theshijDS in peace time.  2. We recommend that the number of destroyers and leaders in full commissionbe reduced from 72 to 63,  and  that thetotal number of submarines to be reducedby 27 (with a reduction of 6 in the numberkept in&quot;full commission).  3. We  recommend  that the  light cruisers  of  African  Squadron  to  bereduced to 2, by keeping &quot; Birmingham &quot;in Reserve at home.  4. The  Geddes  Committee&apos;s calcula-tions  take  into  account  MobilisationAllocation only, and not^ peace establish-ments.   We  consider  that . the  lowestnumber that can be worked to in 1922/23for  the Fleet as reduced in consequence ofthe Washington Conference is 98,570.  5. The Coastguard is now a pensionerforce and cannot supply Active Serviceratings.   We recommend  reduction ofCoastguard for naval purposes to 345 (seeparagraph 17 of our Report).  6.  After hearing the Admiralty, werecommend that the number of cadets and.boys to be borne in 1922/23 be 5,100.  7. In long  refits  the crews  are now employed.  In short refits  the margin oftime after crews have had their leave is too   short to  make  it practicable  oreconomical to disperse them  to  other duties.[7786]B
  1.0. (Page 14.) (a.) Abolition of certainHigh Commands.  (b.) Question whether the  whole com-mand ashore  in this  country could beexercised by one Commander-in-Chief tobe considered.  11. (Page   15.) Reduction  of  staffretinues, allowances, &amp;c, of Home Com-mands.  12.  (Page   15.) (a)  Reduction   ofShore Establishments.  (b.) Retention of complements of these establishments  on  Mobilisation  to  bere considered.  13. (Page 15.) Reduction of establish-ment of Flag and Commanding Officers&apos;stewards and cooks.  14. (Page  16.) Restriction of  allow-ances  in  lieu  of  servants  to  pre-warpractice.  15. (Page 16.) (a.) Reduction of RoyalYacht &apos;&apos; Victoria and Albert&apos;&apos; to care andmaintenance in winter.  12. (a.) We concur generally; but itmust be remembered that a large part ofthe training of the Navy is carried out inthe Harbour Establishments and must be adequately provided for.  The proposedFleet numbers for 1922/23 provide for areduction of over 2,000 Officers and menin Harbour Establishments.   (b.) We concur.  We recommend that only specially valuable instructional staff and  &quot; Key &quot; men should be retained.   13. See No. 8 above.  14.  The Admiralty have explained tous that the increased number of Officersdrawing the  allowance  is  due  to  thepractice of paying a consolidated salaryto Officers on shore having lapsed underthe Jerram-Halsey Report.  15. (a.) We  do  not  concur.    Thechange would mean that His Majesty&apos;sYacht would not be ready for immediateuse at  certain periods  of  the year, if required by His Majesty.  8.  All Officers&apos; servants are already an integral part of the  ship&apos;s fighting com-complement.   If  servant class is abolishedthey would have to be replaced by more expensive  ratings.  9. (a.)   We concur with Committee.Arrangements  for  disposal of  surplusOfficers are under consideration.  (b.) We  recommend   that  adequateterms for  retirement of surplus officers should be  drawn up  at once.   It  wouldnot be fair to treat the normal rules for retirement for non-service as  obviatingthe necessity for special measures to meetan abnormal  situation following a great war.  10. (a.) We concur in the proposal to abolish  the   Coast   of  Scotland  and.Western x\pproaches Commands.  (b.) We  consider that  the exercise ofthe  whole command on  shore  in  thiscountry by a single Commander-in-Chiefis not practicable.  11. These staffs and retinues  are notthe personal following of a Commander-in-Chief.   They include the administra-tive staff of a Naval Centre. We considerthat they  are  capable of reduction, andwe recommend that the Admiralty should review them with that object.  8.  (Page  13.) Abolition of Officers&apos;servant class, on  the ground  that their numbers are not dictated by the require-ments of the ship  in action.  9.  (Page 14.) (a.) Question of surplusOfficers to receive immediate treatment.  (b.)  The  Admiralty not  to bring backOfficers from the Unemployed  and Half-Pay  List with the result of preventingthem from being retired for non-service.
  (d.) Special  Service  Vessels  &apos;&apos; Sur-prise &quot; and &quot;Alacrity &quot; to be disposed of.  16.  (Page  16.)-One  Hospital  Shiponly to be maintained.  17.  (Page  17). Reduction  of  Coast-guard  Stations;  the cost  of  those  notrequired for naval purposes to be borne byother Departments.  18. (Page 17.)-War Signal stations to be closed in peace time.  19. (Page 17.) Victualling and Cloth-ing.   Stocks not to exceed three months&apos;Avar consumption of the Fleet.  20.  (Page  17.)-Men&apos;s  kit  upkeepallowances to be reduced.  21. (Page 18.) Medical Establishmentsto be reduced, and Medical Facilities onshore of the three Fighting Services to be combined,  22.  (Page 18.) Naval Ratings to per-form duties noAv performed by civilians in naval barracks, training establishments,and to man-naval ferry steamers and yardcraft, &amp;c.  23.  (Page 18.) (a.) Cost of Educationat Dartmouth to be reduced by  150 ayear.  (b.) Fees at Dartmouth to be increasedto  150 a year.  24. (Page  19.)-Vote  for  ScientificService to be reduced  200,000 net.      [77 86]  19. Present basis  of  Stocks  is not  months&apos; war consumption as stated, but3 months&apos;  peace consumption  (a  much smaller quantity).   We  recommend thatAdmiralty  should  work this year on  a2 months&apos; stock.  20. We do not recommend adoption ofthis  suggestion  owing  to  the  probable effect on the discipline  and contentmentof the men.  21. Recommendation  adopted;  ques-tion  now  being considered by  Inter-Depaftmental Committee.  22. We do not recommend adoption ofthis  proposal for  reasons given under7 above.  23. (a.) We concur that a considerable reduction should be made. The Admiraltyare  examining  the question  and  aremaking reductions.  (b.) We concur, provided proper pro-vision  is made to enable  the  sons  ofpersons of limited means to pass throughDartmouth.  -  24. We do not concur.  See paragraph5 of our Report.                            B  2  (b.) We are informed by the Admiraltythat His Majesty the King has consented to the disposal of the &quot; Alexandra.&quot;  (c.) We have deferred this question forconsideration on the First Lord&apos;s return from  Washington.   The saving  thatwould  ensue if  &quot; Enchantress  &apos;&apos;  were abolished would be  28,000.  (d.) We  concur in the  recommenda-tion that  &apos;&apos; Surprise &apos;&apos; be abolished anda   cheaper   vessel   substituted   for&quot;Alacrity.&quot;  16. We concur.  One hospital ship willbe withdrawn.  17. We  concur.   The  Navy  requireonly 345 men to perform the naval dutiesnow performed by the Coastguard.   Werecommend that the rest of the  existingforce, or so much as is required for Boardof Trade  and Customs work, be trans-ferred to the Votes of those Departments.  18. Recommendation adopted.  (b.) Royal  Yacht &quot;Alexandra&quot; to be disposed of.  (c.) Admiralty Yacht &quot; Enchantress &quot;to be disposed of.
  (b.) Gibraltar to be reduced to skeletonorganisation.  (c.) Rosyth and Chatham to be reduced.  26. (Page  19.)-The question of themaintenance of the Naval establishment at Wei-hai Wei to be considered.  27. (Page  19.) The number of men employed  in  Royal  Dockyards  to  bereduced below pre-war numbers.  28.  (Page    20.) Dockyard   workeither to be reduced in cost or transferredto private vards.  29. (Page 20.) Suggestion that piece-work rates should be introduced in royal dockyards.  30.  (Page 20.)-The number  of yardcraft to be reduced  to 1914 basis.   s  31.  (Page  20.)-Reduction of Dock-yard Police.                  &apos;  ,  32.  (Page  20.)-Transport.-Reduction of  Motor  33. (Page 21.) Question of reductionof oil fuel reserves to be considered.  34. (Page 21.)-Stock of Naval Storesso far  as  possible  to be reduced  to athree months&apos; war consumption supply.  28. We consider that an improvementin output is necessary, but this is equally .true outside the Dockyards.  The Com-mittee&apos;s suggestion that the private yardswould do the work more economically doesnot seem to rest on any firm foundation.  29. We are informed that piece-worksystem is already worked  in the Dock-yards.  30. We consider that it is not possibleto reduce to 1914  basis, owing  to  thelarger ships in the Fleet requiring moretugs to move them.   We consider, how-ever,  that  the&apos;existing numbers  shouldbe capable of considerable reduction.  31. We concur.  Steps are being takento effect a large reduction.  32. We concur that a reduction of pro-posed expenditure should be effected,  butwe  consider that to abandon all reconnaisance-reconditioning  of   vehicles  would   not   beeconomical.  33. Admiralty have  reduced  proposed expenditure   on    this    service    by 2,321,000  as  compared  with  JulySketch Estimates.   We consider that nofurther reduction should be made.  34. Present  basis of  stocks  is  not6 months&apos;  war consumption as  stated,but 3 months&apos; peace consumption (a much smaller quantity).   We recommend thatAdmiralty should  effect  a saving  of 150,000 by working on a smaller stockthis year.  25. (Page  19.)-Reduction of  Dock-yards :   (a.) Pembroke to be abolished.  25. (a.) This  is  very  regrettable asdepriving  the  Principality  of  Walesof its Naval  Station and discarding theNaval  Harbour on our  Western  coast.We consider  it a matter which must bedecided by the Cabinet on other groundsbesides those  of finance.  (b.) We concur establishment should bereduced  as  far   as  possible  withoutentirely dispersing the local workpeople.  (c.) We concur.  26. We understand that Wei-hai Weiwill  be given back to China.   We pre-some that the Naval Establishment willbe closed.  27.  We concur.   The Admiralty  arenow  taking steps  to  reduce to pre-warnumbers.  The question of further reduc-tions is a  matter of general government policy, owing  to the unemployment causedby heavy discharges.
  (b.) Extension of the period  in whichA.P.C.  Shell  will be completed to  fullestablishment,  and  reduction  of  ex-penditure on other ammunition.  36.  (Page 22.) Rate of manufactureof new torpedoes to be reduced.  37.  (Page 22,)-Stock of Cordite to bereduced.  38.  (Page 22.)-The  question  of  theprovision  of oil storage accomodation to  be  reconsidered  with  a  view  todeferring  part of  the expenditure.  39.  (Page   22.)-(a.)  Reduction   ofexpenditure on New Works, maintenance and Dredging.  (b.) Employment of Naval ^personnel on Dredgers.  40.  (Page    22.)-Withdrawal    of travelling Concession by which Officersand men receive a return ticket at singlefare.  41.  (Page  22). Naval personnel toreplace  Water  Police.  42. (Page  23.)-Reduction  of  Ad-miralty  staff.  39. (a.) After analysing the Vote werecommend a reduction of  525,000 (asagainst   1,340,000  recommended  by.Geddes&apos; Committee).  This saving seemsto be  the  utmost  that  can prudently beeffected.  (b.)  See No.  7  above.  40.  We concur.   See paragraph 44 ofour Report.41.  See No. 7 above.  42.  We recommend that the reduction should be  not less  than   100,000  in1922/23.    Whilst large reductions  inthe Fleet and Naval Establishments arein progress, the work of the Admiraltywill be much increased;  but after  thatabnormal period is over, further  reduc-tions  in  the Admiralty  staff should  bepossible.Q  35.   (Page  21.) (a.)  Reduction   ofVote  for manufacture  of  guns.   Re-conditioning of guns and mountings fordefensive arming of  Merchant  ships to be retarded.  35. (a.) We recommend the expendi-ture be reduced by deferring the com-mencement of manufacture of  the guns for the 2 new ships until 1923/24.  The  expense of reconditioning of gunsand mountings for  defensive arming  ofMerchant Ships will  be spread  over 8years.  (b.) We concur.   We recommend  that expenditure be spread  over 2 years, andthat other items be substantially reduced.  36.  Rate of  manufacture reduced  toone torpedo per week.   We consider thatno further reduction can be made withoutdispersal of skilled staff (see Appendix I,Statement XIV).  37.  Rate  of  manufacture  has  been greatly reduced. Stock is being restrictedtc  the  minimum  necessary  to prevent;deterioration of plant and dispersal  of skilled staff.  38. In paragraph 13 of our  Report  werecommend that this question be reviewed by the  Committee of Imperial Defence.

Reduction  of  cavalry  by two  regi-      ments abroad and six regiments at home.  1.  We  have explained in our  Report  that, the expeditionary Force is nor a  separate army, but is inthe main the  result of  organizing into  divisions,which are considered by the War Office to be themost economical  and efficient tactical  and  adminis-trative units, the forces required to be maintained athome for the provision of drafts and reliefs to unitsabroad.  The reductions recommended  will leave forthe Expeditionary Force only four complete divisions and the infantry of a fifth.  Only one division, how-ever,  could at present be mobilized at once ; thesecond would  be completed  by 4,000 or  5,000specially  enlisted tradesmen.  The third would notbe ready  for  three  months.   The ExpeditionaryForce is  certainly  reduced to half  what it was in1914,  2.  We recommend that the present terms of enlist-ment and conditions of service, which have been fixed after much experience,at present.should not be changed  3.  We recommend ttiat 24 battalions of the line bereduced, viz., 10 South Irish battalions,  2  battalions of the  Royal Irish  Fusiliers, the 10 3rd and 4thbattalions, and 2 battalions of North Irish regiments.Total reduction of infantry : 345 officers, 15,000 men.  We agree with the War Office that it is preferable not to employ half battalions in stations abroad.  i his  provides 62 of the 63 battalions required forabroad.   We recommend that the Guards battalionsshould not be reduced in numbers or be sent abroadif it can be avoided.  On account of their greater military value  andutility, and  in  view of  what  has  already  beendecided   in  respect of   Iraq  and  Palestine, weconsider  that  money  is  better  spent on  Britishthan, native troops as far as practicable   Moreover,the Government of  India do not favour the employ-ment of Indian troops overseas.   4. We recommend that the Cardwell system, whichhas  stood  the test  of  peace  and 1 war, should bemaintained for the present,  but  we recommend  thatthe question should be studied by a committee.   5. We recommend the following reductions on the-regimental establishments of the arms concerned :                                        Other                               Officers.

We recommend a reduction of Cavalry of theLine equivalent to o  regiments, or about li:0 officersand 2,660 other ranks.  The  War Office are con-sidering a scheme by which the identity of cavalry regiments may be preserved.    * The references are to the pages of First Interim Report of Sir Eric Geddes&apos;s Committee  on national expenditure.

In view of their responsible duties for  maiu-taining order in the capital and for the safeguarding of His Majesty&apos;s person and dignity, we recommendthat the Household Cavalry be not reduced.   8. After considering the explanation of the WarOffice (see  Appendix II., jfaper  IS) we are satisfiedthat  money provision is not made  in Army estimates for more than the anticipated average strength ofthe Army.9.  See reductions proposed under 5.  10. We  recommend  that  the  London  Districtshould,  subject to the Kings approval, be merged inthe Eastern Command for administrative purposes.The  Irish  Command  will disappear.    Ulster  willbecome  an area command of Great Britain.  11. We recommend that the Divisional organiza-tion  should be  maintained, but see under 1, 5 and  9for reductions proposed.  12.  We recommend that these reductions be carriedout.  13 and 14.  In the time available we are not pre-pared to make detailed recommendations.  Ill paragraph 36 of our Report we recommend theappointment  of a  Sub-Committee  to  scrutinize theQumtermaster-GeneraPs services in  detail, with  aview to securing further reductions.15. See reductions recommended under 3.  16. The staff  of the  War Office  is being rapidlyreduced.  Further  immediate  reductions  are  im-pracLicable in view of the additional work that willbe thrown on the department in giving effect to our recommendations.  17. We recommend that the 1921-22  Establish-ment of the Army  Educational Corps  should  bereduced by some 2U0 officers (including India).  18. We recommend that  the fees at  woolwich and Sandhurst should be raised to 200Z. for the sonsof civilians ; the fees for sons of  non-Regular officers should be at the civilian  rate;  the rates  for sonsof Regular officers should be raised by 33 per cent.Cost should be reduced as far as possible.  A system  of  scholarships  such  as the Geddes&apos;Committee recommend is in existence.  19. We recommend that the  Central  Gas  Schoolshould be closed and the Anti^Aircraft Defence  Schooland the Searchlight School should be amalgamated.When numbers are being  so heavily reduced, we  donot advocate great reductions in the number of menunder training which  makes for efficiency.  20. After  examination we  are satisfied that this reduction cannot be wliolly carried out. Expenditureon inspection  is  inseparably  connected  with  thequestion of work in the Ordnance Factories (see under25).

In view  of existing commitments we considerthat the largest reduction practicable on Part I. is987,000/., with  300,000/. reduction  on  Part III.(Maintenance).  22. We understand that this question is under theconsideration of  the Colonial Office and depends  onthe future defence scheme for Iraq.  23. We  recommend that the  War Office should hold  certain war stores  for  15  divisions and  asecond  cavalry  division,  in  addition to  completeequipment  for 5 divisions and 1 cavalry division, onthe understanding that the extra cost involved forthe  15  divisions  and  1  cavalry division  does notexceed 200,000/. a year. 1 24. We consider  that  it is not  possible to make further use of  military labour, because the troops arenot quartered near the store depots.  A reduction ofabout 17 per cent, in the wages  bill is in contemplate-tion.  25. We recommend that the recent government decision to retain Waltham Abbey should be adhered to for reasons of national  safety.   A large furthergradual reduction of  numbers employed in the  fac-tories  is  intended,  but  unemployment  conditions must be taken into consideration.  26. The  liquidation  of the  National  Factories  isalmost complete.  27. Clothing  allowance  covers  many  personalincidental expenses of the soldier.   VVe understandthat extension of the life of the uniform would not produce any saving in 1922-23  because of the warstocks still on hand.  28. The establishment of horses will be reduced from33,000 to about  25,000.  The  War Office boarding-out scheme for  horses for Territorial trainings willbe abandoned.  29 (see under 13 and 14). We recommend that theestablishment of vehicles be reduced by 50 per cent.(with 15 percent, maintenance stock). Special vehiclesof military pattern, not obtainable by  impressmentfrom civilian  sources on mobilization, should be heldin store.   The distribution of food to the Army bylorry  should  be limited to cases in which it can be shown to pay.  30. Army  establishments  include  personnel  formilitary and  domestic duties having no  counterpartin an omnibus garage, but  we recommend  that thepossibility  of making  some reduction  should  be examined (see under 13 and 14).  31. We consider that the formation of the Militia(largely technical) is necessary for mobilization pur-poses, and in view of its being available for duty intime of  internal disorder.  -  We recommend that a reduced total  of 1,000,000/.should be provided for 1922-23.iff

Establishment to  be  reduced   by                 50,000 officers and men.           (2.) Possibility of  effecting savings owing                 to the introduction of new arms                 and corps and of  the Air Force to                 be considered.           (3.) Reduction of  ancillary and auxiliary                 services.           (4.) Reduction of  reserves of mobilization                 equipment  and arms now held.           (5.) Reduction  of Army Estimates   for             -. --.-1922-23 by 20,197,800/.  32  and 33.  We recommend that reductions of establishments  and other savings  should  be madein the  Territorial Army  to  the  extent  of  about 1%  millions,  on  the estimated cost  of  the  fullscheme  of 1021-22 (which  includes  units not pro-vided for in   the  estimates  of that  year).   Werecommend  that a beginning  should be made withthe formation of Territorial Anti-Aircraft Artillery.  34. We recommend that the Army hospital shipshould be put out of commission by the end of thecurrent financial  year.  Measures for the reduction and concentration of Army hospitals are in progress.Arrangements for the reciprocal use of Navy  and army  hospitals  are under discussion  between  theAdmiralty and the War Office.   The principle of the admission of  pensioners  into  Army  hospitals  is accepted, and arrangements are under discussion withthe Ministry of Pensions.  35. We recommend that the privilege of travellingby rail at half-rates should  be withdrawn from  all three  Services, the  possibility  of securing  con-cessions on  business lines being  left to the depart-ments to negotiate with the railway companies.  36. (1)  After adjusting  certain  miscalculations(see Appendix II., Paper B) the &quot;excess&quot; of 54,429calculated by the Geddes Committee method becomes39,855.   We recommend a total reduction of  about,330 officers and 31,200  other ranks.  (2.) and (3) These have been taken into  account(see under 13, 14 and 23).  (4.) See reductions recommended under 23.  (5.) We propose a net-  reduction of 15,000,000/.,or, if the 1,500,000/. paid by Germany for the  army of Occupation is credited to Army Funds, 16,500,000/.

We  recommend a  reduction fromcruiting.       -                          26,350 to  14,010; possibility of further                                       reduction should be considered.  7.  (Page 65.) Reduction  of  clothingallowance  by one-third and  abolition of travelling concessions.[7787]  7.   We  recommend that the clothingallowance be reduced  by  20,000 and that other economies in clothing amounting to 1.5,000 be  made.  We  recommend that:concession travelling vouchers be abolished. -This   will effect  a  saving  of  40,000annually.

(Page 68.) - That cost of A ir ministry should  be  reduced  from   825,000  to 600,000.  8. We recommend a reduction of expen-diture on technical equipment of  443,000.No  reduction is practicable on recoudition-ing, since, until they have been  recondi-tioned, machines which have  been in storefor  long periods are unsafe to fly.  9. Wo recommend that authority for this further  expenditure of  500,000  on  addi-tional machines and stores be withheld.  10. We recommend that establishmentsbe reduced  and expenditure on overhaulsreconsidered.  1 I. We recommend that a large numberof vehicles be disposed of at once,   laime-diate surrender of  all  vehicles  beyondestablishment numbers not recommended,as this  would involve  earlier purchase ofnew  vehicles.  12. We  recommend   a   reduction   of 555,000.   This   will  involve   discon-tinuance of  neatly all permanent  building work except at  Halton (see Item 13 below).Air Force (unlike Army and Navy)  has  nopre-war permanent buildings.  13. We recommend that  the  work  atHalton be completed.  Only  100,000 re-mains  to be spent.  To  abandon Haltonwould    render   nugatory   expenditureamounting  to   about    1,300,000  (thegreater  part of  which was incurred  duringthe  war).  The buildings are essential tothe scheme of boy training.  14. We understand that  there  are  no-naval or military  buildings suitable  oravailable for the purpose.  15. We recommend  that  training  of boys at Halton should  continue.   Werecommend   that   the  effective  cost  of present  system  should   be  reduced  byobtaining a  longer period of colour  service to set off against cost of training  period.Recruitment of adult tradesmen personnel in sufficient numbers eotild only be secured(if at all) by offering high rates of pay.which   would  react  on  other grades  of personnel  and  more  than  offset  any possible  saving.  16. We   recommend  a  reduction  to 725,000.   Reduction beyond this would entail increased cost in  commands owingto decentralization, Avhich  would  not  beeconomical,  owing to the small size of theR.A.F.

(Page 70.)-That Supply and  Re-search expenditure should  be restricted to I 1,000,000, Le., a reduction of   494,000.   \  17.  We  recommend  a  reduction  of 350,000.  This will  leave  350,000 net,of which more than half is already pledged to the Channel Service Subsidy.  IS.  We  recommend  that a  beginningshould be made with  the formation of  anAuxiliary Air Force.   This recommenda-tiou  should be considered in connectionwith the  proposals for.reduction of expen-diture on the Territorial. Army.  19. A reduction of  227,000 is tiie most that  we  can  recommend,  in view of  theueed for maintaining a limited programmeof new work.

AT the 6th Meeting of the Committee to examine Part I of the Report of the geddes&apos;s Committee on National Expenditure, Mr. Churchill appointed the followingSub-Committee  to  consider the  Estimates of  1922/23 for the  Quartermaster-General&apos;s Services :          The  Right Hon.  Stanley  Baldwin,  M.P., President,  Board  of Trade            (Chairman).        Sir James Stevenson,  Bart., G.C.M.G., Colonial Office.        Sir George Barstow, K.C.B., Treasury.            With Lieutenant-Colonel C. W. G. Walker, D.S.O., as Secretary.                            TERMS OF REFERENCE.    1. The Sub-Committee to  make a detailed enquiry  into the Estimates for the quartermaster-GeneraTs Services.    2. The Sub-Committee should endeavour to separate non-recurrent  expenditureon war and mobilisation services from the normal annual Army expenditure.    3. The Sub-Committee should endeavour  to ensure that  the reduction in the quartermaster-General&apos;s Services is in proportion to the reduction of the combatantservices.                                REPORT.    1. For the discharge of his functions the Quartermaster-General has under his control the following personnel :         The War Office staff of the Q.M.G&apos;s. Department,        The Q. staff in commands (who are primarily responsible to the  G.O.C. of            their commands),        The R.A.S.C,        The R.A.O.C.,        The Remount staff,        The R.A. Veterinary  Corps,and a large amount of  civilian  labour.    The following figures  show the numbers  of personnel  in the above  categoriesexcluding  staff :  	(a) In 1914.	0) July 1921 Estimate.

The estimated cost ofthe total military personnel is  2,175,500.    2. The  Army services discharged by the Q.M.G. comprise the following :      (a.) Provision  (for  the consumption  of  the Army and the maintenance of           reserves) of rations, clothing, equipment,  furniture,  forage, fuel, light,           water and generally  all stores other than armament stores or R.E. stores.    (b.) Administration of the allowances paid in cash to the personnel of the Army,           e.g., lodging allowance, fuel and light allowance,  ration allowance, field           allowance, Colonial allowance, clothing allowance, &amp;c.    (c.) The transportation of the Army, i.e., he arranges for and bears on his Votes           the cost of the carriage by sea and land of  personnel and stores.    (d.) The storage, handling and issue of all stocks including the armaments stores           administered  by the  M.G.O.    (e.) The provision and maintenance of horse and motor  transport, lorries, &amp;c,           and their upkeep, also W.D. vessels and inland water transport.    (/.) The maintenance of barrack services, e.g.,  sanitation, washing, &amp;c.    (g.) The purchase and care of remounts.    3. With regard to the services set forth in the above  paragraph     (a.) The money required for the  provision of supplies  depends firstly on  the           numbers of the Army, i.e., the number of mouths to be fed, or persons to           be clothed; secondly,  on price variations; and thirdly,  on the scale of           supply for  consumption and. reserves.    (b.) The allowances  depend firstly on the numbers qualified to receive them, and           this number  in turn  is closely related to the numbers serving in other           arms of the Army, and secondly, on the rates fixed which correspond in           some measure with  current prices.    (c.) The expense of sea and land transportation depends on the amount of move-           ment required of the  Army; the long sea  transport is actually arranged           by the Board of Trade Shipping Department which is reimbursed from           Army  Votes; the railway transport is carried out by  the railway)^, but           administered by Q.M.G.     Neither of these first three functions makes a large demand on the personnel,except the distribution to the Army of food bought in bulk.     4. Of the remaining functions      (d.)  The storage and handling  of stocks, other than food and motor transport,           are the functions of the R.A.O.C. supplemented by civilian personnel.     (e.)  The maintenance of horse and motor transport is a function of the R.A.S.C.,           which also carries out the general clerical work in non-regimental offices.
    (/.) Barrack services arc carried out by civilian (ex-soldiers) personnel at home;          abroad, by R.A.S.C. supplemented by civilian personnel.    (g.) The purchase and care of remounts,     Army  horses  not  assigned  to           regimental establishments, are functions of the Remount Staff.    The Army Veterinary Corps is responsible for the health of Army horses whetherremounts or on  regimental establishments,  and of all  other  Army animals, e.g.,camels, &amp;c.    5. The Quartermaster-General has supplied the Sub-Committee with Estimates(see Appendix) showing the reduction in the cash provision required for the various services, other than pay of  Army personnel,  administered by him as compared withthe July 1921 forecast, from which it appears that the figures are as follows :  -	July 1921.	1922/23.

Elsewhere      ...       ..       ...  6,277,000       32    But these percentages give a very imperfect and somewhat misleading result.    6.  The Sub-Committee consider that as regards that part of  the cost of Quarter-master-General Services, which represents the provision of supplies and allowances in cash, the reductions are certain to be at least proportionate to the reductions in numbers of the Army, and will in fact be in higher proportion in view of the fall inprices.   The Sub-Committee have not examined the scale  of provision in kind.  Onthe assumption that these scales remain unaltered, the amount of the cash provisionrequired is merely a matter of correct  estimating.  But they recommend that the ratesof allowances in cash should be reviewed in order that the fall in prices should be reflected in the amount of the cash allowances.    The Sub-Committee observe that the provision for Fuel and  Light has increasedapart from  the Middle East from  1,486,700 in July 1921 to   1,573,000.   Theyunderstand that the figure of  1,486,700  was an under-estimate, for some unknowncause.  The figure of  1,573,000 comprises both provision in kind and cash allow-ances in lieu of provision in kind, and is divided between them as follows :                                                                           Cash        ...       ...       ...       ...      280,000             In kind     ...       ...       ...       ...     1,293,000    The Fuel and Light Allowances  which were  in force  when the pay of the army was increased in 1919 have been nearly doubled since that date in accordance with thepractice of  altering  the allowance in sympathy with  the prices of coal  and  gas.During the period of rationed quantities and controlled prices for coal, the allowance had not been altered, but when supplies again became  free an alteration was made from the price levels of 1915 to those of 1920 (an alteration in the downward course is now due).    As regards the cash provision required for the conveyance of troops and storesby land and sea,  the  amount required for this purpose depends  on the amount of movement of troops and stores  required during the year;  this  is not necessarilyproportionate to  the  reduction in the strength  of the Army and may, in fact, beincreased  by the reorganisation resulting from the changes contemplated.  The WarOffice has  to depend for its estimates  and arrangements on the Shipping Departmentof the Board of Trade, and it is for that Department  to see that  the fall in freight is reflected  in  the estimates.    The crux of the  question is, however, not in  regard to the above services, thoughthe greater part of the money provision required for Quartermaster-General services is expended upon them, but in regard to the four categories (d), (e), (/) and (g) ofparagraph 2, and especially the provision for storage  and horse and motor transport.

It will be seen that on the latest proposals the military  personnel employed atHome and Defended  Ports is 15 per cent, higher than in 1914/15.    Military  personnel represents 30 per cent,  of  the establishment for ArmyOrdnance services, the remaining 70 per  cent, being civilians.  The Sub-Committeethink that  these  proportions should  be  reviewed,  in view, of the heavy overheadcharges which the employment of soldiers entails and the high pay and allowancesnow received, and that at Home the largest possible proportion of civilians shouldbe employed which mobilisation requirements will permit. These requirements shouldbe now less than they were in 1914, when we were prepared for six divisions.    The increase  in numbers abroad accounts for nearly 1,000 additional personnel,due to Egypt, the Rhine, Middle East and Constantinople.   With  the reduction of commitments abroad  these numbers should be reduced.    Military personnel  numbering 438 are employed in war aftermath services principally the examination of  armament stores.                           Royal Army  Service Corps.

Percentage of M.T. in 1922 as compared with 1914 shows an increase of approxi-mately 270 per cent., owing to the change from H.T.  to M.T. throughout the Army,mechanicalisation of  trains, training  of  M.T. recruits, drivers and artificers  forR.A.S.C. and other arms, new establishments for repair  of vehicles both  R.A.S.C.and of other arms (tanks, armoured cars,  &amp;c.) and stores depot for spare parts andmobilisation  equipment, and  vehicle  reception  unit for mobilisation equipment,technical vehicles.  New commitments in Rhine, Black Sea, increased garrison  ofEgypt, also contribute considerably to this increase.   Proportionate increased depotstaff,  due to provision of officers, drivers and artificers for India.    Percentage of H.T. in 1922 as compared with 1914 shows a decrease of approxi-mately 65 per cent., due to changes mentioned above.  Further reductions  will takeplace on complete evacuation of Palestine and Black Sea.    Percentage  of supply  personnel in 1922  as  compared  with  1914 shows   anincrease of 30 per cent., due to wider distribution of  troops, increased commitmentsabroad, new  system of supply from depots, and  increased scale of commodities  inration.    Percentage  of clerical  personnel  provided  for  R.A.S.C. duties  has  increased50 per cent., due to new commitments, cost accounting, and to the distribution  oftroops in foreign stations, some of which were non-existent in 1914.    Percentage of clerical personnel provided for non-regimental units has  increasedby 100 per  cent., due to new commitments in Egypt, Rhine, Black Sea and Iraq.     It will be seen that the total numbers employed in Great Britain  and ireland in  1914/15 were 5,100, and as now proposed would be 5,415;  whereas the formernumbers allowed for  the mobilisation of six  divisions, the Quartermaster-Generalstates that the suggested cut in motor transport  vehicles and  personnel affectsmobilisation to the following extent, viz.:               One cavalry division,             One division,with  a proportion of non-divisional and  L. of C. units,  alone can be mobilised at short notice.     This entails the  impressment of  a large proportion of  the vehicles.   the mobilisation which the personnel of 5,415 will provide is one cavalry division andone division only. This we understand to mean that these forces can be mobilised atany time without special enlistments  such as were  resorted  to  in 1914.   Vehicleswould have  to be impressed, but personnel would be already under engagement toserve.  A  very striking fact  is the great increases in personnel employed abroad,which have increased from 620 to 3,038.  The clerical establishments have increased from 1,129 in 1914/15 to 1,910 (70 per cent.).     In the time  at their disposal the Sub-Committee are unable to say whether thevery large  increase in this force even after the reductions proposed as compared withthe July 1921 Estimate is reasonable.  That a substantial increase  is unavoidablein  view of the number of stations abroad, the introduction of tanks and. armoured cars and the greater use of motor transport is no doubt true.   But it would require a somewhat prolonged enquiry by experts to determine whether the provision  and use of motor transport is not excessive, having regard to the  reductions entailed bythe financial situation on other arms.

Percentage 1922/23 bears to 1914- excess of 66 per cent., entirely due to after-war garrisons abroad.    Note. The military remount establishment of 1914 has been abolished, and allremount depots at Home are run by civilians.    The  military personnel required  for 1922/23 is solely for garrisons which didnot exist before the  war, namely, Rhine, Egypt and Palestine,  Constantinople and iraq.Remounts.    Like the Royal Army Service Corps and the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, theremount  organisation has extended to the Rhine, Constantinople, Egypt, palestine and Iraq.  Its functions consist in maintaining horse establishments of mountedunits and horse transport at full strength, providing the reserves requisite to replacecasualties, casting, and disposal of cast animals and  the disposal of horses as they become surplus to establishments.   Owing to the reductions that have taken  placein the garrisons of Egypt, Palestine and Iraq the amount of disposal work that has fallen on the remount depots in these countries has latterly been very great.    With the exception of the Rhine, where military (R.A.S.C.) personnel only is employed, the depots are staffed mainly by civilians (&quot; Enlisted Followers &quot;), with asmall nucleus of soldiers to carry out  the necessary supervision.                        Royal Army Veterinary Service.    The  distribution of this service overseas  is similar  to  that of the remountorganisation.  It is responsible for the treatment and evacuation of horse casualties.Civilians are employed  mainly as syces at the rate of one to every three patients in hospital.    Note. The strengths of the establishments referred to above are shown in theaccompanying returns.                        ROYAL ARMY VETERINARY CORPS.

The total numbers of  horses on the Army establishments  is 25,000 in 1922/23^no Middle  East), compared with 28,700  in 1914/15, and 40,000  in July  1921(including 10,000 Middle East).
s     The comparatively small percentage of reduction as compared with 1914 is verystriking, regard being had to the great increase in motor transport, the reduction of cavalry regiments and in other arms  of the service.   They observe that  the ArmyCouncil  are  considering the  possibility of  further  reductions  and  consider  thatjprimd facie this should be  possible.
