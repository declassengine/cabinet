[This Document is the Property  of His  Britannic Majestys Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  January .1922.SECRET.                                                                  &apos;   44C P.-3658.CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY  OF  THE  STATE OF  IRELAND.             MEMORANDUM BY THE  CHIEF SECRETARY  FOR IRELAND.     I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 23rd instant.                       GENERAL STATE OF  THE COUNTRY.Police Reports  of the Week.     There has  been no appreciable change in the general state of the country sincemy last Report.  The number of acts of lawlessness reported from all parts of thecountry points to a growing activity on the part of the extreme Republican elements in the I.R.A., but it is not possible to state with any approach to certainty to what extent political motives underlie many of the crimes of violence, particularly high-way robberies and thefts  of Government motor cars and stores, committed duringthe past two or three weeks.  It is  clear, however, that in certain wide  districts,notably in Counties Tipperary, West Cork and Kerry, the local units of the I.R.A:have  got  completely out of hand, and  that drastic  disciplinary measures will benecessary if  the  Provisional Government is not to find  itself  faced  with  armedopposition when the Crown Forces have been withdrawn.     Although it is now something of an anachronism to speak of &quot; breaches of the truce,&quot; the relations between the Crown and Republican Forces, especially in areasdisaffected to the Provisional Government,  are  still, in  actual  practice, governedmore by the terms of the Truce than by those of the  Treaty, and it has been foundconvenient to continue the local liaison arrangements in existence for dealing withacts of aggression or provocation alleged on either side.     The most serious &quot;breaches&quot; committed during the week  were the  firing afcand wounding  of a Constable of the Royal Irish  Constabulary at  Ennis, CountyClare, on  the 17th instant; the wounding of a Sergeant at Listowel, County Kerry,on the 18th instant; an attempt by a party of  armed men to seize a police car atTralee,  County Kerry, on the 20th  instant, in  which the driver of the car waswounded by a revolver bullet; and an attack upon a party of Police at Tralee on thefollowing day,  which resulted in a series of engagements between bodies of  police and Republican Forces in the town  and the  infliction of a number of casualties on both sides. Full information in  regard to the last-mentioned incident is not yet to hand, but from the latest report of the County  Inspector it appears that a party of five Constables, who had left the Barrack  for the purpose of procuring a grama-phone for use at a dance, were fired at about 8-30 P.M. by a number of men, andloneConstable was  slightly wounded.  The  Police returned the fire and wounded oneof their assailants, who then dispersed in different directions.  On the return of thePolice party to the Barrack a number of their comrades broke from control and, inspite of the efforts of the Head Constable, about fifteen of the Garrison succeeded in leaving the Barrack with their arms and rushed into the street.  Several encounterswith bodies of I.R.A. then followed, and heavy  firing continued on both sides until about midnight, when  the County Inspector succeeded in  collecting his men and bringing them back to the Barrack.   Three  of the Police  were seriously  wounded,and the  Republicans are believed also to have  suffered heavily.. The County Inspectorreports that at  a subsequent interview with  the leader  of the local I.R.A. Brigadecomplaints were made that the conduct of the Tralee Police previous to these attacks      [7730]
had been highly menacing and provocative, and that he was afraid that this charge was not altogether without foundation.    The outstanding feature of the present phase of lawlessness in Southern ireland is the number of seizures of motor cars and bicycles in all parts of the country.  no less than sixty  cars have been seized during the past fortnight, the  owners in themajority of cases being civilians.  Three Police and three Military cars  were held up and taken away during the past week, and twenty-five official  bicycles were seizedin a raid upon&apos; the Post Office in Amiens Street, Dublin.  Among the other carsstolen was  one  belonging to His  Excellency, the  Lord Lieutenant, which was held up by armed men when returning from the pier at Kingstown on the evening of the21st instant.    Nine raids upon mail  cars and  postmen were reported during the week.   the motive in every case appears to  have been that of ordinary robbery or  to interceptprocesses for rent.    Two cases  of kidnapping; were reported, both  cases arising out  of labour disputes.    Outrages clearly attributable to the De Valera  section of the I.R.A.  were therescue of four prisoners who were being conveyed under an escort of R.I.C. fromBray to Mount] oy on the 19th instant, the rescue of a woman from Limerick Prisonon the same date,and a raid committed upon the offices of the Clonmel &quot;Nationalist,&quot;a newspaper which had refused to publish an announcement in the interest of the minority Party in Dail Eireann.   The last-mentioned incident evoked strong protests from the Dublin press, and is generally regarded  as a serious error in tactics on thepart of the extremists.                         STATE OF  THE  POLICE FORCES.    The last Company of the Auxiliary Division left Ireland on the 25th  instant,and arrangements for the disbandment of the regular Royal Irish Constabulary arenow being taken up.  The  following figures show the present active strength of theIrish Police Forces :                            Royal Irish Constabulary.Regular Force.

The strength of the Auxiliary Division on disbandment was 1,243.                          Dublin Metropolitan  Police.    The strength of the Dublin Metropolitan Police remained unchanged through-out the week at 1,134.                            NEW RAILWAY  CRISIS.    A fresh crisis has arisen in the Irish Railways in the form of a lightning strike on the Dublin  and South Eastern Railway.   The origin of the trouble was  thetransfer of a  Stationmaster at  Gorey to Shillelagh, apparently as  a  disciplinarymeasure connected indirectly with the recent dispute on the subject of the hours-of-work  provisions of the Carrigan Award.   The hasty use of the strike weapon  by
the railwaymen is strongly condemned by the press, and the suggestion is made bythe &quot; Freeman&apos;s Journal &quot;  that it was  inspired by persons who are deliberatelyseeking to embarrass the Provisional Government.  An announcement issued by theIrish  Secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen states that the strike  was declared without the authority or consent of the Executive Committee of that body.                   PRESENT POLITICAL SITUATION IN IRELAND.    The agreement reached between Sir James Craig and Mr. Collins in London has given great satisfaction throughout the whole of Ireland, and is everywhere regardedas a most important step in the direction of a wider settlement.  Its reception by theUnionist press of Belfast, and by both the Unionist and Nationalist press of Dublin,was equally favourable.  The removal of the Belfast boycott was an indispensablepreliminary to the growth of a better feeling between North and South and to any possibility of co-operation between the two Governments.  The decision to dispense with  the assistance  of a  British  representative  on the Boundary Commission isregarded by  all parties as  a sound stroke of policy, inasmuch as  the territorialadjustment arrived at  will not be open to objection by either side on the ground ofcoercion or interference.
