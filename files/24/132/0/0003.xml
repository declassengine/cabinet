In Crete  the  insurgents are  still at large.  Military  operations against  them were deferred  until 4th  January, in the  hopes  that pressure might  bp brought to bear  on  them through local  notables.   As this  attempt failed, encounters in the open country  are  to be  anticipated.                             JUGO SLAVIA.
