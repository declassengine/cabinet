The unemployed are showing signs of resentment against theGuardians in Coventry and Sheffield, where reductions in out-reliefhave been made or are contemplated.     Cominunist activity has been confined in the main to workinside the trade unions and unemployed organisations duringthe week.     The Plenipotentiary of the Ear Eastern Republic in Moscowis in communication with the &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; Committee,     Norman Ewer, the foreign editor of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;,travelled to Russia with Xlishko of the Russian TradingDelegation last week.     The British Bureau of the Red International of LabourUnions has decided to I3SUE a monthly organ entitled &quot;All Power&quot;.

     demonstration.          Reports from the provinces  indicate  little  change  in     the unemployed situation.  Meetings  continue  to  be  held     in most Of the towns in Lancashire but  in Liverpool the     unemployed have almost deserted  the  communist committee     and are rallying to the loyalist committee, which claims     to &quot; have:;registered &quot;10,000 people.    The Rochdale Committee,     which prides itself on being revolutionary,  is showing     signs bf activity and on January 5th a  number of men     marched! to the offices of the  &quot;Rochdale Observer&quot;,   A     window was smashedand ;about 20  of the  demonstrators     entered the of floes, where they  used a  good deal of bad    &quot;language:&apos; they we re finally ejected by the  police.   This     oommiltee only represents a small extremist/minority of the     Rochdale unemployed. &apos;                      :&apos;-J          lh: Coventry1 there is sonie feeling  regarding the 10$     redle&amp;o-n1 ini6dx^r^ie^-^hB^&amp;^j^T^^&amp;^Tdi^-aaa and the&apos;    &apos; local&quot;ufte9ipld&apos;yed-&apos;&apos;a:re-de^ndlng the dismissal of one of  the    - Assistant Relidving- Oififiberswho; is alleged- to be     dislsour^^otis&apos;.&apos; : Abbut 1,-000&apos; people attended a meeting     in the&apos; Baths&quot; Assembly  Hall oh - January 5th and were addresse     by Ding-ley&apos;; Breece ahd-He&amp;rd.

     Jennett was released from prison on January 4th.          My Yorkshire correspondent reports that the  outlook     in his area is not very hopeful and that although the     majority of the unemployed realise that unconstitutional     action is useless there is a feeling of desperation which     may lead to spontaneous outbreaks.  The Sheffield     unemployed were very active last week:   four meetings,     attended in each case by about 3,000 people, were held  in     connection with the proposal to reduce  the rate of     out-relief:  the chief agitators are Haydock and  Stanley,     respectively chairman and secretary of  the Sheffield     District Council of Unemployed, Woodhead, Butcher, Smith     and Fletcher.  At one meeting Smith said, &quot;The  only way     to get anything is to reach out and take it for ourselves&quot;     and Fletcher told the orowd that he was not going to ask     them to smash up the Town Hall but that it was  up to them.          There.is little activity among the Leeds unemployed.          On January 6th about 250 of the Rhondda organised     unemployed demonstrated at G-elli, Rhonddai&apos;fawr, where a     large number of men is engaged on relief work:  the     demonstrators induced about 50 of these men to  cease work.5H3 COianniSTS           :        &quot;-           .            V          Communist activity during tho week has&apos;been  confined     in the main to work inside, the trade unions and tho     unemployed organisations:  meetings have been held in     London and the provinces but the audiences have not been     large.  The biggest mooting in London was held  in Battersea     Town Hall on January 8th:  about 800 people&apos;wore  present     and the speakers were Councillor Edwards (in the  chair),     Councillor Wall, Sara and Jackson e  Tho speeches  contained&apos;     little of interest:  Sara deplored the  ignorance  of the &apos; :-                                                    working/
     working claases but said that when they were  educated     and had rifles in their hands victory against any     organisation of capitalists would be assured.          Communist meetings in Manchester have  been resumed     after a suspension of several weeks and about 500 men,     mostly of a very low type, assembled in Stevenson Square     on January 8th:  a somewhat violent speech  was delivered  by     Jenkins of the Liverpool Communist Party.          The Birmingham branch, which numbers about 100,     including 20 women, has elected the following officers  for     1922:  -                   Chairman:   W. Brain                   Secretary:  H.M, Emery                   Treasurer:  H.N. Horton     The Executive includes Cardinal, Palmer and Sylvester.          The Communist Press is devoting space  to the Indian     and Irish questions:  the prominent note of these articles     is that Indian nationalists are following in  the steps  of     Sinn Fein and that the British communists should have     sufficient back-bone to do likewise,THE &quot;FAflDS OP? &quot;RUSSIA&quot; COMMITTEE          The following is the text of a circular  letter sent  out     by W,P, Coates, secretary of the &quot;national  Hands off Russia&quot;     Committee, prior to the dispatch of the telegram to the     Prime Minister urging recognition of the Russian Government:                                        &quot;31st December, 1921.               &quot;The above Committee intends sending the &apos;          following cable to Mr. Lloyd George, at  Cannes,  at          12 noon on the day prior to the meeting  of the          Supreme Council;  and to notify the French, Belgium,          Italian and Japanese Embassies In London at the same          time and date:-               &apos;Mr* Lloyd George,                  Cannes, France,               &apos;Eight million organised British  Workers               realising close connection betv/een  decay               of British trade, with consequent               dangerous growth unemployment, and  &apos;                                                      Russian/

TEE YOUNG COMLIimiST LEAGUE          The league has now established headquarters in Gray&apos;s     Inn Road and proposes to hold a national conference at     Easter:  it appears, however, from a circular issued to     branches, that the conference will entail an expenditure of      150 and in order to raise this sum every employed member is     to be levied 2/- and every unemployed member l/-, the     latter contributions to be met from branch funds.          A &quot;million penny fund&quot; has been started in order to     facilitate a weekly issue of wThe Young Communist&quot;:  so     far 12,020 pennies have been raised, of which the office     staff contributed 48.          The following extract, taken from an article entitled     &quot;For You, Young Workers!&quot; by Jack Ganley, in the current issue     of &quot;The Young Communist&quot; is typical of the tone of this     publication:                             &quot;&quot;our Country.               &quot;Although we speak of Britain as ^ur1 country,          and millions of youths have died or been mutilated          in defence of what we have called ^ur1 country, it          is not our country at all., You young workers cannot          point to a single part of Britain and say it is yours.               &quot;Before the war one-eighth of the population          owned more than a half of the total wealth of          England.  On the other hand, thirteen millions were          always on the border-line of starvation.   Since the          war this has been widened, owing to the greater          concentration of capital into the hands of huge          trusts.  The war has been for a few the means of          making colossal fortunes, while for the many it has          meant death and ruin.&apos; The land, factories, mines,          railways and shipping, all the means of producing and          distributing the nation^ wealth, are owned by the          landlord and capitalist class.  The great mass of the     fight for the general proletariat work and your     voice will sound even louder in the cry of &quot;Hands   &apos;  off Russia&quot; in the Par East.          &quot;With a comradeTs greetings,                &quot;Plenipotentiary of the Par East Republic,                              Kushnarev.&quot;     It is probable that the enclosures to this letterwill be used by the &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; Committee as thebasis of further propaganda leaflets.
          people Own nothing except their muscles and brains,          that is, their power to work.&apos;&apos;&apos; &apos;          Jack Ganley is active on behalf of the Young     Communist League in Birmingham-where he frequently     addresses meetings:  he is a somewhat violent speaker   -  and said in the Bull Ring on January 8th to an audience     of 250:  -i-/--rV-I     ri:.-:: t\ti etnuwot. a^ainae!               &quot;I am absolutely opposed to my King and          country...               &quot;The Young Communist League is opposed to          militarism,  I wouldn11- fight for my King and my          country.  That doesn&apos;t mean to say that we v;ant any          one who joins the Young Communist League to swear ne^          to join the Army.  It may be advisable at some          future time that all the workers join.the Army, but          mind you get on the right side of the gun.&quot;THE RED INTERNATIONAL 0?

The Red International of Labour Unions is also     taking significant interest in the movement and it is     worthy.of: note that Jamas Quinton, who holds a mandate     from Moscow to assist in the &quot;red&quot; organisation of     seamen, is in close touch with V/atkins, to whom he wrote     prior to the -latter1 s departure for Russia:  &quot;If it is     your intention and need to come across you must write ; v   to the West European Bureau.

Kelly, its President,  and Sean McGrath, its     General Secretary have so far not committed themselves     to any publicly expressed views, but  are believed to     favour the policy of  Griffith.  They  are by no means     friendly to Art 0&apos;Brien who,  in the past,  has  always     played the part of a  dictator.          In Scotland where the Irish Republican Brotherhood     flourishes and Sinn Fein Clubs are  numerous, de Valera     will have many followers amongst the  less  responsible     members of the Irish.  Colony.   These,  however,  only form     a very small  percentage of the Irish  residents in     Scotland, 85$ of whom are said to be  in favour of the     Treaty.
