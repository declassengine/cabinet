(Circulated for the information of  the  Cabinet.)                  I. ECONOMIC AND  FINANCIAL CONFERENCE .) Mr. Lloyd Georges Resolution.   THE Supreme Council agreed at its  meeting, held at 11 A.M. on Friday, the ^^J?1&apos; h  January, 1922,  to accept in  principle the Draft  Resolution proposed  by  neu910nl- r.  Lloyd George in  regard to  an Economic Conference.  The Resolution was 0&apos;rafiuskm2considered in detail  at a further  meeting of the Supreme  Council  held the same day at 3*30 P.M., and was finally approved as follows:-        The Allied  Powers in conference  are  unanimously  of opinion that  an   Economic  and Financial Conference  should be summoned in  February or   early  March, to which all the Powers of Europe, including Germany, Russia,   Austria,  Hungary and  Bulgaria  should be invited to send representatives.   They regard such a Conference as an urgent and essential step  towards the   economic reconstruction of Central and Eastern Europe, and they are strongly   of opinion  that  the Prime  Ministers  of  every nation  should, if  possible,   attend it in person in order that action may be taken as promptly as possible   upon its recommendations.       The Allied Powers consider that  the resumption of international trade   throughout  Europe and the development of the resources of all countries are   necessary to increase the volume of productive employment and to relieve the   widespread suffering of the European peoples.  A united effort by the stronger   Powers is necessary to remedy the paralysis of the  European  system.  This   effort must include  the removal  of all obstacles in  the way of trade, the   provision of substantial credits for the weaker countries and the co-operation   of all nations  in the restoration of normal prosperity.      %       The  Allied Powers consider that the fundamental  conditions upon which   alone this effort can be made with  hope of  success may be broadly stated  as   follows:      1. Nations  can  claim no  right to  dictate to  each other  regarding the         principles  on which they are to regulate their system  of  ownership,         internal economy and government.  It is for every nation to choose for         itself the system which it prefers in this respect.     2. Before, however, foreign capital can be made available to assist a country,         foreign  investors must be assured that their  property and their rights         will be respected and the fruits of their enterprise secured to them.     3. The sense of security cannot be re-established unless the Governments of         countries desiring foreign credit freely undertake              (a.) That  they  will recognise  all public  debts and obligations                   which have been or may be undertaken or guaranteed by the                  &apos; State, by municipalities, or by other public bodies, as wTell as-                   the obligation to restore or compensate all foreign interests                   for  loss oTdamage caused to them  when property has been                   confiscated or withheld.             (&amp;.)  That  they  will establish a  legal  and juridical  system  which                 ,  sanctions and enforces commercial  and other contracts with                   impartiality.     [7733]                                                         B
4.  An adequate  means of exchange must be available, and, generally, the,    must be financial and currency conditions which, offer sufficient securifo    for trade.5.  All nations should undertake to refrain  from propaganda subversive o    order and  the established political system in other countries  than theiown.  6. All countries should join  in an undertaking to refrain from  aggressioi:      against their neighbours.    If in order to secure the conditions necessary for the development of timtrade in  Russia the Russian  Government  demands official recognition, theAllied Powers will be prepared  to accord such recognition only if the Russian!Government accepts the foregoing stipulations.

It  is reproduced as Appendix II to this paper.I.O.P. 236Conclusions1 and 8B.                             III. REPARATIONS.(a.) Conclusions of the Reparation Commission.    The  Reparation  Commission, at the request  of the Supreme  Council, heldMeeting at Cannes and reached certain conclusions in regard to Reparations.    These conclusions were approved by the Supreme Council at its Meeting hellat 11 A.M. on Friday, the 13th January, 1922, and were communicated to the Germaudelegation at the  same Meeting,  who took note of them and undertook to forwardthem to the  German Government.    The conclusions of the Reparation Commission are as follows :         The Reparation Commission decides to grant to the German Government al    provisional postponement of the instalments due on the 15th January and the!    15th February, 1922 (in so far as they are not  covered by cash payments already!    made or which  may be made, and by deliveries  in kind and receipts under thel    Reparation Recovery Acts received or which may be received up to the respective!    due dates), subject to the following conditions :  o        (a.) During the period  of provisional  postponement the German Govern-!               ment  shall  pay,  in  approved  foreign currencies,  the amount oi               31 millions of&apos; gold marks every ten days, the first payment being               upon the 18th January, 1922.        (b.) The  German Government shall, within  a period of fifteen days, submit               to the Commission a scheme of budget and currency reform, witl               appropriate guarantees, as  well as a complete programme of cast               payments and deliveries in kind for the year 1922.        (c.) The  period of  provisional postponement  shall end  as  soon as th               Commission or the Allied Governments have taken  a decision wit               regard to the scheme and programme indicated in paragraph  (b).
                                      o        Except  and so far as may be otherwise provided in this  decision,  the    difference between the amounts actually paid during the period of the provisional    postponement and the sums due during the same period under the Schedule of    Payments shall become clue and payable within fifteen days from the decision of    the Reparation Commission or of the Allied Governments, as the case  may be.        When the scheme and programme referred to above have been received by    the Reparation  Commission, they  will  be  immediately  transmitted by  the    Commission to the Allied Governments, who will thus be in a position either to    deal with the matter themselves or to refer it back to the Commission to be dealt    with by the latter.(b.) Agreement drafted by the Committee of Experts.    A Committee of  financial  experts was engaged in  drafting an  Inter-AlliedAgreement in regard to reparations.  This Agreement is reproduced as Appendix IIIto this paper.  Except in so far  as drafting amendments would have been necessary,the Agreement was concurred in by the heads of all the Delegations who remained atCannes and by  the French  financial experts. It was never  brought to a definite conclusion owing to the resignation of M.  Briand and the consequent departure ofthe French Ministers from Cannes.    2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. I.,          January 27, 1922.APPENDIX I.              PRESS NOTICE REGARDING THE  GENOA  CONFERENCE.    The Supreme Council have to-day agreed upon  the  subjects to be discussed at the Conference which is  to be called  at  Genoa  early in March, in order tofacilitate the economic revival of- Europe.                        General Objects and Conditions.    The published resolution  of  the  Council of the 6th January explains  thereasons which in the  unanimous  opinion  of  all the nations represented  on theCouncil  make  necessary a  united effort hy  all  European  countries to  restore the economic life of  Europe and to remove the obstacles which at present  impedeit, and the fundamental conditions of such a  combined effort.   These include the recognition by all  countries of their public debts, and compensation  for  loss or damage  caused  by the action  of Governments; financial and currency conditionswhich offer reasonable security for trade  and peace amongst nations.  Among theessential  objects of the  Conference will  be  the consideration  of  the practical measures required to give effect to these principles, and  in  particular to  secure,without injury to the  provisions of existing treaties, the essential conditions  forthe re-establishment of  confidence between nations without which internationalcommerce cannot revive.                                    Peace.    The  first condition  which is of prime importance in the reconstruction ofEurope is to establish the relations of all the countries on the basis of a stable and enduring peace.                              Financial Subjects.    The Conference will also discuss the financial conditions which impede revivaland the  financial measures  which might assist it;  in  particular the financialsitiiation in the several countries  in  relation to  the  task of reconstruction;  the rapid variation in the  amount  and purchasing power of  the national currencies;the violent  fluctuations in the  relative value  of  the currencies of different countries as reflected  in  the exchanges, and  the bearing upon these problems ofthe position and status of  central banks and banks of issue.   The conference will examine the conditions under which public or private  credit can  best bemade available for the work of  reconstruction.       [7733]                                                         C
                              Econoinie Subjects.    The obstacles to revival, however, are economic as well as financial.  TheConference will  therefore consider how the  existing  impediments  to the freeinterchange of the products of different  countries  can be removed, in particularby the  abolition, as rapidly and completely as possible, of such new impedimentsas have resulted from  post-war  conditions.  The improvement and developmentof the transport system will engage special attention; and among other questionswhich might be usefully examined are the security afforded by the laws and by thelegal systems and commercial documents in the different countries; the provisionof expert and technical assistance by countries specially qualified to give it; theposition of consular  officers; the protection  of copyrights; and the  regulations governing the admission of foreigners for the purpose of carrying on business.    January 11, )922.APPENDIX II.  PROPOSALS FOR RE-ESTABLISHING BETTER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN EUROPE.                                      I.    Europe is paralysed.   Her industries are dislocated, the volume of  inter-national trade has seriously decreased.   Many of her people suffer from unemploy-ment, and, in  Eastern Europe, from privation.  Systems of transport in central and  Eastern Europe have  fallen  into disorder, with the result  that the  wholecurrent of commerce has been impeded.    Want  of confidence among nations has paralysed the efforts of individuals,and the fluctuation  in the values of the national currencies has tended to restricttrade to primitive barter, and to destroy opportunities of employment.    A  resumption  of international trade and a development of the  resources ofeach country will extend the volume of productive  employment and tend to relieveexisting privation.    International trade will be re-established only when those engaged in tradeand industry can once more feel confident  that in Central  and  Eastern Europeeconomic principles will be observed which are essential to the development  andeven the existence of private enterprise.    The  fundamental conditions  upon which alone international trade can be actively developed with the Central and Eastern  European countries have beendefined in the  Resolution  passed by the Allied  Powers  in  conference on the6th January, 1922.    To bring Europe back to its former prosperity, it is essential that  theseconditions should  be  fulfilled; otherwise  trade  and labour will necessarily bereduced within narrow limits.    If any country refuses to fulfil these conditions,  trade with that  country willremain impossible   except  to  a limited extent,  and all  Europe will  suffer inconsequence.  The  markets of Central and Eastern Europe are essential  to thewell-being of European  industry.  If these  markets  cannot be reconstituted.Eastern and  South-Eastern Europe will  lose millions of their population, and reconstruction will  become  progressively more difficult;  and the conditions whichproduce misery and starvation in the East  will doom  the industrial  population of western Europe to  a long period of unemployment,  during which they  willcompete with each  other in  markets incapable of taking  more than a part  of thegoods they are anxious to produce.     In such  circumstances the economic  rehabilitation  of Europe  will becomestill more difficult.   Inflation will continue in many countries.  The cost of livingwill not fall, general depression will  not  abate,  and the wage-earning and the professional classes will be the worst sufferers.     The evil is even more far-reaching, and extends far  beyond Europe, for  it hasto be borne in mind that those countries producing raw materials, such  as  India,China, the Argentine and Brazil, if unable to sell these materials owing to theimpoverishment of  Europe, cannot in  their turn purchase the manufactures withwhich Europe has hitherto  supplied them.     The process of  reconstituting  each country by its own unaided efforts has notyet proved successful.   Whole-hearted co-operation among the nations of Europe
and amongst all the classes of the community can  alone  overcome the difficulty and stimulate and assist each country to  make the best use of its energies and resources.    It is therefore proposed  that the British  Empire, Fiance, Italy, Belgium, and japan and the United States of America, if willing, should take a share in the task,together with other countries capable of effective help.  It  is  desirable thatGermany should co-operate.   Germany is, industrially, commercially and financially,an important  factor in  Central and Eastern Europe.   Not only do her resources and her geographical position give  her  great importance, but she has  in the pastacquired knowledge and  experience which are useful for the process of reconnaisance-struction.    The problem is to restore confidence and  the credit  machinery necessary  for setting Central and Eastern  Europe to work again.  Governments  cannot  do thisthemselves, because, apart from other reasons,  credit operations require knowledgeof the position and the character of possible borrowers, and only industrialists andfinanciers possess this knowledge.                                      II.    It is proposed that  an International Corporation free from Government control should be constituted in the manner specified in the annexed Memorandum.    The primary purpose of the International Corporation and of the NationalCorporations which will be affiliated to it, while duly safeguarding rights previouslyacquired by nationals of the participating Powers, will be to undertake organisationof transport and harbour facilities and enterprises  associated therewith in such-countries as comply with the conditions above referred to and desire the assistanceof the International  Corporation.  Rehabilitation  of  the  transport  system willconduce to the free flow of trade and commerce and do more than any  other thing to prepare  the way for reopening of private enterprise.  There is,  however, muchmore.to be done.  Old industries have to be revived and new means of employmentfound.  The International Corporation will, at the same time, encourage  privateenterprise willing to engage in particular undertakings.    The  participation  of Germany in the Corporation will  incidentally facilitate the payment of reparation.  With that object, one-half  of the profits accruing onthe shares  of  the German  National  Corporation  will  be  paid to  the ReparationCommission.    Contracts for the supply of materials and  for  other purposes will, in general,be allotted to  particular countries in proportion to their provision of  capital  forthe International Corporation and the National Corporations.    A preliminary sum of  10,000 shall be provided forthwith by subscription bythe Governments of the countries agreeing  to participate  for the  purpose  of meeting the initial expenses of enquiry and investigation which will be necessary before further progress cau be made.

                              APPENDIX  III.               \                                                               \       /AGREEMENT IN  REGARD TO REPARATIONS DRAFTED BY THE  COMMITTEE  OF FINANCIAL                                  EXPERTS.                                Introductory. .    The Commission appointed to consider the  subject of German reparation makes the following report :      1.  In the opinion of the Commission, the financial evils of Germany, outwardlyexpressed in the catastrophic fall of the mark and the request of the German Govern-ment for some  relief  in respect of reparation, are of  such magnitude that  it isimpossible for her to meet in full during 1922 the instalments required under theSchedule of Payments.  Any attempt  to enforce payment in full in 1922 would serve only to aggravate the existing economic troubles of Europe.    2.  Without entering&apos;exhaustively into  the causes of  the  existing situation inGermany, the Commission is of opinion that the  German Government must itself be regarded as  largely responsible, owing to its excessive  weakness and consequentfailure to adopt a financial policy adequate  to  thei needs of the case.    3.  In these circumstances the Commission recommends that  partial relief begranted to  Germany in respect of 1922 on  condition that effective guarantees aregiven by her that the temporary respite will be used by her to restore order to herpublic finances.    4.  The  proposals  which the Commission proceeds to  make below may be con-sidered under three heads,  viz. :     (A.) Period of Moratorium and amounts  to be paid  by Germany during such          period.    (B.) Guarantees to  be given by  Germany  as  a  condition  of   grant  of a          Moratorium.    (C.) Inter-Allied arrangements for division of receipts from  Germany during          the Moratorium.    As regards (B) (Guarantees to be given by Germany), it is to be understood thatthe conditions proposed are tentative and subject to modification in the light ef thediscussions which are to take  place with the German delegation.  (A.) Period of Moratorium and Amounts to be paid by Germany during such                                   Period.    5. It is proposed that the period of the Moratorium shall be the calendar year1922,  and that during  that  period the instalments due  under the Schedule ofPayments shall not be paid, and that any sum by which Germany&apos;s payments during1922 fall short of the sums due under the Schedule of Payments shall be added, with interest at 5 per cent., to the outstanding liability of Germany.    6. It is proposed that during 1922 Germany shall  be required to make cashpayments as follows :                                                        Milli&apos; n Gold Mark.-.         On January 20       ...      ...       ...       ...    125February  15March 15 ...April 15  ...May 15   ...June  15   ...July  15   ...August  15...September  15October 15November 15December 157550505050505050506060                                                             720    7.  Apart from these cash  payments,  it is proposed that German  payments,whether for the Armies of Occupation or for Reparation, should be made entirely      [7733]                                                          D
in the form  of  deliveries in  kind (including  the  proceeds  of  any Reparation(Recovery) Act or similar legislation),  and that the amount to be paid in kind shallnot exceed a value of 1,450 millions of gold marks.     8. Finally, it is proposed that as from the 1st May, 1921, up to the 30th April,1922, the actual cost of the Armies of Occupation  and as from the 1st May to the31st December the  &quot;forfaits &quot; hereinafter provided for shall  be  charged  againstthe deliveries in  kind (including the proceeds of Reparation Recovery Acts) in thehands of the respective Governments.     As from the  1st May, 1922,. the cost of the  Armies of  Occupation, other thanthat of the United States of America,  and exclusive of the cost under Articles 8-12of the arrangement of the 28th June, 1919, shall be fixed at monthly  amounts  payable to the British, French  and Belgian  Governments in sterling,  French francs and belgian  francs respectively.   The monthly amounts in question will  be determinedby the following method. * A  total amount of 220,000,000 gold marks  shall in  thefirst place be distributed among the Powers concerned in proportion to the followingeffective  strengths :              Belgian    ....       ...       ...       ...   *     19,300             British     ...       ...       ...       ...         15,000             French     ...       ...       ...       ...         90,400     A special allowance  of 2 gold marks per day,  or 10,950,000 gold marks, willbe made  in respect of the British Army of Occupation, to cover its higher cost.  Theremainder, or 209,050,000 gold marks,  will be divided among  the three governments in strict proportion  to the number of effectives as above stated and the gold marksthus determined, including the above  sum of 10,950,000  gold marks to be  paid  toGreat Britain, will be converted into Belgian  francs,  sterling or French  francsrespectively, at the mean rate of each of the currencies in question during the monthof December 1921.   As from the  1st January, 1923,  the annual amounts in nationalcurrencies thus arrived at as  &quot; forfaits &quot; will be paid by the German Governmentin twelve monthly instalments to the Governments concerned.     The above distribution shall be liable to modification by agreement in accordancewith variations in the number of effectives supplied by the respective Governments.     Should the number of effectives be reduced in any case below the  above-mentionedfigures, no reduction shall be made unless and until  the Allied Army  concerned hasrecovered its full cost, after which the  amount payable on the above basis in respectof the Army concerned shall be reduced so as not to exceed  its actual cost, and theamount to be paid  by  Germany shall be  decreased accordingly in  so far  as the saving thus  effected is  not  required  to  cover  an increase in the  effectives of another Army.     The Governments in  question should further agree annually upon a lump Assuming paper marks to cover  the  cost of  seiwices and supplies  furnished by Germanyunder Articles 8-12  of the arrangement of the 28th  June, 1919.     In the event  of  special military action of a precautionary or coercive characterbeing decided upon by the Allied Powers, the resulting expenses should be payable by Germany, over and above the amounts above mentioned.     (B.) Guarantees to be given by Germany as a Condition of a Moratorium.     9. Germany  will within  fifteen days make  arrangements  to  the  satisfaction of the Reparation Commission for  -     (1.)  Collecting existing Customs duties on an effective gold  basis.     (2.)  Raising  the internal price of  coal by x per  cent.    (3.)  Raising  railway, postal,  telegraph and telephone rates by x.    (4.)  Ensuring that, as from the 1st January, 1922,  pending the effective grant        &apos;  of autonomy to the Reichsbank, except by permission of the Reparation          Commission                (a.) The net addition  by the  advances  by the  Reichsbank  to the                     German  Government (whether directly  or in the form of                     discounting of Treasury Bills) during any single month shall                     not exceed the net amount of such advances during the montn                     of December 1921.               (b.) The net addition to the issues of uncovered notes of any kind                     during any month shall similarly be  limited to an amount                     not exceeding the net  additions  to  the  issues  during the                     month of December 1921.
    10. The  German Government will prepare and  submit to  the  Committee  of guarantees within six weeks of notification a considered programme  for     (1.) The  grant of autonomy to the Keichsbank.    (2). The  issue of internal loans-other than  Treasury Bills discounted by the          Reichsbank in amounts sufficient  to cover any Budget deficit until such          time as the Budget  can be balanced by  Revenue receipts.    (3.) Measures calculated to secure the balancing  of the Budget, in particular          the  gradual  suppression  of  subsidies,  and of expenditure,  whether          capital or otherwise, on services which are not of urgent necessity; and          the balancing of the receipts  and expenditure of  the railway,  postal,          telegraph and telephone  services, together  with  all  necessary fiscal          measures for the  assessment and collection of taxation.    (4.) Measures calculated to stop abuses in the matter of export of capital and          to facilitate the return  to Germany of  capital already exported.    (5.) Measures directed  to prepare the  way  for a reform  of  the  monetary          circulation of Germany, including  the cessation as soon  as possible of          additions to the uncovered note issue.    (6.) Periodic publication of financial and commercial accounts and statistics in          accordance with pre-war practice.    11.  This programme as submitted shall  indicate the periods necessary for itscontinuous realisation in each  part, and shall so far as possible be accompanied  bythe text of any laws or regulations necessary to give effect to it.  The Committee of guarantees,  within one  month of  the receipt of the programme from  the GermanGovernment,  will pronounce  upon it.  It will  decide if the periods proposed by theGerman Government are such  as should be accepted, and if it  decides that they arenot to be accepted, it shall fix different periods. It shall indicate what  modification in the programme it considers necessary. If the German Government fails to submit the programme within the time specified, or fails in the execution of the programme in any  particular, the  Committee of Guarantees may  declare the failure of theGerman Government, and such declaration by the  Committee of Guarantees shall initself  have the effect of making immediately due any  payments under the schedule of Payments which at that  date  are  in arrear, without prejudice to the penaltieswhich default in the terms of paragraph 17 of Annex II of Part VIII of the Treatyof Versailles  may involve.    12. The  Committee  of Guarantees will have its seat in Berlin.  The Chairmanshall be elected by the Committee.    13. The  German Government  shall undertake to recognise  the full power of theCommittee of Guarantees to  supervise the execution of the measures above indicated,and to assist  the Committee by all means in its power in the exercise of its functionsof supervision.    14. It is proposed that  Germany should be required to use her best endeavours to the satisfaction of the Reparation Commission  (which in case of necessity would apply the provisions of  paragraph 17  of Annex II of Part VIII of the Treaty ofVersailles), without undue delay to give effect to  the Wiesbaden x\greement and toenter  into agreements with other Powers for deliveries in kind, of the nature of theWiesbaden Agreement of which  not more than  240 million  gold marks  shall bereceivable by Italy, and not more than 260  million gold marks  by  other  Powers,subject  to such adjustments  as  between  one  Power and  another  as may proveconvenient during the course of 1922.(C.) Inter-Allied  Arrangements for  the Division  of Receipts from  Germany                           during the Moratorium.    15. It is proposed that  the Allied Governments should consent to the operation for a  period  of three years  of the Wiesbaden Agreement regarding  Reparation in kind payable to France, subject to the following conditions : .    (1.) The amount of deliveries under  Annexes II to VI of Part VIII of the          Treaty (including any levy in France similar to the levy under the British          Reparation (Recovery) Act) and the Agreement together shall not exceed          950,000,000 gold  marks in 1922, 1;500.000,000 in 1923  and 1,500,000,000          in 1924.[7733]
 &apos;   (2.) The amount standing deferred at the  end of  1924 shall be liquidated by          Prance, with interest as provided for in the Agreement,  in ten equal          annual  instalments, beginning  on the 1st May,  1926, by set-off  against          sums due to France in each year out of Reparation receipts, and unless          the operation of the Agreement is  continued for a longer period by          agreement  among the Allies,  France  shall, in  no year subsequent to          1926, receive, whether in cash or deliveries,  sums which, when added to          the said instalments, would result in France receiving in that year more          than her proportionate share, as determined  by Inter-Allied Agreements,          of the total payments by Germany in that year, including the instalment          due by  France.    It is proposed that any Allied Power  entitled to Reparation shall be permitted to enter into Agreements similar to the Wiesbaden Agreement for delivery in kind,subject to the approval of  the Reparation Commission, provided that the value ofthe deliveries in kind under Annexes II to VI of Part VIII of the Treaty, and under such Agreements to be received by any Powers other  than France (including the proceeds of  the British Reparation (Recovery) Act and any similar Acts) shall not,during 1922, exceed 500,000,000 gold marks in the aggregate.    16. It is proposed that during 1922 each Power shall retain for its own use thevalue of any deliveries in  kind  (including the  proceeds  of  any  levy under  anyReparation  (Recovery) Act).  But, subject to the provisions of paragraph 15 of this document  and of any  Inter-Allied  Agreement already entered into, the receipts ofany Allied  Power in respect  of Reparation, during 1922,  together  with  interestthereon at 5 per cent,  per annum as from  the 1st January, 1923, shall  be taken intoaccount in determining the  proportions of  Reparation receipts due to each Power in.1923 and subsequent years.    17. It  is recommended that the  Governments  represented  on  the  supreme council should agree that the amount to be debited to France for deliveries of coalmade to France by Germany shall  be  calculated in accordance with the Agreementalready arrived at between  the French and German Governments on the assumptionthat paragraph 6 (a) of Annex V to Part VIII of the Treaty of Versailles is applic-able to the total of such deliveries.    Should  the  Reparation Commission be unable  to accept the above Agreementbetween the French and German Governments, the difference between the amountdebited to France as above  and the amount credited to Germany in accordance  withthe decision of the Reparation Commission, shall be liquidated in accordance  withthe terms of the Subsidiary  Agreement of the 13th August, 1921, regarding deliveries in kind.    18. It is proposed  that the Agreements  of  the  13th August, 1921,  shall be ratified except as hereinbefore  modified,  and subject   to  the   following  furthermodifications :     (a.) The 1,000,000,000  gold marks already paid and the 720,000,000 gold marks          to be paid by Germany  in  1922 should be treated together.    (&amp;.) Out of this total sum of&apos; 1,720,000,000 gold marks-               (i.) There should be applied a sum of 500,000,000 gold marks towards                     payment of the cost of the British Army of Occupation up to                     the 30th April, 192F Any amount by &quot;which this eventually                     proves to be less than the actual outstanding costs as on that                     date  being  treated as  a debt  due  to the British  Empire                     repayable out of the first cash  receipts  from  Germany on                     account of reparation after the Belgian priority  has  been                     satisfied.                          Any receipts by the Reparation  Commission on &quot; capital                     account &quot; in respect of the  period prior to the 1st May,  1921,                     will  continue to be paid to the British Empire on account of the                     outstanding cost of occupation  up to the  30th April,  1921,                     and  in reduction of the above-mentioned debt.               (ii.) There  should be  applied  a  sum   of  140,000,000 gold marks                     towards payment of the cost of the French Army of Occupa-                     tion up to the  30th April, 1921, inclusive.   Any amount by                     which this eventually proves to  be less than the actual out-                     standing costs  as on that date calculated in accordance with
V   274                     this Agreement  being  treated as a debt due to France and                     repayable out of the  first cash receipts  from Germany  on                     account of reparation after  the Belgian priority  has been                     satisfied in full and after the debt due to the British Empire                     mentioned above has been repaid.               (iii.) The remainder of the sum of 1,720,000,000 gold marks will be                     payable to Belgium  in respect of the Belgian priority.                         No interest  will be debited or credited in respect  of the                     adjustments under paragraph 18 (b) (i), (ii) and (iii).    (c.) In respect of the value of the Saar Mines the sum of  300,000,000 gold  marks           shall be debited to France in the same way as a delivery in kind made on           the  1st  January, 1922, and  shall be  dealt  with in accordance with           paragraph 16 of this Agreement.  Should the value of the Saar Mines as           assessed  by  the  Reparation  Commission  prove  to be  higher  than           300,000,000 gold marks, the excess will be liquidated by the distribution           among the Powers participating in reparation of &quot; C &quot; Bonds to the value           of such excess taken from France&apos;&apos;s share in the total series of &quot; C &quot; Bonds.    (d.) Belgium  will not call on any of the Powers which have received reparation           in kind, including receipts under Reparation Recovery Acts during 1921,           or may receive such reparation during 1922, for any payment in respect           thereof for the purpose of satisfying Belgian priority.    19. It  is hereby agreed that in  Article  5  (Non-German  Reparation) of thePrincipal Agreement of the 13th August,  1921, &quot;Article 2&quot; should be read  where  article 2 (b) &quot; occurs in the original text.January 11, 1922.
