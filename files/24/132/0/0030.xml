C a B I&apos; l\i  E T .         l\otc by the Chancellor of the Exchequor on the         Report of the Cabinet  Committee on Southern Ireland.     I wish to draw the attention of my colleagues to certain points In tho Cabinet Committee&apos;s Reoort.     Compensation.         The Committee proposes to set up a Commission to dealwith claims, and that the British Government should reimbursethe Irlnr. Government such total amounta as in the judgment of theCommission is attributable to the action of the forces of theCrown or their sympathisers.         It will no doubt be possible to get an impartialCommi&apos;sion, but it seems to me that it will be extraordinarilydifficult for the Commission to obtain In Ireland any usefulevidence aa to the authors of particular, losses.  I am inclined,therefor&apos;&apos;, to suggest that we should straightway offer to bearhalf the cost of the compensation awarded by the Commission.         If this suj/goFtion is agreed to the paragraph shouldbe amended to road:,--  &quot; to reimburse the Irish Government half thecost of the awards authorised by the Commission&quot;.     Trapsfor of _ Revenue .              The Committee, proposes to make over Southern Irishrevenue to the Southern Irish Exchequer without  deducting there-frcm, a?, is done in the cane of Northern Ireland, the amountsdue to the Imperial Government for expenditure in Ireland.Apert from the question of Southern Irish contribution to debt and pensions, these amounts will include -
   (1)  Southern Ireland annuities in respect of  existing       lend purchase advances (ahout  2,650,000  per  annum)     &apos;  and some minor similar claims such as the local  loans       advances.   (2)  Sxcess,  at present perhaps  700,&amp;00 per annum,  of  Customs        and. Excise receipts actually collected in Southern         Ireland over Customs and Excise  revenue &quot;attributable&quot;         to Southern Irelands    (3) Irish expenditure paid primarily  from United Kingdom        resources, e .g,,  existing pension? and judges  salaries.    (4.)  Expenditure on Irish services  after the transfer of         Irish taxation but before effective transfer  of  the         admihistrative services, which will probably be  gradual.    (5)  if the United. Eihgdom continues  to ret  as agent  for         collecting revenue, the cost of  collecting  such  revenuej         (e-g. tho administration of Post Office in  Southern         Ireland exceeds the postal revenue of Southern Ireland         by about E7C 0 ..0CG&apos; per annum) ..                 I think that in any case we ought to  be  entitledto deduct from the payments to Southern Ireland,  the  cost  of collecting her revenue if we collect It.                 As regards the other items it may be  necessaryto trust the Southern Ireland Government:  but we should!  clearly have grater security if at any rate clurinr:; the  provisionalperiod, we had power to deduct from the  Irish taxes,  takingpower to issue from the British Consolidated Eund to the  Irishexchequer the produce of Irish taxation as certified by theJoint  Exchequer Board (on which Southern Ireland would be repre-sented) less such deductions as might be prescribed.  This might include any or all of the items enumerated above.     Basisof Irish Revenue,                 The Committee^ report assumes  that during  the                                                 provisional
t142provisional period Southern  Ireland will  receive  not  therevenue collected in. Southern Ireland,  but  the  revenueattributable to Southern Ireland.    This  follows  the  provisionsof the Government of Ireland Act,  192o.          I should, however,  point out  that when  the  FreeState is set up with Dominion status Southern Ireland will receive not attributable revenue but revenue which she  herselfcollects in Southern Ireland (to which  revenue  will be  appliedas regards such matters as income  tax the usual double  taxationprovision applicable between tho United Kingdom and the Dominions $.As attributable revenue (taking all revenue heads together)  is considerably in excess of collected revenue perhaps by  as much as one million and a half or two millions  a year;      -the  Free  state will suddenly find itself In the possession of  much less revenuethan it will get on the Committee&apos;s plan during the provisionalperiod.   In these circumstances,  it is a question whether  it         \would not bo wiser to treat  the Provisional Government  also  onthe Dominion basis as regards its revenue and to  give it revenuecollected rather than revenue attributable.    &apos; ^oht and Pension Contribution.          The Cabinet will observe that while under theCommittee1s plan the Southern Irish Government  will receive its full revenue from  1st April next, it is not likely that the contribution for debt and pensions  (which depends on  arbitration)will be fixed for  a very considerable time.   For the next  tenor twelve months they will therefore be in possession of a  sumof say  six or  seven millions which may ultimately be  duo to theImperial  Government, but which in the meantime they will bear asa large surplus on their revenue.   They will probably be pressed to uso this money either in fresh . .* penditure in Ireland                                                      or
  cr in reduction of taxation in Ireland, and if they take - as  they probably will do - an optimistic view of the contribution  which the Arbitration Tribunal, will fix, there is a considerable  danger that at the end of the 12 months, when the money is required  for payment to the- United Kingdom, It will not be available.            It may be added that on a very rough cowpivtation, on  the assumption that Southern Ireland pays no contribution to debt  in 1022-25 but pays over the other amounts to which the United  Kingdom has a claim (including Land Purchase Annuities), the  effect  n the Budget 1922-23 would be a net loss to the United  Kingdom of&apos;about six or seven millions.   This figure is of course  given under all reservations.*-                                           R. S. H,Treasury :-Chamber1 7th January? - 1922.
