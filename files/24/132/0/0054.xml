On the whole the improve-ment in coal-mining continues, though  there have been set-backs in certain areas.A slight improvement is recorded in the iron and steel industry.  Shipbuilding and marine engineering  show no improvement, but  a slight improvement in ship-repairing is reported from Bristol.  The improvement in the  woollen  industry ismaintained.  The hosiery trade is fairly brisk.  Cotton, however, remains very uncertain.  General  engineering is still depressed, though a slight recovery in the motor and cycle sections continues, and a few re-engagements in other sections havebeen reported.  Employment in the tinplate industry remains good. The improve-ment in the wholesale clothing industry has not been maintained.  The building trade  remains stagnant.  There is a distinct improvement in the glove-makingindustry at Barnstaple.T. J. MACNAMARA,             Ministry of Labour.

I.-SUMMARY OF  ACTION TAKEN BY  THE  GOVERNMENT.                    [From Autumn 1920 to Autumn 1921.]                      Cabinet Unemployment Committee,    The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, there was a special discussion at a meetingof  the Cabinet, when  the Cabinet Unemployment Committee was  appointed toconsider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment.    [This Committee has since been in  constant session  and has up to the 20thJanuary, 1922,  held 42 meetings.    The problem of unemployment in one form or another has also been before theCabinet  on 56 occasions  between the 13th August, 1920, and the 20th January,1922.]                        (A.) Unemployment Insurance.    An  Unemployment Insurance  Bill  of general scope was introduced  on the23rd December, 1919, reintroduced on the 16th February, 11)20,  received  a third reading in the Commons on the 19th July, 1920, passed into law on the 9th  August,1920, and came into  operation on the 8th November, 1920.    This Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. The weekly rates of benefit, paid out of contributions from employers, employed  and the State, were 15s. for men and12s. for women, after a &quot;waiting period&quot; of three days.  In general, the amount ofbenefit was limited to one week for every  six contributions paid, but during the first year eight weeks&apos;  benefit  could be drawn after four contributions  had been paid.    An Amending Act of the 23rd December, 1920. granted eight weeks&apos; benefit, upto  the 31st March..  1921, to persons who had paid no contributions but had beenemployed for a  certain minimum period in an insured trade in 1920.    A further Amending Act of the 3rd  March, 1921,  increased the rate of benefitto  20s. for men and  16s.  for women.   It further provided that during each of the periods March-October 1921 and November 1921-July  1922 16 weeks&apos;  benefit couldbe  drawn by persons who had been  employed in an insured trade  in 20 weeks sincethe end of 1919 and were normally  employed in an insured trade genuinely seekingwhole-time employment and unable to obtain  it.    A third Amending Act of the 1st July, 1921, reduced-the rate of benefit to 15s.for men and 12s. for women and increased the &quot; waiting period &quot; to six days.  this change was necessitated  by exhaustion  of funds  owing  to  the  great amount ofunemployment and was coupled with a heavy increase in contributions and authorityto  borrow money from the Treasury to the extent of  20,000,000, as compared with 10,000,000  previously.   At the same time power was taken to allow 22 weeks&apos;benefit  (instead of 16)  in each of the periods March-October  1921 and November1921-July 1922.    Between the 8th November,  1920, and the 13th January, 1922, the amount paidin  unemployment benefit  was  60,945,000.*  Of this  amount the contribution ofemployers since the 8th November, 1920, was  12,474,000,* that of employed persons 11,410,000* and that of the State  6,117,000,* in  addition to  1,598,000* inrespect of benefit for ex-regular sailors, soldiers  and airmen.   The balance was provided  mainly  out of  the  accumulated reserve  fund  of over 20 millions andadvances by the Treasury amounting to  8,370,000.*    The number of persons in receipt of benefit was on the 1st July, 1921, 2,062,012wholly unemployed and  988,364 on  part-time, and  on the 17th January,  1922,l,833,000t wholly unemployed and 295,000f on part-time.                 (B.) Emergency Works and other Measures.    A sum of  10,400,000 was  provided for expenditure  on arterial roads, half tobe given  by  way of actual grant and half by way of a loan to Local Authorities.This money is administered by the Ministry of Transport and is expended  by LocalAuthorities under their supervision.  The  men to  be  employed are selected by theLocal Employment Committee of the Employment Exchange and preference is givento  ex-Service men.    A  further  sum of  3,000,000 was allocated to the Unemployment GrantsCommittee, presided over by  Lord St. Davids, for the purpose of assisting LocalAuthorities to carry out at once works on which a substantial number of unemployed        * The amounts for Northern Ireland arc excluded as from the 31st December, 1921.        t Estimated.      [7719]                                                    -   B 2
could be engaged.   The conditions imposed with regard to the expenditure of this money were that works could only be approved in areas where there existed seriousunemployment which was not otherwise provided for, that the men employed shouldbe taken from the registers of the Employment Exchanges, preference being given to ex-Service men, and that any grant paid should not exceed 60 per cent,  (originally30 per cent.) of the wages bill of additional men taken on for the work.  Further,the works had to be such as were approved by  the appropriate Department of theGovernment as suitable works of public utility.  The condition as to recruitment oflabour through the Employment Exchanges  was  subsequently modified so as topermit Local Authorities to draw  all or  a portion  of the  labour  from Boards of guardians.  A condition has also been imposed by which Local Authorities carryingout schemes by means of direct labour may not, during a probationary period of sixmonths, pay to unskilled men wages higher than 75 per cent,  (or, in the  case of men employed only half-time, 87-1  Per cent.)  of  the authorities&apos;  rate for unskilledworkmen.    In  addition  to the items  outlined  above,  assistance from  the  Ministry ofTransport  has enabled  Local Authorities to  maintain in employment on road maintenance a number  of men beyond those  ordinarily employed on this  work.Additional employment  has  also been provided by expediting work on sites and sewers for housing schemes.  An emergency programme undertaken by the Office ofWorks, and the introduction of alternative work and a system of short-time working in Government Industrial Establishments  have further assisted towards  relief of thesituation.    In addition, Local Authorities have been encouraged by the Government to putwork in  hand  without receiving definite Government assistance.    From  the  autumn  of  1920 to  autumn,  1921, in this way, a sum of at least25 millions was set aside by the Government and the Local  Authorities  for schemesof work which are still continuing.  At least 200,000 men have had employment onthese schemes at  various times, and at the present time over 123,000 men areemployed (see table below).                         II.-LATER  MEASURES.                         [Autumn, 1921, onwards.]    Before rising  for the recess, the Cabinet agreed that the position with regardto unemployment was so serious that the Cabinet Unemployment  Committee mustdevote special attention to it, with special reference to the exhaustion of benefit underthe Unemployment Insurance Acts.    On  the 19th  August,  1921,  the Cabinet,  on  the  recommendation  of theCommittee, agreed that assistance could  be given to Local Poor Law Authorities,either by way of  expediting the sanction  for loans  or  permitting the loans to bespread over a  number of years, in  cases in which the Local Authority  could prove that there  were exceptional  circumstances due to the abnormal unemployment andthat they were exercising their  powers with due care and  discretion.    The whole matter was again discussed at the Cabinet which  met at Inverness onthe 7th September, 1921.     On the 16th  September,  1921,  the Cabinet Committee further agreed that      &quot; (1.) Where,  for the purpose of providing employment in the present emergency,Local Authorities (including statutory bodies who  do not trade for profit)  put inhand or accelerate approved works (other than  revenue-producing works), whichwould not otherwise have been proceeded with, or so accelerated at the present time,the State will  give financial  assistance on the following basis.     &quot; Grants  equal to 50 per cent, (since increased to 65  per cent.) of the interestand sinking fund charges on loans raised by Local Authorities to meet expenditureon schemes actively commenced before the 1st  January, 1922,  will be  paid by theState for a period of  one-half the term of the loans subject to a maximum of fifteen years.  The expenditure to be taken into  account will be all approved expenditure incurred within the period ending the 31st March, 1923.     &quot; In approving schemes, special regard will be had to the direct employment ofunemployed persons and to a preference being given to ex-Service  men.     &quot; (2.)  In  the case of revenue-producing works, grants  will be paid, in approvedcases, equivalent to 50 per cent, of the interest on loans, raised for a period of notless than ten years, in respect of expenditure, on schemes actively commenced beforethe 1st January, 1922, provided that such expenditure is incurred within the period ending the 31st March,  1923.  These interest grants will  be paid for  a period offive years.&apos;
      &quot; (3.)  Schemes shall not be authorised exceeding a total capital expenditure of  10 millions without consultation between the Minister of Health and the Chancellor  of  the Exchequer  (since increased to 13 millions).      &quot; (4.) Schemes must be approved by the Ministry of Health or  other appro-  priate Government Department  as schemes  which will provide  employment and  must be certified by the Ministry of Labour for districts where  unemployment is  severe.&quot;      Subsequently it was decided that  Local Authorities carrying out schemes by  means of direct labour may not, during a probationary period of six months, pay to  unskilled men wages higher than 75 per cent,  (or, in the case of men employed only  half-time, 87-^- per cent.) of the authorities&apos;rates for unskilled  workmen.                 III.-FURTHER REMEDIAL MEASURES.      During the Autumn Session,  1921, the  following measures were  submitted to  Parliament and approved :       (1.) Amendments to Exports Credits  Scheme. (a.) Government  guarantee to  be increased from 85 per cent, of the cost to 100 per cent, with  recourse against the  exporter for 57^ per cent.      (b.) Maximum  guarantee  for  each  firm  to be  fixed by special  Advisory  Committee.      (c.)  Extension of scheme to all countries, including the  British Empire.      (d.) Extension of period of credit in certain cases to 1927.      (2.) Government Guarantee of Payment  of Interest and  Principal  of Loans raised by Dominions, Colonies, foreign Governments, public authorities, &amp;c, where such loans are to be applied towards the carrying out of any capital undertaking or in the purchase of articles to be manufactured in the United  Kingdom  required for the purposes  of any such  undertaking, the British Government^ liability under this scheme not to exceed  25,000,000.   It is to-be a condition of the guarantee that the application of the  loan  is  calculated  to  promote employment  in  the United Kingdom.      (3.) A  Sum of 5%  Millions for General  Unemployment  Relief. Subject to Treasury approval, the money will be used in connection with schemes for providing employment  on land  improvement  and  drainage ( 650,000), forestry  ( 250,000), light railways, and also by way of loans to Boards of Guardians or Parish Councils in necessitous areas who  are unable to meet claims for  relief (see Cabinet decision of the  19th August above).     (4.) &quot; The  Unemployed   Workers&apos;  Dependants&apos; Fund,&quot;  to be established  by legislation for a period of six months for the purpose of making grants  towards the maintenance of the wives and dependent children of unemployed workers in receipt of unemployment benefit.  The grants will be at the weekly rate of  5s.  for the wife and Is. for each  child.   The necessary money will be obtained by means of further contributions  paid by those now contributing to  the  Unemployment  Fund  (both employers and workmen) together with  a grant from the State.  The total amount available will be  approximately 6^  millions.     (5.) Overseas Settlement. A further  330,000 was voted  to assist ex-Service men desiring to emigrate to the Dominions.     (6.) Acceleration of Government  Contacts. The  position  with regard  to Government contracts is being examined to see whether, in any cases, a reasonable anticipation of requirements can be made with advantage from the point of view of increasing emplo3nnent.     (7.)  Ministry of Transport. A further sum ( 2,000,000)  will be available from the  Road Fund for expenditure on roads to relieve unemployment in  necessitous areas.     (8.)  Unemployment Grants Committee. A further sum of  600,000 was placed at the disposal of this Committee for dealing with Schemes on the original basis of 60 per cent, of the Wages Bill.     (9.)  Office of Works. A sum of  50,000 has been voted for unemployment relief works in the Royal Parks.     For  the above schemes (apart from the assistance to Local Authorities with regard to Loan Charges,  the Export Credits Scheme and the Governmenfs liability under the Guarantee of Loans  for Capital Undertakings)   the Government  has undertaken to find   12,000,000, the greater  portion  within  the current financialyear.
