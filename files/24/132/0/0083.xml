STJTUKS   COSSTITUTIOH  OF A  NATIONAL LIBRARY     POR.SCOTLAJTD ON TEE BASIS OF THE AjDVOGATJIS&apos;                 LIBRARY&quot;.(Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland.)L,        An offer has been ade by the Faculty of Advocates to            to   hand ever/the Government as the basis of a national Library   for Scotland the great Library owned by the  Faculty.  Details   of the  offer arc contained in the Reports prepared by e.   Committee of the Faculty, of which copies are appended.   Reference is made in particular to Appendix  I in  the Second  . Interim Report marked B.         In normal circumstances I should have recommended, the   immediate acceptance of the offer  (subject to the adjust-   ment of detailed conditions) and the taking  of measures to   constitute  the national Library.   That course would,   however, involve expenditure from public funds on a scale   which,  under existing financial conditions may, I fear,   be deemed impracticable,,  In order, however, that advantage   may be  taken of the  offer so far as practicable I submit   the matter  to my colleagues with a recommendation that the   Government  should give  a general expression  of opinion   in favour of the realisation of the proposal when financial   circumstances permit.2.        The Advocates&quot; Library   contains  about 700,000   volumes exclusive  of manuscripts,  maps  and pictures.   It   was  founded about  the year  168S by the  Faculty  of Advocates   primarily  for  the use  of  the  Scottish Bar.   It has, however,    long had a  national  character  both in  respect ftf  its    contents and  of  its  functions.   For  on the  one hand it                                                    contains/                          - 1  -
contains a large number of volumes and manuscripts  ofgreat importance in the history of the Scottish nation and it has the right under the Copyright Act to claim  acopy of every book that is published;  and on the otherhand, the Fa-culty have admitted to the  use of the Libraryall members of the public desirous of  consulting books forany reasonable purpose.  For a fuller  account of the library I refer to the Memorandum in Appendix II of theReport marked &apos;A&apos;.      The Faculty of Advocates have for over 200 yearsborne the cost of maintaining the Library mainly from  duespaid by new members on entrance to the Faculty.  The burdenhas been a constantly increasing one and it is no longerwithin the power of the Faculty (a body consisting of  about300-400 professional men) to keep the  contents of the library in proper order and repair and to serve the needsof the public who use it.  In view of  the fact that theGovernment, if they agree to accept the Faculty&apos;s offer,will have the right to take over the Library at some future date and of the consequent special interest of the Govern-ment in the preservation of the collection, I understandthat the Chancellor of the  Exchequer  has agreed to make an annual grant of  2,000 to meet the  most pressing needsof the Library and to prevent its deterioration.      In present circumstances this is doubtless the onlymeasure of assistance that can be given by  the Government.If, however, my colleagues endorse the view that the con-version of the Advocates1 Library into a national Libraryis a desirable public object, although for  the present itis ruled out by the state of  the national  finances, i recommend that a  suitable intimation be made to the faculty in response to  their  offer.        I therefore ask authority  to make- an intimation tothe  Faculty  to  the following  effect                                                  The/
      The Government recognise that the Faculty have  formany years made their great collection available to  thepublic for all reasonable purposes.  They regret that inthe present state of the national finances it is not practicable to proceed with the transfer of the ownership and management of the Library to tho State.  They greatlyappreciate the Faculty&apos;s offer and they regard tho constitu-tion of a Scottish National Library on the basis of  the advocates&apos; Library as a highly desirable public object whenfinancial conditions permit.  They realise that the  presentowners cannot, without financial assistance, provide  ovenfor the necessary maintenance- and use of the Library andare prepared to make an annual grant from public fundstowards the cost of upkeep and use.  Subject to the  consentof Parliament, a grant of  2,000 will bo provided undersuitable  conditions for this purpose.(Sgd.)    ROBERT KUKRO.Scottish Office,     1st February,  1922.

The  terms of their remit were asfollows:    &quot;To consider and report  to the Faculty  on the present       and future position of  the Advocates&apos; Library, with       special reference to  the  project of  the institution       of a National Library  for Scotland, with  power to       confer with  the  appropriate  Government Depart-       ments, and to make such other inquiry and investi-       gation as the Committee may  deem necessary to       enable it to  formulate proposals for submission to       the Faculty.&quot;   The Committee deem it  proper at  this  stage to place before the Faculty the  result of their  investigations  andinquiries  so far  as they have proceeded.   It is unnecessary to recapitulate in any detail the historyof  the Library.  Instituted in 1689 &quot;as a thing useful andexpedient for  the College of Justice and profitable for thewhole nation &quot; to quote the Act of Sederunt of 18th January
1684, in which  the Court recorded its approval of the pro-ject the  Library, from a small beginning, has attained amagnitude far beyond anything contemplated by its founders,and  is  now  incomparably the  largest and  most  valuablecollection  of  books and manuscripts in Scotland.  The firstCatalogue, printed in  1692,  contained 3,140  entries.   the contents of the Library, apart from manuscripts, maps andcharts,  and  music,  are  now estimated at  about 700,000volumes and pamphlets.   This great  collection  has   been derived from three sources:   1. Presentations.   2. Purchases by the Faculty.   3. The Faculty&apos;s statutory right,  under  the Copyright        Acts, to  claim a copy  of all  publications in the        United Kingdom.In recent  times acquisitions by purchase have diminished  tovery small proportions, and the great bulk of the Library hasbeen  derived from the third of these sources.  The  most valuable and distinctive possessions  of  the Faculty  have,however,  been  derived from  gifts  and purchases.   For further  historical information, reference is made to aMemorandum prepared by the Convener of the Committeeand submitted to tho Secretary for  Scotland, which is printedin the Appendix  hereto.   It has  been  thought proper  to print this Memorandum in full, in order  that the Facultymay have before it the whole information laid before theSecretary  for Scotland.  There is necessarily some repetitionin the  present Ileport  of  the matter embodied in theMemorandum.   &quot;With the  great growth of  the Library, the administrative and financial  problems entailed by its possession have grownmore and more urgent and embarrassing,  and  have been a cause of unceasing anxiety to  the  Faculty.   So long ago  as1854 Lord President Inglis (then Dean of Faculty) placed on record his opinion that &quot; the present condition of the Libraryis such, from want of adequate revenue, that the question forthe consideration of the  Government  is very urgent.   If noaid can be obtained from the public purse, some other  modemust be immediately adopted for extricating the Institutionfrom its present embarrassment.&quot;
   Owing to the vast accessions received through its copy-right  privilege, the Library has altered entirely in character and scope from what was in contemplation at its foundation.Formed originally  as  a legal and  general  Library  intendedprimarily for the use of the Faculty as a learned profession,such as the Library of  the  Writers to the Signet now is, ithas become a great storehouse of miscellaneous literature andprinted matter, to a large extent quite unrelated to the pro-fessional  requirements or literary  interests  of  the Faculty.While the  resources of the Faculty  would  have  been wellable  to maintain such a Library as  would reasonably have met their own requirements, the change in its character dueto the miscellaneous  accessions of the past century  have rendered the duties attaching to its administration entirelydisproportionate to the financial resources of  a small body of professional men, numbering at the present moment 359.  Itis quite beyond these resources, and is indeed no appropriatepart of  the  work of  such a  body to  perform the task of receiving, binding,  cataloguing,  storing, and making availableto the public a great  collection of miscellaneous books suchas that  which  the  Faculty now  possess.  The  Faeulty&apos;sfunds  have  been  so  largely   absorbed  in  this  taskthat they have been left without means for adequately main-taining and improving their law library by  the purchase of american and  foreign legal works, and extra copies  of lawbooks published in this country.   There is no other instance in the United Kingdom of such  a case.  The  Faculty hasclone  its  best to cope  with the inappropriate task thus laid upon it, and its efforts  have received generous recognition onall hands ;  but  even before the war the Faculty recognised,by the appointment  of a  Committee on 17th January 1912,that the position of matters called for immediate attention.In consequence of  the outbreak of the war, and the absenceof a large number of members of Faculty on service, progress was necessarily suspended.   Now that the  normal life of the faculty has  been  resumed, the situation  with which it isconfronted  is more serious than ever.   The chief embarrass-ment  of the Faculty in the  due  administration of the Librarylias always  been the  question  of  finance.   In  that respect the war  has immensely aggravated  the Faculty&apos;s  problem. The  capital  funds of  the  Faculty have been  depleted; its
income, which fell away owing to the absence of intrants, isonly now tending to recover, and  meantime the necessaryexpenses of administering the library have readied an unprecedented-cedented height.  The remuneration of the stall&apos; has had tobe raised, and the cost of binding is now so prohibitive that large quantities of papers and periodicals have had  to  bestacked away unbound, as  the Curators have found them-selves without the necessary funds.  The ordinary repair of books has been retarded, and a further general deterioration of the Library is inevitable.   Such arrears are cumulative,and  each year  adds  to  the burden.  It  need  scarcely beadded that for many years past no funds have been availablefor purchasing works of historical  and national importance and  interest necessary to  till up  laminae  in the  Faculty&apos;scollection; while, as  already pointed out, the  law libraryhas also suffered from  the Faculty&apos;s  inability  to purchasebooks.   Serious  difficulties  have  also arisen with regard tothe condition of  certain parts ot the  Library premises, andcertain  ventilating  and  heating  work necessary for thepreservation  of  the  books  stored there  cannot   long  be delayed, and will involve considerable expense.   In  these  circumstances  it  is  manifest  that  the Librarycannot- longer be carried  on, even  on the modest standardwhich was all that could be aimed at prior to the war, withouta large  increase of its financial resources, and  the Committeehave addressed  themselves to the  consideration of variousexpedients  for   meeting   the situation  which  has  thusarisen.    Before considering in detail possible augmentations of the faculty&apos;s revenue, it  will be useful to set out  the present financial position.  The existing revenue  of  the Faculty is derived from Annual Kates payable by Members of Faculty,Fees from Intrants, and interest aird Dividends on investedCapital and Feu Duties.  The capital Funds  of the Facultyamounted  at  31st  December 1914  to   27,170.  13s. 8d.Consequent  upon  the War  the  Faculty&apos;s  revenue  fromIntrants diminished so seriously that it became  necessary todraw  largely upon  capital,  and   further   loss  arose  fromdepreciation  on  the  necessary realisation  of  investments.By  31st December  1917  the  Faculty&apos;s  capital  stood at 19,686. Is.  Id, without  allowing for depreciation.   An
appeal for funds issued in 10IS by the Dean of Faculty to members resulted in a substantial  response, and up to  31stDecember 1.919 subscriptions were received to  the amountof  9,198.  Of this sum  3,785  was applied  in meetingrevenue deficiencies,  4,000 was invested in War Bonds, andthe balance of  1,412. 19s. lOd. was retained in hand to meetfurther deficiencies.  The capital funds of the Faculty as at-&quot;list  December  1919, without  allowing  for  depreciation,amounted to   25,099. Os. lid.   Payment  of  subscriptionspromised to the Special fund was in many cases spread  overa period of years, and it  is anticipated further payments tothe amount of  3,500 will  be received during 1920, after which revenue from this source will practically cease.  As  a deficit of  1,200 is anticipated on  the working for the year1920, the  probable  amount  of  the capital funds  at  31stDecember 1920, without allowing for depreciation, will be approximately&apos;  27,339.   These  actual estimated deficits inthe Facultyr&apos;s  revenue have arisen  notwithstanding that theexpenses of administering the Library  have been kept downto the lowest  possible figure, in many cases by the  postpone-ment of  necessary  outlay and  at the cost of diminishedefficiency.   Appended to this Report are two Tables, showing respec-tively the total Income and Expenditure of the  Faculty andthe Expenditure on the Library, under  detailed heads, for theten years 1909 to  1919, for which the Committee are in-debted to the Treasurer of the Faculty.   There  are  three sources from which  additional fundsmight be obtained, viz :     I.  From the Faculty itself          (1) By increasing the Annual Kates.         (2) By increasing the Entry Money.         (3) By increasing both the Annual Rates and the               Entry Money.         (4) By raising an Endowment Fund.    II. From benefactors outside  the Faculty.    Ill, From  the State.
              I. FROM WITHIN  THE FACULTY.   (1) Increase of Annual Hales. The following table shows the income from Annual Kates in the year to Mist December19.19, and the additional revenue which would  result fromdoubling or trebling  these rates on the basis  of  tlie same number of rate-paying Members of Faculty: No.	Class.

As  regards  the  EntryMoney payable, by Intrants,  the Codifying Act of Sederunt,1913, A.  vi. 2, enacts  that  &quot;each  intrant shall pay  two hundred  pounds  to the use and order of  the  Faculty asformerly prescribed.&quot;  The history of this entry money wasinvestigated by the late Mr Grainger Stewart when Treasurerof the Faculty, on a remit from the Dean&apos;s  Council on 27thOctober 1906.  From his Report it appears that the matter has been  the subject of successive Acts of Sederunt from1662 to 1803, when the  present sum was fixed.  The Facultyappears  to  have approached  the  Court  at intervals  for authority to increase the sum exigible, and it is  noteworthythat the shortage of funds  for carrying on the Library isregularly  advanced  by  the  Faculty in justification of  the increases  asked.  The last augmentation in  1803, from  150to  200, was made on  the  representation  of the Dean onbehalf of the Faculty,  that from the great increase  of  ex-penses attending the purchase of books requisite to answer the design and  support  the character of their Library theywere  unable properly to provide for that  expense.  Since1803  the Faculty has more than once considered the question
of raising the entry money.  The last occasion  on which thesubject  was discussed was in  1.839, when a motion to ratifya previous  resolution to raise the entry money to  300 was withdrawn.   In  addition to the entry money fixed  by theAct of Sederunt  there  are certain minor  charges paid byIntrants.   By raising the entry money to  300, and abolish-ing these minor charges,  a net increased payment of over 50 would be obtained from each Intrant.   On the assumption  that the necessary  Act of Sederuntwere  obtained, and that the  entry money  were raised to 300, and the minor charges abolished, an increased revenue of over  500  would be derived from this source on the basisof ten Intrants per annum.  In 1919 nine Intrants presentedpetitions for  admission, and ten admissions took place, thetotal payments received  amounting to  2,259.  On the basissuggested the  figure for  future  income from  this  sourcemight be put at   3,000.   But it is by no means certain thatan average of ten Intrants can lie safely reckoned upon inthe next few  years.  In  the past year the Intrants included a number  whose  admission had  been  delayed  by  their absence on service.   (3) Combined Increase of Animal Bates and Entry Money. The revenue  obtainable from a combined increase is  shownin the following table: 	1910.	Kates doubled and Entry Money raised to  300 on basis of ten Intrants yearly.	Rates trebled and Entry Money raised to  300 on basis of ten Intrants yearly.Annual Rates Entry Money	 555 2,259	 1,110 3,000	 1,665 3,000	 2,814	 4,110	 4,665   (4)  Capital Endowment. The project of raising a capitalendowment from among Members of Faculty was fully con-sidered by the Committee on Faculty Funds appointed on27th February 1918.   It was found to be impracticable.   The  increased revenue accordingly which  the Facultycould obtain  without  going outside its own ranks,  and on
the assumption that the Court would sanction an increaseof the entry money, would thus be about  1,250 or  1,850.Allowing  650 for  income from invested moneys, the total income of the Faculty might thus be raised from, say,  3,500to  4,700 or  5,300.  With these figures may be contrastedthe actual expenditure of  the Faculty in the year 1918-19which amounted  to  4,915,  of which  4,540 was expendedon the Library.  As against  any increase which might thus!be obtained, there must be set the serious arrears in the up-1keep of the Library, which will require  to be  overtaken  inthe immediate  future.  In the matter of binding alone,  atleast  500 is required for this purpose.   The Committee, on  a consideration  of the  foregoingfigures, are satisfied that such increased revenue as might  beobtained from within the  Faculty on the highest  estimate would lie inadequate to enable the Library to be maintained!with efficiency7.  At the most this increase would  do littlejmore  than restore  the position  to what  it was before theWar, if indeed even this could lie  attained.   It would be in ino way commensurate with the necessities  of the case, andwould do little towards improved efficiency of administra-tion.   The Committee, moreover, feel that to call upon theMembers  of Faculty  to contribute  on  a largely increasedscale  to  the expense  of administering  the  Library wouldaccentuate the present anomalous  position, for  a great partof the  expenditure on the Library  is incurred, not in keepingup  the  legal  department,  from  which  members  derivepractical professional advantage, or the literary departments which they utilise, but in cataloguing, binding, and generallymaintaining large quantities of printed matter in which the faculty have little  interest, and which members rarely use,however important and appropriate it  may  be that such Imatter should  be deposited and accessible in Edinburgh  for Ipurposes of record and  research.  The  Committee further!feel that  if the  rates  or  entry   money are increased any Iadditional revenue  so  obtained by  the  Faculty should  be Idevoted  to  the much-needed improvement of their  pro-fessional library and other  Faculty purposes,
      II. FROM BENEFACTORS OUTSIDE  THE FACULTY.   Suggestions  have been  made that assistance might beobtained from endowed  organisations having funds  at their disposal for such purposes, or from private persons of meansinterested in Scotland.   It  may well be  the  case that  theidea  of contributing to the establishment of a great NationalLibrary for Scotland would be attractive to wealthy  andpatriotic Scotsmen, but  the Committee  feel that the  Facultycould not, consistently with its  position, make an appeal insuch  quarters  for  subscriptions to its  own  funds.    TheBodleian Library some years ago issued a general appeal forfunds with some success, but  the Faculty is not in a com-parable position.  The Committee are of opinion that if  anyfunds are to be looked for from  such sources, it is an  indis-pensahle preliminary that the Faculty  should be prepared toplace the Library on an entirely new  footing.   A  ScottishLibrary, recognised and   supported by the  State and admin-istered  as  a national institution, might  well  attract bene-factions from the general public, but a library which is theprivate  property of a  professional body cannot reasonably expect  to  do  so.  The Committee therefore  feel  that thej possibility  of  obtaining funds  from  this  suggested sourcedepends on the decision which the Faculty reaches as  to its general future  policy, in relation to the Library with which the concluding part of this Report deals.                  III.  FROM  THE STATE.   The  suggestion that aid should be  obtained from  theIState is no new one.   The  Faculty has time  and again, ofjtheir own motion or prompted by movements from without,[considered the question.  The history of the Faculty&apos;s efforts n this direction is not encouraging.   Two difficulties  have ilways been  encountered.   In the first place, the  Treasuryllias exhibited the.greatest reluctance to make any grant, andJin the present national stringency this attitude is not  likelypo be relaxed.  In the second  place, the Faculty has hitherto   asking assistance, done so on the footing that the Libraryfcraat remain the private property  of the  Faculty.   The pmniittee are of  opinion that  no  scheme for obtaining llovernment  aid has any prospect  of success which  does not
recognise that in return for a grant some form of reconstitu-tion of  the  Library,  so  as to  admit  of  public  representa-tion in  its management, is essential.   Such reconstitutionmight take many forms.   It is  the opinion of the Committeethat a scheme for the  conversion  of  the general Libraryinto a national institution,  and  its future administration bya Board constituted on  the analogy of the  Trustees of theBritish Museum, would afford the most satisfactory solution,but such a scheme would necessarily involve much  consider-1ation, and would require to contain adequate safeguards  for jthe interests of the Faculty.    The Committee have been in correspondence  with tho&apos;Secretary for Scotland, and  now  with his permission lay beforethe  Faculty the  correspondence which has passed  on thesubject (see  Appendix).  It is manifest that, if  the Facultydesire  to proceed  on the lines  of  a national scheme, itwill be necessary  now  to formulate  definite proposals  for submission to the  Government.  Hitherto the  Faculty hasbeen reluctant to  take  any open  steps  in the matter  o(such a scheme,  and  has desired  to  avoid all  publicity.This  has   embarrassed   the  conduct  of  inquiries  and negotiation.   The Committee are of opinion that the Facultymust now decide whether to leave matters in their present unsatisfactory state, and to postpone indefinitely the  settingof their house in  order, or to  come openly forward as  the promoters of a definite scheme  for the reconstitution of  the library. The Committee are alive to the gravity of this step,and they recognise that in certain aspects it  may be distaste-ful to the Faculty as a departure from their traditional viewson  the subject.   It  is  because  matters have  reached thisstage that the Committee regard it as incumbent upon  themto proceed no further without the  express  sanction of  the faculty and its full realisation  of the position.   It  is part of the  remit to the Committee  that they should, after  inquiry and investigation, formulate proposals for  submission to  the faculty.   But the Committee  have  found, as  their corre-spondence with the  Secretary for  Scotland indicates,  thattheir remit  has involved them  in a vicious circle, for in  theabsence  of  any definite scheme  they have been  unable tomake   further  progress  with  their  task.    The  Com-mittee  accordingly find themselves under  the  necessity of
making the present interim Report,  They do not  feel it tobe within their province to make a  specific recommendation to the &quot;Faculty as to whether it should or should not  commititself to  the promotion of a  national scheme.  They have in this Report  submitted to  the  Faculty the  materials for coming  to a  decision upon the question.  But if  the faculty resolve upon this step,  then  the  Committee  suggestthai it  bo remitted to them now to  frame for the consider-ation of the Faculty a definite scheme for tlie constitution ofa  national library,  containing, as  would  lie   appropriate,adequate safeguards for the interests of the Faculty.

ADVOCATES&apos; LIBRARY,                                 EDINBURGH, 31-st March 1919.j  MY  DEAR SECRETARY  FOB  SCOTLAND,                    The Advocates Library.     Keferririg to the interview which you were good enough  to accord, me, on the 14th  of  this  month, I  now fulfil my  promise  to send you  a  Memorandum describing, with  such  brevity as the subject permits, the position  in which the  Advocates&apos; Library now finds  itself.     As you are no doubt aware,  a previous Committee of the  Faculty  of Advocates  was in  communication with  thej  Scottish  Office on the subject in 1914, and your predecessor,  Mr  M&apos;Kinnon Wood, on 19th January of that year, received  a deputation, which explained to him fully the then existing  state of  matters.  Owing to the outbreak of the war the  matter was not further  proceeded with, but, as  you will see  from the accompanying Memorandum, the problem has  since  become much more acute.      I  venture  to  think  that the case  for  Government  assistance, having  regard to   the treatment of  England,  Wales,  and  Ireland, is an exceedingly  strong one.  The  problem  is no new one.  So  long ago as 1854 Lord President  Inglis, then Dean  of  Faculty, placed on record  his opinion  that &quot;the present condition of the Library is such,  from  want of  adequate revenue,  that the question for the con-  sideration of the Government is very urgent.   If no  aid can  be obtained from the public  purse, some other mode must be  immediately adopted for extricating the Institution from itsj  present  embarrassment.&quot;   In  the  half-century and  more
which  has  since elapsed, the situation, I need  scarcely say,has become much more serious.   The Committee of the  Faculty, appointed on the 3rd ofthis month, has  been charged with the duty of consideringand reporting to the Faculty  &quot;on the present and future position of the Advocates&apos; Library, with special reference tothe project of the institution of a National  Library for Scot-land, with power to confer with tlie appropriate GovernmentDepartments, and to make such other inquiry and investiga-tion as the Committee may deem  necessary to  enable  it to formulate proposals for  submission to the Faculty.&quot;   Inpursuance of this remit, the Committee have requested me,as Convener, to  approach you with a view to ascertaining, inthe event of the  Faculty agreeing to co-operate in the institu-tion of a National  library, involving a transference underappropriate conditions of the property and  administration ofthe Faculty&apos;s general collection of  books and manuscripts toa representative  Scottish Board :    (1) Whether the Government would be  prepared to make         an adequate grant from  public money to  such a         Board towards the future upkeep  of the Library ;    (2) Whether, failing a grant  of public  money,  if funds         were otherwise obtainable, the Government would         look with  favour upon a scheme for the  conversion         of the  Advocates&apos; Library into a  National Scottish         Library under a  representative Board, and would         afford  such assistance as  may be  necessary in the         matter of  obtaining an Act of  Parliament or Boyal         Charter, provided the scheme to be formulated         were such as to commend itself to the Government.   -May I express the hope that, in your combined  capacity as a member of Faculty  and as  the Minister  representingthe interests of Scotland in the Government,  you  may seeyour way to assist the Committee in the task which has been committed to them ?

MY DEAR macmillan,           I have now been able to study the memorandum which  you  recently  sent  me  regarding  the  Advocates&apos;Library.  I  am very much interested in the proposals putforward, and view with  much sympathy the suggestion thatthe time has come when a National Library, based upon thecollection built up over a long series of years by the  Facultyof Advocates, should be established for Scotland.   The arguments  contained in your Memorandum are veryconvincing to my mind, and I am giving careful considerationto the  question of what is the best method  of advancing theends that  you have in  view.   It will, of course, be  necessary for me to consult with mycolleagues in the Government.  I feel that if, in approachingthem, I am  entitled to say that my brethren of the  Facultyare prepared to subordinate their  personal  rights  in the library to  the National and  general interests, I shall  goarmed  with a very powerful  weapon, j                    Yours  sincerely,                                   ROBERT  MUNRO.H.  P. MACMILLAN,  Esq., K.C.                           17which the Committee  is considering is  one which, if carriedout, would be  of  inestimable  importance to  the cause ofeducation and literature in  Scotland.                  I am,                          Yours  very truly,                                 II.  P.  MACM1LLAN.The Right Hun.

      3. MR MACMILLAV  TO THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND.                                    A DVOCATKS&apos;  LIBRA RY,                                 EcuNBURiin, 21st MAY 19]&apos;.).MY nBAR SECRETARY VUR SCOTLAND,                    THE  ADVOCATES&apos; LIBRARY.   My  Committee  is much indebted to  you for  the sym-pathetic reception wliich you have  given to my letter of31st March and the Memorandum  on  the position of the advocates&apos;  Library which accompanied  it.  We  recognisethat the matter is one which requires consideration,  and upon which it will be appropriate to  consult your colleagues in the Government.   I should like to make it clear at this stage that my Com-mittee has no  executive powers.  The task committed to usis to investigate the various possible solutions of the presentcritical situation in order to enable us to formulate proposalsfor submission to  the Faculty.  One  of  these possible solu-tions  is  that  the Library  should  become a  State-aidedinstitution,  with the necessary consequential alterations inits constitution and administration.   To enable us to reporton  this  project  to the Faculty,  my  Connuittee&apos;s presentdesire is to ascertain whether, in the event of the Facultysubmitting  a scheme such  as  to commend  itself to  theGovernment, there is a  reasonable prospect of  financial aidbeing forthcoming  in the shape  of a Government grant onthe lines of the existing  English, Welsh, and Irish grants.   With  reference to   the  concluding  paragraph  of  your letter of the 9th  curt.,  we recognise that a nationalisationscheme would involve the transference of the property of thegeneral  library to a representative public body.  The Facultywould naturally expect to obtain adequate representation onthis  governing  body, and, in  the  case  at least of existing members  who  have  paid  substantial contributions to the library on their admission to the Bar. the retention of theirborrowing rights, as in the case of the Irish National Library(see  40  &amp;  4A Viet. eh. cexxxiv.).   It would probably also be proper to except from this transfer the purely technical and professional portion of the Library, in order to continue thefacilities which the Court  and the Bar  at present enjoy for
the conduct of legal business.  Apart from  these  reserva-tions, and the necessary adjustment of details,  the scheme would  in effect amount to an unqualified gift to the nationof a great collection of books and manuscripts of  inestimablevalue.   As the situation is one of  some urgency, my Committeeis anxious to present an interim report at as early a date aspossible,  and  I venture to hope that,  with  the  informationnow  afforded, you may be in a position to elicit some indica-tion from the Government as to their attitude in the matter for our guidance.   I  may add that the warmest  expressions of sympathyhave been received from  a  number of prominent Scotsmenwhose views have  been  informally obtained.   It may suffice to quote a passage  from a private letter  from Mr A. J.Balfour, who writes : &quot; We owe an immense debt of graf -tude to the Faculty of  Advocates;  but it is  asking a greatdeal  to expect their efforts to be maintained, and it is quiteunreasonable to expect them to be increased.   Under thesecircumstances  I welcome any plan which  would  make thefuture growth  and management of the  Library worthy of thegreat tradition  of  liberal management  which  we  owe tothe Faculty of Advocates.&quot;              I  am,                      Yours  sincerely,                                  II.

                    APPENDIX  II.    MEMORANDUM REGARDING THE ADVOCATES&apos; LIBRARY,                       EDINBURGH.   The Faculty of Advocates at a recent meeting  appointed a Committee to consider and report on the present and future position of the Advocates&apos; Library, witli special reference tothe project  of  the  institution of a  National Library forScotland,   The project  referred to is  one which has  in past yearsfrequently been  tlie  subject of public discussion, and hasengaged the attention of many prominent persons  interestedin Scottish literary and scientific institutions.   It is a remarkable fact  that whereas in  England, Wales,and Ireland there is  in each case a  great National Libraryin receipt of large grants of public money, there is in Scot-land no similarly supported institution.  Apart  from  theBritish  Museum, which may be said to stand  by itself, theNational  Library of Wales, which  was instituted  only in1908, receives, according to the Civil Service Estimates forthe year to 31st  March 1919, a grant  of  3,200, while theNational Library of Ireland, which is also of modern institu-tion, receives a grant of  3,540 for salaries and  900 towardsthe purchase of  books.  Both  of these  Libraries  have also received large capital grants.   The explanation of this state of matters as regards Scot-land is probably to be found in the fact  of the existence in   I am now clearly of opinion that, in order to carry the pro-posal further with my colleagues, it is essential that I shouldhave a definite scheme for the administration of the Library,presumably on the lines indicated in the  third paragraph ofyour letter of 21st May last, submitted to me.   Perhaps you will  be  good  enough  to  confer  with the faculty, and  to  inform me whether they  aro  disposed  tofurnish me with such a scheme.                      Yours sincerely,                                   ROBERT  MUNRO.  H. P.  macmillan, Esq., ICC.
Edinburgh  of the Advocates&apos; Library, which, although theprivate property of the Scottish Bar, and entirely supportedhitherto  out of their private funds, has to a large extentfulfilled for the public of Scotland  the part of a NationalLibrary, and  has, in  recognition  of  this fact, enjoyed the privilege under the Copyright Acts of being entitled to claima free copy of every book published in this  country.   The history  of  the Advocates&apos; Library may be briefly summarised.   The first formal  step  towards  the  foundation of the library was  taken on 8th July 1680, when the Faculty ofAdvocates passed a  resolution on the subject.   The project was  zealously promoted by  the  Faculty, and rapidly tookpractical shape  under the stimulating influence of Sir GeorgeMackenzie, then Dean of Faculty  and Lord Advocate, who isjustly entitled to be described as the founder of the Library.From  the  outset  the movement had the approval of the judges of the Court of Session, who, in an  Act  of Sederuntof 18th January 1684, placed on record their approval of the library &quot; as a thing useful and expedient for  the College ofJustice and profitable for the whole  nation.&quot;   Premises hadmeantime been rented in the  Parliament Close in November1682, and a formal inauguration ceremony took place on 1stMarch 1689.   By the  Act of  Sederunt above mentioned  the  Courtauthorised  the  exaction  from Intrants to the  Faculty ofcertain dues to  provide funds for  the Library, and these duesas altered from time to time,  have all along formed the chiefsource of the revenue of the Library.   In the early years of the Library extensive purchases of books were made, and many valuable donations were received.The first catalogue, printed in 1692, contained no fewer than 3,140  entries,  the  total  value  being  then  estimated at  14,400. 19s. 4d. Scots, say  1,200 sterling.   While  the  Library owed  its inception  to  a  body  of practising  lawyers and its primary  object was to meet the professional requirements of  the  Scottish  Bar, the scope  of the Library  was in no  way restricted  to legal literature. From the outset it was the ambition of the Faculty, who, as i body, have always been distinguished for their interest in
literature, that  their  Library  should form  a collection of books in every department of scholarship.   In  the year 1709 the Copyright Act of  Queen  Anne(8 Anne,  c. 19) conferred upon the  Library the right to claim a copy of every book entered at Stationers&apos; Hall.  Thisprivilege has been continued  by all subsequent  CopyrightActs, and was  recently  reaffirmed in the  Copyright Act,1911, section 15(2).   It now applies to every book published in the United Kingdom.   The Library, as at the present date, thus consists of       (1) Manuscripts and books presented to the  Library;      (2) Manuscripts and books purchased by the Faculty;      (3) Books, maps, charts, and music obtained under the           Copyright Acts.While the greatest actual number  of books  has been  addedto the  Library  from the third of these sources, the  most valuable and distinctive possessions of the Faculty have been derived from gifts or purchases.   The collection of manu-scripts and State papers relating to the history of Scotland isunique, and  of priceless value.  There are also many classicaland  other literary  manuscripts of  great interest and ini-portance.   The contents  of  the  Library  are  at  present estimated at  700,000 volumes,  exclusive  of manuscripts,maps and charts  and music.   The Library is housed in buildings adjoining  and  underthe same  roof as  the Court of Session.   The premises havebeen acquired,  and are held by the Faculty under varioustitles which  it  is unnecessary  here to  detail.  In 1896 agrant of  5,000 was made by the Treasury (as authorised bythe  Court of  Session Consignations  (Scotland)  Act,  1895,section 15), in aid of the erection  of an extension  of the library, which &quot;was completed in  1901.   The total expenditure by the  Faculty out of  their ownfunds, and contributions in connection with the provision andfitting-up of their Library premises, the purchase and  bind-ng of  manuscripts and  books, and  the maintenance and administration  of the Library  since  its inception, exceeds 250,000.   Although the  Advocates&apos; Library has always been theprivate property of the Faculty, and has been maintained and
23461 administered  entirely from  their private funds, the.Faculty have recognised that the possession of this great collection of  national  literature and the enjoyment of the  statutory copyright privilege impose upon them  an honourable obliga- tion towards the public of Scotland and the world of scholar- ship  in  general, and  it has been the settled policy of the Faculty  throughout to admit to the use of tlie Library all members of the public who are desirous  of  consulting books for  any  reasonable purpose.   This aspect  of the  Library cannot be better described than in the words of Mr Solicitor- General  Maitland (afterwards Lord Barcaple) in the evidence given by him  in 1849 before  a Select  Committee  of the House of  Commons  on Public Libraries: &quot; Though  the Library is the property of the Advocates,  practically it is the property of  the public, for there  is no  library  in  Great Britain  where the  access given to the public generally is more liberal than in the Advocates&apos; Library.&quot;  Testimony has been borne by Thomas Carlyle to the benefits thus conferred upon the  public  by  the  Advocates&apos;  Library in  a  letter addressed by -him to Mr Hubert Horn, afterwards Dean of Faculty,  on 3rd April 1874, in which  the following passage occurs: &quot; It is incomparably the best  of all the Libraries we have in Scotland, and in fact the  only  Library worth calling , such, to  which literary aspirants and known literary people, except connected with Colleges, have  any  practical  admit- tance an Institution which may to Scotland, in that respect, he called invaluable.   My clear testimony therefore is, that essentially  it belongs to Scotland  at  large such  the liberal practice  of  the Honourable  Faculty  whose  property it especially is, and that it fairly deserves  all  reasonable help and support from whatever calls itself a Government in that country.&quot;  Many other  eminent men who  have  used  the Library have expressed a similar sense  of indebtedness.   The opening of a spacious new Fieferonce Eoom in  1908 has greatly added  to the convenience  of members  of  the public using the Library.   Such  being the record of the Faculty of Advocates in the past in the matter of maintaining in the capital of Scotland a great Library which may fairly be  regarded as national in character, it has long been felt that the unaided resources ofa comparatively small body of professional men of limited
moans, consisting at present of 365 members in all, are, with every year, becoming more and more inadequate to discharge the task of efficiently administering a great  and growinginstitution of this character.  This had been  fully realisedbefore the war,  but  the  position  lias since been renderedmuch  more  difficult  by  the  diminution of  the Faculty&apos;sfunds and the practical disappearance  of their  income fromIntrants during the war.   At  31st  December 1913, the endof the last complete financial yrear before tho war, the total capital funds of  the Faculty amounted to  26,869, and their income  for the year 1913 amounted  to  4,823 for all pur-poses.   After the  outbreak of war  the number of Intrantsrapidly  decreased, and finally  ceased  altogether.  The chiefsource of the Faculty&apos;s revenue having thus come to an end,inroads had to be made upon the  Facnlty&apos;s  capital, which  atthe same time showed a serious decline in value owing to the depreciation of investments.  The situation became so grave,that an appeal was issued in  the name  of the Dean  ofFaculty in July 1918 to the members  of the  Bar, which  rc-resulted by 31st &quot;December  1918 in voluntary subscriptions  tothe amount of  6,515, and promises of further assistance.This sum, however, did not suffice to restore the capital  toits pre-war figure,  and at 31st December  1918  the capitalfund stood at  23,813,  without  allowing  for depreciation.The  total income for  all purposes for 1918 was  1,235,resulting in a deficit for the year of   2,388.   Even  assuming  that  the  number of  Intrants  may ultimately tend to return  to the  pre-war figure, it is mani-fest that the financial prospects of the Faculty are now suchas to render the consideration of the future of the Library amore urgent question than ever.   Every year brings a  largeaccession of new books to the  Library under the CopyrightActs, and from  other sources, the  mere  cataloguing  and arranging of which involves much labour, and largely occupiesthe time of the restricted staff which the Faculty are  able  to employ.  The resources of  the Scottish Bar are unequal  to continuing the Library indefinitely even on its present foot-ing, in view of its  annual growth and the increase of expendi-ture, not only in  the remuneration  of  the  staff, but  also  inthe cost of binding and materials generally.   Still less arethe Faculty able  to face  the expenditure necessary for the
efficient administration, in accordance  with modern librarystandards, of a great national collection of  manuscripts andbooks, and for the provision of the facilities for research andstudy, which are appropriate in the case of such an institu-tion, and  which  aro  essential  if  the  Library  is  to  serveeffectively the purposes  of  public utility which a nationallibrary of reference is now expected to serve.   The Faculty arc not in a position to purchase to any extent the numerous foreign and American works which are requiredfor the complete equipment of a great reference Library, orto take advantage of opportunities  arising for adding bypurchase to their collection of manuscripts and early printedbooks,  and  otherwise  filling up  lacunae  in their collection.Judicious  expenditure  in the  matter  of  cataloguing andindexing would greatly increase tho usefulness of the Library.A large outlay ou repairs is urgently necessary, in order to preserve  the  older collections from  deterioration, and it isdesirable that facilities should be provided for  the exhibitionto the public of the Library&apos;s numerous historical treasures.    It may be the case that, regarded from the  national pointof view, tlie Library  has to some  extent suffered  from thefact of  its being known  to  be  the property and under themanagement of a private  corporation.  It has  not  attractedfrom the public benefactions in the form  of bequests or giftsjeither  of  books  or  money, such  as a  National  ScottishLibrary in  the  capital  of Scotland  might have reasonablyexpected  to attract.   For  example, the well-known  Glen-riddell Burns Manuscripts were in 1914 placed in the  handsof Lord Ftosebery and others  in trust  for &quot; the people of Scot-land &quot; by  their owner, Mr John Gribbel, &quot; the trust to con-tinue upon the lines set forth until a National  Library shallbe  established in  Scotland, whereupon such  Library, when and where established, shall  become ultimate and permanenttrustee of the gift.&quot;   Again,  a valuable collection of ScottishMusic, which would  naturally have  found its  resting placein a Scottish National  Library, was last  year temporarilyentrusted  by the donor  to  the  British  Museum.  The lastletter  of  Mary  Queen  of Scots, recently purchased for theScottish  nation, was  in  March  of  this year placed on loanwith the  Royal  Scottish Museum,  Edinburgh, pending  adecision as to its  final destination,
   It is in these circumstances that the  Committee of the faculty have  turned their  attention, as instructed by theirremit, to a fresh consideration of the project of  the iustitu-tion of a National Library in Edinburgh on the  lines of thegreat National  Libraries in other capital cities.   The projectis  an  inspiring  one, and  the  Committee  are  engaged  inascertaining informally to what extent the  co-operation of theGovernment, of eminent Scottish publio men, and possibly ofprivate benefactors can  be enlisted.  It is manifest that ifScotland is to have a great National  Library worthy of the traditions and the  eminence  in  scholarship,  science, andaffairs  of  the  Scottish  nation, the  Advocates&apos; Library forms the necessary  foundation  for any such  institution, for italready possesses the only collection of  Scottish  literary andhistorical documents and works  approaching to completeness.Its treasures are  many  of them  unique  and priceless.   It  is recognised  that if publio  funds  or private  bene-factions are to  be obtained, a reconstitution of the Advocates&apos;Library will be essential.  If sufficient  funds are made avail-able, the Committee believe that no difficulty need be antici-pated in  the creation of a Board, analogous to the Trustees ofthe British Museum, consisting of Scottish  public men  ofdistinction,  as well  as  representatives of  the Faculty ofAdvocates, which would command  public  confidence, and towhich  the property and administration of  the Library mightunder appropriate conditions be transferred.

SECOND   INTERIM   REPORT                       or THE  COMMITTEE  OF  THE  FACULTY  OF                 ADVOCATES                        ox       THE  ADVOCATES&apos; LIBRARY                    Committee-MB FLEMING, K.C.

PATRICK.MR COWAN, K.C.               MR MACMILLAN, Convener.THE Committee&apos;s first  Interim Report of 10th March 1920was duly submitted to a meeting of the Faculty, held on20th March  1920, when  the following Resolution wasadopted:    &quot; That the Faculty approve of the Interim Report of  the       Committee on the  Library, and remit to  the Com-       mittee to frame for  the consideration of the Faculty       a definite  scheme  for  the reconstitution  of  the       library on  a  national basis, with adequate safe-       guards for the interests of the Faculty, with an       instruction to the  Committee to  report  to  the       Faculty, after consultation with  the Keeper  of       the Library, what manuscripts have been  purchased       with Faculty funds since 1st January 1800, their       approximate cost, and their present value.&quot;
   The meeting also authorised the Committee to add to itsnumbers, and on the subsequent invitation of the Committeethe following  Members of Faculty agreed  to act, viz.:  MrSandeman, K.C.;  Mr Cowan, K.C., Treasurer oE the Faculty;Mr .1). P. Fleming;  and Mr J. M. Hunter.    In pursuance of the  Resolution above quoted, the Coni-mittee has addressed itself to  the preparation of a Schemefor the reconstitution of the Library  on  a national basis.Several meetings  were   held,  and the various  practicalquestions  arising were fully discussed.   As the  outcome ofits deliberations,  the Committee now begs to submit for  theconsideration  of  the &quot;Faculty the  Draft Scheme  which  is appended to the present Report.    In submitting this Scheme the Committee desires to offer a few explanatory observations.    1.  The first  question naturally arising is whether  theentire contents of  the Library  should  be transferred to thenew administrative body proposed to  be constituted.  TheCommittee is  unanimously of opinion that the Faculty should reserve the Law Library as  its own exclusive property.   Inno other way  can the professional requirements of Membersof Faculty, and the service of law books  for use in the Courts,be satisfactorily safeguarded, particularly in view of  thepossibility of  the  general  library being removed  at some future  date to premises  not connected with the parliament house.  Tho  Law Library is in an exceptional position.   Ithas always been managed separately from the general library,has a special catalogue of its own, and  has also its own staff.A considerable proportion of its contents has been purchasedwith the Faculty&apos;s  funds.  It is thought that the exceptionof the Faculty&apos;s  professional  library  from  the proposed transfer&apos; will  not  in any material way derogate from thevalue or utility  of the  gift which the Faculty  proposes  tomake to the  nation, or prejudice the reconstitution on anational basis of the general  library which contains all themanuscripts and books  of national interest and importance, Arrangements can readily be made by appropriate regula-
tions for the consultation by the public of books in the LawLibrary, in continuance of the system at present in operation.The Committee lias had before it the precedent of the estab-lishment of the Irish National Library in Dublin in 1877,which originated in the transfer to the Crown of the libraryof the  Royal  Dublin  Society.   In that case the Societyreserved to itself  its  collection of  scientific  serials  andtransactions and  other publications  of learned societies, aswell as certain works of art.  (See  The Dublin Science  andArt Museum Act, 1877, 40 &amp; 41  Viet. ch. cexxxiv., section 4;also  A  History of llic Royal Dublin Society,  by Henry F.Berry.   London: Longmans, Green, &amp; Co., 1915.  Pp.181-2,291-304, 353-4.)  The Committee entertains the hope thatthe Faculty,  when  disembarrassed  of  the present  heavycharge upon its resources,  occasioned  by the  maintenanceof the  general library, may  be  able to  improve greatly its existing law library, and to afford much greater facilities to members of Faculty  for the consultation of law books.  It isno exaggeration to state that the Faculty&apos;s law library hasin the past been  starved in the  interests of the generallibrary.   Apart from law books  properly so  called,  the Facultymight  desire to retain also  a few manuscripts and volumespossessing a special professional or personal interest  to the faculty, and it is proposed  that  provision should be madefor this.  Any ordinary works  of reference, such as direc-tories, dictionaries, and the like, which it is desirable to have as part of the equipment  of tlie Law  Library, the Facultywill  be in a position  to provide  for themselves.   2. It is part of  the  Scheme that there should  be trans-ferrecl to the proposed new governing body the privilege atpresent enjoyed by the Faculty, under statute, of  claiming acopy of every book published in the  United Kingdom.  (SeeThe  Copyright Act, 1911, section 15.)  The Committee has considered bow this could best  be reconciled with the retention-tion by the Faculty of its Law  Library, and has reached theconclusion that in any Act of Parliament which may be
passed for effectuating the Scheme, provision should be madefor the handing over to the Faculty of all law books receivedby the  new  body under the copyright privilege, such booksto become the property of the  Faculty.   This should  notoccasion any serious  practical  difficulty.   An  analogy isafforded  by  the  Squire  Law  library at  Cambridge.  TheUniversity of  Cambridge,  like  the  Faculty of  Advocates,enjoys the copyright privilege, and, by  an arrangement, alllaw books received are deposited in the Squire Law Library,which is housed in a separate building.  These law books, nodoubt, remain  the property of  the  University,  but there seems no reason wdiy, in the case of the Faculty of Advocates,the law books received should not be handed over in property to the Faculty.  The  determination  of  the books properlyfalling  within  the category  of  law  books can be  left to appropriate officials.    3. The Committee  has specially considered the questionof the retention by Members of Faculty of their presentborrowing facilities as regards the genei-al library.  In thecase of  the  transfer of the Royal Dublin Society&apos;s  libraryexisting members onhy of  the Society retained their borrow-ing privileges.   There are no doubt difficulties in reconciling the institution  of  a national library7 with the continuance of extensive borrowing privileges on  the part of the membersof a, special body, but in view of  the  peculiar relationship ofthe  Faculty7  to the library, and the magnitude of the giftproposed  to  be made to the  nation  without any pecuniaryconsideration, the Committee lias  decided&apos;that the scheme should  provide for the continuance  of  borrowing privilegeson the  part of members  of  Faculty  present and future.Whether the  existing privileges should  be restricted ormodified may be considered later.  Apart from the questionof  borrowing books, the  Committee  regard it as important that books, maps, etc., in the general  library should continueto be available to members of Faculty and to the Court as atpresent.    4. The question of the allocation as  between the Facultyand the new governing body of  the  premises in  which  the
existing library is housed  is one of considerable  difficulty.The Committee is of opinion that the Faculty should in any event retain the Law Room, the  Corridor, and  all  theirpresent accommodation on the Corridor floor, and that pro-vision should be made either in the  present  buildings,  or inany extension, thereof, for  the Faculty&apos;s requirements in thematter of additional accommodation for consulting rooms andother  professional  purposes.  The remainder of the librarypremises should be  transferred to and vested in  the newgoverning body, but  so long only as they continue to occupythem for the purposes of  the proposed National Library, andin the  event of the  National  Library  being removed else-where, should  revert to the  Faculty.   The  titles to thepremises at present  occupied  by the Library are, as regardspart of the buildings, in a state of some uncertainty.   Theywere the  subject of a Report by the  Faculty&apos;s agent, sir george Paul, D.K.S., dated 19th October 1906, supplemented by a letter from Sir George Paul  to Mr James Adam, thenTreasurer  of the Faculty, dated 5th January 1912.  these documents are in the hands of the Keeper of the Library,who will make them available to any member of Faculty. Itis  highly desirable that, if  the proposed transfer takes place,advantage should be taken of the  opportunity to have thetitles cleared up in the transferring statute, and the premises,as allocated, vested respectively in  the Faculty and the newgoverning body.    5.  The Committee consider it an indispensable conditionof the proposed transfer that the present Librarian  and staff should, if they so desire, be taken over by the new governing body,  or if  they prefer  not  to  be taken over, should be compensated.    6.  Much importance is attached  by the Committee to thequestion of  the  composition of the new governing  body towhom the- general library would be transferred  on  behalf ofthe nation.  The matter is one -which will necessarily be thesubject of arrangement between the Faculty and the Govern-ment, but  the  Committee are of opinion that a  suitable
model  is  to  be found in  the  Constitution  of  the OfficialTrustees of the British Museum, and that a fixed  and sub-stantial representation should  be accorded to the Faculty.Ex ojjicio representatives  of learned and public bodies  inScotland, suitable nominees of  the Crown and distinguishedScottish  men of letters, would naturally find a place on thegoverning body, and a power to  co-opt  additional  members would probably be of advantage.   It may be mentioned thatthe National  Library of Ireland is administered by a body of trustees,  of  whom four are appointed  by the Crown and eight by  the Royal Dublin Society.   7. It is obvious that at the present stage it is not possibleto do more than suggest the broad outline of a Scheme forthe foundation  of a  Scottish National Library based on the faculty&apos;s existing general library.  Many matters  of  detailwill necessarily come up for consideration should the Schemeproceed,  but  these  will appropriately form  the  subject  ofdiscussion and negotiation with the Government.   8. Should  the Faculty  be pleased  to approve of  theScheme now submitted by the  Committee, with  or withoutmodifications, it will be essential  that  the Committee, ifauthorised to lay it  before the Government, should make itclear that the  carrying of the Scheme  into practical effect will entirely  depend on the  provision of adequate funds bythe Treasury or from other sources.   In this  connection the Committee notes  that, according to  the Civil service estimates for 1919-20, the Irish  National Library receivesan annual grant  of   3,555 for salaries and allowances, withan additional grant of  900 for the purchase of books.   Thegrant to  the  &quot;Welsh  National  Library  for 1919-20 was 8,900.  For  1920-21 the Treasury, recognising the importantwork being clone by the  Welsh National Library, increased its grant  to   12,000,  and this grant is  to be augmented by 1,000 annually  until it reaches  17,000 per  annum.  Itmay also be  noted  that  in July 1920, in  response  to anappeal on  behalf of the Bodleian Library, a donation  of 50,000 was received from a private benefactor.
   0. With regard to the concluding sentence of the presentremit tho Committee has obtained from  the Keeper of the library a Report on the Manuscripts purchased with FacultyFunds since 1st January  1S00.   This is appended  to thepresent Report.   It  may be added that the Faculty, duringthe same  period,  acquired  by purchase printed  books ofconsiderable value, notably the Astorga collection of Spanishbooks.

REPORT BY THE KEEPER OP THE ADVOCATES&apos;  LIBRARY     AS TO  MANUSCRIPTS PURCHASED  SINCE 1800.As  requested  by the  Committee  on the Library, I  have examined the Minutes of the Curators from  1800  onwards.   The only purchases  of  MSS. of  any importance  whichare  noted  in tire Minutes since that date are:    The purchase in 1828 of part of the Wodrow MSS. from       Miss Wodrow for  125.   The purchase in  1831 of three manuscript volumes of       the Corpus Juris and the Decretum for 50 guineas.       There  are the  fine 14th century illuminated Italian       MSS. now marked as Advocates&apos; MSS., 10.1.4 and        10.1.2,   The purchase in 184;! of the Rent Roll of the  Bishopric       of Aberdeen for 71 guineas.   The purchase in  1893 of 23 MSS. at the Phillipps Sale       for  35. 3s.   The purchase iir  1895 of  12 MSS., chiefly topographical       and genealogical, relating to Scotland, at the Phillipps       Sale for  41. 5s.   The purchase in 1898 of 10 MSS., relating to Scotland, at       the Phillipps Sale for  110. 7s. (id.   Au important purchase, which  is not mentioned in theCurators&apos; Minutes, is the purchase  in  1826,  from  MessrsHarding, Lepard, &amp; Co., booksellers, London, for  170, of a fine  collection  of papers of the Elizabethan  period.   These
include  letters (if Queen  Elizabeth, Mary of  Guise, MaryQueen of  Scots, the Regent  Moray, Burleigh,  Walsingham,and other famous personages  of the period.   Another purchase, not mentioned in the Minutes, is thatof General Hutton&apos;s Collections, bought in 1829 for  70.   The  Minutes contain no record of the acquisition of  thecollection  of Icelandic and other Northern MSS., which werebought early in the 19th century.   In view of the present  uncertainty  of  the market forobjects  of this  class,  it is   difficult to  estimate with anyaccuracy the  pecuniary value of these  MSS.  There  can,however, be no doubt that the Elizabethan papers,  and themediaeval MSS. of  the Corpus Juris and the Decretum, areof great value.   The  Minutes vary greatly from time  to time as  regardsthe regularity and completeness with which they have been kept; the modern practice of keeping regular Minutes of allstated meetings only dates from 1866.  1 do not think, how-ever, that further search elsewhere would discover any  otherpurchases of importance during the period dealt with.  Mostof the Faeulty&apos;s purchases of MSS. were made early in thehistory of  the Library.  All the well-known MSS. which havebeen acquired during the past 120 years, such as the MSS.of &quot; Waverley&quot; and of &quot;Marmion,&quot; the &quot; Lyon in Mourning,&quot;the Riddell Papers, the Murray Papers,  and the autographletters of  Boswell, Burns, Ruskin, Stevenson, etc., have beenreceived either by donation or by  bequest.
