[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1922.SECEGRET.CONVERSATION  BETWEEN LORD  CURZON AND  M.  POINCARE  AT        THE QUAI DORSAY ON MONDAY, JANUARY 16,  1922.    M. POINCARE began by saying that he must warn Lord Curzon that he wasnot ready yet to discuss the questions of which Lord Curzon desired to speak.  Hehad not seen papers nor  been in touch with Eastern matters to any considerable extent since the conversation he had had with Lord Curzon in London.  He there-fore wished to excuse himself for being unable  to  give any immediate answer..    Lord Curzon  replied  that he did not wish to embark on any detailed discussion at this stage; that would  not be fair to M. Poincare.  He wished to know, hoAvever,when it would be  convenient to hold the discussion on Near Eastern questions : theTreaty of Sevres, which  had been negotiated at London  and San Remo had been signed but  not ratified.  Every month it had become clearer that it was impossibleto execute it.  The  Turks and Greeks had been  invited to the Supreme Council inMarch last and had declined the propositions then put forward  with a view  to a modification of the  treaty.  They  had preferred  to fight.  Lord Curzon thoughtthat was a mistake.  Then Lord Curzon had come to Paris  last summer  and had met M. Briand and  had proposed the mediation of  the Powers.  The Greek Govern-ment had been asked to  place themselves in the hands of the Powers.  They baddeclined foolishly  again, he thought for, after an initial success, they had been thrown back.  That was  the last stage of united action on the part of the Powers.In the course of the recent autumn, the necessity for fresh action had become moremanifest.  Lord Curzon  had proposed to M. Briand that this action should be intwo stages.  Firstly, there should be conversations  between the Foreign Minsters ofFrance,   Great Britain and  Italy at  Paris  at the earliest time convenient toM. Briand. He thought this should result in common agreement on the terms to beput to the combatants for  the last time after this proposal had been agreed to.  since then His Majesty&apos;s  Government had been a good deal distressed and shocked by theFranklin-Bouillon Agreement.  We had protested and asked for explanations.  the correspondence had  now been published. His Majesty&apos;s Government, however, had always been firmly convinced  that the only way to  reach  a solution was by an absolute understanding between the Allies.   We had accordingly been willing to put the Franklin-Bouillon Agreement  temporarily in the background, and it had beenarranged that a  meeting of  the  three Foreign  Ministers  should take  place inDecember.   Then M.  Briand had  come to  London and the Cannes Conference hadensued.   But  it  had been arranged  that  the Eastern  discussions should followimmediately in Paris.  To facilitate and expedite  this Lord Curzon had drawn upa basis of discussion containing proposals for a solution.   This had been sent to theFrench  and  Italian  Governments.   At  Cannes,  before  M.  Briand&apos;s  resignation,M. Briand had told Lord Curzon that he considered the  document a good basis ofdiscussion, and the Italian Foreign Minister had said the same.  Then came thechange of  Government in France.  Lord Curzon now wished to know the earliest moment when the postponed discussion should take place. He was ready to go to paris at any  time  convenient to M.  Poincare next week,  if necessary.   He had seen the  Marquis della Torretta at Cannes, who also said that he would come on receipt of  a telegram. The matter was urgent; the whole peace of the East wastrembling in the balance.    The  conversations between the three  Foreign Ministers should, he suggested,proceed as follows.   They should go  through the whole  Treaty of Sevres on thebasis  of  his note, deciding what to keep  and  what to eliminate.  The discussion should not end without an agreement between the Allies, and such an agreement should not be difficult. As soon as they had agreed on-the terms to be put to the greeks and Turks,  there should be  a Supreme  Council.   He had  proposed  to688  [7680]
   M. Briand that the final conference should be at Constantinople, where, he thought,   a  solution might be more readily obtainable than in Paris or London where the   Council was beset by deputations and exposed tupress influences. It would moreover   be difficult to get Mustapha Kemal to come from Angora to Paris  or London.   The   conference would not of course decline to hear the Greeks and the Turks.  Both would   have an  opportunity  of submitting their views, but there  must be no line by line   discussion of the new terms.  Both combatants must eventually be told that this was   the treaty on which the Allied Powers were unitedly determined.       This of course raised certain contingencies for which we must be prepared.   The   Greeks might refuse.  He had already tried to meet this  possibility  by seeing the   Greeks both in London and at Cannes.  As a result of these  conversations the Greeks   had placed themselves in the hands of the Powers  and had done so  knowing, the   general substance, though of course not the details, of the terms they would have to   accept.  They knew that they must leave Smyrna and that the Tnracian frontier   would have to be thrown back further from Constantinople.   For this they were,   broadly speaking,  prepared.   A refusal on their part was  less to be contemplated&quot;  than recalcitrance on the part of the Turks.  We must therefore be  prepared for the   course which  the Allies might have to follow in  such a case,  whether it  took the   form of a blockade of the Turkish coast, or of increased facilities or  assistance to   the Greeks.  Failure on the part of the Allies  to impose their decision could only   mean a resumption and continuation of hostilities which it was in the interest of   everyone to avoid.  When therefore the  Foreign  Ministers met they  must decide,   not only on the new terms, but also on their line of action if the terms to be embodied   in the new treaty were refused.      M. Poincare replied that he  would at once  study Lord Curzon&apos;s  memorandum   and send  the observations to  London in writing, for the French Government might  have both observations and objections to formulate.  He wished this exchange of notes  to precede the meeting, and he had already suggested to Mr. Lloyd  George that such  meetings between the statesmen should  only take place when the ground had  been  practically cleared and when they were  sure of  agreement.      Lord  Curzon replied that not much time need be spent on a preliminary exchange-  of notes :  the three Powers were, he believed, already near to agreement.  Moreover,  the meeting contemplated would be a conversation not a conference.   Each repre-  Kentative would be accompanied only by a few experts.  An exchange of notes might  last for weeks.  Meanwhile the situation was serious.  We  were already past mid  January.  Neither side could nor would fight seriously while the theatre of war was  under snow.  But in March or April climatic conditions would again begin to favour  hostilities.  If they broke out again the last chance of a peaceful settlement would  probably  be gone and the Powers  would look extremely foolish.  Previous written  discussion among them was really unnecessary.   They knew each others views.  A  speedy settlement was far more likely if they met  round a table      M. Poincare replied  that he only  knew the outline of the British proposals.  He thought they were unlikely to be acceptable  to  the Turks.  Modifications would  probably be necessary, and the French Government would have  several  observations  to  make and would forward them as soon as possible.   M.  Poincare was prepared  for a conversation, but not for a conference.  And the conversations must not  take  that character later.   Public  opinion in France was at present  strongly opposed to  conferences.  In the last resort he was not opposed to a meeting at Constantinople,  but it must be a meeting of  Foreign Envoys  or Ambassadors,  and not of  Cabinet  Ministers.  It would be difficult for a French Minister to go  there.      Lord  Curzon said  that  he  would, of course, be  happy  to receive any  note  M. Poincare wished to send him.   He had never expected that  his own note would  be  accepted at once and in its entirety.  But when the Allies were agreed there must  be  some means of communicating  the new terms to the  Greeks and Turks on an  occasion when they would both be present.  He agreed that it might be well  that  the Ambassadors or  High  Commissioners at  Constantinople should  start  the  conference, but he  doubted whether they  would eventually  have enough authority  to  carry it through.  After a few weeks the  Greeks, or more probably the Turks,  might prove obstructive and a higher authority would have  to be invoked.   Either  then Cabinet Ministers would have to go to Constantinople or the Turks and Greeks  brought elsewhere.   The High Commissioners alone would probably be insufficient.  History proved this.  The conference at Berlin and every previous  attempt to settle  the Eastern Question were cases in point.  This was a grave crisis, and the leaders  would have to intervene later, if not now.
    M. Poincare  said  that he understood  Lord  Curzon&apos;s proposal to  be  firstconversations between the three Foreign Ministers in Paris, then  the meeting atConstantinople under  the  auspices  of  the  High  Commissioners, and  thirdly, ifnecessary, recourse to their  Governments.   At first sight  he had no objection tosuch a procedure,  but he must say that he would encounter much resistance to  anycoercion.   Public  opinion  in France would not  accept  any such measure as a blockade.   He was, however, very anxious to act with us, and on the informationnow in our possession he was hopeful that we might reach an acceptable result.    Lord Curzon replied that M.  Poincare might  rest assured that His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment  were  equally  unwilling  to fight  the  Turks   for  obvious reasons.M.  Poincare knew our  position in Egypt and India.   We did  not wish  to resumehostilities with a Moslem Power.  But if terms  were again  offered, we must know what he should do if they were again refused.  We need not discuss that in detailnow,  but he would wish  to  know  the earliest date  after the  presentation  ofM.  poincare&apos;s note when the French Government would like the British and italian foreign Ministers  to come to Paris.  He would be willing to  come either  next week,or immediately after the opening of  Parliament  on the 31st  January.  He  did  not wish to press M. Poincare.    But it was a case of the sooner the better,  for  thediscussion had already been postponed from December to the 6th January,  then tothe 9th January, then to the 12th.   It was now the 16th.  We were going on towardsFebruary, and every week  counted.    M. Poincare stated that he would examine  the possibility of a meeting next week, or if not soon after  the  31st January.   But he foresaw grave difficulties.He had thought of these conversations only as an offer of intervention, not of coerciveaction.  On that he must make all reservations.  He was ready to mediate, but he must first sound his Parliament.  He was sure that neither  Chamber would accept any coercion.  There was no sympathy anywhere in France for  Greece.  If Turkeyrefused, coercion would be against her and to the profit of Greece.  French publicopinion would not  accept that.    Lord Curzon thought that M. Poincare had not quite realised the dimensions ofthe problem.   It was not a case of mediation, but  of  drawing up a new  Treaty of sevres.  Only the  Powers could do that.  Whatever  the objections of the FrenchParliament or public might  be there  must be  a Supreme Council for the final stage of the new treaty.    M, Poincare replied that the matter would be less difficult if we were acting inthe interests of Great Britain, France and Italy; but this was  not now the case.  our action would be in the interests of the Greeks. Anything done for  the Greeks wouldbe ill-received in France, where they were no longer regarded as Allies, but almost asenemies.   King Constantine and M.  Gounaris were very unpopular.  The FrenchGovernment were  willing  to  attempt a  compromise, but  there would be muchopposition if we seemed to try to impose our  will upon the Turks in the interests ofthe Greeks.  Smyrna and Thrace presented great difficulties which must be looked into very closely or we should encounter strong Turkish opposition.    Lord  Curzon  replied  that we  also  had  no   particular affection   for King Constantine or M.  Gounaris. It was, however, not with the  Greeks  that we had tomake peace, but with the Turks. This was the one treaty which yet remained to be concluded.   The French Government bad frequently asked  us  to  assist them  in &apos;enforcing the Treaty of Versailles, and had actually taken coercive action themselves.There could surely  not be a difference  between  the cases of Germany and Turkey.   Ifyou make a treaty, you should be prepared to enforce it.    M. Poincare replied that when once a treaty was signed he would be preparedfor sanctions if the Turks failed to execute it.  But he did not contemplate imposing a treaty on the Turks, as Allied- interests were not at stake. The truth was, this was acase of defending the Greeks against the Turks.  He would be-willing to  sound  thelatter to see what they would accept if we so desired.    Lord Curzon replied that he would not ask M. Poincare to take any such actionsince it would probably only result- in  the putting  forward of impossible claims.    M. Poincare said that it could be done unofficially. As a matter of fact he hadalready seen the Angoran representative.  We could  not proceed blindly; Smyrnawas the most difficult point.  The Turks  were  convinced they  would win all they wanted in the spring.
    Lord Curzon requested M. Poincare to read his Smyrna proposals.    M. Poincare replied that he would do so at once.    The conversation then passed to Tangier.    Lord Curzon said that when he was at Cannes, and was discussing the questionof the Pact with M. Briand, he had desired to clear the ground of other outstandingand troublesome questions.  One of them was Tangier.  For a long time past abortiveendeavours had been made to reach an agreement.  Of the three Powers concerned,France and Spain had, no doubt,  greater interests, but, on historic and strategicgrounds, which he need not now enumerate in detail, British interests were also mostimportant.   When M. Millerand was  in London in March 1920, he had asked lord curzon to  arrange a discussion between themselves and the Spanish Ambassador.M. Millerand had, however, been recalled to  Paris, and the impending conferencedid not materialise. Later, the French Government had declared that the conferencemust meet  in Paris.  The Spanish Government, however, would not go to Paris,while the French Government would not go to Madrid.  Lord Curzon had accordinglyagain suggested a conference a irois in London.  It had never taken place,  and thesituation was daily becoming more acute.  There had been difficulties over the port,the fisheries and other matters.  Both  the Spanish and the French Governments had suggested  to him that  a  separate  arrangement should be made with them respec-tively, but he had always declined these overtures  and had firmly maintained  thatthe discussion and the arrangement must be tripartite.  His Majesty&apos;s government wished to revert to the pre-war position. In 1914 a statute of Tangier had been drawn up, but fell through on  account of the outbreak of war and the failure of theSpanish Government to agree.   He did not want to press M. Poincare unduly at themoment, but the question was  a source of anxiety, and might become worse, and itwas one of  those problems which must  be cleared up. M. Briand had requested us tomake no public announcement about Tangier lest it should lead to misunderstanding,and tempt the French public to think  that the  British Government were raising thequestion of the French protectorate.   Our recognition of the French protectorate inMorocco had, however, he had reminded M. Briand, been conditional upon the inter-nationalisation of Tangier.    M. Poincare said that he  saw no objection to a London discussion.  He couldnot, however, go himself, as Parliament would  not leave him time.  A French repre-sentative could go, but the conversations must be private and must  not be an opencouncil.    Lord Curzon said that that was quite understood.    M.  Poincare said  that  the question of Tangier was a delicate  one, but there could be no conflict of interests.    France would certainly respect  those of GreatBritain.  There could be no question of using  Tangier as a submarine base, or withany hostile intent.  The matter was a delicate one, not  between France and GreatBritain, but between themselves and the Spaniards.   Hitherto there had been twocurrents of opinion in the French Government on the  subject of Tangier.    He,M. Poincare, was quite determined that there  should only be one, and that all ques-tions separating  France and Great Britain must  be  eliminated.   The Pact coulclfollow, and set a seal upon this procedure.  Any other procedure would be putting the cart before the horse.    Lord  Curzon said  that when  M. Poincare had had  more time to look round hewould ask  him to send a  representative of the French  Government  to London forthe private discussion a trois which was in contemplation.  Lord Curzon added thathe would either write or speak to M&apos;. Poincare about this a few weeks hence.    M. Poincare said  that he would  await the communication, and do his best to hasten a solution.  His Majesty&apos;s Government could  always count upon him to do his best to co-operate loyally and  frankly with Great Britain.   He, himself,  hadregretted the &quot;defaut  de  methode &quot; and the  irregularity of the Franklin-BouillonAgreement.  It had been  a mistake, not a deliberate action.                      &apos;  (The conversation  then closed.)o
