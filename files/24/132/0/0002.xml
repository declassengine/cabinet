[This Document  is the Property of His Britannic  Majesty&apos;s  Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1922.TURKISH   PEACE. Situation in  India.    I circulate to my colleagues the following extracts from a private letter, dated2ord December 1021, which I have received to-day from the Governor of Bombay.                                                                     E. S.  M.    10th January 1922.     We are not having a very happy Christinas in India, and for the first time  since i landed I feel  the position to be really grave.  Up till now we have had our share and this side of India perhaps more than our share of anxiety and difficulty, but I havenever till now felt that the situation was fundamentally dangerous if  we handled it with prudence and patience.   But 1 have  all along endeavoured to point out to you that  unless  the Moslem question were boldly  and promptly rectified by the Cabinetthe position might at any time become very serious.   In support of this may I referyou  to my several private letters and telegrams to you and especially my telegramof 15th October.&quot;5  I know how fully you share my views, and we are all grateful forthe support  which we are confident  you have given to Indian claims  on the matter.But what.matters effectively is  that a concrete  result should be obtained, and I amseriously alarmed at  the position of affairs out here at the present time.     Meanwhile we must  hold on with determination while yott get us  a settlement ofthe Moslem question.  This settlement must now be a definite one.  Anything lessthan the one I have several times suggested  will be ineffective.   The Enos Midia linedrawn back to include Adrianople is the minimum in Thrace ;  all Anatolia, includingSmyrna and Cilicia,  must be Turkish, and a Vatican position  in  Mecca and Medina,Kerbela  and Nejf.  I wish  I  were at home to take a hand in it, for I can&apos;t bringmyself  to  believe  such  a  solution  impossible of  achievement but  I  daresayI underrate  the difficulties.  Such a settlement, but I think only such a settlement,will now save the situation here.                  e prom Governor of Bombay, 15th October 1921.    Moslem question.  In view of present, situation in India, I feel  bound  to urgeonce more upon you my opinion that it is imperative that  action should be taken onthe Turkish  question, which should restore  the  lost faith  of Islam  in our  attitudetowards it.  My point of view, and my anxiety to assist in this question, is well knownto you from various private letters and telegrams that have reached you from  me, butonce again an  opportunity, so it seems to me,  presents itself in the exhaustion  ofboth  the combatants  in  Anatolia, and  in  other  factors  of  the situation Avhichshould be taken  immediate advantage of  to put EnglancVs position right.  In regardto above, I have  all  along  held  view that, shorn of the Khilafat  question, the non-co-operation movement is easily settled, but so long as all Moslems  in India are eitheractively hostile or sore and distrustful,  as  they are  at  present,  the situation willremain serious.    We have now for very many  months tried by patience and firmness  to savesituation from  becoming worse out here, but I can  only repeat what I have  so  oftenurged, that unless we get back to a policy of reconciliation with Islam  the situation inIndia may at any  moment become a grave one.    I hope you will not think that I have misread either this  situation  or  the  homedifficulties, but I have  spent  most of  my  life in studying Islam  in Turkey and elsewhere, and  I  am  absolutely confident that a continuation of our present policy towards Islam,  or what appears to the public to be our policy towards  Islam, will leadto results fatal  to our rule in the East.     5037   100  1.22                                                       [P-T.0.SECRETCP. 3602.
    I cannot, add anything, I think, to wind. I have often written to you on the subject which could enhance the importance  which I think this question  has  for us in thiscountry and indeed I  think in all  our foreign  relations  as  well.   Unless this settlement is come to immediately it will come too late, and I am telegraphing to this effect to you again to-day, not because  I doubt of your  appreciation of the situation,but in the hopes that these representations may strengthen your hand.     And so I repeat that I see no safe course except to remedy grievances which arereal, and having done so to sit firm and refuse  to  bend  to clamour.   The grievancewhich needs immediate  settlement is  the Moslem grievance.   We simply must have this  settled,  and settled  on  generous  lines.  I do beg of you most earnestly  not toallow a settlement of  a partial character to be announced ;  it would be fatal andwould settle nothing.
