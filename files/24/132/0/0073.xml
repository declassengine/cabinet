Oyphoy Telegram  to  Lord Allenby  No.  32  of,. gfrth January,  19220         His MaiestyTs Government have made  every effort  to  meet     the  visws of  the Egyptian statesmen and yourself,  and we. are     profoundly disappointed that you are  unable to  recommend, these     proposals to  them.; You and they have  been equally, familiar     sinoe  the beginning of Deoember with  the  general principles     underlying the polioy of His Majesty^ Government  and  the     limits to whioh we were prepared to go.   These limits have been     stretched to  the uttermost in our  anxiety to  arrive at $     sottloment.         We have  offered  to invite Parliament to  enter into  an     immediate engagement  under whioh the  abolition of  the proteotorate     and  the recognition of %ypt as a  sovereign state  would  be brought     about  Stttonatioally,  as soon as the aseuranoes whioh the Egyptian     negotiators  themselves agreed to  proffer  were embodied in a shai-e     giving us security for their fulfilment.   That this solution  should     be regarded by Your Lordship as so incompatible  with EgyptJs     olalms as to  make  you unwilling to put it forward  as the agent     of His Ma jo sty Ts Government, Is deeply deplored  by th^ncM 1; t-*
                                                 -     412     When you returned to Egypt early in November you were, fully informed of the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, which was formulated largely in consultationwith yourself and wan personally explained to you.   Uponthin basis you expressed a confident hope of obtaining the co-operation of an Egyptian Government, and indeed,at one stage when Sarwat Pasha stated the conditions on which he was prepared to assume office, we accepted them without demur.  It was with some uneaei-ness that His Majesty&apos;s Government saw weeks passbefore this offer took effect.  Kor during this periodhad we any clear indication as to the lines on which you were seeking to come to a final understanding with-Egyptian statesmen.     Your telegrams-^ &apos;Eo3, 17 to 20 suddenly presentedHis Majesty&apos;s&apos; Government with a plan in wh^ch almost the entire position hitherto taken, up by them wasto be abandoned and a decision demanded without delay.Your Lordship practically presented His Majesty&apos;sGovernment with an ultimatum &apos; demand in.-- complete and immediate capitulation on, points in, which the british parliament will feel the deepest concern, and which,involving as they do the absence of any guarantee forthe future position of Great Britain in Egypt, raisean issue that.is vital to the Empire.  .. . nevertheless, in the endeavour to enter as far aapossible into the spirit of the Egyptian representatives,Eis Majesty&apos;s Government have s3nown. their willingness togo to the .extreme ,of concession. . They might have expectedHis Majesty&apos;s representative to,-welcome the bridge  whichthey were ready to. build for the Egyptians.  But your lordship without either recognising the merits of ourcarefully elaborated scheme, or suggesting any improve-meuts or modifications which might facilitate its adoption, merely reiterates your ultimatum, /
declaring that nothing can be accepted or even discussedbut what you have put forward, yourself, this in factbeing identical, as, we gather, with the demands whichtha Egyptians have now formulated as their minimum.         If it he true th. t no Egyptian dsr;e at presentsign his name to anything short of complete independence,there must have boon a change in Egyptian sentimentwhich, was neither foreseen by yourself when you leftEngland nor by Sarwat Pasha when he first offered to form a ministry,    We have as yet received hoadequate explanation of this violent metamorphosis,and we cannot but regret, from this point of view,tha t you did not accept our suggestion to send Amosand Clayton to furnish the fuller information whichwo sought. His Ma jo sty&apos;s Government cannot thereforeaccept your resignation until they have had an opportunityof seeing you in person sad hearing from your own lipstho circmnfftvinces that have led to the presentposition.  Accordingly they will bo glad, if you willoomo home at once to acquaint them with your views.In the meantime, as  it seems desirable that no mis-apprehension should exist as to the present positionand policy of His Majesty^ Government, or as to thecircumstances in which you are being invited to oornehere to discuss it,  we propose to issue here onMonday, January 30th, and shall be glad if you will issue simultaneously in Egypt, a brief summary of  thesituation, the text of which is contained in my immediately following telegram.   It is of course uselessat the present stage to place before thy Egyptian ox-Minis term   proposal which you stato your inability tosupport and which, for reasons we ara unable to appreciateare certain, in your opinion, to rnaet with a hostilerecaption.
   Op da telegram to Lord Alle nby to^sajodE^ 38 th January, 1922,        Following is summary of situation for publication:on Monday, referred to in my immediately preoedingtelegram.  Beginsj-        The High. Commissioner has heen summoned to england to give full information and advice to His Majesty&apos;aGovernment as to tha&apos; pre-eont situation in Egypt, and asto the communications that have been oassing between &quot;him and tho Egyptian ex-Mini stars, with regard to the.future government of the country.        There appears to bo an impression in gome quarters.thst Great Britain has abandoned, or is about to abandon,her liberal attitude towards Egyptian aspirations, end that she desires to make use of her special  position inEgypt to maintain a political end administrative eve torn.there incompatible with the freedom which she has declared.her willingness to recognise.                            \        This Is not&apos;the case.   The policy of His Mejesty^sGovernment j both during and&apos;since the Adly mission toEngland, has been founded upon the following principles:-&quot;        While unwilling to cede to disorder or violencewhat they ore prepared to grant on its own merits, His  ,Majesty&apos;s Government have explicitly stated their readiness to invite Parliament to; terminate the protectorate, which was declared In 1914;  to recognise the existence of Egypt as e sovereign State and toagree  to  the constitution of an Egyptian parliament                                                 and d t c 1
and the re-establishment of an Egyptian Ministry ofForeign Affairs as goon as they are satisfied as tothe following conditions, which they regard as vital to the interests both of Egypt and the Fjnpire.        They must have full and effective guarantees:-        (1) that the imperial communications, to whichEgypt is essential, are secured;        (2) that Great Britain retains both the right and the power to afford that protection to the foreign   \communities in Egypt, which the governments of thes&quot;opeoples in existing conditions look to her to supply.        (3) that Egypt is eafeguar&amp;od against all foreigninterference or aggression, direot or indirect...        As soon as an agreement, satisfying these conditionshas been  drawn up between an Egyptian Government and thaBritish Government, there Mill be no hesitation on the partof the latter in inviting parliamentary&apos;sane ti on to suchan accord..
