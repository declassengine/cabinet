0* P. 3615e        COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL BXPJgNDITTJRS.             ADMiR^-aagy AND PROPOSED MINISTRY OF DEFENCE.,.         Paraphrase of a message dated 14th January, 1922,         from the First Lord of the Admiralty (Washington)              (Circulated to the Cabinet at the request                  the First Lora of the Admiralty).J       MI have only just received a copy of the geddes Report and understand that a Sub-Comnitteeof the Cabinet is now engaged in considering how the Report should be applied to the Admiralty.        I cannot express useful opinion on suggestedreforms as I have had no previous opportunity of becoming acquainted with the Geddes proposalsowing to my prolonged absence on public duty., andhave no means of discussing the proposals with my advisers.   All I can do no?; is to promisemost careful and sympathetic consideration ofthem on my return home.        There is one proposal, however - that forthe creation of a Ministry of Defence - towhirdiI must record my emphatic dissent.   In my opinion the proposal would be productive of no economies which could not equally be effected by theco-ordinating influence of the CLP. or other meansij; and would in fact be disastrous to theArmy and Navy.   In any case, I trust that consideration of this revolutionary proposal will be deferred until I return.&quot;2, Whitehall Gardens, S,1?.,   16th January, 1922.^THIS DOCUMENT m^TTfe,PR01*3l^..QPrHIB BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S aOV-TR^CNT)SECRET.
