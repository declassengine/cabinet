          Second Interim  Keport                  .    of theCommittee on National Expenditure. To the Right Hon. Sir ROBERT  S. HORNE,           G.B.E., K.C., M.P.,       Chancellor of the Exchequer. SIR,     We beg to submit our Second Interim Report, which, as in the case of our previous Report, we would ask you to consider as both interim and preliminary.   In it we deal with a number of Departments in groups as set out below, not selected on account of the large amount of money involved, but because of administrative urgency and convenience.     TRADE  SERVICES GROUP          Board of Trade.         Department of Overseas Trade         Export Credits Scheme.         Mercantile Marine Services.         Mines Department.       .  Ministry of Transport.     AGRICULTURAL SERVICES GROUP       .   Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries         Board of Agriculture, Scotland.         Fishery Board, Scotland.         Ordnance Survey.         Forestry Commission.     POLICE  AND PRISONS GROUP :         Police.         Prisons.         Reformatory and Industrial  Schools.         Boards of Control.     GENERAL GROUP          Comprising 24 Votes  as detailed in          table of contents.    The  provisional Estimates  for  1922/23 remitted  to  us,  after making  the reductions of  75,000,000 offered  by the Departments in their provisional estimates in July last, amounted to  528,000,000 for ordinary Supply  Services.  The Servicescovered by our first Interim Report amounted to  390,000,000, and this, our second interim Report accounts for a further  18,000,000.  Irish Votes, which we are  notexamining, account  for a further  17,500,000.  There remain for examination 60Votes,  accounting  for  the  balance   of approximately  100,000,000 estimated expenditure on Ordinary Supply Services, and. 6 Votes for  &quot; Aftermath Services &quot;which come under the heading of &quot; Special Expenditure.&quot; 1    We  have, generally speaking, followed  the  same process of  study of  theestimates and consultation with the Treasury and with the Ministers and; officials of the Departments dealt with, and, as in our first Interim  Report, we have statedin some  detail where we think  economies  can be  effected, and  have arrived at conclusions, which we think should be communicated to the  Departments  as to  thelimits within which their Estimates should be framed.  We wish, however, to reiteratethat the details we give are  not exhaustive, and that our recommendations give  theminimum  economies which,  in our judgment,  should  be  effected in the  various departments.      [7653]   &apos;                                                   B 2V  Part IV.1L  Part V.IJ .  Part VI.    Part VII.
    We  take this  opportunity  of  explaining  that  we realise  that  some of our recommendations relate to classes of expenditure which will have many advocates.Powerful arguments can no doubt be urged for  such expenditure.  But in presentcircumstances only  one overriding  comment is necessary  :  &quot; Has  the  nation themeans at the present time to continue incurring it ? &quot;   To that question your  remitto us is a full and  complete answer.   We are invited to  recommend  reductions  in expenditure because they are absolutely necessary to keep our outgoings at a levelwith our income.   Our remit is not how best to spend money from an overflowingExchequer;  but how, with the least  harm, to bring expenditure within the  limits  ofour income.    We will now proceed to deal with the Trade Group, and seriatim with the other groups as set out above.
REPORT ON GOVERNMENT  EXPENDITURE ON TRADE  SERVICES.                           INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.    The provisional Estimates submitted  to  the  Committee of the cost  of  these services in 1922/23 amount to  2,134,856, as compared with  538,998 in 1913/14.    The figures for  1922/23  include  247,000 in respect of War Services.   Particu-lars are given below : -	1913/14. Audited Expenditure.	1921/22. Estimate.	1922/23.

Since 1913/14 there has been a great extension of the activity of this group.Separate Departments have been established with Parliamentary  Secretaries  for overseas Trade and Mines, and a new Ministry was set up in 1919 for Transport.Although considerable reduction is shown in 1922/23 as compared with 1921/22,it is largely accounted for by the discontinuance of the Grant-in-Aid to the EmpireCotton Growing Committee ( 978,715) and the reduction of  577,025 in the cost ofWar Services. If.the whole of the War Services are eliminated from the provisional estimate for 1922/23, the expenditure proposed for that year is three and one-halftimes that of 1913/14.    In addition to the items given in the above table  5,000,000 were provided in1921/22 for the Export Credits Scheme and  1,000,000 were shown in the provisional estimate for 1922/23  for this service.PART  IV.
BOARD OF TRADE ESTIMATES. 1913/14&apos;.Audited Expenditure   ...   (Excluding services since trans-      ferred to other Votes.)31(5,676OrdinaryServices. WarServices,f1921/22.1922/23.EstimatesProvisional Estimates1,794,713  720,7551,750,525 179,500    1. As explained above, the reduction in Ordinary Services is mainly due to the discontinuance of the grant of  978,715 to the Empire Cotton Growing Committee.    Since the provisional Estimates were  submitted, further Estimates have  beenprepared  for  submission to Parliament  which show a  reduction  in  respect  of ordinary  Services as compared with the Provisional  Estimate, from  720,755 to 615,702, a reduction of  105,053, of which  62,608 arises from a transfer of charges to the Mercantile Marine Services Vote, and an increase in the cost of War services from   179,500 to  191,748,  or of  12,248.    In  order  to avoid  confusion, wehave  adhered  to  the   provisional  Estimates  submitted,  and  any  reductionsrecommended, are based  on those Estimates.    It is  exceedingly difficult  accurately to compare the Estimates of the Boardof Trade alone, as the services covered by the Vote  in 1922/23 differ widely fromthose  covered by the same Vote in 1913/14.  In the first place, the  Vote in 1922/23includes services arising out of the war, such  as the  liquidation of the accounts ofFood  and Timber Trading, and work connected  with Enemy Debt, ReparationDyes,  &amp;c.    Although the gross cost of these  services  for 1922/23 is estimated at 569.500,  there will  be  substantial receipts, and it is anticipated that the net cost will be  179,500.    With regard to ordinary services, a number of  the activities  of the Board ofTrade on the Railway and Harbour  side have been transferred to the Ministry ofTransport, and duties which were formerly performed by the Commercial IntelligenceBranch of the Board of Trade  now  form  part of  the separate Department of overseas Trade, and the General Register of Shipping and Seamen  is borne  onthe Mercantile Services Vote.  On the other hand, Parliament has added permanentduties to the Board of  Trade  in connection with  the safeguarding  of Industries,Dyestuffs  Import Regulation, and Gas Regulation,  and  the Transport Section ofthe Mercantile Marine  Department  has been transferred  from the Admiralty tothe Board of Trade.  The net effect of all these changes is reflected  in the openingparagraph of  this part  of the report,  which  showed  that, after  eliminating warservices, the cost of this  group has increased from  538,998 in 1913/14 to  1,887.856for 1922/23.    Before dealing with the Estimates  in detail, we  have given some considerationto the organisation of the Board of Trade, and are particularly struck by the factthat,  although some of  the  operations  of. the old  Commercial  Department  of theBoard now  form part of the  functions 6f the separate Department of OverseasTrade, the part of the Commercial Department  retained has been expanded into threecostly specialised Departments, namely, the Industries and Manufactures Department,the Power,  Transport and Economic Department, and the Commercial  relations and Treaties Department.    For  reasons which have already been given, a comparison of the numbers ofstaff is as difficult as a comparison of the Votes.   The total staff,  administrative and Clerical, employed by the Board of Trade in  1914 compared with the current year, and the estimated staff required for  the 1st April, 1922, is as follows : 2.  Staff.August 1,  1914  ...August 1,  1921  ...April 1,  1922 (estimated) ...1,5004,0003,790
     Of the total staff of 3,790 required on the 1st April, 1922, about 1,560 will be engaged on permanent Ordinary Services, and there will be a further 44 engaged on work under the Registration of Business Names Act.  The remaining staff of 2,274 are said to be required for temporary services arising out of the war.     In addition, there is at present an industrial staff of 426 employed in the Timber Supply Department,  which will be reduced to 250, costing  840 per week, on the 1st April, 1922, which will be charged to the Trading Account.     The  Board of  Trade  proper, in  addition to  having  a  President  and Parliamentary Secretary has now a  Chief Economic Adviser at a salary of  3,000 per annum, and there are, in addition, two Joint Secretaries to the Board. We under- stand the post of Economic Adviser is not a permanent one.     The Department is subdivided in the following way :          Secretariat,  including Parliamentary Branch and Library.         Commercial  Relations and Treaties Department.         Industries and Manufactures Department.         Power, Transport and Economic Department.         Statistics Department.         Finance Department.         Establishment Department.         Board of Trade Journal. and a staff of 250 for  general services, including typists, messengers, charwomen, &amp;c. In addition, there are also          Legal Branch.         Standards Department.         Industrial Property Department, inchiding the Patent Office.         Companies Department.         Registration of Business Names Act Department.         Food Department.         Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies.         Clearing Office,  Enemy Debts.         Russian Claims Department.         Reparation Claims Department.         Timber Disposal Department.         War Insurance Accounts Branch.     It is obviously impossible for us to make a detailed investigation into the duties of these various sections of the Board of Trade; but we  have considered the report of the special  Investigation Committee appointed -in 1920 to examine the work of the  Department,  in  which  the   view  is expressed that three Departments  (1)  Industries   and   Manufactures,  (2)  Power,  Transport  and  Economic,   and (3) Commercial Relations and Treaties had developed  their activities on the advisory side beyond  what is necessary,  and that their functions and work overlap those of  other  Government  Departments;   and  we think  that in the present circumstances   the  Power,  Transport  and  Economic  Department  could  be amalgamated with  the Industries and  Manufactures Department,  thus realising economies in staff.  We also think that in certain directions the activities could be curtailed without any real loss of  efficiency in the Department.    At  a later  stage in  this report we deal with the separate Department of Overseas Trade and make recommendations thereon. 3. Transport Section, Mercantile Marine Department.    Included in the Estimates for the Board of Trade there is an item of  43,000 for the Transport Section of the Mercantile Marine Department.  Before the war this Department was attached to the Admiralty and the pre-war cost was  14,500. Of.  the  reasons assigned  for  the  increase over  pre-war  cost apart  from the  usual  reason  of war  bonus  and  increased  rates of pay one is  the additional troop work consequent upon the continuance of  the Armies of Occupation on the Black Sea, in  Palestine and  in  Mesopotamia, involving the use of twelve transports now instead of six.  Another reason is  the large increase in the stocks of Transport Stores for the Expeditionary Force in the event of war.  In 1914 the Department was authorised to hold sufficient stocks  for 87,000  men  and 30,000 horses,  the largest items being 220,000 blankets and 90,000 hammocks.   No shipsfittings of any sort were held  in stock.
     We are informed that the future policy regarding the retention of transport;Stores is now under consideration by the  Committee of Imperial Defence, but thatthe  Department  has  asked to be allowed to purchase  additional  ships&apos;  fittings,horse-stall fittings, and horse gear up to  the requirements  for the despatch of an expeditionary Force  of 65,000 men  and 14,000 horses, and to be allowed to retainall surplus stock up to the requirements for a Force of 180,000 men and 60,000 horses.     We have  ascertained  that  immense stocks are held  at  the  present time,including              600,000  Blankets.             360,000  Hammocks.              12,460  Hospital berths.              86,624  Breast rails for horse boxes.              41,276  Horse halters.     The estimated cost of handling these stores  in 1922/23 is   22,500, comparedwith  6,000 in  1913, and we are  informed  that the  Department proposes to concentrate at a new Depot at Pitsea the whole of the stores necessary  to meetwar  requirements.  This proposal would  involve  not only the cost of transferringthese large stocks to Pitsea,  but also the provision of additional buildings at Pitseato accommodate  the  stores.   We consider that  under  present  circumstances . no-additional expense whatever should be incurred in the  acquisition  of  additionalships&apos;  fittings or horse gear or provision  of storage accommodation, and that the stocks  held should  not exceed pre-war. We doubt whether the present system oftransporting troops is the best under  peace conditions, and think  that contractarrangements  to cover everything  could probably  be made at less cost.  It  appearsto us quite wrong that the Board of Trade should  be holding vast mobilisation storessuch as these, and we think the Department should be reduced to pre-war dimensions.4. Census of Production.    The Board of Trade propose to take a  census of production in 1923 in respect ofthe year 1922 at a total estimated cost of  120,000, of which  8,000 is to be spent inthe next financial year.  The Board of Trade had hoped to obtain a census relatingto the output of the principal industries of the country for  the year 1920; but thiswas abandoned in view of the need for economy.  We are of opinion that this need ismore pressing to-day, and we further  consider that any figures of production obtained for the  year 1922 will be misleading owing to the abnormal trade depression.  Werecommend that the census should  certainly be postponed until trade is more nearlyapproaching a normal condition.5. British-Italian Corporation.    Included in the Estimates is an item of  107,200 under the heading of British-Italian  Corporation.  In 1916 an agreement was made with this Corporation underwhich the Government agreed to pay a subsidy of  50,000 a year for ten years andalso to pay Income Tax and Excess Profits  Duty for which the Corporation might be assessed by reason of this subsidy.  The agreement has, however, now been brought toan end by the lump  sum payment included in the Estimates.6. Zinc Concentrates and Spelter.     An agreement was  concluded  in  1917  as  regards  concentrates and  spelterwith  the  Zinc Producers&apos;  Proprietary Association (Limited),  Australia.   Thisagreement  operates until the 30th June, 1930, and  is divided  into three periods asunder :-         1. From the  1st January, 1918, to the 30th June, 1921.        2. From the  1st July, 1921,  to the 30th June, 1925.        3. From the  1st July, 1925,  to the 30th June, 1930.     The annual quantity  of concentrates  the Government may be required  to takeis fixed by the agreement at 250,000  tons per annum in the first period and 300,000tons per annum for the second and third periods.   The prices  are fixed for the first two periods and a formula laid down  for regulating prices in the third period.     There is also an agreement giving the Zinc Producers&apos; Association the right ta&quot; put &quot; 45,000 tons of spelter annually with the Government at ruling market price.     These agreements were  negotiated in  1916 through the Australian Governmentand  are binding until 1930.  Owing to changes which have occurred since in world
prices  and to the rise in the cost of labour, and also to the  restricted demand forspelter, sales of concentrates cannot be made at a price sufficient to cover the pricesagreed to be paid.  The Government now hold 700,000 tons of zinc concentrates inAustralia and 3,000 tons of spelter in the United Kingdom.   We are not familiar with the reasons  for entering  into this long-term agreement; the extent of the losscannot at present be estimated, but it is almost certain to run into several millions.7. Registration of Business Names.    A staff  of  forty-four is  indicated  in connection  with the Registration ofBusiness Names Act, but the cost is borne on the Vote of the Registrar-General. Feesare charged for services rendered,  and in the first year of the operation of the act the receipts amounted to  28,000 as against an expenditure of   5,000.  Registrationshave, however, considerably fallen  off, and the service is  now run at a loss of some 4/5,000  per annum.  It  is a question  whether this registration is  now necessary,and we think not.8. &quot;Board of Trade  Journal&quot;    The estimated cost of producing the &quot;  Board of Trade Journal,&quot; exclusive of thecost of accommodation, is  15,770 per annum, whereas receipts from the sale, after allowing for trade  discounts and overhead charges, are only  6,500.  The weeklycirculation is about 10,000 copies.  Arrangements have been made, however, to meetthe estimated deficiency on this account by accepting advertisements for publication in the Journal, such advertisements being  expected to yield a net revenue of  10,000per annum.  If  these anticipations  are  realised and  the Journal  becomes self-supporting we see no objection to its continuance; but we do  not think it should becontinued if any contribution from the Taxpayer is necessary.                          WAR LIQUIDATION SERVICES.9. Food Department.    We  understand that  disposals are now complete in the case of wheat, flour,bacon,  dried fruits, eggs, and canned goods, and that the completion of the disposalof the  whole of the remaining stocks will be reached before  the 31st March, 1922.The Ministry of Food final trading account will be presented to the Comptroller and auditor-General on the 31st March. 1922. There will,  however, be certain adjust-ments to make, but  it is fully anticipated  that the accounts will be  completed by the30th June, 1922.    The final trading account  of the Wheat Commission will be completed about thesame date; but the  amounts involved are  very large, and the  adjustments will take some time owing to the necessity for analysing the accounts  in order to arrive atthe final cost to  each Ally.  Unfortunately, the staff engaged in  considering theclaims will  have to remain for a slightly longer period, as many large claims areoutstanding, and we  do not consider that the  interests  of the taxpayer should be jeopardised by too  hastily disbanding the expert staff  necessary for dealing withthese complicated claims.    Of the staff  of 1.599 transferred from the  Ministry of  Food to the Board ofTrade  on the 1st April, 1921. the  services of two-thirds have been dispensed with.excluding the provincial staff,  which will disappear  by  the  end of  January 1922.On the 1st April. 1922, it is estimated that the total staff will amount to 332, and itis intended to reduce the staff progressively throughout the year until it disappears.It is  then  proposed to retain a  Food  Claims Advisory Committee for  givingassistance in inspect of claims not settled  before that date.  The cost for 1922/23 isestimated at  61.500.10. Timber Trading Account.    The Government purchased and sold enormous quantities  of imported and home-grown timber during and since the war.    As regards imported timber, the total  sales from the inception of the Departmentup to the time when the Avhole stock will have been disposed of will probably amountto  60 millions.  We understand that a  year ago it was anticipated that a profitwould  be shown on these transactions;  but since that date difficulties have arisenwith the firm who had contracted to purchase the whole of the remaining stocks, andit is now anticipated that the imported timber department will ultimately show a&apos;loss.    As regards home-grown timber the total sales amounted  to  15,800,000; but in       [7653]                                                           C
this case also there will he a loss of approximately  5,800,000 which is attributable to large payments for damage to roads (not entirely due to home-grown timber) alsoto additional expenditure involved in conducting timber felling and sawing opera-tions, and to trade depression which has had an adverse effect on the prices realised.    In view of  the afforestation expenditure, the result of  a Government Depart-ment&apos;s trading in home-grown timber is noteworthy.  Tn neither of these accounts hasany debit been made to  represent interest on Treasury advances.11. Clearing House Enemy Debts.    A large staff is still engaged on the operations of the Clearing House.  Up todate it has dealt with  250,000 claims.  The estimated number of staff  at the 1stApril, 1922, is 1.385, and the cost for 1922/23  390,000.   The volume and the natureof the work of this office will necessitate its  continuance for several years, but thecost will  be entirely covered by fees.  We have not investigated the staff in detail.12. Russian Claims Department.    Provision is made in the Estimates for 1922/23 for a staff of about twenty-fiveat a cost of  5,000.  At the present  time  the Department is mainly engaged in arranging  and classifying the various claims against Russia,  and  dealing  withcorrespondence in connection therewith.   The duration of this work must depend upon  developments leading  to the  re-establishment of commercial relations  withRussia and the  acknowledgment by the Government  of Russia  of  its nationalobligations. No fees  are charged so far.13. Reparation Claims.    Provision is made in the Estimates for 1922/23 for  a staff of 161 at a total costof  40,000.  This  Department has  been  engaged  in preparing the  claim of theUnited Kingdom  against Germany for reparation in  respect  of damage under certain clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, and is now chiefly  occupied in consideringthe question  of  compensation to civilians  who have  suffered war damage.    ACommission, under  the  presidency of Lord Summer, has been set up to deal  with claims of this nature, assessing the measure of the damage suffered in  each case.14. War Risks Accounts Branch.  Marine.    A staff of only three is provided for in the Estimates for 1922/23, at a cost of 623 for  the completion  of the work in connection with Marine Claims, which involvethe recovery of considerable sums of money in respect of salvage, &amp;c, and also thepayment  of further claims arising out of the insurances  effected.    15. As is shown by this Report, the Board of Trade, in addition to its permanentwork, is  engaged to a very great extent in liquidating war  liabilities of all kinds.e.g., Food, Wheat Commission, Mines,  Shipping, Timber,  Zinc Concentrates andSpelter, Reparations, Enemy Debts,  Russian Claims and so forth.    We have found our task of criticising and forming an opinion of the Board ofTrade expenditure infinitely more  complicated  and difficult on account of  thesedecreasing and  abnormal duties.    Such  circumstances necessarily  increase thedifficulty which the Government or Parliament finds in controlling expenditure.    If such of these aftermath services as are incapable of  being wound up beforemidsummer of this year  were withdrawn from the  Board of Trade  this would admitof the departmental cost being estimated on a permanent  basis and criticised by comparison with  what it did before the war and from year to year.    It must be  obvious  that  these abnormal departments,  which fluctuate butgenerally tend to shrink, require the most constant care to see that the staff is reduced,not only  in the  particular branches, but in all the common services, as  the  workFalls,  and even so great opportunities will exist for staff being carried long  after they have become redundant.                   \    Our  conclusions to  this chapter  are embodied in our conclusions on the wholeTrade Group, at the end of this part of the Report.    The  various Services in  the  Trade  Groups are so closely  related and oursubsequent recommendations would involve so many cross references that we think the course  we have adopted  will be more convenient  than  attempting to set outconclusions at the end of each  chapter in the group.
                  DEPARTMENT OF OVERSEAS TRADE.     The net Estimates for 1922/23 compare with 1921/22 as under :--         1913/14       ...............Non-e xistent.            but approximately  34,000 included in the Board of Trade                         and.

Since  the Provisional  Estimates were submitted we understand  that  the 345,039 for 1922/23 will probably be increased to  375,300, the difference of  30,207being largely accounted for by expenditure  in connection with the Eio CentenaryExhibition.     The total staff employed in the Department for the two years is as follows :                                                    AND-district 1, 1921.  April 1, 1922.

The question of the organisation of commercial intelligence abroad has beenthe subject of considerable controversy, and in the last four  years five committees have been set up to  consider some aspect  of the organisation.   The names of theCommittees were as  follows :      The  Faringdon  Committee  of  1917 on the  Organisation  of  Commercial         Intelligence in Foreign Countries.    The Tilley Committee of 1917.    The Cave Committee of 1919 on Government Machinery for dealing with Trade         and Commerce.    The Steel-Maitland Committee of 1919.    The Holmes Committee  of 1920  on the Staffing and Methods of work of the         Department of Overseas Trade.    In two cases the  Committees could not present an  agreed report, and the questionis admittedly one of  great complexity and difficulty.    The Department combines part of the work of the old  Commercial IntelligenceBranch  of the Board of Trade with that of  the Commercial  Department of theForeign Office.    From the figures of staff it will be seen that the activities overseas are beingcurtailed to a very small extent and that  the  main reductions  are taking place inthe Headquarters staff; but even then a staff of 385 at Headquarters (since increasedto 396) appears to us  to be unjustified.    3. We have given careful attention to the class of  work performed by theDepart-ment of Overseas Trade, and have been supplied with a list of instances where their work has been commended.  We give in Appendix  (A) hereto examples from thatlist in order to illustrate the kind of work  which they tell us they are doing.    It appears to us that this sort of canvassing is  absolutely outside the scope of ordinary Government business,  and ought  not  to be paid for by the taxpayer.   Weasked the Department whether they had any really large deals to bring to our noticewhere they had been instrumental in obtaining trade for the country  which would otherwise have been lost, and we were told of a proposal for a contract with a foreign country  running into millions of pounds.  Upon enquiry, however, we find that this contract  involved a guarantee by  the British Government,&apos; and as it was a  class ofbusiness  in which British Trade is strongly represented in foreign countries we haveno reason to suppose that had that guarantee not been  necessary, the firms would haverequired Government assistance of this kind.    Indeed, so far as large firms  are      [76531                         ______      ,                     C 2
concerned,  we are satisfied that through  their own  agents  they  are  quite able to handle their own business affairs, and so far as small firms are concerned, we understand it is done to a large extent through Associations to  which  they subscribe or bytheir own individual ehorts.  We are convinced that a Government Department inthis country  which has no financial responsibility in suggesting or recommendingoperations  to the mercantile community will do no practical good.   To  keep up ahuge headquarters establishment in London of  396 persons and offices costing over 120,000 a year in salaries alone, as against approximately  34,000 spent by theBoard of Trade and the Foreign Office in 1913/14, appears to us unjustifiable.    The aid which we think the trade of the country can legitimately ask from theGovernment is  in connection with Tariffs, with introductions in  foreign countries,and general information.  Assistance in matters of detail, such as the freight on Jaffaoranges, using up old razor blades or obtaining orders for a  few dozen men&apos;s shirtsis no doubt appreciated when gratuitously rendered, but in  our judgment it is not for the taxpayer to render this assistance gratuitously.    In these  circumstances we are of opinion that considerable economies could beeffected if the activities of the Department in London were materially reduced, andsuch duties as are necessary taken over by the Board of Trade by combining with theCommercial Relations and Treaties Department.  A  very large  reduction should bepossible in the  headquarters organisation, upon which the Holmes Committee  has reported, &quot; so far as we can gather, it has become a vast repository and not a vehiclefor information.&quot;  The commercial representatives in foreign  countries would, aswe think is right, come under the Foreign Office, but be available for direct com-munication from the Board of  Trade.   Some economies, without loss of efficiency,should result  from a combination in certain cases of the duties of Commercial repre-sentative and the ordinary Diplomatic Staff.  In Dominions and Crown Colonies theBoard of Trade might have their own direct  representatives,  if  necessary, of whichwe are  doubtful.   The Export  Credits  Division and  the  Exhibition Branch of overseas Trade Department would be similarly  merged with the Board of Trade.4. Petroleum Department.    The Petroleum Department was set up in April 1917 in order to co-ordinate thesupply of  petroleum  to  different  Departments,  a problem  rendered  acute by war conditions, and was originally under the aegis of the Ministry of Munitions.  It wasmade  a separate Department in November 1919.    It is proposed to have a staff of nineteen on the 1st April,  1922, and the cost for the next financial year is put at  9,000.  So far as home production of oil isconcerned,  the need for a separate Petroleum Department is not apparent, and  if,now  that normal conditions are  restored,  the  Government Departments whichpurchase petroleum require expert assistance and advice, we  think  this could bemuch  more economically afforded by the Board  of Trade with the assistance of  an expert adviser,  and that  the separate organisation, consisting of nineteen persons,costing  9,000 per annum, is unnecessary.APPENDIX (A).

Staff, 12    ......   Costing  10,210 per annum in 1922/23.    1. Various schemes have been adopted during the last two years with the objectof encouraging the export of  13ritish-manufactured goods.    At first  the present scheme  was  limited  in  its application.   The  amount authorised under &apos;&apos; the overseas Trade  (Credits  and  Insurance)  Act, 1920,&quot; to be  employed under thescheme was not to exceed   26,000,000, and the actual amount required in  any yearmust, of course, be voted by Parliament in the ordinary way.    The scheme  provided  for advances  being made  by  the   Export   CreditsDepartment,  now a section of the Department of Overseas Trade, up to  80  per cent.of the cost of goods exported  to the Baltic and Balkan States.   With a view torelieving unemployment,  the scheme was extended in November last to include allcountries.  The scheme   for advances  has been  replaced  by  arrangements  forguaranteeing drafts.    Interest  is charged at 1 per cent, above bank rate, with a minimum of 6  per cent.and commission at 3 per cent, for the first  year, 4 per cent, for the  second year, and5 per cent, for the third  year.   The final liquidation was originally fixed for  the8th September, 1925;  but it has now been extended by another two years to  the8th Sepetmber, 1927.    2. The   following statement shows the Advances,  Guarantees and Creditssanctioned and taken up for the period ended the 31st December, 1921,  and also the guarantees to Banks under Part II of  Export Credits Extended Facilities :----	Sanctioned.

Of the balance of advances sanctioned but not taken  up ( 1,654,570), we areinformed that  1,302,692 may be regarded as having lapsed.    3.  We understand that goods are being exported, to the following countries :-              A dvances.                            Guarantees.             Czeeho-Slovaki a.

Italy.             Finland.Guarantees have  also been given for moderate amounts in respect  of  exports to poland, Esthonia, Java, Siam, and Holland, and for  quite small amounts for othercountries.
    4.  It wa&apos;s anticipated that of the total commitments for advances  351,878 mighthave to he advanced during the current financial year in fulfilment o.t  sanctions, andthat at  the present rate of progress the sums credited under the scheme will, during thenext financial year, raise the total commitments  to the total amount authorised byParliament, namely,  26,000,000; but it is impossible to estimate with any precisionthe  extent to  which public funds will be called upon to make payments in respectof these commitments.    The  Treasury,  however,  have been  asked   to  provide 2,500,000 in the estimates for next year.   If this is a true estimate the businessmust be of a very risky nature, and having regard to the rates of commission charged,we think that  500,000 should be the  outside figure budgeted for.    No loss has so far fallen on  the Exchequer.  One transaction may  result in  asmall debit balance in the linal liquidation; but  we understand  there are ampleresources in hand from the fund  formed by the commissions charged, which to dateamount to  64,544.    The scheme is an experiment to restart the export  credit of the country, andwe make no further recommendation.

Of the reduction of  69,178 for ordinary services  in  1922/23  as comparedwith the current year,  53,230 is attributable to the fall in Bonus and Wages.

Mercantile Marine Offices.                                                                            1913/14 Audited Expenditure ...       ...       74,015             1921/22 Estimate     ...       ...       ...       168,553             1922/23 Estimate     ...       ...       ...      145,500    Of the total of  145,500 in the Provisional Estimate for 1922/23,  20,000 was included for the Atlantic  Ice Patrol, which we understand  is  to be reduced to 10,000.  The remaining  125,500  is for Mercantile Marine Offices, towards whichfees&apos;produce  30,000.    The Mercantile Marine Offices Avere originally started in 1850 with the  idea that they should be self-supporting  by  fees levied for engagement and discharge of seamen,&apos; but these fees, which amounted to roughly  70,000 in  1882, were abolishedby the Board of Trade in that year.   In 1892 Parliament took away from the Boardof Trade their power to charge any fees  in connection with engagement and dischargeat a Mercantile Office.   There  is  now no power,  therefore, under the  MerchantShipping Acts to levy fees for the engagement and discharge of Seamen in the UnitedKingdom; but fees are paid by the shipowner if the engagement and discharge takes place on board ship at the request of the shipowner, and these largely make up the 30.000 above,   The total number  of engagements  and discharges of Seamen per
annum may be put at roughly 1,000,000, and we recommend that this service should be rendered again self-supporting as it was prior to 1882, after certain steps, which arcin contemplation for reducing the cost of the organisation by limiting the  work andby improvement in organisation, have been given effect to.    We have examined the statistics of engagements and discharges at the principalports  and iind that Mercantile  Marine  Offices  are  maintained at  places  whereengagements and discharges per annum are relatively small, in some cases less than,000  per annum.   We  do not  think that the retention of an office is  justified in circumstances such as these and recommend that a minimum number should be laiddown  arid if the engagements and discharges for an average of three years fall belowthis minimum the  office should  be  closed and the work  placed  upon the CustomsOfficers.3.  Surveyors.                                                                           1913/14 Audited Expenditure ...       ...       89,294            1921/22 Estimates    ...       ...       ...      264,115            1922/23 Estimate    ...       ...       ...      240,800    Although the expenditure on the Survey  Service  amounts to  some   240,000, thereceipts from fees are only  42,000.  The Surveyors are stationed at twenty-nine ofthe principal Ports  and their work may be roughly divided as follows :                                                   Per cent.Survey of passenger vessels ...       ...       ...       44Tonnage and Load-line    ...       ...       ...       27Minor Surveys, Inspections and Police work  ...       29    The staff of Surveyors has increased from 178 on the 1st September, 1913, to 221on the 1st September, 1921, or by 24  per cent.    During this period  all the salaryscales have been considerably increased, apart from the application of the war bonus.    The total number of vessels completely surveyed during the twelve  months ended october 1921  was  1,469,  compared with 1,911 during  the  twelve months ended october 1913,  a decrease of 23 per cent.  Certain  additional  duties  have  been imposed, but on the whole we do not consider the- work in 1922/23 will be in excessof pre-war, and we suggest the number of staff should be limited to that extent.    The Surveyors of the Board of Trade do not carry out all the work of surveyingas a large  proportion of the survey work in connection with the Load-line of british ships  is carried out by the  Classification Societies.  We have considered whether agreater proportion of this expenditure  can be  recovered from fees which  at the presenttime are limited by statutory maxima  specified in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894,reproduced from the Merchant  Shipping Act, 1854.  As an example of the inadequacy of these fees we would point  out that the highest fee chargeable for the tonnagemeasurement of a ship is  10,  this  being the fee for tonnage measurement for anyship of 5,000 tons and upAvards.  With the growth of the average size  of vessels feesof this description are obviousty quite  inadequate, and we suggest that the necessary steps be taken to obtain powers to revise fees for these services, so  that after econo-mies in staff have been effected they shall be self-supporting.4. Food Inspection.    There are  at the present  time  twenty-three inspectors appointed under &quot; TheMerchant  Shipping  Act,  1892,&quot;  and stationed  at  London,  Cardiff,  Glasgow,Liverpool  and  Newcastle for  the inspection of ships&apos; provisions.   We think  thatwith the greater organisation of the seamen the time has probably arrived when theGovernment might retire  from  regular  duties  of this  character,  retaining oneor two inspectors for intermittent inspection and special enquiry.5.

The increase is said to be due primarily to war causes, and a considerable  reduction is anticipated during the present calendar year.    The work is dealt with in two main branches, one dealing with the Royal naval reserve and the other with Merchant Shipping.  The main increase in staff has beenin the Royal Naval Reserve Branch.  During the war the Royal Naval Reserve Forceincreased  from 18,223 to 94,300, and a considerable additional staff has been  neces-sary in connection  with demobilisation work, issue  of  prize money, certificates ofwar service, and the compilation  of a complete alphabetical index of the Royal naval reserve Force.   We are informed that a second distribution of prize money will bemade in a few weeks&apos;  time, after which the staff will be  reduced to normal.    The Merchant Shipping Branch performs regular work in connection with the registration and records of  ships and seamen under the Merchant Shipping Acts,and this work has largely increased,  as will be gathered from the following figures :-                                           Average  number of Animal Registrations.                                   1012/1.4,        19.19/21.Change of ships&apos;  names ...          220           470Vessels registered       ...         1,855         2,044Registers  closed ...      ...         1,481         1,842    This branch also undertakes a variety of duties such as              Registration of seamen.             Searches for missing seamen.             Verification of service.             Issue of masters&apos;, mates&apos;, &amp;c, certificates.             Examination of deserters&apos; wages  accounts.             Sight-testing examinations.    Apart from special work arising out of  the war, we think the duties within thecompass of a staff on a pre-war basis and the cost of a normal staff should be largelymet by charging appropriate fees for the services  rendered.7.

The staff employed in August 1921  was 411 and the estimated staff required at the 1st April, 1922, is 355.    The  Mines Department was first established  on  a temporary basis during thewar for the control of the production and distribution of  coal.   By  the MiningIndustry Act of 1920 it was placed on a  permanent  basis  under a parliamentary secretary of the Board of Trade.    The  functions  of  the Department  may  be described as follows :        v&apos;i.) To secure the most effective development and utilisation  of  the mineral          resources of the United  Kingdom and the safety and welfare of those          engaged in  the mining  industry.     (ii.) The collection., preparation and  publication  of information and statistics          relating to  the mining  industry.    (iii.) The continuance of coal  control for a period of  one  year from the 31st          August, 1920, with a possibility of extension for a further six months.    (iv.)  To make  regulations for the constitution of (i) Pit Committees, (ii) District          Committees,  (iii) Area  Committees, (iv) a National Board, to  discuss          and make recommendations as  to health and safety  of workers,  output,          wage disputes,  &amp;c. the Department having power to enforce compliance          with such recommendations if  finally approved.     (v.)  To make schemes as to drainage.    (vi.)  To make regulations with  respect to metalliferous mines.   (vii.) To regulate a fund for the improvement  of the social conditions of colliery          workers, the fund to  be obtained by a  levy of one penny on each ton of          coal raised and to be allocated by a committee of five persons.    On the setting up  of the Department  on a  permanent basis in September 1920there  were  transferred    (viii.) The powers of the Home Office to make regulations regarding health and.    So far as we understand,  the circumstances have completely changed since theDepartment was formed.  The mines have been returned to the owners, and voluntary arrangements  have  been  come to between the owners and the men which rendercertain, parts of &quot; The Mining Industry Act, 1920,&quot; inapplicable  or inoperative.Further, the question of State acquisition of Royalties appears to be one which, inthe present financial stringency of the country, will necessarily have to be deferred.In these circumstances we feel that considerable economies could be made in staff,office  accommodation, &amp;e,  if the functions which  were gathered from  variousMinistries reverted  to those Ministries.    2. In addition to its  permanent functions, the Mines Department is engaged inclearing up  the  accounts of the  Coal Mines Agreement Confirmation Act and theCoal Mines  Emergency Act, and we understand that the work at present in  handwill keep the staff fully occupied until the end of the financial year 1922/23.

Having regard to the fact that the Chairman of the Committee was the firstMinister of Transport,  he desired that  this Vote and  the Road Pund should beconsidered in his absence, and the following letters exchanged between the chairman and yourself show that you agreed with  the course suggested :                                      Treasury Chambers,    My dear Chancellor,                         Whitehall, November 18, 1921.         The Committee on National Expenditure will be considering the Ministry    of Transport Estimates and the question of the Road Pund next week.  It would    be more satisfactory to myself, and I  think it would be appropriate if I absented    myself  from that part of  the enquiry and  took  no responsibility  for  the    Committee&apos;s  recommendations in their report.         If you would be good enough to express your willingness to relieve me from    taking any share in that part of the remit, I will consult my colleagues, and then    if you  and they agree, I will invite them to select their own Chairman for that    part of the investigation.  I  do this  because the figures which will come before    them were in fact prepared and submitted to the  Treasury while I was Minister    of Transport, and I do not wish to take part in criticising or defending my own    actions.         As you know, before  I  relinquished my post as Minister of Transport, I    expressed  the opinion to the Prime Minister that in view^ of the passage of the    Railway Act, 1921, restoring the railways to private ownership,  there was no    justification for  retaining a separate Ministry of Transport, especially having    regard to  the existing financial stringency.   Should the Committee adopt the    view which I, as Minister of Transport, held on  this point, I would propose, if    you  agree, to take part in their discussions as to the best distribution of the    Ministry&apos;s work  among existing Departments of the Government.         With that one exception, I would prefer to  take no part in the matter,  and    shall be glad to know that you agree  to my taking this course.                                                      Yours sincerely,                                                 (Signed)      ERIC GEDDES    The  Right Hon.  Sir Robert Home,          G.B.E., K.C., M.P.,                   The Treasury, Whitehall, S.W. 1.                                       Treasury  Chambers,My dear Geddes,                               Whitehall, November 21, 1921.    With reference to your letter of the 18th instant, I entirely agree with the courseyou propose to take in connection with the deliberations of the Committee on national expenditure in regard to the Ministry of Transport                                                     Yours very sincerely,                                                 (Signed)      R.  S. HORNE    The Right Hon. Sir Eric Geddes,          G.C.B., G.B.E.,M.P.    2. The Ministry was formed in 1919 with the object of amalgamating in oneMinistry all the functions and duties in connection with Transport, including the                     * Included under Board of Trade, Road Fund, &amp;c.YChapter  YI,
maintenance of roads, which  were spread over several Departments.  Duties were transferred from the following :          Board of Trade.         Ministry of Health.         Road Board,  powers and duties in relation to roads, bridges,  ferries.             vehicles and traffic.         First Lord of the Admiralty.         Commissioners of Works, powers in  relation  to Menai Bridge.         Secretary for Scotland.         Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.         Commissioners of Public Works, Ireland.         Congested Districts Board for Ireland         Department of Agriculture and  Technical Instruction, Ireland.     The Act of 1919 also conferred upon the Minister extensive powers for makingadvances  for  the construction, improvement  and maintenance of railways,  light railways,  tramways, harbours, docks, and inland navigations, and the promotion and improvement of transport services.     Considerable improvement, standardisation and development of the canals andinland waterways of this country were also under contemplation.     In existing circumstances it  is clear that these duties of  the Ministry will be incapable of realisation for a long time.     In addition to  the various   duties  transferred,  the  Ministry  was   speciallycharged with the duty of liquidating the various agreements entered into duringthe war for taking possession of  the railways, canals, &amp;c.  It was obvious at  thattime that  some railway legislation would be necessary and the Minister  was speciallycharged with  the duty of considering and formulating the policy to be pursued as tothe future position of railway undertakings.   The size and scope  of  the  Ministrydepended mainly  upon the  railway situation and the  settlement of the  future of railways.     This  question was settled in  the Act of last session, and the responsibilities ofthe Minister under that Act are not much more extensive than those existing beforethe  war.   There also remains the important work  of  liquidating  the Govern-menfs  liabilities  under the  agreements for  the control of the railways.   In  thisliquidation large sums of expenditure have still to be investigated  and many ques-tions involving highly technical matters will have to be determined.     We are reviewing the question of this liquidation  work in a later report on theDisposal Board and Liquidation  Commission.     3. The activities of the Ministry have already been appreciably reduced, as willbe seen from the figures quoted at the head of this chapter,  as compared  with thecurrent year.   The numbers of staff show the  following comparison:-                                                    August I, 1921.  April 1. 1922.        Permanent  ...      ...        ...       ...         322         320        Temporary  ...      ...        ...       ...         356         189it is difficult to make a comparison with pre-war, as  the number of stall&apos;  requiredin the various  Departments for  the duties transferred  are not known. A staff offorty-one  was  engaged in the Road Board in August 1914, and a staff of thirty-ninein the Board of Trade, making a  total of eighty; but these figures are exclusive ofcommon staff, such as registry, typists,messengers, &amp;c, and also of the Light RailwayCommission.    The organisation of the Ministry has been considerably contracted. Of the sixseparate Departments apart from  the&quot;Secretariat, only two are now retained, namely,Roads and Finance, and the  Roads Department is a  separate Department underStatute.   This Department has the old functions of the Road Board, and  also manyadded functions,  notably the  classification of roads for the purpose of grants   andthe collection of the Motor Taxation, which is assigned to the Road Fund.    Of  the gross expenditure some  71,000 is in  respect of the Director-Generalof Roads  and his staff and  the members  of the Finance Branch attached to  that department.   These functions will continue whether the Ministry of Transport becontinued  or not.    4.  Included in the Estimates of the Ministry of Transport -are items of  13,700
for the  Irish Branch; but with a settlement of the  Irish question this expenditure would no longer be required.   The Estimate also includes the following items:                                                                              Holy head Harbour       ...       ...        ...      5,607             Ramsgate  Harbour       ...       ...        ...      1,000             Caledonian and Crinan  Canals   ...        ...    37,550and the Department is also responsible for the Menai  Bridge, although no specialitem of  expenditure is shown under that heading.   So  far as Holyhead Harbour isconcerned, a  portion of  the estate is now leased to the London and  North-WesternRailway Company, and the balance is merely in respect of  the  harbour of refuge.which is of national importance.  Ramsgate Harbour is of purely local importance,and we are of opinion that the responsibility for that harbour should be undertaken by the Local  Authorities.  It is questionable whether  the Caledonian and CrinanCanals satisfy the test of national importance, and arrangements  should, if possible,be made for their  control and management to be undertaken by  local  bodies.  TheMenai Bridge at one time formed part of the highway to Ireland;  but it appearsnow  to  have assumed  less  importance from the national point of view, and,  inconformity with the general practice in regard to bridges and highways, it  should now fall under  the control of Local Authorities.    In all the circumstances we agree  with the views expressed  in the penultimateparagraph  of the  letter  from Sir Eric Geddes to you quoted  above and do  notconsider that the separate existence of the Ministry can longer be justified, havingregard to the curtailment of activity on the termination of the possession  of  theRailways by  the Government,  and  the handing over to  the Disposals  Board of  theLocomotives,  Wagons and Lorries  pi^eviously held  by the Ministry.    The question remains for consideration as to which  Ministry  shall be responsiblefor the  permanent work of the Ministry of Transport, which is necessary both inthe interests of  the public and of the railways.    The Ministry  of Transport was originally intended to deal with all questions affecting transport  and  power,  and we think that economy and  efficiency would be attained if all such questions of transport by sea, rail, road and canal, and questionsof power and coal, were grouped in the Board of  Trade under  one parliamentary secretary, to assist the President.    If our recommendations on this point were adopted, a second Parliamentary Secretary could take all trade questions, includingTreaties and Tariffs, Patents, Bankruptcy, &amp;c.   As the Board of Trade and Ministryof Transport have now  together two  Ministers and four Under-Secretaries, thiswould effect a saving of one  Minister  and two Under-Secretaries, unless one were required for  &quot;  aftermath &quot;  services.    We consider that a reorganisation of  theBoard of Trade on these lines would  enable the Department to get to work on a normal basis  and should be conducive to efficiency and economy.    As  pointed out in paragraph 15 of chapter I  under the Board of Trade,  our task of  criticising  the Department^  Estimates has been rendered infinitely moredifficult on account of the very large proportion of temporarv and expiring services which have been tacked  on to  it,  e.g., Food,  Wheat Supplies,  Clearing Office for enemy Debts, Russian Claims, Reparation Claims, Timber Disposal, War InsuranceAccounts, Shipping Claims,  Zinc Concentrates Agreement, and now we have toconsider also the  temporary  and expiring work of the Ministry of  Transport inclearing up the Control Accounts of the Railway Agreements.    We feel  that a great deal is to be said for concentrating  all these temporary andexpiring matters, which will  extend beyond midsummer next, under one head, in aLiquidation  Branch, corresponding in some  respects  to the Disposal Board  andLiquidation  Commission.  We can see no material economy in retaining these inthe Board of Trade.   They would  roughly  account for a staff of 2,274 out of thetotal Board of Trade staff of 3,790, and it is manifestly impossible for a Departmentto  get   down   to  its  normal  work  and   dimensions  if   it  has  all  theseaftermath of the war services to deal with.  They necessarily create an atmosphere of inflation, and tend to keep a larger staff  than is necessary  both for the temporary and for the permanent services. On the other hand, if the temporary  services were all grouped together, the staff involved and the work they were doing would be undercontinual review,  and their steady decrease as the work fell would be more easilyand efficaciously controlled, by the  Treasury and by Parliament.     While we  do not feel that we can make a definite recommendation on this with-out more detailed consideration, we do recommend  that in the interests of economy
(I efficiency, the Government should consider whether such a suggestion should not given effect to.                            CONCLUSIONS.  As a result of our consideration, we are of opinion:   (1.)  That the Ministry  of Transport should cease as a separate Ministry and         its functions  should be transferred to the  Board of Trade.  The Road         Department and the Electricity Commissioners should come under the         President of  the Board  of Trade.  (2.)  That  the  Department of Overseas  Trade  should  cease  as  a separate         Department and the necessary  duties in London be undertaken by the         Board of Trade.  (3.)  That the Mines Department should cease as a separate Department, the         various functions reverting  to  the Departments originally responsible         for them.  (4.)  That the Petroleum Department should be discontinued.  (5.)  That economies can be effected in connection with  the Surveys of Ships         and General Register of Shipping, and, after these economies  have         been  effected, the services should be placed on a  self-supporting basis.  (6.)  That there is  much  to  be said for grouping the aftermath services, as         detailed  in  our Report, and  for  removing  them from  the Board of   .         Trade.  (7.)  That  the  Net Estimates  for ordinary services of the Board of  Trade,         including all the  Departments covered  by  this  Part  of the  Report,         should be reduced from  1,887,856  to  1,350,000,  and  that the  Vote         for  Export  Credits should  be  limited  to   500,000  instead  of the          1,000,000  asked for in the  Provisional Estimate  and subsequently         increased to   2,500,000.V

Of this increase,  1,114,000 is accounted  for by newservices undertaken by the  Board since 1913/14,  leaving  624,000 as the additional cost of the pre-war  functions of  the Ministry;  an increase of 172 per cent., which isin excess  of any general rise in salaries, &amp;c.     We will now deal seriatim with the main heads under  which  the account  is setout above :                            A administrative Expenditure.                                                                  2.           1913/14 Audited  Expenditure   ...       ...     168,544             1921/22 Estimate       ...       ...       ...     956,653             1922/23 Provisional Estimate    ...       ...     658,677     The large drop in the estimated cost of Administrative Expenditure for 1922/23compared with the current year  is mainly due  to the Corn Production Acts (Repeal)Act, 1921, and to the automatic reduction of bonus.     Compared  with  1913/14,  the  Estimate  for  1922/23  shows  an increase  of 490,133, or 291 per cent., and so far as we have been able to ascertain, the principal    * Exclusive of  133,000 non-recurring expenditure for Herring Fisheries and  69,398 for agricultural wages Board.[7653]E

We  have ascertained that  the  new  item  of   20,000 included  for county agricultural  Committees includes a large margin for emergencies, and we suggest areduction of  10,000 under this heading.  This is in part a non-recurrent charge.    The activities of  the  Ministry under the Rats and Mice Act, 1919, include themanufacture of bait required by Government Departments.  We have seen a copy ofthe Trading Account of the Bait Factory, but no actual sales take place, and therefore the selling price  is merety one necessary to balance the account.  The total amountmanufactured up to the 31st March, 1921, was only 12,000 lbs. A much larger output is anticipated this year.  This manufacture is not in our opinion a necessary function of the Ministry of Agriculture, and we cannot believe that adequate and satisfactorysupplies  cannot  be obtained through trade channels.  All  large undertakings, suchas Railway,  Dock and Warehouse Companies require supplies of this nature, whichthey obtain without difficulty at a small cost.    Publicity, including the cost  of the Ministry Journal and leaflets, costs  10,275.We are told  that the Journal  this year will be self-supporting, and that sales of leaflets cover  50  per  cent,  of the cost.  We think, having regard to fall in.  prices,a  gross  provision  of  8,000  should  suffice, towards which  there should be  anappropriation-in-aid of at least  7,000.  Any deficiency of receipts  should be met bya corresponding  reduction of expenditure.   . The above savings amount to about  45,000 to which must  be added the savings in headquarters  salaries and. wages, travelling expenses, and statistics which would.follow the proposed curtailment of the activities of the Ministry as set out later in&apos;this Report.   We consider that  the Estimate  for Administrative Expenditure onaccount of Agricultural, and Fishery Services should be reduced by at least   100,000.                       Agricultural Education and Research.                                                               3.            1913/14 Audited Expenditure    ...       ...     64,338             1921/22 Estimate      ...       ...       ...     567,810             1922/23 Provisional Estimate    ... ,      ...     364,760    The drop in the Estimate for 1922/23 compared with the current year is largely due to the inclusion of a non-recurring loan of  125,000 to Home Grown Sugar (Ltd.),in the 1921/22 Estimate under this heading.   It is probably too early to  express afinal opinion on  the efforts to develop home grown, sugar, but up till now tl^ results are extremely disappointing.  The original  capital was   500,000 of which  theGovernment subscribed one-half in the year 1920 and guaranteed 5 per cent, interest on the other half, and this guarantee has been fully operative hitherto and has to beprovided for in  the Estimates  for 1922/23.  Before reaching  the  production stage the company got into financial difficulties.  Further capital had to be provided  and 75,000 was  raised on a first mortgage,  and the Government advanced  125,000 on second mortgage.    Dividing the expenditure on Education and Research we find  that the  29,000spent on  Education  in 1913/14  has  increased  to   234,000 required for 1922/23.This expenditure is incurred on very much the same lines and with the same ideals as
 in tho wise of Education generally, and is disbursed on a percentage basis to the Local Authorities.  The average percentage payment is about 68 per cent.  In our interim report on Education and Health, we  point out the grave disadvantages of the percentage contribution.  The same disadvantages appear to be present here and we recommend the abolition of this basis.     It would be impossible, within the scope and time limits of an enquiry such as this, to investigate in detail the objects upon which this money for Education is being- spent.  We understand that the Ministry is already committed to grants to Colleges, Institutes,  &amp;e, at the present  rates  until October 1922,  the end of the present academic year, and  while we  consider that  a much greater reduction  should be effected in subsequent years, we suggest that all the country can afford at the present time is a lump sum grant of  175,000, to be appropriately divided by the Minister of Agriculture on the basis of lump sum or per capita grants.     The expenditure on Research has increased fiW 35,000 in 1913/14 to  113,000 required for 1922/23, of which  105,000 is to be paid for from the Development Fund.  This Fund, we are told, will stand at about  1,250,000 at the close of the present financial year.  Of this,   400.000  is the balance of the old Fund which has already  been   almost  entirely   earmarked  for  grants   by  the   Development Commissioners.     4.  The remaining  850,000 is a sum  which will be paid into the Fund by the Exchequer  in the current financial year on account  of  an  arrangement with the agricultural community at the time that the Corn Guarantee was repealed.  We are told that there was  an understanding at that time that this sum of  money would be placed at the disposal of the Development Commissioners  and the Ministry of Agriculture, to be applied by them on agricultural  development (mainly Education and Research) independently of the current expenditure borne on the Votes from year to year.     We understand that when this grant of  850,000 was made, no specific sum was laid down as the normal amount to be borne on the Vote and Development Fund for Education and  Research,  but we  can hardly think  that  the Government would undertake  that the  provision  of the special grant should  preclude substantial economies in future years from the abnormal rate of expenditure current.     We can only consider the  Development  Fund as Taxpayers&apos; money and we recommend  that the total provision for Research from the Vote and Development Fund should be restricted to  75,000 for 1922/23, making the total for Education and Research  250,000 apart from any grant which the Development Commissioners may recommend out of the above mentioned  850,000 placed at their disposal by the Exchequer when the  Corn  Guarantee was repealed.     We should like  to draw7 attention to the  fact that expenditure  from  the Development Fund does in fact result in recurring expenditure for future years which cannot well be discontinued when the money granted  from the Fund  is exhausted. We  consider that it should be definitely laid  down that future expenditure from the Fund or from the special grant of  850,000 should not  entail any additional future expense to the State when the  money  voted is exhausted :  in  other words, any  expenditure involving future  commitments should be  endowed  out of  the Fund,  otherwise Parliamentary control of expenditure is weakened. 5.  Live-Stock, Reduction of Disease, Improvement of Live-Stock and Light Horse      Breeding,             1913/14 Audited Expenditure   ...       ...     88,527             1921/22 Estimate      ...       ...       ...    233,160             1922/23 Provisional  Estimate    ...       ...    221,685    We are informed that  140,000 of the total amount  of  221,000 shown in theProvisional Estimate for 1922/23 is for compensation to owners of herds which haveto  be destroyed owing to their  having  been in contact with infection  such asFoot and Mouth Disease, Swine Fever, &amp;c.  A revised Estimate reduced the  140,000to   108,500.  This compares with  43,000 in 1913/14, but there has been considerabledisease during the last two years.    This money is voted in order to recoup the Local Taxation Account as requiredby statute for expenditure incurred in liquidating the claims which  have accrued inthe previous financial year, and it cannot be further reduced in the year under review.    The scheme for the encouragement of Light  Horse Breeding accounts for  30.000as  compared with  24,000 before the war. &quot; The object of the scheme is essentially      [7653]                                                       E  2
military  and in view of the  additional reductions  in cavalry recommended by theCommittee we doubt the necessity for its continuance. The fact that the annual show,at which the premiums are awarded,  has been already advertised  for  next monthas usual, makes it impossible  to do more in 1922/23 than to reduce the charge some-what further, but we think that the scheme should then be dropped from this Vote.     The administration of  &quot;The Horsebreecling Act,  1918,&quot; is estimated to  cost 8,000 of which about  two-thirds is recovered  by fees charged  for  veterinaryexaminations.  We think that the Act should be amended to permit of the fees being increased to cover the whole  cost of this service.     The improvement of Live-Stock  has increased from  3,400 before the war  to 34,000  to-day.  This object is no doubt very  desirable, but that  it should haveincreased tenfold appears to  us to be excessive activity in times when the  financial aspect  is  of  such  importance.   The  grants  to   Milk  Recording   Societiesaccount for  12,500  of  this  expenditure, apart  from considerable Administrativecost.   The  object   is   to  develop  the  formation  of  Societies  for recording the yields of  milk  cows so as  to promote the breeding of cows on lines of highmilk production.   It is stated that  the operation of  these Societies has  shownthat the average annual yield of milk per cow&quot; can be  increased from between 400and 450 gallons to  600 gallons and  upwards.  If the Ministry are successful  in securing a rapid extension of the scheme, there will obviously be on present lines a steady growth of expenditure on subsidies to the Societies.  We desire to point outthat if the above contention can be established, the scheme is plainly  of direct coni-mercial value to the Farmer,  and we consider that it should be possible, therefore, toplace it  upon a self-supporting  basis.  We understand that a Federation of theRecording Societies is contemplated, and we think that subsidies from Public funds should be discontinued.     The total provision for live-stock improvement  should,  we think, be reduced&apos;from  34,000 to  10,000.                 Land Settlement, Cultivation and Improvement.                                                                            1913/14 Audited Expenditure  ...       ...      44,250             1921/22 Estimate       ...      ...       ...     931.400             1922/23 Provisional Estimate   ...       ...     914,650     6. A revised Estimate for 1922/23 reduced the total amount required under this heading to  873,725.  The increase from  44,250 in 1913/14 to  873,725 in 1922/23reflects the policy adopted by the Government of settling men upon the land out ofPublic Funds.     The total capital sum which was  approved by  Parliament for this purpose was 20,000,000  for England and  Wales, and  3,500,000 for Scotland (which wild  bedealt with later), making  23,500,000 altogether.  This sum is provided  from the consolidated  Fund through  the Public Works Loan  Commissioners, and is lent tothe  Local Authorities or in Scotland to the Board  of Agriculture.  In  addition,Local Authorities in England  and Wales have power to borrow money in the open market, but little has been raised in this way.  These Authorities buy or lease land,equip it and let it to small-holders on what is considered a reasonable rent, subjectto the approval of the Ministry of Agriculture.     The Local Authorities pay interest and sinking fund on  the amounts  borrowedby them, and the difference between these charges  and the  net rents obtained fromthe holdings has to be made good out of monies provided by Parliament.  The amountprovided for this purpose in the  Provisional Estimate for 1922/23 was  750,000.     The  present position of the Land Settlement Scheme  in England and Walesmay be summarised as  follows  :          Total capital  commitments as at December 31,1921    15,385,000Area of land purchased or leased       ...      ...       257,393 acres.No. of small holdings covered by commitments   ...        17,297No. of small-holders already settled (included above)        14,297No.  of qualified  and approved applicants  not  yet        provided- for      Ex-Service       ...       ...       ...      ...         7,593     Civilians         ...       ...       ...      ...         4,749No.  of applicants awaiting interview, &amp;c.      ...         9,255

The increased expenditure provided for 1922/23 compared with 1913/14 ismore than accounted for by the increased remuneration of the staff, which has beenreduced in numbers.

This item is merely included as a precaution, and, in view of the need for economy, we are  of the opinion that expenditure of this kind, which cannot before seen, should not be provided for  in the Votes.                          The Fisheries Department.                                                  1913/14 Audited Expenditure    ...       ...     19,1391921/22 Estimate       ...      ...       ...     67,4301922/23 Provisional Estimate    .......     24,355                                      29    The Ministry of Agriculture anticipate that the effective number to be providedfor, after the  17,297, for which commitments have already been entered  into,  are settled, will be only 7,500.    The Ministry have supplied particulars showing that for schemes approved upto the 30th June, .1921, the average capital cost per holding of 14-7 acres was  849,and the average annual  loss to the State  29 16s.    We are informed that consequent upon  alterations in policy and administra-tion, and the fall in prices, considerable economies have recently been effected.  Onschemes approved during the six months ended the 31st October, 1921, the averagecapital cost per holding of 11-2 acres has been  448, and the annual loss  13  perholding, and in many cases there are no buildings provided, which accounts  for thelow average cost.   The Headquarters expenditure at the Ministry in 1922/23 will be 75,000, which is equal to about  4 per holding per annum additional loss, which seems very high.    We would point out that, as in the case of Housing Schemes, the same  viciousprinciple  applies that the Local  Authorities who administer the estates have  nofinancial interest  in economy.    The actual loss each year up to the 1st April, 1926, is borne by the Taxpayer,but in that year it  will  take a different form.  The holdings will be taken over bythe Local Authorities on a valuation and the definite liability of the Government willbe ascertained. If the full scheme is carried out, it is estimated by the Ministry that from first to last out of a capital expenditure of about  20,000,000 there  will be a loss of about  8,000,000.    While there would appear to be no possibility  of avoiding the heavy  burden which the Land Settlement Scheme has thrown upon public funds,  we consider that atany rate under the present financial conditions the further acquisition of land by LocalAuthorities should be restricted as far as  possible  to  those cases where holdingscan be provided on an economic basis,  which was the  theory before the war.   Inaddition, however, to this restriction we feel that the limit of  20,000,000  should bereduced,  and  that capital expenditure  under the Act  of 1919  should not exceed 17,000,000.    The. amount  for  which commitments  have  been entered  into  is &quot;15,385,000, so that the reduced limit still leaves a margin of  1,615,000.    7. In  addition to the lands purchased by Local Authorities,  we understand thatthere are  certain properties held by the Ministry itself under the Small  HoldingsColonies Act.  We consider that unless this land can be divided into small holdings onan economic basis it should  be sold,  with  consequent  improvement in the  Budgetposition in 1922/23 and in numbers of  staff at the Ministry.    8. Other items included in the Provisional Estimate are  25,000 for Land Drain-age Schemes and  4,000  for grants to the Agricultural  Organisation Society for organising co-operation amongst small  holdings.  We suggest that these items ofexpenditure should be limited to 50 per  cent, of the amounts proposed.                         Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.
    11.  Compared with the current year, the expenditure under this heading has beenvery severely cut.  Fishing is an important  industry to this country, and the total amount included  for Research under this heading and the heading  of Administra-tive Staff is  34,000.  Apart from small reductions in Administrative cost  coveredby our recommendation (paragraph 1) as to a general cut in Administrative  Cost of 100,000, we do not make any further recommendation. We refer to this again in chapter III, under the heading of Fishery Board, Scotland.

This scheme for assisting ex-officers and men is a post-Armistice measure whichcannot,  in the view of the Committee, be amended at this date.  It is  a rapidly-diminishing charge, which must  be left to work itself out.                              CONCLUSIONS.    As  a result of our consideration, we are of opinion :-    (1.) That Administrative expenditure should  be reduced  by  100,000.    (2.) That, apart  from the sum  set aside for  Education and Research under           the Corn  Production Acts  (Repeal) Act, 1921, the amount for  this           service should be reduced from   364,760 in Provisional Estimate  for           1922/23 to  259,000, and that the system of percentage grants should           be abolished.    (3.) That economies should be made in the expenditure on the Reduction of           Disease,   Improvement  of  Live-stock   and   Light  Horse-breeding           amounting to  87,000.    (4.)  That Land Settlement is proving much more costly than could have been           anticipated,  the  present  annual  loss  under  the  Land  Settlement           (Facilities) Act, 1919, alone being  759,909 apart from Headquarters           cost.  That, in view of this fact, further acquisition  of land under the           Act of 1919 should  be restricted, as far as  possible,  to  cases where           holdings can be provided on an economic basis, and that  a limit of            17,939,900  total  expenditure  be  substituted  for   29,090,000  at           present  in force.    (5.)  That, in view of all the circumstances, the Net Estimate of the Ministry           of Agriculture should be reduced from  2,050,171 to  1,765,009,  and           reductions in grant from  the Development Fund  amounting to  42,500           should be  made.
                                Chapter  II.                BOARD OF AGRICULTURE (SCOTLAND).    1. The provisional Estimate for 1922/23, compared with the actual expenditurein 1913/14, and the Estimate for the current year, is as follows :                                                                          1913/14 Audited Expenditure   ...      ...    233,245            1921/22 Net  Estimate  ...       ...      ...    452,064            1922/23 Provisional Net Estimate       ...    355,971    This Vote  may  conveniently be  divided  under the main headings  set  out below :  -	1913-14.	1921-22.	1922-23.Administrative Expenditure ..

We  deal seriatim  with the main  heads  under which  the Vote has been setout above.                         A dministratire Expenditure.                                                                         1913/14 Audited Expenditure    ...      ...      31,619            1921/22 Net Estimate  ...       ...      ...     177,041            1922/23 Provisional Net Estimate       ...     159,677    2. This heading represented 13 per cent, of the net Estimates for ordinary services in 1913/14, whereas in 1922/23 this percentage has increased to 42 per cent.    The main item included under this heading is Salaries and Wages,  and we areinformed that since the  provisional Estimate for 1922/23 was submitted,  a reductionof  11,161 has  been accepted.   The cost of salaries and  wages has increased from 24,555 in 1913/14 to  135,270, or by 450 per cent., and we are informed that, apartfrom War Bonus and normal growth owing  to operation of salary scales, nearlythe whole of this increase is due to extra staff engaged for Land Settlement.    Weare suggesting a restriction   of  the present  activities  in  several  directions,particularly under the Land Settlement Act, 1919, which  we consider should enablethis heading to  be reduced to  130,000 for 1922/23.
Grants to Agriculture (Scotland) Fund and for Land Settlement Deficit.                                       Grants to       Grant to meet  -                                       Agriculture     Land Settlement                                     (Scotland) Fund.      Deficit.       1913/14          ......    185,000       1921/22          ......    200,000        15,000       1922/23 Provisional Estimate    140,000        35,000     3. The Agriculture (Scotland) Fund was established by the Small Landholders (Scotland) Act, 1911, and. took  over the credit balance of the Congested Districts Fund, together with an annual income of not more than  185,000 of Voted monies and of  15,000 from the Scottish Local Taxation Account,   In addition,  15,000 annually  for ten years has  been provided by the Land Settlement (Scotland) Act, 1919, for the purpose of improving Crofter housing.    A further capital  sum of  150,000  for expenditure  over a  series of years  on Agricultural Development (mainly Education and Research) has  also been provided in connection with the cessation  of the  Corn Guarantee.   All this  money  goes  into  the Agriculture (Scotland) Fund.     The Fund is administered by the Board on the authority of the Secretary for Scotland,  and  expenditure  is  not  shown  on the Estimates  or subject  to  direct Treasury  control.   We  do not  see any reason why the expenditure of  the Board in respect of its general duties as an agricultural Department should Hot be shown in the annual  Estimates  in the usual way, and we suggest that the Government should consider whether it  would not be better to confine the. expenditure of the Fund  to  Land Settlement  and  Crofter housing,  and reduce  the  Grant-in-Aid accordingly, leaving the expenditure for general agricultural  purposes to be voted annually,  thereby  bringing  this expenditure under  direct Parliamentary control. Details of the Pund are  given in Appendix (A).  It will be seen that the balance of over  262,240 in 1913 will have fallen to  23,281  by the end of 1922/23, even if the full amounts asked for are  voted,  and  we  therefore think  this is  a suitable opportunity for reviewing the position of the Fund on the lines  suggested.     The  Board propose  a reduction .of  60,000  in  the grant to be  made by Parliament to  the Agricultural Fund  for  1922/23  as  compared with the current year.  A  detailed allocation of the proposed expenditure from the Fund in 1922/23 on Agricultural purposes  is also given in Appendix (A).  We are struck with the large proportion of the  amount available for Agriculture which is  allocated to Education and  Research, viz.,  66,125  out of  a total expenditure of   111,914. This is in addition to the sum of  46,345 shown in the Vote under the heading of Agricultural Education and Research,  so that the total amount  to be expended on Education and Research  in  1922/23  is  112,470, which compares with a proposed expenditure for England and Wales  of  364,760.  We consider  that under present financial conditions this expenditure should be  capable of a reduction of  50,000, thus leaving   62,470, or rather more than one-sixth of the provision for England and Wales, which  is approximately the  ratio of the Agricultural population of the two countries.  If additional facilities are required in Scotland, there remains the special grant of  150,000 made as a sequel to the Repeal of the Corn Production Act, and we think an endeavour should  be made to obtain contributions from Local Authorities as in England.    The amount allocated, from the  Fund for the Improvement of Live-Stock and Florse  Breeding is  38,237, and there is a further item of  2,060 in the Estimate for expenditure under the Horse Breeding Act,  making a total  of  40,297.  this expenditure compares  with  72,675  in England  and Wales, and  we  suggest a considerable reduction should be effected.    It is also proposed to spend   5,030 from the Pund on  the  Scottish Seed Testing Station compared with  3,850 on the Seed Testing Station in England. Unless fees can be charged to reduce the cost to the State, we think that a reduction of  2,000 under this heading should  be enforced.    Having regard to these suggestions, we consider that the expenditure from the Fund for  Agricultural purposes should be reduced from  111,914 to  80,000, out of which  should be met the   16,934 under the heading of Education and research in the Votes as suggested later (paragraph 7).    The remaining items paid for out of the Fund are for Rural Housing. Land Settlement (pre-war), which do not appear capable  of reduction.   The definite
joumiitments for Public Works, however, amount to roughly  5,000, and while thereis a contingent liability on the remaining  5,000, we consider that the provision of 8,000 in all should be sufficient.                               Land Settlement.    4.  The Grant-in-Aid of  35,000 to meet the deficit under the Land Settlement(Scotland) Act, 1919, represents the loss incurred during the current year, andtherefore this amount cannot be  reduced.    The total capital  sum which was approved by Parliament for Land settlement for Scotland was  3,500,000.  The system of settlement is broadly analogous to thatin England and Wales, except that the Board  in Scotland itself performs the dutiesundertaken by the  Local Authorities in England and Wales.  Further, in certain cases, landholders may be required to permit small-holders to settle on their estates.    The  present  position of the  Land  Settlement  Scheme  in  Scotland may besummarised  as follows:         Capital Commitments (including  57,615 coin-            pensation paid  out of Agricultural Fund)    2,666,252        Number of Small Holdings  covered by Commit-            ments        ...       ...       ...       ...        2,772        Number of Small Holders already settled   ...         974        Number of Applicants waiting to be settled             Ex-Service Men       ...       ...     3,162            Civilians    ...       ...       ...     6,710                                                --        9,872    The deficit for 1921/22, which  amounted to  35,000,  may  therefore reach amaximum deficit of  200,000 per  annum on present commitments.  This sum will beincreased to the extent to  which loans for  the provision  of  stock  prove  to beirrecoverable.    Under  these  circumstances  further commitments  should  be  restricted asfar  as  possible  to  provide  for  pressing needs such  as in the Highlands, and capital Expenditure under the  Act  of 1919  should  not  exceed   3,000,000.The amount for which commitments have been  entered into is  2,666,000 so that thislimit would allow a margin of  334,000.    Apart from the Highlands, we think that Land Settlement in Scotland  should now revert generally to the pre-war basis.    This proposal, if  adopted, will relieve the Taxpayer  of the liability to provide further capital amounting to  500,000, and  will  restrict the annual  deficit.  Inaddition considerable economies should be effected in the staff of the Board.                               Horse Breeding.                                                                           1913/14 Audited Expenditure      ...     ....    2,929            1921/22 Net Estimate     ...       ...       ...    2,260            1922/23 Net Estimate     ...       ...       ...    2,060    5. As in the case of England and Wales a considerable proportion of the cost of administering the Act of 1918 is recovered by fees for Veterinary Examinations, andwe have  already recommended for  England and  Wales  that the  Act should be amended so as to permit of fees being increased to cover the whole cost of the service.                             Land Impraoement.    6. The Provisional Estimate of  3,540 required  under this heading is mainly dueto remanet expenses arising from the exercise of powers under the  Defence  of the realm Regulations, and cannot be reduced.                     Agricultural Education and Research.                                                                          1913/14 Audited Expenditure     ...       ...    26,183            1921/22 Net Estimates   ...       ... -      ...    43,389            1922/23 Provisional Net Estimate ...       ,.,    46,345      [76&apos;53J                                                           p
    7. We have already dealt with the expenditure on Education and Research fromthe Agriculture  (Scotland) Fund. The above Estimate is for additional grants andis made up of three separate grants as follows :                                                                          (a.)

Additional  grants for  Capital  Expenditure               and  maintenance of Research  Stations at               Agricultural Colleges, &amp;c, Research Scholar-               ships and other  expenditure under schemes               to be approved over a period of five years ...     13,346        .(e.) Grants to Scottish Agricultural and Veterinary               Colleges for  maintenance       ...      ...     16,934    Expenditure under  (a)  and (/;) is borne on  the Development Fund,  and weconsider that (a), which is a revote, should be deleted except for  2,592 to which weunderstand the Board is definitely committed, and  that (b) should also  be reduced tounavoidable commitments.    With regard to (c), this item  should  be considered  in  conjunction with  theexpenditure of  53,000 for  the maintenance of Agricultural  Colleges included inthe proposed allocation of expenditure from the Agriculture (Scotland)  Fund. Weconsider the whole grant to Agricultural  Colleges  should be  paid for out of the agriculture (Scotland) Fund  reduced  as suggested.   All these  items of duplicategrants specifically voted and  made from the  Agriculture Fund illustrate the difficultyof enforcement of  strict Treasury and Parliamentary control.  *                        Training of ex-Officers and Men.    8. The Provisional Estimate of  5,000 for assisting ex-officers  and  men  isa rapidly diminishing charge, and we  make no recommendation.                          CONCLUSIONS.As  a result of our consideration, we  are of opinion: (1.) That  Administrative  Expenditure should be reduced  from  159,677  to        130,000.(2.) That  the whole cost  of Education and  Research should be reduced by        50,000  and borne on the Agriculture (Scotland) Fund and Develop-       ment Fund.(3.) That Land  Settlement under the  Act of 1919 should be kept within a limit       of  3,000,000 instead of  3,500,000 at present authorised, and  that       expenditure within that  figure should  be limited to pressing needs.(4.) That after the next financial year all expenses in connection with Agricul-       ture  should  be charged to  the  Votes,  and   that  the Agriculture       (Scotland) Fund  should be limited to Land  Settlement and  Crofter       Housing.(5.) That, in view of all  the circumstances,  the Estimates of the Board  of       Agriculture (Scotland)  should be reduced from  355,971 to  275,000.

The total expenditure of  the Fishery Board has increased  from  24,770 in1913/14 to  76,561 for 1922/23, an increase of  51,791 or 209 per  cent.    Since the above Provisional Estimate for 1922/23 was  submitted, reductions of  4,203 in the  amount to be voted and of  7,647 in the amount to be expended fromthe Development Fund have been agreed.    The statutory functions of the Fishery Board have not increased since 1913/14and the increased cost is attributable to the growth of the fishing industry in Scotlandand the greater activities of the Board.  The total staff employed excluding specialistswhose salaries are paid out of Development Fund grants has  increased from 74 in1913 to 92 for  1922/23 made up as follows :-        A administrative Staff                                                    1913/14.      1922/23.

The cost of administrative staff has increased from   14,180 in 1913/14 to 40,741 for 1922/23.  An increase of 187 per cent.    The total headquarters&apos; staff shown for  1922/23  is 31 compared  with 21 in1913/14, and a considerable portion of this staff is engaged on statistical work.  Wewould  like to draw attention to the elaborate  nature  of these statistics which is described in the Fishery Board&apos;s Annual Report as follows :--         &quot; In addition to the annual returns the officers throughout the year furnish    weekly reports on the fisheries  of their respective districts, while, during the    summer fishery, a daily telegram is forwarded to the head office indicating that    at a, certain hour in the afternoon so many vessels have arrived with an average    catch of so many crans, the quality of the herrings landed, prices realised, the    location  of the fishery grounds and  the weather conditions, the information    as to fishing grounds being in turn plotted each week on charts prepared for    the  purpose.   A  detailed weekly  return  (based on  information supplied by    correspondents) is also submitted of the number of boats fishing daily, the daily    catch, prices, fishing grounds, and the quality cured, branded and exported, this    information being also embodied (more concisely) in a telegram addressed to the    head office every  Monday for communication to the press.   Officers are  also    authorised to exchange wires daily as to the catch, fishing  grounds and prices,    and these wires  are posted up  at  the mart, for the information of fishermen,    salesmen  and curers.&quot;    Note. The Italics are ours.    It appears to us that if this information is of importance to the fishermen, curersand  the fishing industry  generally  it should be possible  to institute a  charge for supplying the  information  required,   which  would  cover  the  cost  involved,or  preferably  that  the  industry   should  organise  the  work  itself.   If  the particulars  obtained  are not  worth  paying for Ave  suggest the statistics should bq
drastically curtailed, and the staff at ports, which number 38, reduced.  In addition the fishery correspondents should  be abolished.    The scientific staff for 1922/23 numbers 20 compared with 13 before the war.The total amount spent under the various headings on scientific investigation and research amounts to  19,708. Apart, however, from the above remarks as to telegrams which are more of a commercial character, we make no recommendation as we fully recognise the importance of the fishing industry in Scotland.  Our research work isnot more than that of other nations with whom we collaborate having regard to  the size of the industry.    3.  The remaining items on the Vote and Development Fund appear to have been severely curtailed.                              CONCLUSION.    After full consideration, we are of opinion that the Vote should be reduced from 57,629 to  50,090, and that the  expenditure forecast from the Development fund should  be reduced  from   18,932 to    11,285,  making a  total  reduction  in expenditure  of  15,276.
                           ORDNANCE  SURVEY.                                                                           1913/14 Audited Expenditure   ...      ...    210,199             1921/22  Net Estimate  ...       ...      ...    335,346             1922/23 Provisional  Net Estimate       ...    278,646    Since the above Estimate was submitted a revised Estimate  of   268,276 hasbeen put forward.    1. The  staff  now numbers 1,388,  as compared with 2,077 in 1913/14.   Of thepresent number 342 arc established Civil Servants and 192 are serving soldiers.    2. The  transfer  of  the  responsibility for making the Ordnance  Survey ofIreland to the Parliament of Northern Ireland  and the Irish Free State will enable a saving to be made in stall amounting to 245 and a reduction in the Estimates of 58.000.    3. At the present time the large scale maps (6-inch and 25-inch) are revised asunder            40 per cent, of the surface of the United Kingdom once in forty years.         60 per cent, of the surface of the United Kingdom once in twenty years.The question of the necessity for the  revision once in twenty years of such a  largeportion of the surface has been discussed with the  Department, and they  agree thatthe twenty-year revision should be confined to  boroughs, urban  districts  and  ares which  have undergone  considerable change since the  last revision.   A limitation ofthis character Avould result in a  saving  of 143 in staff and  a reduction  in theEstimates of  30,000, and we recommend that this change be introduced  forthwith.    4. A gross income of  100,000 is realised from the sale of maps,  and the Depart-ment have suggested that certain small increases in price of the 6-inch and 25-inchmaps could probably be made, resulting in an increased revenue of  8,000 per annum,and we recommend that these  increases be approved  and introduced without delay.    5. We have made  enquiries with  regard to the position of Royalties payable by private firms of map-makers, and gather that the position is not entirely satisfactory.Having regard to the great benefits  these firms enjoy  by  the  use  of the accurate information  contained in the  Government publications, we think  that substantialRoyalties should be obtained in every  case,  and we recommend that steps be taken.legislative, if necessary, with a view to ensuring this revenue.    6.  The Department is evidently fully alive to  the situation, and is economisingwherever possible.                               CONCLUSION.    The transfer of the duties in regard to the  Survey of Ireland, and the adoptionof the above  recommendations,  will  result in  a reduction of  the  Estimates  from 278,646 to   172,646, or a saving of  106,000.
                         FORESTRY  COMMISSION.     1. The Forestry Commission was set up under the Forestry Act, 1919, which provides for the payment of  31- millions to the Forestry Fund, spread over a period of ten years in such annual amounts as Parliament may from time to time determine.     The amounts voted each year, as grants to the Forestry Fund, and the estimated amount required for 1922/23, are as follows:                                                                             1919/20        ...      ...       ...       ...     99,000              1920/21        ...      ...       ...       ...    379,000             1921/22        ...      ...       ...       ...    200,000              1922/23  (Provisional Estimate)  ...       ...    275,000     2. We are informed that the activities of the  Forestry Commissioners are based upon the report of  the Reconstruction Committee, dated May 1917.  This report proposed the afforestation with conifers of 1,180,000  acres in forty years, of which 200,000 acres were  allotted to the first decade, 75 per  cent, to  be planted by the State.   In addition, 20,000 acres of  land  suitable  for hard woods were to  be acquired; private owners were to  be encouraged by means of grants to afforest and to re-plant felled areas, and education and research were to be  subsidised.     3. The present  position may  be briefly summarised as  follows :           Amount expended, or to be expended, to March 31, 1922    578,000         Acres acquired            England   ...       ...       ...      ...      37,000           Wales     ...       ...       ...      ...      10,000           Scotland   ...       ...       ...      ...      81,000           Ireland    ...       ...       ...      ...       6,000                                                     ---     134,000 acres.         Acres planted, or to be planted, before March 31, 1922     20,000 acres.     In  addition to  the  above acreage, the Forestry Commission have  taken  over 14,000 acres acquired in Ireland prior to 1919.     Of the 134,000  acres acquired in  the United Kingdom, we  are  informed that about 70 per cent,  is suitable for Forestry work, the rest being hilly and stony land. The  average cost per plantable acre is roughly 50s.  for land purchased; but about 70 per cent, of the  total acreage  has been acquired on  lease or  feu  at an  average annual cost of 2s.  9d. per acre.     We would draw attention to the fact that of the  134,000 acres  acquired, 81,000 acres, or  60 per cent., are situated in  Scotland, whereas in time of Avar the most important demand is for pit props for South Wales, as practically all  the Admiralty coal  is drawn from this source.     We have enquired into the question of the accessibility of the acreage purchased, and  understand that 90 per cent, is within 5 miles of a railway station  or seaport, 5 per cent,  is between 5 and 10 miles  away,  and the  remaining 5 per cent, is over 10 miles aAvay. These distances are measured as the crow flies and really give  very little indication as to the accessibility of the timber.     4. The Forestry Commission  does not surrender any sums unspent at the end  of the financial year, and will carry over from the  present financial year  100,000. They have indicated that they are prepared to spread  this amount  over the next three years  and to reduce the grant-in-aid required for 1922/23 from  275,000  to 200,000.  They suggest that if this is done the grants-in-aid for future years shouldbe fixed as follows :                                                                             1923/24       ...       ...      ...       ...    260,000             1924/25       ...       ...      ...       ...   280,000             1925/26       ...      ...      ...       ...    330,000             1926/27       ...      ...      ......    330,000    To complete the payments into the Fund under the Forestry Act, 1919, the following  payments  would be  required:                                                                            1927/28       ...      ...       ...       ...    711,000            1928/29       ...      ...       ......    711,000
     5. We are impressed with the fact that of the proposed grant of  200,000 for 1922/23  only   92,000 would  be available for  cultural purposes,  the  remaining  108,000 being required for overhead and ancillary charges as follows :                                                                              Rents and  Feu Duties  ...       ...       ...      20,000             Payments  for  standing  timber, &amp;c,  on                  acquisition by lease or feu   ...       ...      10,000 to 20,000             Advances  for  afforestation       ...       ...      10,000             Education and research ...       ...       ...      16,000             Advisory Services, Consultative  Committees,                  Publications, &amp;c.   ...       ...       ...       2,000             Salaries  and  allowances  of  Headquarters                  Staff,  Assistant  Commissioners&apos; Offices,                  Divisional Offices   ...       ...       ...      40,000 to 50,000     6.  It appears to us that the whole  question of Government afforestation needsfurther consideration in existing financial circumstances.     If the Commission spend  193,000, as they anticipate, during the six month sending the 31st March next they will still have an unspent  balance of  100,000.     If the amount of  200,000 asked for next year is provided the funds availablefor period the  1st October, 1921, to the 31st March, 1923 (two planting seasons),would be as under :                                                           $                 Estimated  Expenditure October   1,  1921-                 March 31,  1922    ...        ...      ...    193,000             Balance at March 31, 1922       ...      ...    100,000             Unemployment  Grant   ...        ...      ...    250,000             Vote for 1922/23       ...        ...       ...    200,000743,000    7. The Commissioners justify the expenditure of  3-^ millions on Forestry in tenyears on the  following grounds :       (i.)  That the drain on the coniferous forests of the world is increasing yearly,           and any country which has no indigenous supplies is  to a certain extent           placing her industrial future in the hands of others.     (ii.)  That practically every civilised country in the world has  recognised the need           for  securing  future timber supplies, and considerable developments are           taking place, not only in Europe, but in America and the Dominions.    (iii.)  That timber production is a matter for  the  State rather than the private           individual.     (iv.)  That a  home  supply of timber  is a general  insurance in peace against           profiteering and also provides a form of rural employment.      (v.)  That Home Forests  are a necessary assent in War.    8. It is obvious to us that the expenditure at present being incurred and forecastis merely  the  prelude  to  a  gradually  extending  policy,  and  an organisation including provision for Education and Research-is being built  up to  cope with iton the largely extended scale.  &apos;    As regards the first justification which the Commissioners give, that the drain on the coniferous forests of the world is increasing and that without an indigenoussupply a  country  may find itself as regards its industrial future in  the  hands of others.  We cannot learn that the Home-grown timber ever seriously competed withtimber from other countries.  At a time of abnormally high prices, our experienceof extensive State trading  in Home-grown timber  has resulted in a very substantialloss.  This experience  affords little  encouragement to  further ventures in Home-grown timber  of a  far-reaching character, involving not only the felling  andconversion of the  forests, but  the planting and cultivation also.    We have been supplied with a great deal of information on the subject, but are quite unconvinced that there  is any prospect of State afforestation in  this countrybeing an economically sound proposition.    The second justification is that  practically every civilised country  in the worldis going in for afforestation,  and that therefore we should do so.  Circumstances
differ in various countries, and we do not think that this reason by itself is sufficient justification for vast expenditure of the kind contemplated at the present time.    The third justification given by the Commissioners is that timber production isa matter for the State rather than for the private individual.  With the present high rates of interest and wages, afforestation is not, in our opinion, likely to be a soundcommercial investment, and the State has not in present circumstances any surpluscapital to invest in an undertaking, the returns of which are distant and  doubtful.    The fourth reason  given is  that  a Home supply of  timber  is  an insurance against profiteering in peace, and provides a form of rural employment.  We havealready dealt with the first point above.  To create employment on an uneconomicbasis cannot be justified.    The fifth, and perhaps the most important, reason is that Home forests are a necessary asset in war.  This may be so, but the same might be said of Home-grown wheat, and the whole gamut  of articles of food, clothing and armament which wedo not produce in  this country.    In  any event, the  Forestry  Commission appear to  us to own  land  not  in immediate  proximity to the rail and too far from the industrial  areas where the timber will be  used or shipped in time of war.    The preponderance of land  inScotland is certainly  in the  wrong  place from  this  point  of  view, and in thatcountry, although the all-over price of land may be low, something  like 50  per cent.of the land acquired is unfit for afforestation, and with land at 50s. an acre, costing 8  to  plant,  the  planting and carriage  and not  the cost of the  land are the predominant factors.    We do not wish to say that  no money should  be  spent upon  encouraging thegrowth of indigenous timber  in this country, but we suggest that  a review shouldbe taken of the situation, and that before further money is spent on the organisationof a Forestry Service and Education and Research, the Government should decide how far it can afford to go in the next twenty years.   In our judgment, a decision should now be taken that no further land should be acquired  for forestry purposes,and that no land which has already been acquired in districts not readily accessibleby rail or from the seaport or too far  from the industrial areas where consumptionwill take place should be planted.    9.  We  think that the Forestry Commission should, in the interests of  economy,be merged in the Ministry  of Agriculture.  Any small sum which is  necessary for education and Research, or to fulfil a commitment which we are  informed has been entered into with the Dominions as to a survey of timber resources, should be borne on the Ministry of Agriculture Vote in subsequent years.    We recognise the enthusiasm and public spirit of the Commissioners, but  in thepresent  condition  of  the  country&apos;s  finances,  we  cannot recommend that this expenditure which will always show a  heavy  loss and which  cannot reach fullfruition for something like eighty years should be continued.                              CONCLUSIONS.    After full  consideration of the circumstances, we are of opinion:     (1.)  That the  scheme of  afforestation by f;he State should be discontinued.    (2.)  That the  Vote of  275,000 for  1922/23 should not be allowed and that           steps should be taken to  cancel the  power to spend the remaining            2,822,000 of the total of  3,500,000  authorised under  the  Forestry           Act, 1919.    (3.f That  any unspent balance in  the  Fund  should  be surrendered to the           Exchequer after meeting  any  liabilities  accruing in 1922/23 in respect           of timber survey.[7653]G

POLICE  (ENGLAND AND WALES). 	Voted Money.	Payments from Consolidated Pund.	Total Exchequer Contribution.Audited expenditure 1913/14 Estimated net expenditure 1921/22 1922/23	  109,241 6,741,474 7,044,600	  2,863,000 2,917,000 2,917,000	  2,972,000 9,658,000 9,961,000     1.  It will be observed from the above figures that the total Exchequer contribution towards the cost of the Police in England and Wales, i.e. (i) Metropolitan Police, and (ii) County and  Borough Police Forces, comprises two grants,  viz. (1)  Voted Money, and (2) Payments  from the  Consolidated Fund.     Both the Metropolitan Police and the  County and Borough Police Forces (of which there are 180 separate Forces  in England and Wales) are paid for jointly by the  Taxpayer,  in the form of contributions from the Exchequer, and by the Rate- payer.  The Metropolitan  Police are administered by the  Commissioner of Metro- politan Police  under  the Secretary of State for Home Affairs,  whereas the County and Borough Police are under the primary responsibility  of the Local Authority, though the  Home Secretary has some supervisory  powers. Grant System.     2.  Prior to the war, two Exchequer grants were paid towards  the cost  of the Police under the &quot;Assigned Revenues&quot;  system, viz. (1)  300,000 was paid  to the several pensions funds under &quot;The Local Taxation (Customs and Excise) Act, 1890,&apos;&apos;&apos; and (2) a grant was made by the  Exchequer under &quot; The Local Government Act, 1888.&quot;   In  County  and County Boroughs,  this latter  grant amounted to one-half the cost of the pay and clothing of the Force, but in the Metropolitan  Police District the grant was the  equivalent of a 4fi.  rate over  the area.     For some time before  the war, there had been a proposal  to revise the system and to charge  one-half of  the net cost of the Police to the Exchequer  (the  Police being regarded as a semi-national service),  and this proposal was embodied  in the Finance Bill of 1914, which was dropped on the outbreak of war. In  1918, however, the Government decided to raise the pay of the Metropolitan Police, and they also decided that it was necessary for the State to  bear one-half of the net cost of the whole  Police of the country, with a proviso that  the State should have a stricter control of the rates of pay and should have power to withhold the grant if the Police service was not properly performed.  The result of this change of system as applied to an enormously increased net expenditure (owing to increased pay of Police)  has been that, whereas in  1913/14 the total  Exchequer contribution to the Police was  2,972,000  (composed  of  109,241 Voted Money  and  2,863,000 grant from  the Consolidated Fund), in the current year 1921/22, the Exchequer contribution  has risen to  9,658,000, made up of  6,741,474 Voted Money and  2,917,000  grant from the Consolidated Fund.-                                        , Total Cost of the Police.     3. We have seen above that the change of the  grant system has coincided withthe very greatly increased cost of the Police as the result of advanced pay.  Owingto the change in the grant system, it is not possible to set the Estimates of 1914/15alongside those  of the current or the next financial years for  purposes of comparison,but the following table gives a true comparison of the expenditure on Police:                                             1913/14.           1922/23.        Total expenditure  on Police                                          (England and  Wales) ...         7,676,000         20,500,000        Towards which  Exchequer            contributed  ...      ...         2,972,000          9,961,000        Percentage  of   Exchequer            contribution...       ...        38*7 per cent.      48 &quot;6 per cent      [7H53I -                                                      G  2
     From these figures it will be seen that the total cost has increased by 167 percent., and that, under the present grant system, the Exchequer contributes 48&apos;6 percent, of   20-1  millions, whereas previously it only contributed 38-7 per cent, of 7^ millions.     The greater cost of the Police is almost entirely due to higher pay, allowances and pensions, and increased cost of clothing. The actual increase in the numbers ofPolice in the period between 1913/14 and the  current  year is comparatively small.The figures are :              1913/14         ...       ...        ...       ...     55,000             1921/22         ...       ...        ...       ...     55,723Suggested Economies.     4. There are only two means of effecting economies :          1. By reducing the numbers of Police; and/or         2. By reducing the cost per  head of Police.     So long as the present grant system continues, under which one-half of the net expenditure of the  Local Authorities on Police is made up  by grants  from theExchequer, the full incentive to economise is not given  to the Local Authorities whospend the money, and the Flome Office is  in a position  of comparative impotence toenforce economies.     In the course of this Report, we point out various minor directions in whichwe think that economies can be effected,  even  under the present grant system, butwe have  no doubt whatsoever that, as in the case of other Social Services which are paid for jointly by the Ratepayer and the Taxpayer, economy can only be obtained in the present circumstances if the Local Authorities are limited to a fixed grant for police.     We  fully recognise that a fixed  grant per  capita of the Police in their presentnumbers would work out unfairly, since we understand that some Local Authoritieshave been stricter than others in fixing their numbers, and a per capita grant on present numbers  would be unfavourable  to those who have already been the more economical.  We understand that the  Home Office have  not yet themselves consideredan alternative to the present system of grants, but that they are satisfied that a formal  investigation  of the  strength of the Police Porces as a whole would leadto  considerable  reductions.   As  we shall show  later on,  the  Commissioner of metropolitan Police is so reviewing the requirements of the Metropolis.     In the other Forces, Home Office  supervision is exercised through His Majesty&apos;sInspectors of  Constabulary, who are in  touch with the Local Police Authorities.These Inspectors, however, are only two in number,  and their principal functionhitherto has been to ensure  that the  strength and efficiency of the Forces  have been properly maintained.     We therefore suggest  that a full investigation should now be made as to thestrength of all the Police Forces, beginning with those whose present establishmentappears to be on a more generous scale than the average, and that the Home office should  at  once endeavour to arrive at  a basis of the numbers required for the adequate policing of each area.   We think  that such a  basis,  calculated uponacreage, population and rateable value, should be introduced with the least possible delay, and that the Exchequer contribution should be limited to a fixed annual grant,calculated on the number of Police justified for each district on the new basis.  Onlyin this way, by a strict rationing of the grant,  do we think it possible to ensure thatthe numbers of Police will be adequately reduced.  In spite of the fact that the total numbers of police have only increased by  723 since  1914, we do not feel justified in accepting even the  1914 numbers as necessary,  and,  in view of  the  fact that  theaverage  total cost per head of Police in 1913/^14 was  139-6 arid is now   367 7, itis not necessary  to  emphasise how essential is the need for economy in  numbers.A saving of 5 per cent, on the  present numbers (55,723) would mean a saving of morethan  1,000,000, of which  one-half  would  accrue to the Exchequer.     But, apart from numbers, there  is the question of pay, pensions and allowances,which, as we have shown above, has resulted in a total  cost per head of Police rising from  1396 in 1913/14 to   367-7 in 1921/22, an increase of  228 or 163-5 per cent.     The present pay of the Police Forces is fixed in accordance with the First Reportof the Desborough  Committee of July 1919.  At that  date the cost of living figure had been steadily declining from 120 in January 1919 to 105 in June 1919, and the
                            METROPOLITAN POLICE.    The following figures have  been  supplied  to  us  showing  (a) the authorisednumbers, and  (b) the  actual numbers of the Metropolitan Police Force on the 31stDecember, 1913, and the 25th December, 1921, respectively :  NUMBERS at December 31, 1913.

A table is attached (Appendix (A)) showing the pre-war and  post-war rates  of  pay of Metropolitan and Provincial Police. Prom this it will be seen that the standard basic scales for Constables were  fixed at 70s.  to 95s. a week, and of Sergeants  at 100s. to 112s. %d. a week, with free  housing and uniform in both cases.  Further, the pay and pensions recommended by the Desborough Committee were standardised throughout the country.  Shortly after this scale was fixed in 1919,  the cost of living began to rise  very rapidly and a special scale  of bonus was added as a temporary measure, but this  has now ceased as the cost of living has fallen below the point  which was taken as the standard above which bonus became payable.   The question which we therefore have to consider is whether  all the considerations which weighed with the Desborough Committee now hold good.     The cost of living figure has  already dropped some way below the  105 which obtained when the Committee  reported,  and if  the cost of living  were the  only consideration, we  should feel  justified  in suggesting that the Government should review the wdiole of the Desborough scales, but in our opinion, the most important consideration is that  the work and responsibilities of the Police should be appro- appropriately  remunerated.  In  present circumstances  we do not suggest  a reduction at the present time of the pay of  the Metropolitan Police, though  we refer  later  on to certain possible reductions  in allowances.  We do, however, think that there is good ground  for differentiating  between the Metropolitan  and the Provincial Police in this  matter seeing that it is generally accepted in trades and occupations that  work in the Metropolis justifies a special rate of remuneration. Detailed Revieiu of Estimates for 1922/23.     5.  So far we have only stated our opinion that both the numbers and  cost of the Police might be substantially reduced as  the result of a detailed investigation for the purpose of arriving at  the  minimum strength required for each Force and at abasis upon which a fixed grant might be paid for the future in lieu of the presentpercentage grant.     As  regards  the  immediate future,  however,  we  have studied the  detailed estimates for the year 1922/23 and we make the following suggestions : 
    From the above figures, it will be seen that the present actual numbers are 280below the authorised strength, and that in the case of the Police chargeable to theMetropolitan Police Fund, the numbers are 253 short of the authorised establishment.In this  connection, the Commissioner  of  Metropolitan Police  has  explained to  us that since 1914 the annual  increase in the strength of the  Force which used to  bemade practically automatically to meet the increase in population and the additionalincrease since 1910 to  meet  the requirements of the Police  (Weekly Rest Day) Acthas  been  discontinued,  but apart  from  foregoing  this  automatic  increase,  theCommissioner has given  directions that the actual number of Metropolitan Police isto be kept at a figure at least 531, or 2^ per cent., within the authorised establishment.    The Commissioner is conducting  a minute review of the present number  of&quot;beats&quot; and  &quot;points,&quot;  whereby he hopes to effect a saving of a further  280 men,or a cost  of   100,000 to the Metropolitan Police Fund.  At  the  same time he isreviewing the &quot; Special Branch &quot; and contemplates substantial economies.    It is  the number  of &quot;beats&quot; and &quot;points&quot;  which determines the number  ofPolice required for ordinary duties. A statistical table is attached (Appendix (B))showing how  the Metropolitan  Police have been  employed during the last twelve years in relation to the  number of inhabited houses  and the length of Constables&apos;beats (in  miles).   From this table, it  will  be observed that the  total length  ofConstables&apos; beats in the  Metropolitan Police District has been reduced from 11,714miles in 1914/15  to 11,665 miles in 1920/21, but the number of Constables  employedon ordinary Police duty to each mile of their beats  has increased from 1-63 to 1-66.    Indeed, there has  been a gradual tendency  to increase the number of Constableson beats during the last  ten years, and this tendency is seen throughout the table inAppendix &quot;B.&quot;  For  example,  whereas  in 1909,  one Constable was employed  on ordinary duty to 450  of  the population, in 1920/21  there is one Constable to every386 of the population.  Whereas,  in 1909, there was one Constable to 71 inhabitedhouses, in 1920/21, there was one Constable to 66 inhabited  houses.    This  increase  in  numbers  of Constables  has,  during the  same  period,  been accompanied by a great increase in cost: whereas,  in 1909, the cost of the Policewas  153  for each 1,000 inhabitants, it had risen in 1920/21 to  485.  .    The Commissioner has  furnished  us  with  a detailed analysis  of the  duties  onwhich &quot; uniformed &quot; Police,  authorised to be employed at the cost of  the MetropolitanPolice Fund,  are engaged at present. The following points appear to us to be worthy of attention :     (1.) Out of a total  &quot;uniformed&quot; strength of 18,282-3,426 Police of variousranks  are shown  as  being required  as reliefs  for  weekly  and  annual leave and sickness, i.e., 3,426 are required to relieve 14,856, or a margin of 23 per cent, forreliefs,  a figure which we think  should be   considerably reduced,  certainly  to20 per cent,  margin,  seeing that  the normal  absence from duty is :                 52 weekly rest days,                 12 days annual leave, and                   8 days sickness,or  a total  of 72  days&apos; absence per .Constable.   As  this  period of absence is approximately 20 per  cent,  of the year, a  similar margin of 20 per cent, in numbersought to suffice for reliefs.   Consequently, a margin of 2,971 should suffice, giving a saving of 455 Police.     (2.)  In this  same analysis  of the &quot;uniformed&quot;  Police,, we find that 260 areemployed on clerical   duty.   We understand that the Commissioners policy is toreduce the number of  Police so employed and  to  substitute civilians, and we thinkthat this  substitution should be completely effected  with the least possible delay.For each Policeman so substituted by a civilian there would be a substantial saving.     (3.)  We similarly suggest that the 51 Police used as  motor car and  despatchcar drivers, and the 12 Police used as messengers, the 19 used  as grooms and the 22used as Divisional  storekeepers should be  substituted by civilians, with a consequentsubstantial saving.     (4.)  We notice that since 1914 the authorised establishment has  been increased by Superintendents, 41  Inspectors,  and  88  Police  Sergeants,  whereas the  PoliceConstables in the  same  period  show a decrease of 1,496.   The Commissioner hasexplained to us the duties  for which these additional officers are  required, but  weshould have expected that there would have been some reduction  of the higher ranksproportionate to  the decrease in the number of Constables,  and we recommend that,in reviewing the strength of the Metropolitan Police Force, the Commissioner should
endeavour to revert to the pre-war ratio of higher ranks to Police Constables, thuseffecting a considerable saving.    (5.) Apart from the numbers actually charged to the Metropolitan Police Fund,it will be observed from the above table that 1,573 Metropolitan Police are employed atDockyards and Naval and Military Stations.  They are paid for by the Admiralty andthe War Office respectively, and we have already drawn attention, in our  FirstInterim Report, to what we consider to be an excessive use of Metropolitan Police forthis purpose.  The reductions which we hope will be effected in this direction will bein relief of Army and Navy Estimates, and not of  the Metropolitan Police Fund.    Apart from a decrease in numbers, there are various items of expenditure whichwe think might be curtailed and reduced below the figure included in the provisional estimate for 1922/23.    (i.) We recommend that the proposals which are now under consideration by theCommissioner for prolonging the wear of the different articles  of Clothing and forthe standardisation of cloth should be effected,    (ii.) We have considered the question of the employment of the  Women Patrols.These  Women  Patrols, 110 in  number, are in addition to the numbers of Police.Their pay is only 10s. a week less than that of the &quot;uniformed&quot; Constable.  their powers are  very  limited, and their utility from  a Police  point of view is, on theevidence submitted to us, negligible.  We do not think that in present circumstancesthis expenditure  can be justified.    (iii.)  The expenditure on the Public Carriage  Licensing Department is estimated in the current year to amount to  100,700, whereas the receipts are only estimatedat  32,000.    We have ascertained, however, that this Department comprises much more thanits name implies.  It includes the Lost Property Office Staff ( 6,466); Police employedon issuing processes for  traffic  offences ( 741); and Police employed in  the streetson, point duty  at Public Carriage Standings, i.e., one-third of the cost of 278Constables  ( 38,305).  The above items  account  for  45,512  of the  expenditure.The actual expenditure on the  work of licensing Public Carriages is therefore 55,188 in the current year. This will be reduced in 1922/23, owing to the with-drawal of the Police bonus to  50,000.    As stated above,  the estimated receipts from licences are only  32,000, derivedfrom 13,625 vehicles and 33,970 drivers  and conductors.   We  do not consider thatthe business of licensing such public carriages, drivers  and conductors should showa  deficit of   18,000, and we think that the cost should be reduced to the level of thereceipts.  At the present moment the Police employed on licensing duties at NewScotland Yard number forty-one and cost   14,391.  The Police  employed on inspect-ing public carriages after they  have been  licensed in order to see that they are kept up to  a reasonable standard of repair and sanitation, number  seventy-two and cost 30,982.  We recommend that the Commissioner should reduce  these staffs to theminimum compatible With securing that vehicles are properly licensed  and main-tained, and that  if he is unable to  reduce their  cost to the level of the estimatedreceipts, steps should  be taken to increase the charges for licences by a small amountto a point where  the system will be self-supporting.  The charges are at  present  2for proprietors and 5s. for drivers and conductors, and  these amounts were fixed bythe Metropolitan Public Carriage Act, 1869, and have never since been reviewed.   t.(iv.) We have considered  a statement showing the proposed expenditure on building Works  and Maintenance of Buildings  during the next six years.     As regards  building works, an expenditure  of approximately  150,000 perannum over the next six years is proposed. In the year 1921 /22 the estimated figure is  115,000, and for  1922/23  the Estimate is  140,400.   The  chief items in theprogramme for 1922/23 are  50,000 for married quarters;  33,000 for new stations; 20,000  for  a  garage at Lambeth  for Police vehicles.    There is  also&apos; an item  of 8,000 for continuing the building of new stables and a riding school.  We suggestthat this programme should be  limited to   50,000.     As regards maintenance work of building, there is a provision of  25,000, andas this work has already been  narrowly  restricted, and as there are heavy arrears,we do not suggest any further  reduction.     This item also contains a provision of  25,000 for the Purchase and Maintenance-of Motor Vehicles. This represents less than half the amount estimated to be spentan 1921/22, but we think that it could still be reduced by 50 per cent, if, instead of purchasing new  vehicles, the  Commissioner negotiates&apos; for  some of the numerous
motor vehicles of the Fighting Services, which will be redundant if the recommenda-tions in our Interim Report are carried out.    There is a further item of  &quot;10,000 for the Purchase and Maintenance of MotorBoats.  We understand that the motor-boat fleet of the River Police consists of threelaunches and twenty-seven motor boats.  One new launch and sixteen boats have been purchased since  the war, and the proposal is  to purchase three more boats this year at an estimated  cost of  1,200.  We suggest that, in view of the high proportion ofnew craft which have been acquired  since the war, the purchase of any new boatsthis year should be postponed.    (v.) We are of opinion that certain of the Allowances should be reviewed.    (a.) Boot Allowance.    (b.) Bicycle Allowance.    (c.) Plain Clothes Allowance.    (d.) Subsistence and Refreshment Allowance.           These Allowances have been increased from time to time in recent years               to  meet higher costs, and we suggest that they should be reviewed in               the light of current prices from time to time,    (e.) Special Duty  Pay. We  understand  that Police  employed  in  PublicDepartments  receive a  &quot;Special Duty&quot;  allowance  of  Is. a  day, although such employment is not specially arduous, and is, indeed, sought after.   At the presenttime we are informed that a  charge of  500 in respect of such  allowances fallsannually on the Metropolitan  Police Fund,  whereas the Public Departments whoemploy Metropolitan Police incur a cost of  16,000 per annum in  respect of theseallowances.   We think that it should be abolished.    (vi.) Administrative Expenses. We find  that  the  cost  of  HeadquartersAdministration, which in 1913/14 represented 258 per cent, of a total expenditureof  nearly  3 millions, is now 2-87 per cent, of a  total expenditure of more than 7 millions.  These expenses, however, comprise many items, such as books, printing,.postage, travelling, advertising and legal and  audit expenses, all of which have shown a necessary increase in volume, together with an enhanced cost.     So far  as salaries and numbers are concerned, we find that the  civil staff of theCommissioner has increased  from 73 to 244, i.e., an increase of 171.  Out  of this number 69  are engaged on entirely new work and 82 represent civilians substitutedfor Police (which  is, in itself, an economy), and we make no recommendation.     (vii.)  We have  examined the figures of the  cost of horses and forage for themounted Metropolitan Police, and we find that, for the last eight years, the average price per horse has been   60, which after taking into account the amount realised bythe sale of cast horses, works out at a net cost of  32 per horse.  We further find thatthe cost of  forage per horse, which reached  the high figure of  75&apos;9 per annum in1920/21, shows  a reduction to  49-8 in the current year.   We think it desirable thatall possible  reductions should be made in  the  number  of mounted men,  and we-understand that the Commissioner is considering proposals  to this effect.     6.  The economies which we have suggested above, which are only instances  andnot in any way exhaustive, should result in a considerable saving.  We are of opinionthat a  review on  the lines which we have suggested would produce  a reduction of10 per  cent., i.e.,  700,000, on the approximate  7 millions estimated to be the  costof the Metropolitan Police for 1922/23.  It must  be borne in mind that only one-halfof this saving, i.e.,  350,000, would accrue to the Exchequer, the other half accruing to the Ratepayer.                      COUNTY AND BOROUGH POLICE FORCES.     7.  We have already shown  that the total estimated expenditure on Police for1922/23 is&apos;  20^  millions.  Of  this total the cost of the Metropolitan  Police  is 7 millions.  The estimated cost of the other Police Forces in England and wales&apos;is  13^ millions.     We are not in a position to  criticise their Estimates  in any detail.   As we havealready stated,  the Home Office supervision over  these 180 separate Police Forces  is exercised through two His Majesty&apos;s Inspectors of Constabulary, and has hithertotaken the form  of ensuring that the strength and efficiency  of the Forces is properlymaintained and not of seeing that it is reduced to the most economical proportions. The Home Office have informed us that the strength of these local Forces is not being increased to any considerable extent, though there is little that the Home Office can-
 Jo to control  items  of local  Police  expenditure beyond  an examination of the Estimates and claims.  The Home Office did issue a circular in August last urging the Police Authorities not to recruit the  full authorised strength,  except  where bsolutely necessary;  to consider whether  any reduction  in numbers  is possible;: to defer all capital expenditure not required for urgent purposes, and, generally, to effect any economies other than reductions in pay or allowances.  We understand that few replies have been received or were expected by the Home Office, though the latter know that many Police Authorities  are keeping vacancies open, suspending building operations and taking  other measures, but most  of these matters do not equire  any reference to  the Home Office.  &apos; There can be no doubt indeed, it is dmitted that the check of the Home Office on Police Authorities has been rather for the maintenance of numbers and efficiency  than for economy, and that  it cannot  in any way be considered a control of expenditure, amounting to  13^ millions of which the Taxpayer pays half.   In these circumstances, we  think it is urgently necessary that  the whole strength of these local Police Forces should be investigated so that for the future a fixed grant per capita of the approved number of Police  can be made from the Exchequer.    8. For the purpose of  the forthcoming financial year, we recommend  that in view of the fact that the Metropolitan Police has to be kept up  at a strength capable  of giving relief to other districts in case of emergency, and of affording assistance  in Criminal Investigations, the percentage reduction  in the  case of the  County and Borough Police Forces should be rather larger than in the  case of the Metropolitan Police Force, and we recommend that there should be a reduction of V2\ per cent. on the  13^ millions cost of the local Police Forces,  with a consequent saving  of  1,687,500.  We recommend  that, pending the  determination of  a fixed grant on a per capita basis, the local  Police Authorities should be informed that the Exchequer contribution for 1922/23 will  be  based on the assumption that the percentage eduction which we have just suggested is effected, and that instead of contributing half  of   13^ millions, i.e.,  6,750,000, the Exchequer contribution will not  exceed  5,906,250, which is  half of the  revised total cost when the  13^ millions is reduced by 12^ per cent, to the total of  11,812,500.  The saving to the Exchequer would thus oe  843,750.    We recognise that it will probably be difficult  to effect this economy in Provincial -and  particularly in Rural Police Forces, if  the  existing scale of pay for the Metropolitan Police continues to be applied throughout the country.    In  view  of what we have  stated earlier  in this report on the subject of the ecognised differentiation  between London  and the  Provinces in  the fixing of rates of pay generally, we recommend that the obligation to pay the Metropolitan Police scale in Provincial Forces should be cancelled.Pensions.    9. We cannot close our report  on this subject without calling  attention to theliability which is now being incurred  by the Taxpayer in respect of the pensions  ofPolice.  The subject is fully dealt with  in a memorandum  by the  government actuary, which is  attached (Appendix C).    The salient points are that  the new pension  conditions contained in the PolicePensions Act, 1921, were not enforced upon men serving in  the Police (England andWales) when the Act was  passed. Present  members of the  Forces thus get the great advantage of the Desborough scale  in the calculation  of their pensions, while theysurrender nothing of the previous privileges under which the minimum  pension wasreached in most cases after the period of twenty-six years&apos;  service.  In  Scotland,  onthe other hand, the scale of the Police Pensions Act, 1921,  applies to those  membersserving  at the time in the Scottish Police Forces, in whose case it is more favourable than the scale previously in force.    It is anticipated that the effect of the  provisions of the Act of 1921 regardingcompulsory retirement, combined with the calculation of pensions on the Desboroughscale, will be to produce a considerable increase in the  number of pensioned  men.    There is a further point that the scope and scale of the widows&apos; pensions andchildren&apos;s allowances have been largely increased by the Acts of 1918 and 1921.    The Government Actuary&apos;s report shows that, assuming interest at 4 per cent, perannum, the value of all the  pension benefits under the 1921 Act to men who entered thePolice Forces immediately  before, the Act came into force is equivalent to  about 22 percent, of pay, or a flat rate of  50  a year throughout the whole period of service. Allow -ing for the authorised deductions from pay, i.e., 2\ per cent., the pension rights are worth about 19^ per cent, of pay, or a flat rate of   44  a year throughout service.   In      [7653J                                                            H
the case of men appointed after the Act  of  1921 came into force, each of thesefigures must be reduced by about one-seventh, i.e., the rights are worth 19 per cent, of pay, or, after deducting the statutory contribution,  16^ per cent.    The total cost of  Police pensions and  allowances to widows and  children inEngland and  Wales shows the following comparison :                                                            - &apos;               1913/14     ...       ...       ...       ...      1,352,651              1918/19     ...       ...       ...       ...      1,410,925             1919/20     ...       .......       ...      1,808,142             1920/21 (Estimated by Government Actuary)     2,600,000    For Scotland, the figure for 1920 is  78,563.    As regards the future growth of pensions cost,  assuming that the Police Forcesof England, Wales and Scotland  remain at  their present strength, the government actuary estimates that the amount paid in pensions and  allowances in 1925/26 will reach  4 millions and  will continue to rise  until an ultimate charge of  7,700,000is reached  in  about 40 years.  He calculates that  the number of pensioned men will eventually  reach 70 per cent,  of the number actually serving.    In  calling attention to this  already large and  constantly growing liability, wewould only add that we are  informed that actuarial  Estimates were not made inconnection with the Police Pensions  Bill of  1921.   We consider it would have beenadvantageous, in view of the great addition of pay  made by the general adoption ofthe Desborough scale with its immediate effect upon the superannuation liability, ifthe scheme had been actuarially  tested before  the  Police service  was confirmed inits exceptional privileges by a new Act of Parliament.  As in the case of Teachers&apos;Superannuation we think  the question should receive early investigation.                               CONCLUSIONS.    10. As a result of our consideration, we are  of opinion:     (1.) That the present &quot;percentage grant&quot; system  should be discontinued.    (2.) That a full investigation should at once  be made of the strength  of all            Police Forces  in England and Wales in order to enforce economies.    (3.) That the detailed economies which we  have suggested should be effected            forthwith in the Estimates for 1922/23 for the Metropolitan Police,            with a consequent reduction of those Estimates by  700,000.    (4.) That the obligation to pay the Metropolitan Police scale of remuneration            in County and Borough Police  Forces  should be cancelled.    (5.) That economies should be effected  forthwith  in the Estimates for  1922/23            for the County and Borough Police Forces on the same lines, as  in the            case of  the Metropolitan Police, with a  consequent reduction of the            Estimates for the County and Borough Police of  1,687,500.         If the recommendations in our Report are adopted,  the total savings for            1922/23  would amount  to  2,387,500,  of which one-half,  1,193,750,            would enure to the Exchequer.APPENDIX (A).COMPARATIVE Table of Pre-AVar and Post-War Hates of Pay of Metropolitan and                              Provincial Police.Grade.Constable in typical rural county (Cambridge).Sergeant in dittoConstable in typical industrial borough or city  (Sheffield)Sergeant in dittoConstable in Metropolitan ForceSergeant in dittoPre-War.s.  d. s.  d.22 9-30  430 6-35  028 0-39  041 6-46  630 0-40  043 0 47  UPost-War.

APPENDLX (C).     MEMORANDUM BY THE GOVERNMENT ACTUARY  ON THE COST OF  PENSIONS                             OF  THE POLICE FORCE.                                The Pay System.     1.  As the pensions of the Police Force are based on pay it is necessary, in the first instance, to examine  the conditions  as to the latter.  Until quite recently, the scales of pay  varied considerably throughout  the  country.   For example,  in  the Metropolitan Police and two or three Provincial Boroughs&quot; before 1914 the scale for Constables was 30s. rising to 42s.; in one  or two County Forces, 28s. rising to 35s. or thereabouts,  with quarters free;  while in a county like Dorset the scale  was 21s. rising to 26s. Wd. with an allowance for rent.     For the  first three years following the outbreak of war, the policy of the Home Office was generally to refuse sanction to any  increase of pensionable pay,  but to allow County Police  Authorities  at  their discretion to meet the increased cost of living by a terminable war bonus.   The same  policy was followed in the case of the Metropolitan  Police and  also by the Scottish Office; but while some  Borough Police Authorities adopted a similar course, in other cases the pay was raised.     At the end of 1918, the  Home Office took steps  which secured a considerable measure of uniformity the result of which was the adoption of two scales of pay for Constables and Sergeants :      (a.)  The Metropolitan  scale, 43s. rising to  53s. for Constables and 56s.  rising           to 60s.  for Sergeants; and     (5.)  The &quot;standard&quot;  scale, which is generally 3s. lower than the Metropolitan           scale.     Generally speaking, the former  scale applied in forces north of a line from the &quot;Wash to the Mersey, as well  as in  the Metropolitan Force and in a few  Borough Forces.    The Desborough  Committee recommended the adoption of a uniform scale of pay for all branches of the Force, that proposed for  Constables being 70s. a week rising by ten annual increments  of  2s.  to  90s., with  further  special long service additions of  2s. 6d. a week on completion of seven andjtwelve years&apos;  service after attaining the maximum of 90s., and that for Sergeants 100s. rising by five annual increments of 2s.  Qd. to 112s. 6d.  It was further recommended  that a house-or quarters be provided rent  free,  or a non-pensionable allowance for rent granted in addition.                              The Pension System.    2. Prior to 1921 the scale of pensions for Officers of the Police Force in England and Wales was based on the provisions of &quot; The Police Act, 1890,&quot; and in Scotland on &quot; The Police (Scotland) Act, 1890.&quot;  While  under both Acts a Constable could retire on pension without medical certificate after twenty-five years service,  the former Actgave a wide range of discretion to Police Authorities as regards the scale to be adopted with reference  to years of service,  and in  England and Wales the great majority of Officers were entitled to retire on  the maximum pension of two-thirds of pay aftertwenty-six years service.    &quot;The Police Pensions Act,  1921,&quot; introduced important changes in the scale ofpensions.  The principal of these  are as  follows :     (1.)  While a  pension  of  one-half  of  pay  can  be  claimed without  medical           certificate after twenty-five years service,  as before, the maximum pension           of two-thirds of pay cannot be claimed until after thirty years service;    (2.) Retirement except in special cases is made compulsory at 55 for Constables           and Sergeants,  at 60 for Superintendents and Inspectors, and at 65 for           Chief Constables; but this condition is not  enforced in any cases of men           serving at the commencement of the Act where-longer service is required           to secure maximum pension without medical certificate;    (3.)  Except  as regards   Special  Pensions  granted  in   injury  cases,  the           discretionary power  allowed  to  Police Authorities under &quot;The Police           Act, 1890,&quot;  as regards the amount of pension, is removed.
                               Widows&apos;  Pensions.    4. Under &quot; The Police Act, 1890,&quot; pensions were granted to widows, but these were allowed only to widows of men who died as the result of injury received while on duty;  in  such cases an allowance for each child was included.   &quot;The Police(Scotland)  Act,  1890,&quot; contained similar provisions  for Scotland.   &quot;The Police(Pensions)  Act, 1918,&quot; authorised a general extension of widows&apos; pensions whatever the cause of death and irrespective of whether the husband was serving or pensionedwhen he died.  This, therefore, was a very substantial enlargement of the pensionsystem;* further, this Act  raised the scale  of widows&apos; pensions.   &quot;The PolicePensions Act, 1921,&quot; again raised the scale of  pensions to widows,  and extendedthe children&apos;s allowances to children generally in lieu of the previous restriction to children of men who died from the effects of injury received while on duty.                         The Value of Pension Rights.    5. Assuming  interest at 4  per cent, per annum  the value of all the pension benefits under the  1921 Act to Officers  appointed immediately before the Act  came into force is equivalent to about 22 per cent, of pay, or to a flat rate of  50 a yearthroughout  the whole period of  service.  Allowing  for the  authorised deductionsfrom pay, the pension rights are worth about 19^ per cent, of pay, or a flat additionof  44 a year throughout service.  In  the case of Officers appointed after the act of 1921 came into  force, each of these figures must be reduced by about one-seventh,i.e., the rights  are worth  19 per  cent, of pay,  or, after  deducting the  statutorycontribution, 16^ per cent.                         The Present Cost of Pensions.    6. The following has been the total cost of pensions and allowances in Englandand Wales for the year ending the 31st March : Metropolitan PoliceCity of London Police ,County and Borough Police        Total1914,  606,363 45,777700,5111,352,6511919.   631,127 42,027737,7711,410,9251920.  768,515 61,951977,6761,808,142    The figures for Scotland relate to  slightty different periods, the latest availablefigure being for the year ending the 15th May, 1920:   78,563.    7. The marked increase in the cost of pensions in 1920 as compared with 1919appears to be due to retirements which had been held up during the war.  This was certainly the case with the  Metropolitan Police.* It did not apply to widows whose husbands had died before the Act came into force.     The reduction of pension rights provided in England and Wales by the 1921Act was not enforced upon men serving when the Act was passed.   Present membersof the Force thus get the great advantage of the Desborough scale in the calculation of their pensions, while they  surrender  nothing of the previous privileges underwhich the maximum was reached in most cases after the short period of twenty-six years of service.   In Scotland the  scale of the Act applies  to serving members, in whose cases it is more favourable than the scale  previously in  force.     3.  Information furnished  by the Home Office showed that retirements from theMetropolitan Police took place in large numbers as soon as, or  soon after, a pensioncould be claimed without medical certificate, and, having regard to the small numberwho have  adopted  the  1921  scale, it seems probable  that  this high rate of  earlyretirement will continue.   Prom  a  &quot;Return of  Police  Pensioners prior  to the4th August,  1914,&quot; published in December 1919, it appears that there has been atendency to postpone retirements to a later age in the  Countjr and Borough Policeof England and Wales and to a more marked extent in the Scottish Police.  It mustbe presumed  that the effect of the provisions of the 1921 Act regarding compulsoryretirement, combined with the  calculation of pensions on the Desborough scale, willbe to produce a considerable increase in the number of pensioned men.
  &apos;  8. The accounts of the Metropolitan Police for the year ending the 31st March,1921,  show that the cost of pensions had still further increased to  1,006,602.  this large  increase is no doubt due in part to the application of the Desborough scale to new retirements,  but is attributable mainly to  additions to  existing  pensionsauthorised by &quot;The Pensions (Increase)  Act,  1920.&quot;    9. Equally full information is not available in the case of the Provincial and scottish Forces, but the same conditions have prevailed, and the total cost of PolicePensions may be estimated at fully  2,600,000 for the year ending the 31st March,1921.                      The Future Growth of Pension Cost.    10. Allowing  for  the effect of the Desborough scale,  including the probability that the increase of pensions to which it leads will stimulate earlier retirements inthe  Provincial and Scottish Forces, I come  to the conclusion that the amount paidin pensions and allowances,  in the financial year ending the 31st March, 1926, mustreach  and may exceed  4,000,000.  On the assumption that the  whole Force remains at its  present strength of approximately  63,000, I estimate that the annual cost will increase  until an  ultimate  charge  of   7,700,000  is reached in  about forty years.Of  these  amounts, pensions  to widows  and  allowances to orphans account  for 75,000 in the year  ending the  31st March,  1926,  and   720,000 in the year of ultimate charge.    11. The  present pension charges, and still more the charges estimated to accruein future, are obviously very heavy in relation to a force of about 63,000 men.  Thereason for this, however, is not difficult to  find.  Owing  to the early age  at which men are permitted to retire  the number of pensioned men  bears a remarkably heavyproportion to the number of serving men.   This proportion is  estimated eventually to reach  70 per cent., so that, for  63,000 men serving, 44,000 men will be on  thepensioned roll. Any doubt which such a figure might engender will be dispelled by reference  to the present facts  in connection  with the Metropolitan Police.  In 1906this Force consisted of about 15,500 men;  in 1921  the strength was 21,000.  Thenumber of men on the List of Pensioners on the 31st March, 1921, was 10,800, beingabout 70  per  cent,  of the active Force as existing fifteen years previously and 50  percent, of the current strength.                          The Cost to  the Exchequer.    12. The  annual charges mentioned in preceding paragraphs represent  the totalcost of pensions.   Under past arrangements the Exchequer paid annually the sumof  340,000 under &quot; The Local Taxation (Customs and Excise) Act, 1890,&quot; and, inaddition,  such sum as was necessary to make the  total Exchequer grant up toone-half of the net cost of pensions after taking into account the contributions from members  of the Force and various other receipts which were carried to the  credit ofthe  Pension Fund.    The  Pension Funds have now been abolished, but I  understand that, for  thepurpose of calculating the Exchequer charge, the  items  hitherto credited to theseFunds will still be deemed to have been available for pensions, and,  in case  it shouldbe thought that the real cost of pensions to the public is  on these grounds substan-tially less than the sums named, I think it necessary to emphasise certain points.    (a.)  From the figures given in paragraph 5 it will be seen that the contributions           (deductions from pay)  represent on average about one-eighth of  the value          of the pensions, and as these contributions are not accumulated to assist in          providing the pensions  of those who pay them,  but  are  immediately          absorbed as they are received in  payments to existing pensioners,  the          proportion of contributions to pensions will speedily fall below 10  per          cent., and eventually will be less than 5 per cent.    (5.) In the case  of  Scotland and many of the Provincial Forces, interest on          investments is also available towards  the cost of  pensions.    The  old          Pension Funds were not established, however,  on an actuarial basis, and          the assistance from this  source was not very  material.  With  pensions          based hereafter on the Desborough scale, it will  be relatively insignificant.    (c.) Contributions (made, I believe,  on an actuarial basis) towards the cost of          pensions of Police specially employed by Government Departments and          Local Authorities reduce the Vote for  the Police, but do not reduce  the          charge  of pensions on the public.  From the point of view of the Tax or
      Ratepayer it is a matter of indifference under which head of his burdens      the charge is levied.(d.) Fines, fees,  &amp;c, hitherto paid into the Pension Funds and still taken into      account for the purpose  of the  Exchequer charge,  are public receipts.      They have no relation to Police Pensions, and their  allocation  to this      purpose does not, in fact, reduce the cost of pensions to the public.     ^           &apos;)p          ;X-           %r                                        (Signed)      A.

It will be observed from the above figures that the total Exchequer contribution towards the cost of the Police in Scotland comprises two grants,  as in the case ofEngland and Wales, viz. : (i) Voted Money, and (ii) Payments from the consolidate fund.  The Police in Scotland, as in England and Wales, are paid for jointly by theRatepayer  and by the Taxpayer in the form  of contributions from the Exchequer.    The Police in Scotland are under the primary responsibility of the Counties andBurghs.    Thirty-one Counties  and 28  Burghs  maintain  separate  &quot; recognised &quot; police forces.   Of these          and  2 Burghs S j&quot; ^ave a population of less than 10,000         a-d  lEurghf)    &quot;       &quot;    cf between 10,000-20,000         -luST)    &quot;       &quot;    of between 20.000-50,000.    These   figures  illustrate  the   large  number of  separate  Police  Forces  forcomparatively small areas, a point to which we refer later.Grant System.    2.  Prior to the year 1920, two Exchequer grants were paid annually towards thecost of the Scottish Police, and since 1899 these two grants had  been stabilised atanimal contributions  of (1)  180,000 from the Local Taxation (Scotland) Account,as a contribution towards the cost of the pay and clothing  of the Police; and  (2) 40,000 towards pensions, i.e., a total Exchequer contribution of  220,000.    It has been pointed out to us by the Scottish Office that when the grant was a fixed total  sum of  180,000 per annum  towards the cost of Police  pay and clothing,the Scottish  Office endeavoured, in the  interest of the participating authorities, toexercise  an effective  check upon all  proposals from particular districts involvingincrease expenditure, and consequently  an increased claim upon the fixed  grant, butthis was a  difficult matter, as there is only one His Majesty5 s Inspector of  Constabu-lary for Scotland.   Indeed, in spite of the  supervision of the Scottish  Office, thetotal Police expenditure for Scotland rose steadily, with the  result that, whereas in1899 the annual grant of  180,000 represented 9s.  5d. per   of the  total expenditure,in 1915 it only represented 6s. 5d. per   of the total expenditure.  From this it willbe seen that the total expenditure on Scottish Police was increasing steadily, even under the old grant system.    In 1918, as in the case of England  and Wales, the grant system was changed onto a basis  that the Government should pay   to  the  local Police  Authority a sumsufficient to make up the amounts received from the Local Taxation Account and theExchequer Contribution Account to one-half the  net total expenditure of the year.This change of system, coupled with the improved rates of  pay and allowances ofthe Police, has resulted in a large increase of the Voted Money required,  as will beseen from the following table :                               Payments from the                Total Exchequer                              Consolidated Fund.

Total Cost of Police.    3. Owing to the change in the grant system, it is not possible to set the estimates of 1913/14 alongside those  of the current or the next financial years for purposesof comparison, but the following table gives a true comparison of the expenditure onScottish Poiicc:                                                                              1013/14.  Tola!   expenditure   on          towards which Exchequer                 Police (Scotland)   ..    701,000   contribution       ..  =   :&apos;20,000       11)22/23.  Estimated expenditure on          towards which Exchequer                 Police (Scotland)   ..   2,120,000   contribution       ..  -  1,060,000    From these figures  it will be seen that the  total cost has increased by 203 percent,  (whereas in England and Wales the total cost has increased by  167 per  cent.).Further, whereas in 1913/14  the Exchequer contributed less than one-third  of thetotal cost of  701,000, it is now asked to contribute one-half of  2,120,000.    The increased cost of the Police is mainly due to higher pay, allowances, pensionsand increased cost of clothing.  The actual increase in the numbers of the ScottishPolice Forces is shown in the following comparison:               1914    ...       ...      ...       ...      ...    5,921             1921    ...       ...      ...       ...      ...    6,563an increase of 642.  This is a very much greater proportionate increase of numbersthan has taken place in England and Wales.  The Scottish Office have explained  tous that the  increase is  accounted for by  the general putting into  operation  of thePolice (Weekly Rest Day)  (Scotland) Act, 1914, the reduction of hours from  twelveor ten to eight per day, and the increased  annual leave given on the recommendationof the Desborough Committee.   Some of these improved conditions were already  inoperation in England in 1914, but in Scotland they were only introduced subsequent to 1914, and would thus account for a larger increase in numbers.Suggested Economies.    4. There  are  only two means of effecting economies :-         (a.) By reducing  the number of  Police; and/or         (b.) By reducing  the cost per head of Police.    Under the present  grant system, we  do not consider that the local authoritieshave the full incentive to economise on Police. We have dealt with this subject fully in our report on the Police (England and Wales), and our criticism applies equallyin the case of Scotland.   We are convinced that economy can only be obtained if thelocal authorities are limited to a fixed grant for Police, determined on some carefullycalculated basis.  We therefore suggest that a full investigation should now be madeby the Scottish Office into the strength of all the Police Forces in Scotland in orderto arrive at  a  basis calculated on acreage, population  and rateable  value  for determing the minimum numbers required for the adequate policing of each area.As soon as this has been arrived at the Exchequer contribution should be limited to a fixed  annual grant, calculated on the number of  Police justified  for  each districton the new basis.   We recognise  that  any  rough-and-ready calculation coveringEngland, Wales and Scotland would not be justifiable, since the figures of population and acreage per Constable in England, Wales and Scotland respectively do not givea fair comparison, and  the strength of the Scottish Police Forces ought certainly tobe calculated  on  a separate basis.     The  above-mentioned  investigation  should  include  the   possibility  of  the compulsory  amalgamation,  at the discretion of the Secretary for  Scotland,  of twoor more County or Burgh Police Forces, which are at present separate.  We  under-stand that at present there is no machinery for the amalgamation  of one Count\Police Force  with another, nor  of  one  Burgh Police Force with  another, thoughBurghs  may agree  to consolidating their  Police  with the County Police.    TheDesborough Report recommended that,  in Scotland,  all separate  Police  Forces inBurghs of less than 50,000 population should be merged in the County Police Forces,and that small County Forces should be grouped with one another or with an adjoin-ing large Force under a single Joint Police Authority.   We are satisfied that suchamalgamations of the County Police Forces would produce economies and should beeffected, and, as  regards amalgamation of Burgh Police  Forces, we  think that  the       !7653]                                                            I
Secretary for Scotland should have power to enforce such amalgamations  where hothinks they would be economical without loss of efficiency.    When  it  is pointed  out  that  the  approximate cost of Police per head in1913/14 in Scotland was  115  and has now risen to  323, an increase  of 181  percent.,  it is  not  necessary to emphasise how important  is  the  need for economy in numbers.  A saving of 5  per cent, on the present numbers (6,563) would mean a saving of more than  190,000.    But apart from numbers, there is the question of pay, pensions and allowances,which, as we have just shown, has resulted in a total cost  per head of Police rising from  115  in 1913/14 to  323  in 1921, an increase of  208, or 181 per cent.  Thepresent pay of  the  Scottish Police Forces  is fixed in accordance with the  report ofthe Desborough Committee of July, 1919, and the remarks which  we have made onthis subject in  connection  with the Police (England and Wales) apply equally to scotland.  We would only repeat that, in our opinion, there is  good ground  fordifferentiating between the Metropolitan and the Provincial Police in this matter,and we recommend that  the obligation to pay the Metropolitan Police Scale inProvincial Forces should be cancelled.    As regards  Pensions, we have already dealt with the matter  in our Report on police (England and Wales),  and appended to that Report will be found a memoran-dum by the Government Actuary which covers the question of Police Pensions inScotland.    On the subject.of Allowances, we draw attention to the recommendations whichwe have made on this head in our Report on the Police (England and Wales), and wethink that they should be applied mutatis mutandis  in the case  of the Scottish.Police.    5. For the purpose of the forthcoming financial year, we recommend that thereshould be a reduction of  12-1 Per cent, on  the estimated  2,120,000  cost of theScottish Police Forces, with a consequent saving of  265,000.   It must be borne inmind that  only one-half  of  this saving, i.e.,  132,500, would accrue  to  theExchequer,  the  other  half  accruing to  the  Ratepayer.  We  recommend that,pending the determination of a fixed grant on a per capita basis, the Scottish police authorities should  be informed that the Exchequer contribution for 1922/23 will bebased on the assumption that the percentage reduction which we have just  suggestedis effected,  and that instead of  contributing one-half of  2,120,000, i.e.,   1,060,000,the Exchequer  contribution will not exceed  927,500, which is half of  the revisedtotal cost of  1,855,000.  The saving to the Exchequer would: be  132,500.                              CONCLUSIONS.    6. As  a result  of our consideration, we are of opinion :-    (1.) That the  present &quot;percentage grant&quot; system should be discontinued.    (2.) That a Ml investigation should at  once be made of the strength of the            Police  Forces  in Scotland in  order to enforce economy  and to effect            amalgamations  of  Police Forces  wherever  economy would   result            therefrom.    (3.) That the  obligation to pay the Metropolitan Police scale of  remuneration            in  Scottish Police  Forces  should be cancelled.    (4.) That economies should be effected forthwith in the Estimates for 1922/23            for the Scottish  Police on the same lines as in the case of the Police in            England and Wales, with a consequent reduction of the  Estimates for            1922/23 of  265,000, of which one-half,  132,500, would enure to the            Exchequer.
                    PRISONS  (ENGLAND AND WALES).                                                                            Audited Expenditure  1913/14 ...      ...      767,903             Net Estimate 1921/22  ...       ...      ...    1,577,254             Provisional Net Estimate 1922/23     ...    1,367,254     1.  Of this decrease in 1922/23,  111,000 is due to the fall in bonus and wages and  99,000 to other causes.     Since the above Estimate was furnished to the  Treasury a  further reduction of &apos;  42,360 has been made on the building programme,  thereby reducing the Provisional Net Estimate to  1,324,894.     The size of this Vote is very largely determined by the numbers of the prison population and the consequent numbers of prison officers required.  The average daily number of prisoners is as follows :               1913/14       ...       ...        ...      ...      18,236             1921/22 Estimate       ...        ...      ...      13,450             1922/23 Estimate       ...        ...      ...      15,000     The figures of  &quot; Prison Staff&quot; are :-             1914                                            3 360             1922/23 Estimate       ...        ...               3A53     The Prison Commission, in estimating the number of prisoners for 1922/23 at the high figure of 15,000 (compared with 13,450 in the current year), have, of course, included Sinn Fein  prisoners in this country  and  have  made  allowance for  an increased  number of these latter.  We understand that, as a result  of the amnesty, some 600  Sinn Fein  prisoners will be released from  this country and  the margin allowed for  an increased number  of such prisoners in 1922/23 will not be required. This, and the consequent reduction of some fifty warders, who, we understand, were added to deal with  these prisoners, should result in a large saving. 2. Ratio of  Prisoners to Staff.     We are informed by the Prison Commission that the actual number of prisoners in 1921  was 18 per cent, less than in 1914.  The number of prison staff in 1921 was 14 per cent, less than in 1914.  Whereas in  1922/23 it is estimated that there will be one  officer to every  4-9 prisoners, in 1914 there  was one officer  to every  5-4 prisoners.  We understand  that  the  introduction in  1919 of  the 8-hour day and weekly rest  day  for warders, the growth of  the Borstal system,  and increased care for the mental and physical  condition of prisoners have led tp this recent increased ratio of officers to prisoners. 3. Cost of Prisoners.    The attached  table (Appendix  &quot;A&quot;)   shows  the  average cost  per head  of prisoners  in  England and Scotland before the war and in 1920, the last year for which full figures are available.  From this table it  will be seen that  the cost  of prison staff and maintenance of prisoners in  England has increased much more than in Scotland, and we  suggest that  the English cost should be reduced at  least to the level of the cost in Scotland. 4. Pay of Officers.                                                                           Audited Expenditure. 1913/14   ...      ...    380,429             Net Estimate, 1921/22  ...       ...      ...    886,106             Net Estimate, 1922/23  ...       ...       ...    763,346                              Reduction    ...       ...    122,760 ^ 14 per cent.    It will  be seen  that  this item of the  pay and  allowances of prison officersconstitutes more than half of the whole Prison Vote.  As we have elsewhere stated, we are dealing with  the question of the pay of State servants separately.   We would      [7653]                                                         I 2
only here point out the great increase in the annual cost of the pay and allowances of warders, per head of prison population, as shown in the following  table :--                                      19H.         1921.                                                    Local Prisons      ...       ...          19-3         62:2Convict Prisons    ...       ...          26-2         87-9Borstal  Institutions        ...          22-2         62-45. Cost of Maintenance of Warders.     The provisional Estimates for 1922/23 were based on  the assumption  that themaintenance cost of each warder would be  123.  We were not satisfied that thiscost sufficiently reflected the fall in prices, and on a revision of their  calculations.the Prison Commission have furnished us with an amended Estimate by which themaintenance cost of each warder is reduced from  123 to  107, giving a saving of 16 a head for each of 3,000 warders.6. Clothing, Bedding and Furniture.     This item  is estimated at   67,000.   We  have  examined the basis of this estimate, and  are satisfied that it could be reduced by 5 per cent.,  i.e., to  63,650,by extending the life of the articles.   Even this  latter total is based on the outsideEstimate of 15,000  prisoners,  and should be further  reduced on  account of thereduction in the number of Sinn Fein prisoners allowed for.7. Criminal Lunatics.     The Estimate  for 1922/23  is  24,600,  based  on  a number of 319 criminallunatics.   In  consultation with the Prison  Commission,  we  have considered thebasis of this calculation, and we think the estimated  numbers can be reduced  to300, with a consequent saving on the estimated cost.8. Closing of Prisons.     We understand that the Prison  Commission are  of opinion  that no furtherclosing of prisons is considered to be practicable at the  present time,  but in viewof the release of the Sinn Fein  prisoners  we think this question  should be very carefully re-examined.9. Imprisonment before Payment of Fine.     We are informed that  as  a result  of  Section  1  of the Criminal JusticeAdministration Act,  1914, a large number of prisoners are committed  to prisonwithout having sufficient time to pay the alternative fine.  This is  due to the factthat Magistrates, as the Law stands at present, have  to send a  prisoner  (who is unable to pay the fine at the moment) to  prison, unless he  is able to prove that hehas a fixed abode in the actual area of jurisdiction of the Court.  We are informedthat, in many such cases, the fines would be forthcoming in  a very short time  if the prisoner were not at  once incarcerated.   Indeed,  we are told that  of  prisonerscommitted in default of fine in 1921, no less than 38 per cent,  paid fine after receptioninto prison,  i.e., 5,088  out  of  13,404.   If  Section  1  of the Criminal  JusticeAdministration Act were amended in this respect, we  are  informed that a saving in escort and maintenance on a large number of short-sentence prisoners would beeffected, and we suggest that this should be carefully considered.10.  Prison Labour.     We are struck by the fact that this labour is not more  remunerative.   We areinformed that the present lack of machinery is a  great hindrance, and that, in viewof the expense  involved in having the work supervised by warders  at their present rates of pay, the produce does little more than  pay the cost of supervision.   Further,it is found  that  in present circumstances,  Government  Departments,  who are normally the largest purchasers of the  products  of Prison  labour,  are  now able toobtain the same articles at less cost from  surplus stocks of  war stores.    We  thinkthat,  although  on  that account  it  is  most difficult at present economically to usePrison  labour,  the  use of it  upon all Government requirements  should be moitcarefully considered.
                           CONCLUSIONS.As the result of our consideration, we are of opinion: (1.)  That the reduction in the numbers of  Warders and the revised  Estimate       for the cost  of maintenance of Warders will enable substantial savings       to  be made,  and  to  this must be  added the  result  of  the Irish       Settlement.(2.)  That, in view of these considerations and other minor economies which we       have suggested, this Estimate  should be reduced by  200,000 (including       the reduction of the building  programme) to a total of  1,167,254.

                           PRISONS, SCOTLAND.

Of this amount,   21,000 is due to fall in bonus and wages,  and  9,350 toother causes.  We understand that there will be a further saving due to the reductionof bonus.     The numbers of staff show the following comparison with pre-war : Staff in the Prisons              1913/14     ...............551             1922/23     ...       ...       ...        ...       ...   570Staff in the Prison Commission Office              1913/14     ...       ...       ...        ...       ...    26             1922/23     ...       ...       ...        ...       ...    27Numbers of Prisoners              1913/14            ...      ,..       ...       ...  3,000             1921/22            ...      ...       ...       ...  2,133             1922/23            ...      ...       ...       ...  2,135     The Estimates have been based on what was expected to be  the actual  number ofprisoners during  the  year 1922/23.    Since these numbers  were  estimated, an amnesty has been  granted  to Sinn Fein  prisoners, of whom we  understand therewere approximately fifty in the  Scottish prisons.    There  should, therefore,  be a saving of the maintenance of this number of prisoners.2. Cost of Prisoners.     The gross cost per head of Prisoners  shows the following comparison for theyears 1913,  1920 and 1922 (estimated) :-                                              1913.     1920. 11)22 (estimated).                                                                             Local Prisons        ...       ...    28       83      86             Convict  Prisons       ...       ...    43     142     138             Polmont  (Borstal Institution)  ...    43       89      98     These increases since 1913 are mainly due to the advanced pay  and increased cost  of maintenance of Warders,  but we consider  that the cost for 1922 should showa decrease all round as compared with 1920 instead of showing a  marked increase as they do in the case of Local Prisons and Polmont.3. Numbers of Prison  Officers.     We have shown above that the  Estimates include a provision for  an increase oi21 in the numbers of prison staff compared with 1913/14.  In view  of the releasof the  Sinn Fein  prisoners, we recommend  that a proportionate  reduction ofWarders, with a consequent saving of their pay and maintenance cost,  should bemade.4. Closing of Prisons.     We suggest that the prisons at Stornoway,  Lerwick and Kirkwall,  where theaverage daily number of prisoners does not exceed 2, should be closed,  and that  the)&apos;should be converted into  &quot; legalised cells &quot; in the charge of the Police for sentencesup to 14 days.  We further suggest that Dundee Prison should only  be utilised for short-sentence prisoners,  and that the other prisoners should be  transferred to PerthPrison,  We understand that both these  measures will  result  in  economy.
635. Building Programme.   This has already been restricted by the Prison Commission,  but we suggest thatthe following Avorks which have not yet been commenced should  be postponed :    (a.) Governor&apos;s  House at Edinburgh new prison for which  2,500 is asked in          1922/23.   (b.) Work on the Chapel  for Greenock prison. -(j, Convict Labour.   In Scotland,  such labour is employed on the construction of Peterhead Harbourof Refuge.  We propose to deal with this subject in our Report on tlie Estimates forPeterheacl (Class  I,  12).    As a  result of our  consideration,  we  are  of  opinion  that, in  view of thepossibilities of savings which  we have  indicated above, the Estimate  should  bereduced by  12,500 to  196,100.CONCLUSION.

The figures for 1913/14 cannot be divided between England and Wales, and scotland&apos;.     The main increase in the Vote is due to the altered basis on which the Govern-ment Grant is paid.   Before the war State contributions were fixed on a capitationbasis; but owing to the increased  expenditure and the falling off  in voluntary con-tributions a new system was introduced under which the State paid 50 per cent, ofthe net expenditure  of  each Local Authority&apos;s school  and a proportion of  theaggregate expenditure on  voluntary schools, being the amount necessary with  theLocal Authority&apos;s flat rate contribution to provide for the proper maintenance of eachschool.     We have already commented on the disadvantages of percentage contributions,and our remarks apply with even greater force to contributions of this nature.  Weconsider that some grant system should be  devised which Would  leave to the con-trolling Authority full incentive for economical management now lacking.    2. The number of schools in England and Wales which now hold the certificate of the Secretary of State is as follows :                                                                Local                                                  Voluntary.

A detailed statement has been supplied showing the average weekly cost per head in a Reformatory  School in 1913 and 1922/23,  and the main items are given below : SalariesFood  (including  staff)ClothingDomesticOther items 1913. s.  d. 3  0 2 10 1  6 1  3 2  010  71922/23. s.  d. 8  67324656726  6IncreasePer cent.  183  165  128  100  130  150    In regard to Salaries, the Authorities responsible for these  Schools were com-pelled, in order  to obtain suitable teachers, to adopt the same scales as the LocalAuthorities, and we do not see how these Schools can hope to obtain a teaching staff at lower rates of  salary than those obtaining in the ordinary Elementary Day Schools.It is admitted, however, by the Home Office that certain Schools are extravagantlystaffed and pay exceptionally high salaries.    With increased salaries it is of even greater importance to  avoid overstaffing.5. Standard of Staffing.    We have examined details of the Schools from which staff returns for 1922/23have been received.    The following figures show  a very  serious increase  in thestandard of staffing as compared  with 1913 : No. of bedsNo. of childrenNo. of staff   ...No. of children per unit of staff .. 1913.14,04313,062 1,442  906 1922.14,63010,785 1,429  7-55    In other words, the standard of staffing has been raised by 16-6 per cent., or, ifthe standard of 1913 had been  maintained, 239  fewer  staff  would  have  beenemployed.    The position in London is even worse.   The children have increased from 962to 996, but the staff have gone up from 116 to  151, the ratio being 8-3 in 1913 asagainst 6-6 in 1921, an increase in the  standard of 20 per cent.  These figures areaverages, but there are individual cases where the results are still more unsatisfactory.    Figures which have been supplied to us show that the Schools in Scotland are more economically staffed than Schools in England and Wales, and in the. latter caseGirls&apos; Schools are more extravagantly staffed than Boys&apos;.    As in the  case of Elementary Schools, we  think  that  without  any  loss  of efficiency it  should be possible to increase the number of children per teacher,  andthus to effect a  saving in cost.    We  have examined the list of  instructors  given in the  returns from variousSchools, and noted, for example, that a School of only  140 boys had a full-time band-master at  208 per annum.  We cannot think that the musical training can justifythis.[7653]L  K
    It was admitted that the number of instructors in Boys&apos; Schools in some cases is too high..  We were told steps are being taken to reduce tlie number of instructors,ami to place bandmasters on a part-time basis.  We consider that the whole questionof instructors should be thoroughly reviewed, and that instructors should be retainedonly in cases where it is possible for  them to earn their salaries by the work they are able  to perform  in such industries as Boot-repairing, Tailoring, Baking, &amp;c.    Our examination tends to show that the staffing of these schools throughout isunnecessarily lavish  and that without any loss of efficiency economies are possible,but they can only be made by the Authorities controlling the schools,  and this willbe best attained  by a complete discontinuance of the percentage system of grants.    The other items  show large  percentage increases, and  we think without anyhardship reductions are. possible in the Estimate  for  1922/23.   For  example, theaverage cost of clothing is equal to  8 17s. Sd. per child  per annum.6. Day Industrial Schools.    The Day Industrial Schools, which were originally intended for the children who  played  truant from the  ordinary Elementary Schools, do not now perform thefunctions for which they were primarily intended.  As will be seen from  the table in paragraph 3, the  cost per head has risen enormously in  England and Walesfrom  13 to  50.   The total cost  of  these  schools in 1922/23  was  estimated at 21,909, but since the Estimates were submitted to us we learn that it is now proposedto close the three schools..7. Parents&apos;  Contributions.    The amount recovered from parents is as under :--                                                        Average per head                                                          per annum.             England  and Wales    ...       ...       ...     75s.  3d.             Scotland        ...       ...      ...       ...     22s.     It will be  seen  that the parents&apos; contribution in  Scotland are  far  below thecontributions in England  and Wales.   We cannot regard the sum collected  inScotland as adequate, and consider more energetic  steps should be taken to increasethe amount  collected.     8. In addition to the ordinary  contributions, the Secretary of State for  HomeAffairs and  the Secretary  for Scotland have had  sums set  apart called  &quot; variable.grant,&quot; the amounts for 1922/23 being  as under : -             England and Wales      ...       ...      ...     32,000             Scotland        ...        .........      5,500     In view of  our recommendation that a lump  sum grant be given, the necessityfor these variable grants disappears, as cases of  this kind must  be met  out  of dietotal grant.  The need for this is a.  collateral evil to the -percentage grant system.                                CONCLUSIONS.     After full consideration of the  circumstances, we  are of opinion:      (1.) That  the cost per head  has  risen  unreasonably,  owing largely to the            recently  introduced  system  of  percentage grants,  which  should  be            abolished.     (2.) That,  in view of  the  reduction  in  the number of children  committed,             certain schools should be closed.     (3.) That  the standard of staffing is lavish,  and  can be reduced without loss             of efficiency.     (4.) That  the Net  Estimates should be reduced from  481,586 to  435,000 in             England and Wales, and from  109,325 to  100,000 in Scotland.
BOARD OF CONTROL,  ENGLAND  AND WALES. 1913/14 Audited Expenditure1921/22 Net  Estimate  ...1922/23 Provisional Net Estimate 21,464511,364535,968    Since the Provisional Estimate was submitted, a revised Estimate has been putforward showing a reduction of  5,528.    The  contributions  under this Vote to Local Authorities are  in respect of theprovision and  maintenance of accommodation for mental defectives only who aregenerally speaking incurable.  The contributions do not cover cases of general lunacy.    The  Mental Deficiency Act was only passed in 1913 so that the expenditure during the year 1913/14 does not reflect the operation of the Act. The Exchequerpays 50 per cent,  of the expenditure  by Local Authorities approved by the  Depart-ment.  This is another instance of  the  percentage  grant system, and in our examination of the representatives of the Department, we were particularly struckwith the difficulty of controlling expenditure of this kind.    As  illustrating the variation in the standard  of management,  we  attach  as appendix  (A)  a statement showing the cost per head  in 1920/21  at both LocalAuthority Institutions  and Voluntary  Institutions.    The average cost per head varied  from  58 to as high as  320 in Local  AuthorityInstitutions, and from   41 to  76 in Voluntary Institutions.  The highest cost was explained as being due to the small  number of  patients in  relation to the certifiedaccommodation of the  Institution; but even comparing Institutions of similar sizewe found fluctuations,  the cost of some being practically  double that of others.    Taking the item of food alone, the cost per head at one Institution was  19, andat another  with a similar number of  patients this item cost   33-18.    It was admitted that some Local Authorities manage these Institutions on a moreextravagant scale than others;  but we found no evidence that  the expenditure  ofthose extravagant Authorities was reduced to the level of that of  the more prudentones before the  Government grant on  the percentage basis Avas certified for payment.    The number of places at present  provided in the Institutions to which the Statecontributes is 15,000, and there  are now 9,000  patients  in those Institutions.  Wewere told that  there was a large number of mentally defective  persons outside the institutions.    If this were not an activity which Ave regard as essential to the physical and moral health of the nation we Avould have recommended a substantial reduction  inthe Vote in order to enforce economy.  In the  circumstances we  refrain  from any reduction,  pointing out, however, that a larger number of  these  afflicted  personscould in our opinion  be taken  into these  Institutions  Avithin the  limits  of theEstimates.   There are  at the present time 6,000 places unoccupied.    We recommend that the necessary steps be taken to change this grant from a&quot;percentage&quot; basis  to  a &quot;per  capita&quot; basis coupled with provisions  to ensureadequate treatment and economical management.CONCLUSION.&apos; 7653K 2

GENERAL BOARD OF  CONTROL FOR SCOTLAND.1913/1.4 Audited Expenditure1921/22 Net Estimate   ...1922/23 Net Estimate   ...    6,13971.73376,333    Since this Estimate was prepared it has been intimated that the amount to beprovided for 1922/23 will be increased by  28,325.    The percentage grant system applies  to  Scotland as well as to England and    There  is only one Local  Authority Institution,  but there are a number ofInstitutions controlled by Voluntary Bodies.    There is accommodation in Institutions in Scotland for 1,477 defectives,  and1,268 patients are resident in those Institutions.  In addition, Scotland places casesof this kind under guardianship in private dwellings, and at the present time thereare  635 such cases.    So  far  as Voluntary  Institutions are concerned,  contract  rates per head  are approved by the Department; but  in the case of a Local Authority Institution  thedifficulty of controlling expenditure is as apparent  as in the case of England andWales.  In Scotland, however, the accounts seem to be dealt with in a  particularlyingenious manner.  Estimates  are submitted as to the probable cost in the coming financial year,  and  after discussion  are approved.   If  in  actual  working  theestimated cost is exceeded, as frequently  happens, the difference is carried forward and added to the cost of &quot; providing &quot; for the subsequent year or years; so that inform the authorised amount is complied with;  but, in fact, 50 per cent, of the whole cost, is  sooner or later borne by the Taxpayer.    The cost per head per annum at the three principal Institutions is as under :     The  average cost  per  head is  lower than in England.  We recommend no reduction in the  sums asked for, but, as recommended for England and Wales, thegrant should be on a &quot; per capita &quot; basis, and all necessary steps should be taken toensure economy.Wales.    s.  d.93  1  159  8  351  9  6The first instance is a Local Authority Institution.CONCLUSION.

In this Part wo deal with twenty-four votes which do not fall into convenientgroups according to subject-matter,  but which are  arranged  according to theirclassification in the Civil Service Estimates.    These Provisional Net Estimates for 1922/23 represent a total  expenditure of 1,566,365, and we have  made recommendations wherever we  have  come  to  theconclusion that economies might be effected.

In spite of this arrangement India has voluntarily offered to accept a  reducedgrant of  120,000 for 1922/23, and this offer has been accepted.    The sum in the  Estimates is, therefore, fixed by agreement, and actual  costs donot  fall upon the Estimates, and therefore are outside the scope of this enquiry.CHARITY  COMMISSION.       CLASS  11(18).1913/14 Audited Expenditure1921/22 Estimate1922/23 Provisional  Estimate   29,52956,64748.177     This Provisional  Estimate  has since  been  reduced to   44,561 a saving of  3,616.     The staff employed in 1913/14 numbered 127 and will be reduced to 119 by the  st April, 1922.     The main  function of the Department is  to exercise supervision over public charitable  Trusts, and the  advice  of  the  Commissioners is constantly sought by Trustees for their protection and assistance in their administration.     Since 1913/14 no  functions have been transferred from the Commissioners or abolished; but  several new duties have been added as under:      Duties under          &quot;The Blind Persons Act, 1920.&quot;         &quot; The  Places of Worship Enfranchisement  Act, 1920.&quot;         &quot; The  War  Charges Act, 1916.&quot;     Questions arising under          &quot; The  Welsh Church Acts, 1914 and 1919.&quot;         &quot; The  Parochial Church Councils Boards Measure, 1921.&quot;     The following figures give a comparison of the volume of work and the amountof Trust money administered by the Commissioners, hut do no more than form avery rough basis for comparing the duties in the two periods:                                                      1913.          1920.

After full consideration, however,  we have come  to the conclusion that such  fees would bedifficult to collect, and as the work is in connection with &quot; Charities &quot; we think thatan exception can properly be made from our general principle that the  cost ofGovernment services rendered should be met by fees.[7653]

The Gross  Estimate of the cost of this Department for the  year  1922/23 is 142,000, which compares with a  pre-war average of  102,000.  This expenditure,however, will not entail any charge on the  Exchequer as the whole cost is met byfees charged in Bankruptcy cases.    We make no recommendation.

The Government  Chemist advises  Government  Departments, Committees and parliament  on all questions requiring the  advice  of expert chemists, with  theexception of such work as is performed by the &quot; Fighting Departments.&quot;  The workincludes the analysis of samples in connection with the Assessment to Revenue andDrawback,  and in connection with the construction of Armament  for the admiralty and Air Ministry, the chemical work of the Geological Survey, the analysis of samplessupplied to Government Departments on tender or contract, the analysis of samplesof food and other supplies for the War Office, and of produce for the Ministry ofAgriculture; and  the  analysis of samples referred by Magistrates under the food and Drugs  Act.    The work of this Department does  not admit of a merely &quot; quantitative &quot; com-parison of the number of &quot; samples&quot; analysed in different years.   It does, however,appear that the number of samples dealt with steadily maintains the pre-war averageof about 350,000 a year, but the field covered by  these analysis is more varied than previously and much &quot; fundamental&quot; work is thereby involved.    A large quantity of work of a new kind has recently been thrown upon  theDepartment in connection with the Safeguarding  of Industries Act, the Importationof Dyestuffs (Regulation) Act, and the  Dangerous Drugs Act.    We make no recommendation.

The following figures give some indication of the work of the Department:          The increase in  the staff for 1922 compared with&apos; 1914=15 per cent.         Increase  in  numbers  of  Civil Service  Certificates&apos; issued  for  1921 =            30 per cent.         Increase in numbers of candidates examined in 1921 = 50  per cent.    It is unlikely that the  work of the Commission will have shrunk to normaldimensions by the end of 1922, as reductions of staff will be mainly in temporaryclasses.    .We make no  recommendation.

The total expenditure on  supply services, which has to be audited, has increased from   160,000,000 in 1913/14 to  750,000,000 in 1921/22, and in addition thereare receipts on  liquidation services amounting to  158,000,000, which have to beaudited.  But for  the Act of last  year,  which gave the Comptroller and Auditor-General discretion as to the extent of his audit, we are satisfied that much largerincreases in staff would have  been necessary.   Consequently we have no suggestion to make that this staff,  which is safeguarding the interests of the Taxpayer, shouldbe reduced.    x\lthough our  recommendations, if adopted, will&apos; result in a reduction  of theexpenditure to be audited in future, audit is  of course conducted in arrear, and wecannot therefore suggest a reduction of this Estimate at present.     65,543182,220160,530[7653]

Certain of what are nowperhaps the more important  duties of the Office  are off-shoots from the  early legislation relating to Friendly Societies.    The Friendly Societies&apos; Register has been in existence for nearly a century, thecertification of rules of Savings Banks and Friendly Societies being made compulsoryby the Savings Bank Act, 1828, and the Friendly Societies Act, 1829.  The main workof the Chief Registrar is in connection with the registration, the certification of rules,and the amendment of rules of Friendly, Industrial and Provident, Building andLoan Societies, and Trustee and Railway Savings Banks.  The Chief Registrar isalso  responsible for adjudicating in  disputes as to Building Societies and as todeposits in  the  Post Office, Trustee or  Railway Savings  Banks.  He also has  to prosecute for offences against various Acts, and for  misapplication of funds.    Annual returns, containing the accounts of 36,900 Societies, &amp;c, registered underthe various Acts administered by the Office, have to be examined.    New  statutory duties have  been imposed since August  1914 by  Acts  oflegislation.  In spite  of these additional duties, many of which are  permanent, thestaff has been reduced from 180 in August 1914 to 165 in April 1922.    The expenditure under the Vote  is almost entirely on staff, and although thenumbers of staff have been reduced, the cost has considerably increased, owing to thefact that the members of the staff in 1914 were mostly very junior and at the minimum of the scales.    The volume of work thrown upon this Department by Statute is best illustrated by the membership and accumulated funds of the various organisations, which arenow subject to the control of  the Central Office.   These are as follows :

The major portion of the work of the Department is concerned with the valuation of Approved Societies under the National Insurance Acts,  the remainder consistingof references from other Departments for actuarial advice.    The Department has proved  itself of great  assistance  in  the control ofexpenditure, and also in  giving advice when legislation  affecting UnemploymentInsurance,  War Pensions, and matters  of similar character have been before theHouse of Commons; and in existing  circumstances we  do not  recommend any reduction in the numbers of staff proposed for 1922/23.   In fact there are cases, e,.g.,Teachers&apos; Superannuation and Police Pensions where  we think great advantagemight have been derived from extended actuarial advice.

They are now responsible  for  about sixtyaccounts and hold securities totalling about  672,000,000.    Having regard to the increase of work, and the importance of the functions ofthis Office in connection with national finance, we make no recommendation.

The estimated gross expenditure for 1922/23 is  21,336,as compared with a gross cost of  11,527 in 1913/14.    The staff on  the  1st  August, 1914, numbered 49, and the Estimate  for the1st April, 1922, is 58.    The work has increased as  follows :         Loans  granted              1914/15  ...   1,303,  totalling approximately  5 millions.             1920/21  ...   2,835,  totalling approximately  61-1 millions.

The function of this Department is to administer the Local Loans Fund, fromwhich loans are made under Statutory authority to Local Authorities and certain other bodies for Housing,  Land Settlement and similar purposes.    Fees are charged on a  scale fixed by the  Treasury for  the  work  done by theDepartment in connection with  loans, and these fees are appropriated in aid of the vote up to the amount of  the  gross expenditure  (less a token sum).  Receipts inexcess  of  the  expenditure  are paid into the  Exchequer;  such  extra  receipts are estimated  at   12,465 in 1913/14 and  53,670 in 1922/23.    In  the circumstances, we make no recommendation.

It therefore represents a reduction of50 per cent, on  1921/22.    After considering all the  circumstances, we think this figure should be capableof a further reduction to  180,000.    This last figure nearly four times the pre-War expenditure should,  in ouropinion, be sufficient.

The cost of salaries per head has increased from  17 in 1913/14 to over  62in 1922/23, largely due to the increased pay of the warders and also to a reductionof their hours from 13 per day to 60f per week.

The total expenditure of the League of  Nations in 1921 is  estimated  to be 1,003,778, towards which, on the present basis of contribution, the British Empirepays 23 per cent.  The contribution of Great Britain alone is just under 10  per cent.For the year 1922,  it is estimated that the cost to the British taxpayer will be 115,446.    The finance of the League is  controlled by  a &quot; Commission of Control,&quot;consisting of five members, one of whom, at least, has to be a financial expert.  this commission examines  in detail the Budget prepared by the Secretary-General ofthe League and then submits  it, with a Report, to the Council of the League.    The Commission of Control for the year  1922 is composed of representativesof France, Chili, Holland, New Zealand and Czecho-Slovakia.    The British Government&apos;s control of  the expenditure of the League is limitedto any representations which the Government may make through their representative on the Council of the League, and so  far as the Pommission of Control is concerned,the  Government relies on the representative of New Zealand to watch any special interests of  Great Britain.    The Budget for 1922, a  copy of. which is  attached (Appendix  &quot; A &quot;), provides 233,000  for  Establishment  charges,  37,000 for  Office Expenses,  219,000  forspecial  Organisations,  Councils  and   Committees,  and   70,000  for   CapitalExpenditure at Geneva.    The rates of pay of the officials and staff have either been fixed by international agreement or have  been the  subject  of  investigation by a Committee of  Experts.They are held by the Treasury to be not out of  keeping with those paid in the  home civil Service and the Diplomatic Service, and although  they  are free of income-tax,  this only compensates the staff for the very high cost of living in Geneva, andfor the disadvantages  of serving abroad.    Unless  Geneva  is fixed  as the permanent home of  the League of Nations, wesuggest for  consideration whether  some less expensive place could  not be found forthe Secretariat of the League, and also whether some method could  not be devisedwhereby a closer check of the activities  of the League,  which appear to involve considerable expenditure, could be secured.

The provisionrequired for 1922/23 represents the amount directed by the Public Works Loans Act,1921, to be written off the  assets of the Fund in respect of certain loans specified inthe Schedules to that Act.  We are assured that the writing off of a loan from the assets of the Fund as a bad debt in no way relieves the debtor from liability, and that,if any sum is subsequently recovered,  it is payable to the Exchequer.    In the circumstances we make no recommendation.                 FRIENDLY SOCIETIES&apos; DEFICIENCY.                                CLASS VII (8).                                                                          1913/14 Audited Expenditure    ...       ...     14,653            1921/22 Net Estimate   ...      ...       ...      6,802            1922/23 Provisional  Net Estimate ...       ...      6,000    This Vote represents a provision required by Statute to make good the deficiency in the  income  of the  Friendly Societies&apos; Fund arising from the fact that  certainmoneys were invested by Friendly Societies  in the past with  the  National  DebtCommissioners at rates which proved to be in excess of the rate of interest which those Commissioners could earn in the market.  The excessive rates are payable onlfon moneys invested by Friendly Societies in the Fund in respect of contracts made bythem before June 1888, since which date the rates have been reduced.  To alter thesystem would require legislation, and  the winding up of the Fund would involve the repayment  of the Capital liability of approximately  250,000.    The charge  is  a gradually expiring one, and in the circumstances we make no recommendation.    It may be added that the Exchequer is entitled, on the other hand, to receive the excess of interest accruing on Securities held by the National Debt Commissioners onaccount of  the Fund for  Savings  Banks, and it is estimated that  200,000  will bepaid into the Exchequer in 1922/23 on  this account.UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF  GRANTS.

This expenditure  arises out of  schemes  approved by  the  Government in theAutumn of 1920 for expediting Road Construction and Road Improvement works with a view to the relief of unemployment.    The provision is for meeting commitments entered into in  1920/21, in respectof schemes now in progress, and it  does not  appear to be  possible, therefore, toreduce it.1.1

The sums provided are distributed to LocalAuthorities to meet part of their expenditure on schemes approved by a Committeesitting under the Chairmanship of Lord St. Davids.  The provision  for 1922/23covers  the balance of grants on schemes  approved, but  not completed, before the31st March, 1922.   The whole of the expenditure in 1922/23 is thus in respect  ofexisting commitments; but the Provisional Estimate of  300,000 has been increasedto  630,000.  In the circumstances we make no recommendation.
                         CONCLUDING  REMARKS.    Before concluding this, our Second Interim Report, we wish to adjust certainfigures in the Estimates dealt with in our First Interim Report.   Our consideration in three cases was based upon revised Estimates which were  submitted to us, andnot upon the July Provisional Estimates upon which your original remit was made.    These adjustments, which are in the Ministry  of Pensions,  University Grants,and in Old-Age Pensions, amount in  all to a  reduction of  2,171,875; but on theother  hand, provisions made  in November  last in  respect of Unemployment have resulted in an increased charge of  1,000,000                                                                        Which  leaves  a net  reduction  of     1,171,875        To be added to  the        ......    70,300,000      -  resulting from the recommendations             in our First Interim  Report,        Which gives a total of          . .         ...        71,471,875        In  this Report, we  recommend the            following reductions :            Trade  Group         ...       ...       538,000          Export Credits        ...       ...       500,000          Agricultural Group    ...       ...       855,000          Police  and Prisons    ...   .    ...      1.595,000          General Group (24 Votes)      ...       102,000                                              -------     3,590,000          Total  reductions of First and Second Interim            Reports        ...       ...       ...      ...    75,061,875    The present position, therefore, is that we have made recommendations to youof  75,061,875 towards the  100,000,000 which you asked us to find.    There remain 60 Votes, representing  100,000,000 of expenditure, and various other  matters which are outstanding.   With these we  will deal in our next and final Report.  In the meantime, however, we would point out that so far we havenot been informed as to what extent the Government intend         (a.) To  adjust  the  Navy Estimates,  as  a result of the Washington              Conference.        (b.) To   reconsider the  proposed  expenditure   on Oil Stocks and Oil              Storage.        (c.) To review the permanent military garrisons abroad.To these three matters we have drawn attention in our First Report.    We are of opinion that  further large savings might be obtained under  these three  heads.  They involve  questions of high policy, and we should be glad to haveguidance thereon  from the  Government, as we hope to deal with them in our final report, which we propose to submit before the end of February.                                We are, Sir,                                     ,  Your obedient Servants,                                  (Signed)       ERIC GEDDES  (Chairman).
