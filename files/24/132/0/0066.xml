By desire of the Prime Minister the following Committeewas established to consider the suggestions and recommenda-tions contained in Parts II and III of  the Interim Report of theCommittee on National  Expenditure (CP. 3570) (hereinafter called  the  &quot; Interim  Report&quot;),  and to report  thereon  to theCabinet:         The Lord Privy Seal (Chairman).        The Chancellor of the Exchequer.        The Home Secretary.        The Secretary for Scotland.        The President of  the Board of Education.        The Minister of Health.        The Minister of Labour.        The Financial Secretary to the Treasury.        The Director of Overseas Trade.                      With Mr. R. B. Howorth as Secretary.    2.  &quot;We have carefully examined  Parts  II  and III of the interim Report of  the  Committee on National  Expenditure(CP- 3570).    3.  We have not  yet  completed  our examination  of thesection dealing with Education and  we reserve for  separatetreatment one very important recommendation which is common to many services, viz. : the substitution of block grants fixed fora term of years for existing percentage grants, but we  are in aposition to  deal at once with the specific recommendations ofthe Geddes  Committee on  Health, Labour, Old Age Pensionsand the Ministry of Pensions.    4.  Before  recording our  conclusions in detail we desire tomake two general observations :     We are impressed by  the  great value of the work done        by  the Committee and  the assistance which  their        report  will  afford  both to  the Government  and        Parliament  in  realising  the true character  of the        problem and the nature  and conditions of  the reduc-        tions which can be  effected.  Equally worthy of note is        the effort made  by the Departments  themselves and        more   than   once  handsomely  recognised   by the        Committee to effect reductions.   Thus the Committee        on  National Expenditure  point out  that the reductions        suggested  by them  amounting in the aggregate to         70,300,000 in respect of  all  the Services dealt with in        the Interim  Report are additional  to  the still greater        reductions amounting in  all to  75,000,000 which the        Departments  had  themselves proposed in their first        sketch of  the Estimates for the year 1922-23.

But  this  is  only ;i part of tlie  contribution  made bythe Departments, for hi many eases the suggestions for further reductions adopted in  the Interim Report originated  with theDepartments themselves, and the conclusions of the  Committeeare generally accepted by the four Departments  covered by thisReport.    6. If  our recommendations are approved, the  Estimates tobe presented to Parliament by  these  Departments will compareas follows with those submitted in 1921-22 and with the Geddes&apos;Committee proposals:  	19i.&apos;l-22 j Interim Report Estimate.

MedicalReferee Consultants(p. 91).       (Interim Report, Part II, Chapter II, pp. 90-100.)    7. The Committee on National Expenditure advise that theEstimates  of the  Ministry  of Health and  National HealthInsurance  Joint  Committee for the  year  1922-23 should  bereduced from  24,269,500 and  350,500 respectively to  22,100,000in all.    We agree, but we recommend some variations in detail.    8. The Interim Report recommends that the Central MedicalReferee Service  should  be   discontinued  and  that  approved societies should in future employ  their own referees.   We areinformed that  the present  system gives  a far more efficientservice than would  be possible at the same cost under a systemof Societies&apos; referees.   We  see no  objection  to  the  presentsystem if the whole cost of  the service is transferred from the taxpayer to the insured person and  accordingly recommend:     That the  Central  Medical   Referee   Service  should  be        continued, but that the  whole  cost  of  that service        should  be recovered from  the  Societies  out of  the        proposed   extra contributions   (see  under  heading        &quot;National Health Insurance&quot; below).(&amp;.)

Welsh Boardof  Health, Cardiff(p. 92).    10. The Interim Report states :  &quot; A Board of Health was setup  in Wales to  which  some of the Ministry&apos;s functions in wales were delegated.  This has led to unnecessary duplicationof staff, and we are informed that   40,000 out of  80,000 couldbe saved if the work were transferred to the Ministry in London,and we suggest that this change should be adopted.&quot;
Housing; LocalAuthorities, &amp;c.;Housing Schemes(pp. 92-94).    12. The  Interim Report  recommends that, with a view to reducing the  heavy charge on  the State, an active  policy of saleof houses should be adopted.    We recommend the Cabinet     (1.) To approve in principle the general  policy of sale of           houses, as suggested in the Interim Report.    (2.) To authorise the Minister of Health to proceed as far as           possible on the lines of              (a.) Removing statutory restrictions on sale; and             (6.) Continuing the present practice of encouraging                   sales wherever prices can be obtained which                   result in a reduction of the State commitment.Public health services,Tuberculosis(Maintenance) and capital (p. 94).    13. The Interim Report suggests that the  sum provided in1921-22 should be  repeated, viz.,  1,202,000, and that a  sum of 360,000 should be provided for capital commitments.   We find that the  sum  of  360,000  can now be reduced to   210,000, andthat the  Ministry of  Health recommend that this saving of 150,000,  with an additional sum of  100,000, should be providedfor maintenance to avoid closing  beds on a large scale.   Theadoption of the Geddes figure  would necessitate  the closing ofbeds.   We are unable to take the  responsibility of reducing thenumber now available.   . We accordingly recommend     That the amount to be provided in the Ministry of Health        Estimates for  1922-23 for Tuberculosis  (maintenance)        should be  1,452,000,  the  amount for   Tuberculosis        (capital) being  210,000.Maternity and.          14. The Interim Report also suggests that the sum providedChild Welfare      for this service in 1921-22 should be  repeated, viz.,  1,042,000.(p. 94).            Here  again we are  of opinion that  the Minister of Health has                 established a case  for increasing  the above figure  by a  sum  of                  75,000, and accordingly recommend                      That  the amount to be provided  in the Ministry of  Health                         Estimates  for  1922-23 in  respect of Maternity  and                         Child Welfare should be  1,117,000.*                     In  each  of the two  last-mentioned  eases the  increased                 provision  for 1922-23 should enable  the present services to be                 continued during 1922-23 on /the same scale as  in  1921-22, but                 without any extension.                    * This recommendation may be affected by the activities of the Board of Education                 in the same field.       [7746]                                                        B 2                     There is  no doubt  that economy could be secured by the                 abolition  of  the Welsh  Board, but  this  raises  questions of                 national sentiment and policy, and cannot be  determined solely                 by reference to expense.                     We recommend                      That the question of the future of the Welsh Board of Health                          should be left for decision  by the Cabinet.(e.) Alkali             11. We agree with the  Interim Report that services of thisInspectors (p. 92).   nature should, as  a general principle, be self-supporting,  and                 accordingly recommend                      That the necessary legislative powers  should be obtained                          by the Minister of  Health  with a view to increasing the                          fees  to a figure sufficient substantially to cover the cost                          of the staff.
Venereal Diseases        15.  The Interim Report  recommends that sums of  424,000 r1 W&quot;elfaare of the  ,UKj  80,000 proposed by the  Ministry of Health for insertion inBlind (p. 94).       the Estimates for 1922-23  in respect of &quot; Venereal Diseases &quot; and                 &quot; Welfare of the Blind &quot; respectively should be passed.          .  .         AVe concxir in these recommendations.Port Sanitation andExamination of aliens (p. 94).    16. The Interim Report  states that until recently the costof this service was entirely borne by the locality, and suggeststhat the Exchequer grant should cease.  It is not suggested thatthe services could be abandoned or reduced ; the adoption of thisrecommendation would therefore only free the Exchequer at thecost of the rates.    17. We are informed that of the amount involved ( 45,000)about  one-third  to  one-fourth  is  attributable to the medical examination of  aliens, of  which  the whole  cost  falls on  theExchequer, and  the  residue  to  services in connection with  thegeneral sanitary work of the ports, such as the  inspection of foodstuffs and general medical inspection, &amp;c, the cost of whichis shared equally by the State and the Local Authorities.   Wehave carefully examined the nature of the charges  and the area for the benefit  of which  they are  undertaken.   We find  thatthey  are  in large  measure  national  services  in the  efficientmaintenance of  which the whole nation  is interested and that;the present Exchequer contribution is, in ail the circumstances,a fair one for the State to make.    We recommend     That provision  should be made  in  the Estimates of  the         Ministry of  Health for  1922-23 for the sum  of  45,000         for Port Sanitation and Examination of Aliens.National HealthInsurance(pp. 95-96).    18. The  Interim Report (summary of Conclusion (3). p. 96)states  that, as regards National Health  Insurance, &quot;the state has progressively accepted additional  burdens  and additionalcosts when they occurred, and has  not  reaped any benefit fromthe &apos; windfalls&apos;  which accrued  to  the funds of the approved societies  as  a  consequence of  the  war.  We  think  that,  as opportunity offers, such burdens should be  transferred  to  theinsurance organisations, where they might well  be compensated for, in  part at any rate, by betterment in  the  actuarial position,and  that a  very small increase  in  contribution  should  be imposed to meet the additional  cost of  medical  and  other benefits now  borne by the State in excess of  its proper share oftwo-ninths.&quot;    We recommend     (1.) That, as suggested in the Interim Report, the  State&apos;s           share of  the  National Health  Insurance  burden           should be reduced by increasing from the  1st July,           1922,  the total  contributions  from  employers ami           employed by \d. a week  in each case.    (2.) That the Minister of Health  should be  requested to           prepare forthwith the necessary draft legislation for           consideration by the Home Affairs Committee.    (3.) That the draft Bill in question should include proposals           for disposing of the balance of the new contribution           money.Ijummary of conclusions(pp. 96 and 97).    19. Our recommendations  on the suggestions contained inparagraphs (1), (2), (3) and (4) of the Summary of Conclusions onpp. 96  and 97 of the Interim Report are set out in the foregoing paragraphs.   As  regards  Conclusion (5), we are in agreement
                with the Committee on National  Expenditure and the Minister                of Health and accordingly recommend                     (1.) That the  Estimates of  the Ministry of  Health  and                           National Health Insurance Joint Committee  for the                           year 1922-23 should be reduced from  24,269,500 and                            350,500 respectively to  22,100,000 in all.                    (2.) That any  necessary  legislation  be promoted  to take                           effect not later than the 1st July, 1922.                    20. We draw attention  to the fact that the reduction in (1)                above is apart from any savings which may accrue from the sale                of houses.

Report  the  Committee on National  Expenditure observe that,                owing to the uncertainty which prevails, at the present time, and                the direct bearing on this Estimate of the rate of Unemployment,                the sum  available for 1922-23  cannot be reduced  below the                amount shown in the Preliminary Estimates.    &apos;22.  The  Provisional  Estimates  for  1921-22,  includingSupplementary  Estimates  taken,  and  for  1922-23,  are  asfollows:  	1921-22.	1922-23.Ordinary Services Services arising out of the war Total .. .. .:	  11,982,101 10,155,304	  9,779,200 5,211,500	22,137,405	14,990,700UnemploymentInsurance (p. 104,Conclusion (1) ).UnemploymentInsurance Scheme(p. 104, Conclusions(2) and (3) ).UnemploymentInsurance by industry.      [77W]    23.  The following is a Summary of the Conclusions reached by the Committee on National Expenditure (see Interim Report,page 104) and our recommendations :     24.  The  Interim  Report states in effect that so  long  asUnemployment Insurance is on  the present basis, EmploymentExchanges are required as  agencies  for checking payments ofUnemployment Insurance benefits.    We agree.    25.  The Interim Report states that the &quot; present Unemploy-ment Insurance  Scheme is  only partially a mutual insurancescheme, and is very complicated  and costly to administer on that account,&quot; and  proceeds to recommend that a  Committee of experts  should be  set up forthwith, with a view to simplifyingthe Unemployment Insurance Scheme, amalgamating Unemploy-ment Health and Insurance cards, records, and, as far as possible,administration,  and  exploring  the  possibility  of developingUnemployment Insurance by industry.    We report     That the Ministers concerned  have already taken the steps         here recommended.    26. We  are  of  opinion, however, that  a Committee  soconstituted would-not have sufficient expei&apos;ience or authority to                                                   B ;j
The Indus trialRelationsDepartment (p. 104,Conclusion (4) ).Proposed abolitionof the EmploymentExchanges and&apos;the Ministry ofLabour (p. 104,Conclusion (5) ).Services arisingout of the War(p. 104, conclusion) ).Staff of the Ministryof Labour (p. 101,para. 2).Payments throughAssociations(p. 103).undertake  the  exploration  of  the  possibility  of  developingUnemployment Insurance by industry.    We recommend     That this question should be remitted for examination  to        another   Committee   including  representatives   of        employers of labour ami of organised labour.    27. The  Interim  Report  states that  &quot; the  scope  of theIndustrial  Relations  Department should be considered, as alsothe work of the Trade Boards Division, after receipt of the Reportof Lord Cave&apos;s Committee, and that  their transfer to the Board.of Trade should also be considered.&quot;    We approve this recommendation.    28. The Interim  Report suggests that  when decisions havebeen reached on the questions  referred to these Committees andon  the future of  the Industrial Relations Department, theabolition of the Employment Exchanges and of the Ministry ofLabour should be considered.    This recommendation is subject to the proviso that so longas Unemployment  Insurance  is on. the  present  basis, labour exchanges are required for their present purposes.    We agree     That such consideration will be required.    29. The Interim Report recommends that no further fit men should be entered for training,  and estimates an ultimate saving of  500,000 from this source.   We are informed by the Ministerof Labour  that it is not his intention to enter the names of anymore fit ex-Service men for the Training Scheme,  but  that he is unable to accept the estimate that as much as  500,000 will be saved by this decision.  The Minister expects  to  achieve  equalsavings in this and other directions arising out of the terminationof the war services.    We agree with  the Minister of Labour.    30. In discussing the  Staff of the  Ministry of Labour, the interim  Report  states:  &quot; We  do not  consider a  period  of exceptional unemployment as the most appropriate for settling apermanent establishment,  and strongly deprecate any additionto the Permanent Staff at the present time.&quot;    We concur.    31. The Interim  Report draws attention  to  the fact that&quot; Insurance benefits from the Fund are now  paid in certain, casesthrough the  medium  of  Associations,  such as Trade Unions.These payments are made under Section 17 of  the Act of  1920,and the Unions receive one shilling for  administration expensesfor  every week&apos;s  benefit they  pay out.  Unfortunately,  from a variety of causes, this  procedure, instead of  reducing the cost tothe Taxpayer as originally anticipated, actually increases it, andthe payments to the  Unions  for these  services  amounted to 500,000 in 1921-22.&quot;    32. The Interim Report adds  that,  unless a more completescheme whereby  each industry would look  after  its   ownunemployed can be introduced in the  near future, the present arrangement should be reviewed,    We recommend     That  this question   should  be  referred  to  the  Inter-        Departmental Committee  whose establishment   is        suggested  above  under the  heading  &quot; Unemployment        Insurance  Scheme.&quot;
                  OLD AGE  PENSIONS.         (Interim Report, Part II, Chapter IV, p. 113.)    83. The Interim Report points out that the  cost of Old age pensions  in  Great Britain (excluding Ireland) has increased from  . 9,821,000 in  1913-14 &apos; to   21,750,000  in  1921-22 and 22,304,000 in 1922-23.    34. After indicating the nature of the increases due to theprovisions of &quot; The Old Age Pensions Act, 1919,&quot; and the factthat the  cost  of  living figures  are  not at the  present timeappreciably below  the  rate prevailing  at the  time when the increases  were  decided  upon,  the  Committee  on  National.Expenditure state that:         &quot; In  view of the  foregoing considerations we  do not    consider  that  any reduction in this Estimate  for 1922-23 is    possible, unless  the Government wish to reduce the amount    of Old Age Pension now paid.  This is a question of policy    as to which we express no opinion.&quot;    We take note of this conclusion reached by the Committee        on National Expenditure, and make no recommendation        to the Cabinet on the subject.Summary of conclusions(p. 118).-Treatment,Beds in NaVal andMilitary Hospitals(p. 116 (a) and (b)).                MINISTRY OF  PENSIONS.       (Interim Report, Part III, Chapter I, pp. 111-121.)    35. The  Committee on  National  Expenditure  make  thefollowing recommendation . respecting  the  estimates of  theMinistry of Pensions for 1922-23 :     &quot;We recommend in all  the circumstances of the case that         the Estimates  for 1922-23 be reduced from   96,360,000         to  93,000,000, a reduction of 3  millions.&quot;    36. Whilst fulfilling all obligations to the persons interested,the Ministry are able to secure  an  additional reduction of  nearly 3,000,000, bringing their total  expenditure down to  90,156,000.This most satisfactory result is mainly due to the substantial economies which will result from the administrative reorganisa-tion of the pensions service made possible by the provisions of.&quot; The War Pensions Act, 1921.&quot;    We  recommend     That the Estimates of the  Ministry of Pensions for the year         1922-23 should be taken at  90,156,000 gross.    37. The following is a summary of the particular conclusions reached  by the Committee on  National Expenditure and of our recommendations and decisions thereon.    38. The Interim Report makes  the  following observations on  the question of the utilisation of vacant beds in naval andmilitary hospitals  for pensioners under treatment     &quot; (a.) The accommodation  at  Ministry hospitals is  rather           under  14,000 beds,  though Treasury  authority has           been obtained  for  15,000  beds, which was a great           reduction  on  the demands made by the Ministry.           The number of beds occupied on the 30th June, 1921,           was 11,600, and unoccupied  2,400.  We are informed           that the accommodation is being steadily decreased           as opportunity offers,  but consider that much more           rapid  progress  is  desirable,  as the proportion  of           unoccupied beds seems excessive.
&quot; (&amp;.) There are 11,85(5 beds  in  Admiralty  and War Office       hospitals in this country, of which 5,335 are filled and       0,521 are unoccupied.  Altogether, therefore, in these       three Departments the taxpayer is providing 25,856       beds, and  of  that number 9,821 beds are unoccupied.       Immediate steps should, in our opinion, be  taken to       utilise spare  accommodation in naval and military       hospitals  for  pensioners  under  treatment,  thus       enabling buildings  hired by Ministry of  Pensions to       be surrendered.&quot; We concur. The Minister  of  Pensions  informs us that steps on  the     above  lines have already been  taken, and that  the     Admiralty and War Office have expressed their willing-     ness to allot to the Ministry any accommodation that     may be available.Beds in CivilianHospitals(p. 116 (c) ).    39. The  Interim  Report speaks of the use by the Ministryof Pensions of beds in civilian hospitals as follows :    &quot;(c.) We  are  not  satisfied  that  the fullest: possible use is           being  made  of  civil  hospitals.   It appears that,           including cost of accommodation, each patient in a           Ministry  of  Pensions hospital  is  costing  ou  the           average 10s.  lid. a  day, whereas the capitation rate           at civil hospitals averages 9s. a day.  General surgical           and  medical  cases  should  to a  large extent,  we           suggest, be  treated  either in  civil hospitals or hi           naval or military hospitals.&quot;    We agree.Home Treatment(P. 116 00 ).    40. The  Interim  Report ((d) p. 116) suggests &quot;that  the-question of a  strict  limitation  of home  treatment should beconsidered,  as it  is  admittedly  unsatisfactory,  and  leads toabuse.&quot;We agree.Much has already been done in this respect.TreatmentAllowances(p. 116 (d) ).    41. The Interim Report ( (d), p. 116) points out that Treat-ment Allowances are on a generous scale and become even more so  in  cases  where a man  is entitled to  Health  insurance benefit, rank allowances or service  pension, and suggests thatthese  allowances  should  receive  immediate  consideration.Taking the recommendations separately : Health insurance benefit.    42. The Interim Report states that if Treatment allowances are reduced  by &quot;the amounts  received  for  Health  insurance benefits, the saving would be  roughly  1,000,000 per annum.The Minister of Pensions is of opinion that while sickness benefitcannot  fairly or wisely be wholly set off against the allowances,he is prepared to meet&apos; the recommendation by  deducting fromthe Treatment Allowances one half of the  amount of the sickness benefit.    We agree with the Minister of Pensions.Kank Allowances,Service Pensions,HospitalAllowances and wife&apos;s Allowance.43.  Tne Minister of  Pensions points out that: (1.) To  discontinue  the payment of additions for  rank or      service in the case of men in receipt  of  treatment      allowances :
    (2.) To increase in the case of a man in hospital the present;           contribution (19s. out of the allowance of 40.s.) towards           the cost of his maintenance in hospital;  and    (3.) To reduce the allowance  paid  to the wife  of  a man           undergoing treatment so as to make it  tlie same as           in the case of the wife of a totally disabled man,would be in derogation of rights expressly conferred by the termsof the Royal Warrant. *    We agree that these particular economies cannot be effectedwithout a breach of faith.Orderlies              44. The Interim  Report  observes  that  &quot;there  are  1,888(p. 116 (s)).        orderlies employed in Ministry hospitals, which is equivalent to                 one orderly for six patients.  This number  appears  to be very                 high, and we  suggest that patients who are in a condition to do                 so should do more light work and thus reduce this heavy item of                 cost.&quot;                     We  are informed that a substantial proportion of the total                 number of men classed as &quot; orderlies &quot; are actually employed on                 general duties of a miscellaneous character,  and that of a total                 number  of  orderlies employed at a Ministry institution, only                 about  40 to 45 per cent, perform duty in the wards.   Moreover,                 it has been represented to us that the high proportion of helpless                 in-patients  in  the Ministry-&apos;s  hospitals  necessitates  somewhat                 more liberal staffing than in the ordinary civil hospital.                     We recommend                      That the Minister  of  Pensions should  be urged to make                          every  effort to  reduce the heavy cost involved in the                          employment of orderlies in Ministry hospitals.Parents&apos; PensionsKP. 117).    45. The Interim Report comments on two classes of pension at present payable to parents, viz., pre-war dependence.pensionsand flat-rate (5s. a week) pensions.  With regard to the former,the Report suggests in effect that an examination of past awards of this  class should be  made to  ascertain whether the awardshave  been made on a correct estimate of the facts, and also thata  final date for application should be fixed.  As  regards thefiat-rate pension, the Report points out that this class of pensionwas &quot; granted to any parent who lost  a  son under 20 years ofage, irrespective of  whether the parent is in need or whether theson ever contributed support. It is a question of policy whether such pensions should be  limited to cases of need, but, apart fromthis, we think it desirable that a final date  for application shouldbe fixed.&quot;    We agree  and have authorised the Minister of Pensions to        give notice forthwith that he has fixed the 31st March,        1922, as the  final  date  for application for these two        classes of  pension,  the form of the notice to indicate        that no application made after the 31st  March,  1922,        will be entertained, and that cases of real need will fall        to be dealt with under other provisions of the  Warrant.        Legislation  may be necessary to  give  effect  to the        results of  the examination of past awards.Administration*p. 118).    40. After pointing out  the sweeping changes which arebeing made in administration as a result of &quot; The War  pensions act, 1921,&quot;  and urging that the  reforms under this Act shouldbe pressed forward  as rapidly as possible, the Interim Reportsuggests that the pay of  the &quot;temporary administrative medicalstaff of the Department, numbering 324, which averages   972* See Appendix.
per annum  requires reconsideration in view of the falJ in thecost  of  living  and  the  reduction  recently  effected in   the emoluments  of  panel  doctors  under  the  Health InsuranceScheme.&quot;    We report     (1.) That the  Minister of Pensions is actively pressing the          reforms under the Act of 1921.    (2.) That the  Minister  of  Pensions  should  examine  the          temporary administrative medical staff list to ascertain          whether, in the case  of  doctors whose  contracts are          expiring,  arrangements can  be- made for  necessary          re-engagements  at lower rates of pay without loss of          efficiency.                       On behalf of the Committee,                   (Signed)    AUSTEN  CHAMBERLAIN.    (Signed)    R. B. HOWORTH, Secretary.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1.     January 29, 1922.
           RESERVED RIGHTS  AND ARTICLE 6 OF THE ROYAL WARRANT.             (Note by the Legal Adviser to the Ministry of Pensions.)    MODIFICATION  of Article  6 of  the Royal Warrant  in  derogation  ofaccrued rights as to treatment allowance will require legislation.    The reserved right of a soldier to his pension, although usually based on theground that the Crown  cannot commit a breach of faith to the soldier,  has really a statutory foundation.    By section 10 of 7 Geo. 4, C.  16,  an  Act to consolidateand amend the Acts relating to Chelsea Hospital (and the powers and duties of theCommissioners of Chelsea  Hospital  with respect  to  the grant and administrationof disability pensions and grants in respect of the Great War have been transferredto the Ministry  of Pensions), it is  provided that  &quot; Every  soldier who shall from and after the passing of this Act .... have been  discharged by reason of being.....disabled  .... shall thereupon be entitled .... to  receive such pension,allowance or relief as shall have been fixed  in any orders  or regulations made byHis Majesty in relation to  such cases .... and in force at  the  time  of hisenlistment, and for the pajmient whereof money shall have been voted by Parliament,and every  such soldier shall receive the same under the provisions of this  Act orany rules or regulations  made  in pursuance  thereof by the .... commissioners of  ....  Chelsea.&quot;   Orders and Regulations made  by  His  Majesty  &quot; in suchcases &quot; include Warrants so that a soldier, enlisted after the 3rd September, 1919,.and discharged for service disability during  the Great War, would be entitled by statute to  the  &quot;pension, allowance  or  relief&quot;  contained in the  1919  Warrant.That  would apply to comparatively few soldiers, but it  would  be an  impossible position to leave  to men, who had served, only  during the  aftermath  of the War,the higher treatment rates, and to deny them to men who  had borne the brunt ofthe War.    But the preamble to the  1919-  Warrant, following precedent, substitutes theprovisions  of that Warrant &quot; in place of &quot; the provisions of previous warrants, anddeclares that &quot; this  Our Warrant  shall .... be established and obej^ed  as the sole authority in the matters herein treated of,&quot; so that it may fairly be argued thata soldier has the  same right to the benefits of this Warrant as to the Warrant inforce  at the time of  his  enlistment.    But, apart from the statute referred to, it would  be a breach of  faith on thepart of the Crown to take away rights already accrued.  Under Article 1202* of the pay Warrant of 1914 (expressly kept alive by the 1919 Warrant) the soldier has aright to select the pension most beneficial to  him, and in the vast majority of caseshe  has selected and is under the 1919 Warrant, and in such cases his right to thebenefits of Article 6 have already accrued; by Article 4 of that Warrant  he  may be compelled by the Minister to undergo treatment, and to reduce the treatment allow-ances,  the right to which  has already accrued,  would be a breach of faith on the partof  the Crown.  To quote the  words of the Treasury Solicitor in a previous case,&quot; there is the wider question : Whether (any) alteration effected by (a) new Warrantamounts to a breach of faith on the part of the Crown, which the Government havebeen, advised many times  cannot be properly committed against soldiers or officersby  the alteration to their detriment  of the terms of service existing at the  date oftheir enlistment or receiving commissions.&quot;  I think, therefore, that Article 6 cannotbe altered  except by legislation.                                (Signed)      W. BRANDFORD GRIFFITH.    January 14, 1922.* Selection for most beneficial pension.   1202. A soldier who has been or shall hereafter be awarded a pension may be awarded the pension fixed by the regulations in force at the date of his discharge, or by subsequent  regulations made  applicable to soldiers discharged on or before such date, if such pension will  be more beneficial to him than the pensionfixed by the regulations in force at the date of his enlistment.
