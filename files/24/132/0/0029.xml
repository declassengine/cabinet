Great Britain&apos;a traditional friendship with Italy, strengthened by  comradeship  in the  Great War and by close co-operation in the re*-eetabli,establishment of peace, makes it unnecessary for the Britich Government to explain  that the Treaty about to be concluded between Great Britain and prance is not designed in any way to exclude Italy frcm the  counsels of the Great Allies or to weaken the close understanding vhich  subsists between them.   That Treaty has been proposed for  Dpecial reasons, which they have no doubt that Italy fully appreciates.      Great Britain&apos;s special  interest in the security of France&apos;s eastern frontiers against  German attack has been revealed to all peoples in  the fierce  light of war.   Germany&apos;0 invading armies in 1914  swept close to the  channel ports and were finally- held along a line in France and Slanders nearer than any part of the continent to the English coast.   The sound of the German guns was heard  in England  daily for four years.   England knows  - that, were Germany in  some future  struggle to succeed in planting her artillery upon the coast  of prance, London itself would be within range of her shells.   Hot  only Britain, but all the Dominions of the British Eapira, gave unreservedly of their Manhood and their wealth to  overwhelm the common  enemy side by
side with the French armies.   The fields&apos; of&apos;  France nowoarer many hundxeds of thoumndo of British  dead.   Thewhole of the British Imp ire is represented- amongst thosegrav83.   Britain, therefore,  has an interest  not less thanthat of France in ensuring that the sacrifices of the French .and British peoples- shall not have been made in vain.     France, however, has good, reason-for anxiety lest thestruggle-should he renewed.    Her --capital has been occupiedby Germany within living memory.   It was saved by aslender margin of miles only four years ago.   Soms ofher richest provinces are still scarred by the devastationsif the enemy.   No country has suffered equally in the last half century without fault or provocation of her own.     It was (i.u these goounds that Great Britain signedtogether with the reprssentatlves. of the United states on June 28th, 1919, a Treaty agreeing to come  immsdiate-ly to the assistance of France in the event  of any unpro-vo&amp;ed movement of aggression being made against her byGermany.   The Treaty of 1919 was ratified by  the british parliament in the same year, but in virtue of  its  secondArticle, which provided that it should come  into foroe only when the Treaty of even data signed by ths representatives cfthe United states was ratified, it&quot; has hitherto been a deadletter.   Great Britain nevertheless has always felt thatit was a point of honour on her part to stand  by ths Treaty.The understanding 7/hich it contained influenced French policyin certain important respects during the negotiation *f  theTreaty of Versailles;  and Great Britain therefore  considersherself bound in honour to renew her pledge.
natural baJr^riere-p-^                             her from herlate enemies.   She therefore has no need to share the commonanxiety which inspires the pact of irisiu^ajaco-q^between-jGreat&apos;- Britain--and Prance...aigaixisi--ampro-vK^^ and-sudden war.     On the other hand, Great Britain offers to Italy, as to france , her intimate and earnest -oo-op-eration in building up agreat system of Europ-e an. accord for the maintenance of peace.Great Britain&apos;s pledge to stand by France against an unprovokedattack by Germany upon French soil is the first measure necessaryto ensure the stability of Europe and to divert the German people from dreams of revenge.   But in the mind of the British Govern-ment, that measure is only a stepping-stone to a much wider pact,which they hope to see concluded in the Economic Conference whichis to meet in Italy under the auspices of the Italian Governmentnext I/larch.   Clause VI of the British Resolution accepted by theAllied Powers In Conference last week lays dowr: as the basis ofthis pact &quot;that all nations should join in an undertaking to refrain from aggression against their neighbours.&quot;   It is hopedthat Germany and Russia will give and receive this simple guaranteeand that the new conformation of Eastern, Central, and South-Eastera Europe -under the Treaties of Versailles, St. Germain^andTrianon may thereby be ensured against the paralysing effects of international suspicion and non-cooperation.   It is alsohoped that the prosperity of all European States may be revivedby the re-entry of Russia, with its great productive and con-sum ing powers, into the normal and beneficent processes of inter-national commerce and exchange.   Such a pact would lead bynatural agreement to the reduction of European armaments and tothat general sense of security amongst nations which Europe so                           -                      profoundly
      prof omdly needs .   If &quot;liies^greaii&apos;^      at the coming Conference,, the Allied  Powers  will  be  entitled      to feel that they have used  the power bequea-thed  to  them      by victory to raise...all-.3urop-e to .a^saner and happier plane,IHHHS.
