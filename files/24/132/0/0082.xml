BY IHFYMIN^IST^ pg HEALTH,        I have to i eport that I have conferred vdth the   Chancellor of the Exchequer on the present position of the   schemes initiated by tho Government -under which financial   assistance is given to Local Authorities in respect of works&amp;s   put in hand by thorn to provide additional employment,,        Two forms of financial assistance have been given -   (a) assistance towards the annual charges incurred in respect   of works undertaken out of capital; (b) assistance by the   .payment of 50$ of tho wages bill, for works undertaken out   of revenue..        We agreed that the latter form of assistance,  (b),   should not be extended.        As regards  (a), it was originally arranged that the   Unemployment Grants Committee should be empowered to approve   for grant schemes up to a  capital value of  10,000,,000*   This figure was  subsequently  increased1 to  13,000,000, and   schemes practically up to  this limit have already been approved   by the Unemployment Grants Committee.        We agreed -              (l] that  the Unemployment Grants Committee should      be authorised to approve sohemes up to a further capital      value of  5,000.000  (making  18,000,000 in all);              (%) that the neoessary proportion of this       5S000^000 should be allocated to schemes about  to be put      forward by tho Electricity Commissioners, whiah are      understood to be estimated to cost between one and two      millions.
        (3) that deoided preference should be given by the  Unemployment Grants Committee to revenue proofing schomes,  wjrioh are  far loss costly to the taxpayer relatively to the  amount  of  employment given *        (4) that the Unemployment Grants Committee should  arrange that the approval of schemes up to the extended limit  should  be  spread over as long  . period as is reasonably  practicable;  and        (5) that a  number of the sohemes in respect of whioh  grant has  been approved should be inspected in $r&amp;er  to  ascertain  how the work is proceeding ana to make sure that  they are being carried out in a satiefaotory way and are  really  helping to deal with the Unemployment problem on the  lines laid down  by the Government.       I have taken stepB for the adoption of measures to carryout  the agreement which has now been made, .                   (Sgd.)    A. MOND. .is try of Health.j30th January, 1922.
