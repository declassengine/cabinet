L.G.66.                   llenorandum hj^the: jllniater of He a ltjbi i         I append a note for the information of the  Cabinet describing   the recent proceedings of the Poplar Board of Guardians,  and  the   action which I have taken and propose to take in the matter.         As the reault of  negotiations with representatives of  both   the rioter and the poorer local authorities of London last  autumn   I was able to secure an  agreement whereby the cost of outdoor relief   in the London Poor Law Unions would be equalised through the  medium   of the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, and statutory effect  was given   to this agreement by the Local Authorities (Financial Provisions) Act   which was passed in November last.   Under this arrangement the   expenditure on outdoor relief has been made,  for a temporary  period,   a common charge on London as a whole, and a great  part of the burden   of this expenditure has  been transferred from the  poorer  to the   richer Unions,   It was  estimated at the timo of the passing  of the   Act that the Poplar rates, for example, would be relieved in  the                                     s ..d&apos;,   current half year to the extent of 2/7.3 and  that  on tho  other hand   the City vcould be burdened with an increased  rate  of 6.6d. and   &quot;nVestminster with an increased rate of 6. 2d.         It was of course  necessary, and Ind ed It waa  part of  the   agreement, that the charge on the Common Poor Fund should be  limited   to expenditure incurred  in accordance with a  scale and under  conditions   to bo prescribed by mo,   The Regulations prescribing such  scale  and   conditions were issued at the beginning  of this year.   The scale   which I prescribod was based upon a  comparison of  the existing  practice.!   of the various Boards  of Guardians in. London  and represents a fair   average of their scales  of relief.    I am Satisfied that  thia scale  Is
Sufficient in all ordinary cases for ^the relief of destitution.   fasbuardiana retain their discretion to givo relief  in excess of thepcale, but if they do so the excess cost must be borne by the local/Irates *       With the exception of Poplar no Board of Guardians has/protested against the scale a3 a measure of the common charge for[outdoor relief.   My correspondonco with the Poplar Guardians is^annexed.   It will be seen that after receiving a deputation from the[unemployed who demanded an increase on their local relief scale, already tho highest in the country, the Guardians, not content withI accepting this demand, decided to grant an oven more extravagant scale.II replied at once pointing out that relief on this scale would be unlawful.       The Guardians1 powers are limited to the relief of destitution. The Poplar Guardians deliberately resolved to exceed their legal powers in pursuance of the Labour policy of &quot;work or full maintenance&quot;.       The position therefore Is, first, that the Poplar Guardians will be unable to charge on the Common Poor Pund any expenditure in exceos of the prescribed ocale, and secondly, that in so far as the relief given by them exceeds their legal powers the expenditure will not be a lawful charge even on their local rates.   If the Poplar Guardians persisted in granting relief on their proposed scale, the expenditure would bo subject to disallowance by the District  Auditor and the Guardians authorising tho expenditure would be personally liable to be surcharged.   In follow, however, of the sums involved and the financial status of the Guardians in question this remedy would not be very  effective.       It would further be open to any ratepayer  to apply to the Courts for an injunction to restrain the Guardians, but  in the not improbable event of the Guardians disobeying the order of the Court, we should
merely have a repetition of the imprisonment  of Mr.  Lansbury andhis colleagues last year.       The most effective weapon,  as the  Guardians  themselves arenow realising, is that of finance.   The  Guardians  can only carryon by means of borrowed money,  and they cannot  borrow money fromtheir Bankers or otherwise without my sanction.       After the passing of the recent Act I  authorised theGuardians to raise by overdraft a  sum of   146,000,  representingthe amount which will ultimately be recoverable by  them from theMetropolitan Common Poor Fund.   The adoption of their new scalewill add at least  4,000 a week to their  expenditure.   Even apartfrom the new scale the funds at their disposal  will he exhausted bythe middle of March, and they cannot expect to  receive further ratemoney till hay next.   In these circumstances the Guardians havepostponed for the present the operation of their new scale and are understand about to apply to  me  for sanction  to a further loan.       I should clearly not be  justified  in sanctioning a furtherloan except on condition that the  Guardians adhere  to a reasonablescale of outdoor relief, ?nd take  the necessary steps to reduce their expenditure In other directions.   The  Poplar Guardians have always been notorious for their extravagant administration, andthe cost of their workhouse and other institutions  is far above theaverage for London.   As a preliminary step therefore I propose atonce to institute an enquiry into  their expenditure on both indoorand outdoor relief, and I hope to  be able to  obtain the services  ofan independent poor law administrator for this  purpose.       We are bound, however, to recognise the  possibility of theGuardians refusing to accept the conditions which I should think  itnecessary to attach to my sanction and of a consequent deadlock in administration.   (Such a situation has actually arisen in the case  of
    the Bedwellty Board of Guardians who have refused to accept    conditions upon which a loan has been offered to thorn on the    recommend at ion of the Goschen Committee)*   To moot this    situation it seems to me necessary to obtain statutory authority    enabling rue to suspend a Board of Guardians and appoint an    administrator vested with the full powers of the Guardians    including the power of charging his expenditure and ohe cost    of administration on the local rates,   A copy of the enactments    conferring such a power upon the Local Government Board in    Ireland is attached,                                          A.

Right Honourable Sir,             The Guardians have requested me to inform you that at .    their Meeting held last evening the unemployed attended and    asked that a deputation should be reoeived by the General Pur-    poses Committee who were then sitting.   The Committee went    into the Waiting Hall and heard the spokesmen of the unemployed    and on the resumption the following resolution was passed by the    General Purposes Committee:-   &apos;*         RESOLY&amp;D TEAT we Inform the Board that a huge demonstration         waited on the Committee this evening and asked the Guardians         to Increase the scale of relief to able-bodied men and         voioed their determination not to submit to the soale pro-         posed for London by the Minister of Health;  that the Ohair-         man of the Board be asked to write a letter to Sir Alfred  -         Mond informing him that it  is impossible for this Board         to administer the aoale as laid down by him as the present         soale of relief administered by this Board is totally in-         adequate;  that as the unemployed are again owning next         Wednesday the Chairman shall request Sir Alfred Mond to         attend here at 5*30 p*m.  and failing his ability to be         present that he send one of his principal offioers to         attend and explain to the unemployed and the Guardians         the reasons which lead him to lay down so. entirely inade-         qttate a soale of assistance:  That the Board protest against         the fixing of the sum of lOd. per ct.y as.the oharge on the         Metropolitan Common Poor fund to the end of January and         state that the intention of Parliament is being vitiated         by the Order of the Minister of Health fixing the sum at         IQd. per day.             The Guardians in forwarding the above resolution ask me   to say that they wish to make an emphatio protest against the    soale as usurping the legal powers and duties of the Guardians   by taking away their discretion in dealing with cases of relief.             I am to point out that  the Guardians forwarded to you   on the 2nd Dooember last,  a letter in which they suggested a   scale which would in their opinion have met the needs of applicants   for relief.   The soale under the Order is totally inadequate,   partioularly as regards the limit in income in Olause i. (ii).    To   pretend that the larger families of 10,  11 or 12 perscffia have ade-   quate means of support if one of the elder sons living in the   household is earning  3. Is. Od.  or that this oan in any oa e be   available as the income of the household, is in my opinion and  that   of the Board,  ridiculous.  :  The MinisterJs scale is also inadequate   and unfair in that it does not provide for payment of the actual   amount of rent.   The amount paid for rent obviously varies con-   aiderably in different partseven of the same,distriot  and is not^ Right Honourable Sir Alfred Mond,  M.P.,.                         under         Minister of Health,               Whitehall, 3.W.I. &apos;
under the control of the unfortunate applicant and underthese conditions a high rent oauses suffering to the personpaying it when the scale of relief is inadequate and fixed.          I alao want particularly to draw attention toOlause 2 (b) and to express the emphatic opinion of thePoplar Board of,Guardians that the only deductions to bemade from earnings should be those laid dowh under ourordinary scale of relief.          With reference to the last provision In Olause 1fixing the Olaim at lOd. per day for a period to the end ofJanuary, In tho opinion of this Board, this prevision clearlydefeats the intention of Parliament.to give relief to PoorerBoroughs^   Under the provision  32,700 out of the  114,700spent by tho Guardians in Out Relief during tha Christmasquarter will remain a charge on local rates.          The representatives of the Unemployed put for-ward to the Guardians last evening a demand for the followingseale;-          Man and Wife  ..*   ...    ***    ...    1*  7*  6.          1st Ohild         .....                   6s  6o          2nd and &quot;additional ohildrer!     ...       6*  0.

Sir,          In reply to your lottor of the 19th instant I am directed by the Minister of Health to say that he is unable to attend the meeting at the Guardians1 offices this afternoon and that he does not consider that any useful purpose would be served by the attendance of a representative of the Ministry at this meeting.          Tho Minister cannot accept the statement mado by the Poplar Board of Guardians that it is impossible for them to administer the soale of relief presoribed by the Regulations. As regards the adoquaoy of the soalo it  seems to him sufficient to point out that it is higher than the  soale which is actually being administered by a number of Metropolitan Boards of Guardians, and that it would be obviously unfair to the ratepayers of London as a whole to adopt one of the highest of the existing scales of relief as the basis for the charge upon a Common Fund,,   It would be even more unfair, and entirely contrary to public policy, to adopt a soale, such as that suggested in your letter,  whichwould have the of feet of placing many recipients of relief in a better position than many independent workmen who aro supporting themselves by their own wages *          With regard to the temporary flat  rate ohargo of lOd.a day, as this represents a sum which is fractionally above theaverage of the ascertained cost of relief in the severalMetropolitan Unions,  it is obviously the fairest figure whioh oould have been fixed.          The Minister is quite at a loss to understand on what grounds it is suggested that the Regulations deprive  the  Guardiansof their discretion in dealing with cases of reliefs    Thatthis is not so was explicitly pointed out In the Oiroular Letterwhioh was issued with the Regulations.          The Minister is satisfied that the prescribed soale should afford ample scope in all ordinary cases for tha relief ofdestitution.   If the Guardians in any case  eleot to  give relief in exoess of the scale tho excess must neoessorily be a charge upon the funds of their own Union.                              I am, Sir,                                  Your obedient Servant,                                     (SGD)  H-W.3.

POPLAR BOARD OF GUARDIANSUpper North Street,     Poplar, E.14.       30th January, 1922.Right Honourable Sir;          I am desired by the Guardians of this Parish -to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the  25th instant,No,XII. 282a/621, and to express the regret of the Board thatyou did not consider that any useful purpose would be served bythe attendance of a representative of the Ministry at their meeting.          The Board wish me to inform you that a large numberof unemployed men, together with a big demonstration of  women;attended their Meeting.   After hearing delegates of the men andwomen, the Board discussed the matter and finally resolved toadopt the following scales of relief in this Parish:-     Able -Bodiod,                             *   s.   d..

Old Aget Pensions . ..      That the scale of relief for Old Age Pensioners be       10s, Od. weekly in  addition to the pension.,    Widows and, Deserted Women.       30s.

The scales are to be operative as from the 6th proximo.          On the adoption of the above scales, the  followingresolution was moved and carried unanimously:-          That the Minister of Health be  Informed that     this Bc*snd  is of opinion that his action  in throwing     the burden  of adequately relieving people in need upon     the shoulders of the  poor of Poplar-  is downright     contemptible, and is  In defiance and contempt  of theHon0  Sir A,  Mond,  P.C.j  M.P.,     Minister of Health,           Whitehall, S.w.1.-expressed/
     expressed will of Parliament, and that he he informed     that the Board has adopted the foregoing scales.          In my opinion and that of the Board, the Guardianshave never administered adequate Outdoor Relief in the past and the provisions of such a scale as that appearing in theMinister&apos;s Regulations will only encourage other Boards tocontinue to give inadequate relief to the poor in their districts.          It is not in the power of the Guardians to alter the fact that independent workmen are receiving inadequatewages and the opinion of the Board is that this is no reasonfor giving less relief than will properly maintain the families receiving public assistance,.          The Minister!s Circular explicitly stated that less than the scale could be given and. did provide for theGuardians using their discretion to go above the scale, butthe Guardians submit that, by inference, this limited their discretion to the amount of the scale ,.,          After prolonged consideration the Board came to theconclusion that the scale was entirely Inadequate;.,   TheGuardians&apos; opinion is that the working people are entitled towork or maintenance,   The adoption of the scale quoted inthis letter is an endeavour to face the facts as tc the Humnecessary to keep a working man and his family fit while heis looking for work, and to properly maintain the other classes on Out Relief.                 I am., Right Honourable Sir,                      Your obedient Servant,                          (Sd.) C. E 0 SUMMER.                  Chairman, Poplar Board of Guardians.
cop-XII.282a/621.31st January, 1922,Sir,          I am directed by the Minister of Health to acknow^ledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th instant reporting the scale upon which the Guardians of the Parish of PoplarBorough propose to grant relief to able-bodied applicants.          The,Minister understands that this scale is inexcess even ot the revised scale submitted at the Guardians&apos;meeting by the deputations to which you refer.   It is inexcess of any scale in force either in the Metropolis or inthe Provinceso   And it appears to be admitted by theGuardians themselves that it is in excess of what is requiredfor the relief of destitution.          Inasmuch as the legal powers and duties of theGuardians are limited to the relief of destitution, thegrant of allowances in accordance with the scale proposedwill be unlawful,                        I am, Sir,                          Your obedient Servant,                              &apos;  (Sd) H.
