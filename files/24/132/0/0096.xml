[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,-]Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1922.SECRET.C.P.-3696.                                                                             cabinet.CABINET COMMITTEE ON PARTS II AND III  OF THE  INTERIM REPORT          OF  THE COMMITTEE  ON  NATIONAL  EXPENDITURE.Second  Report.                        THE PERCENTAGE GRANT SYSTEM.    1. THE  Interim Report  of the National Expenditure Committee recommends, inthe Introduction to Part II, the abolition of the percentage grant system.    2. The origin of this system  is to be found in the Minority Report of the RoyalCommission on  Local  Taxation  of 1901.  The  majority  of the  Royal  Commissionadvocated the retention and  extension of Mr. Coschen&apos;s system of  assigned revenues,but the  Minority Report of  Sir G. Murray  and  Sir E.  Hamilton, adopting therecommendations of the Chairman, Lord  Balfour of Burleigh, advocated a return tothe system of direct grants-distributed among Local Authorities  on a basis  of three factors:  &quot;expenditure,&quot; &quot;necessity&quot;  (determined  by population)  and  &quot;ability&quot;(determined by  the produce  of  a Id. rate).  This principle was  endorsed  by theTreasury  Departmental Committee of  1911/14,  which, while fully  recognising theobjections to  a system of grants  based on expenditure, definitely rejected  a systemof grants per unit of  service as  impracticable, and  recommended, in  the  case ofElementary Education, a system  on a basis combining units with expenditure.   Theformula of the Treasury Committee was  embodied in  the Finance Bill of 1914, andsubsequently, with some modification, in a scheme for a supplementary grant presented to the House of Commons in 1917.  In the  Education Act of 1918 provision wasmade  for  a  Deficiency  Grant, bringing the State&apos;s subvention up to a minimum of50 per cent, of the cost for both Elementary and Higher Education.    3. It will be seen that the present system was introdirced after carefid consideration,and had high authority behind it.  It has. on more than one occasion been  used incases  where Parliament has desired  to stimulate Local Authorities to  carry out  a service, which without  such  aid  they would not undertake.  it should be  furtherobserved that the introduction of  the new  system coincided with a great  depreciation of money values  which  largely affected its operation.    4. The Committee on National Expenditure criticise the percentage grant system on the ground that: it  stimulates extravagance, takes away from the  Local authority the incentive  to reduce expenditure, and weakens the power  of the  Government  and,the House of  Commons to control large  portions of  the National  Expenditure.   TheCommittee consider that the percentage grant should be abandoned in the interests of economy and  be  replaced by fixed  grants or by grants based on some definite unit, andpoint  out that even if it were necessary to maintain the  charge to  the  taxpayer at itspresent very high level, the change would  be very beneficial to the country by       (i.) Increasing the incentive  to Local Authorities to economise ;     (ii.) Restricting the growth of the demands on the  taxpayer;    (iii.) Enabling staff economies to be effected at Headquarters.       [7804]
     5.  The  system is undoubtedly open  to criticism  on these grounds, and  thesecriticisms  are  particularly applicable  at the present  time,  when  it  is  of  supreme importance that the Exchequer should  exert the most  effective control over national expenditure, that divided  responsibility should be reduced to a minimum, and that thelocal authorities should be encouraged to economise.     6.  The percentage grant  system is  applied to forms of social service which varygreatly in importance  and character.  The  substitution of grants based on units otherthan expenditure and not varying  with  expenditure  may, on detailed investigation, befound more practicable in some of these cases than iu others.     7.  Our detailed recommendations on the  proposals contained  in  Part  11 of the interim Report will, in many cases, have the effect of fixing a limit on the  expenditureon a particular service during the year 1922/23, and in such cases the result will be similar to the substitution of a fixed or  maximum  grant not varying with  expenditure for a percentage grant in that year.  In order to make this limitation  effective in thecase of statutory grants such as  Education Deficiency  Grants, Public  Health grants and  Mental  Deficiency  Grants, legislation will be necessary.   We do not consider thatit would be practicable to effect an  abrupt transition  forthwith from the percentage tosome other grant system.     8.  Moreover, having regard to falling expenditure on social  services  and thedifficulty of estimating the extent  of the further fall in such expenditure in  the nearfuture, it would, in  our opinion, be unwise, from  the point of view of the Exchequer, toattempt now to fix the  grants for the years subsequent to 1.922/23.     9.  We  have come to the conclusion that the  whole question  of  the percentagegrant  system,  and  the extent to  which it can be  superseded  by some  other  formof grant is one which calls  for  detailed  expert  examination,  and we  accordingly recommend          &quot; That a Committee  should be set up forthwith to  report on the manner in     which and the  extent to which some other grant  system can be substituted for the.     percentage  grant  system, and  as to the  cases,  if  any, in which the percentage     grant system should be retained, and the reasons for such retention.&quot;                                    On behalf of the Committee,                                      (Signed)       AUSTEN  CHAMBERLAIN.         (Signed)       R.  B. Ho WORTH, Secretary.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,      February 8,  1922.
