I Teal  some  difficulty  in advising the Cabinet on the sub-jeot  . of  Lor&apos;-&quot;:  ,&apos;\llenby!s rooont telegrams,-  for (1) ray advice as to the form of. treaty to be  offered- to; Adly Pacha and-the - reply to be sent to *he Sultan was not  taken in November last and (2) the Cabinet pre- f erred to. tak9 a Gcurse -which has been attended with the very con- sequences which I then unavaiiingly predicted.  Lord Allenby correctly Informed-the Cabinet on that occasion that he could command sufficient military and naval strength-to.prevent a -general rising and to get rid Of Zaghiul Pacha,  should the latter present him  with  an opportunity. But he was incorrect in assuring ua that he  could  find an Egyptian Minis-try willing to take - office under  the conditions laid down in our official letter to the  Sultan:   and the  forecasts which I  ventured to make as to the breakdown of  the administration, the refusal  of  the Egyptians to co-operate with  us,  and the- revival  of  a general  and in the long..run dangerous  form of discontent  have been amply realised.   Further, although my colleagues  assured me  that our decision  would receive.the unanimous support of all  the more  responsible organs of the British probable-- an assurance  which. I- took  leave to mistrust - I have not found  that.  with-the  exception  of  the  &quot;Morning Post&quot; (non tali  auxilio) any  important  journal  has consistently  backed our policy, while several of  the more  influential  organs; that ordinarily support tho Government such as  the &quot;Daily, Telegraph&quot;., &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Observer&quot;/ &quot;Pall Mall - Gazette!&apos;,  &quot;Evening  Standard&quot; V--I&apos;.eot aside the  NorthOIiffe papers  --have openly  doubted-its wisdom.      There did Indeed occur a moment-in December when  Sarwat  Pacha appeared likely  to form a Government, on acceptable .conditions, and I  lest no time in encouraging those proposals,./
 But. they foil through owing to tho consolidation  of national- ist opinion in Egypt and to tho pressure exercised by  tho&quot;ZaghluLlst Party.   Since .thon wo have boon without an Egyptian Government; and the administration has only&quot;scraped along under martial,, law, and with tho aid of the British Undor-Sccrotarios ,in the various Departmentsc      Such a c onci it ion. cannot of course continue indefinitely.; for it is tho negation of Government; it will increasingly alienate all the more friendly elements in the Egyptian com- munity; it will provoko&quot;pcrlodical if not chronic disturbances and&apos; risings; and, as I also-pointed- out to tho&apos; Cabinet and  as&apos;&apos; ofd&apos; Allonby now -admits,. &quot;it &quot;&apos;will lead dither- to&apos; a. ccmplo to- ultimate capitulation an our&apos;&apos; part&apos;-&quot;or &apos;td the hoc ossify&apos;of-  &apos; annexation,  - &apos;       &quot;   --&apos;--&apos;  -&quot;&apos; &apos;-- &quot;   - &quot;   &apos;--&apos; v    &apos; -  -     .-&apos;:: &apos;:&apos;-:&quot;      These arc the circumstances in which lord Allonhy comes&apos;-&apos; f o&apos;r\canvassed with -a renewed, proposal;,, &quot;  There appears to be  a - temporary reaction among the better elements.aV:-:alns&apos;t the&quot;policy of &quot;uncompromising&quot; hostility to Groat&apos; Britain&apos;-&apos;whloh -- has manifested itself during&quot;the last Sir Weeks.;&apos;  lord  Allonby&apos; has all the&apos; fine &quot;boon.&apos; busily&apos;&quot; occupied&apos; With&apos; private&apos; ncgotia- tiens; and ho how&apos; tolls us, with the approval Of&quot; all-his&quot; advisero., &apos;.that the psychological moment has-arrived when we&quot;can-: e-lthor Obtain an Egyptian Mini a try &quot;cii the&apos;&quot;terms whloh ho suggests&quot;, or must abandon all hope&apos;&quot; of conciliation.,  The-delay of a fow days necessitated by my absence abroad&apos;and tho impossibility&apos; of consulting my &quot;colleagues&apos; may&apos; already  have- imperilled the chances of agreement&apos;,&apos; since the-nature -of  the compromise and. tho formation and oven thole deposition-; of  thb - &apos;&quot;&apos;- proposed Gcyoriinent gave boon fully revealed and; widely&apos; con A- - - vassed in tho Egyptian Press;&apos; arc  it&apos;is by no moans-&apos;Certain that, bofcro we have telegraphed &apos; our decision, Sarwat.  pacha--;:;- - may not have been terrified into withdrawals&quot; -  v       -      Lot mo accordingly examine the condition;! how  put- forward
They are     1) That1 -we should imp lenient&apos; the first cono.it ion  of  our proposed treaty&apos;by&apos; proposing to parliament the termination of  . ,the protectorate and the recognition&apos;of:Egypt as a  Sovereign State?.     2) That we should accept, also  as proposed in  our treaty,.the revival of  the Egyptian&apos;Ministry&apos; for -Foreign Affairs;&quot;     3) That-we should, favour the election of a native Parlia-ment - also a point&quot; which we have no reason  to- contest:-     4&apos;) That we should agree to the  ah oil t ion &amp;f martial law --as to which&apos;&apos;we have long ago declared our willingness to act&apos;atany&apos; time on the advice- of the High- Commissioner.     So&apos;far the concessions proposed are not In excess of anything that we have&apos; all&apos; &quot;been prepared to make.  Hitherto however thefirst two have been contemplated as  part of  a treaty  and havebeen contingent upon the acceptance  of the other- conditions laid.down in the draft Agreement approved by the  Cabinet.-  lord allenby now suggests a different procedure.  In the earlier partof his proposed letter to-&apos; the Sultan lie defends and apparentlyadheres in general terms to the two  main- guarantees which we havehitherto exacted as regards:&apos;-        (a), dispositicd of troops, arid-        (b) financial and judicial advisorsf-but he  suggests that as soon as the  conditions which I&apos; havesummarised above have been  carried out, we  should undertake in concert with- the Egyptian Government to&apos;- examine the conclusion.of an agreement on the following points        (a) Security of communications        (b) Defence of Egypt*        (c) Protection of foreign interests and minorities In           Sgypto        (. d-J Soudan vHow these four  heads may^ according  as they  are Interpreted, mean                            - Z -                   much/
much or little.  They may point to a revival of the Adly discus-si one under lean favourable: conditions,  because the Governmentwith which re should conduct them would already, if parliament had approved tho suggested programme, have acquired independence and might utilise its position to be obstinate  on any or all ofthe reserved points, even resigning if it did not get its way and making as much trouble for us, Inside and outside of Egypt,. agit could.     On the other hand if such a Government proved reasonable,we might obtain conditions approximating to those which some ofmy colleagues were prepared to Join me in conceding two months ago, &quot;&quot;With  that object in view, if we generally fall in with LordAllenby1s proposalst we  can still, I think, safeguard the position&quot;by saying that while prepared  to discuss these  subjects with an egyptian Government as soon as it has shown its capacity sucoess-fully  to undertake  the administration of the  country, and whileanxious to  advocate a  solution with regard  to all of them, our views  Lave  been sufficiently  clearly&apos; indicated  to leave theEgyptian Government in no doubt as  to the basis upon which thediscussions must proceede     Of course it may  be held  that-/even this  is dangerous.  Iconcede an  element  of  danger.  The  question is  whether  it is greater of  less than the danger cf  refusing Lord Allenby&apos;s advice and  exposing  cureelves with  our eyes  open to  the alternativewhich  he very clearly  depicts.  The  situation is not quite what it was when we had  broken  off  with  Adly Pacha.  We now  have theHigh&apos;Commissioner making definite proposals which  we shall assumeno  small responsibility  if we. reject.  We have  so  far failed  toget  any  sort  of- native ministry *  We  now have the. chance  (in  all probability the.last  one)  of  obtaining  one  on terms which if  theyare  onerous arc in  no  sense humiliating.  We  are warned of the grave-consequences  if  we refuse.  The Irish settlement,&quot;so farfrom helping  us,  will  greatly  have  encouraged the  Egyptians,  forthey see British  troops  being  withdrawn in  toto from. Ireland,  a                            -  4 -                position/
position vital to tho safety of Groat Britain,at the &quot;sometime that wo persist in retaining them in Egypt in-such place and in such strength as wo please;  and they see a form of independence conceded to Ireland,, much more also lute  than anything which wo are prepared to give to them.  I am convinced that wo cannot permanently maintain this position.     I would point  out in conclusion that the responsibilityfor tho carrying out of the suggested policy is one which weare not invited to  assume ourselves to-day  or to-morrow,  lord allenby only asks that we should  declare our willingness  torecommend it to the British Parliament.&apos;   In practice thismeans that we shall get an Egyptian ministry at once,  whilethe parliamentary decision will necessarily be postponed  forthe best part of a  month,   I  should not hesitate myself  totake tho verdict of either House  of Parliament on tho matter,since I believe there  is an almost universal  desire  to extricate ourselves from a position which,  already  difficult,may easily become intolerable.&apos;     I would further point out that Lord Allenby has  success-fully prevented the Egyptians  from attaching as a oonaition  totheir oo-operation  the return  of  Zaghlnl.   That would havebeen an impossible  condition;  and his continued absence  fromthe country is an essential element of success.         .               , (Initialled.) . . .
