[This Document  is the Property of His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1922.SECRET. CP. 3671.Memorandum by Secretary of State for India.    I circulate to  my  colleagues herewith  the  draft of a Bill which it is necessarythat I should introduce and get passed into law as early as possible in the approachingsession.  The circumstances which have necessitated the Bill are as follows :     Section 101 of the Government of India Act inter alia prescribes the qualificationsrequired of  persons appointed to be Judges  of High Courts in India, and  one  of the classes of persons declared by the section to be eligible is (sub-section 3  (d)) :-    &quot; A person having  been  a pleader of a High Court  for a period of  not less than     Section 105 of  the Act  gives  power to Local Governments to make temporaryappointments of Judges to the High Courts of their respective provinces to till leave and  other  short vacancies,  but  such appointments are subject to the provisions ofsection 101 with regard to the qualifications of the person appointed.     The Lahore  High  Court (Punjab) was constituted  by Letters Patent  in April1919 and took the place of the previously existing Chief Court of the Punjab, and theHigh Court, when it came into existence, enrolled as its pleaders the persons who had previously been enrolled as  pleaders of the Chief Court.     In April 1921 the Punjab Government, acting in exercise of the powders conferred by section 105 above referred  to, appointed  a pleader  of  the  High Court to acttemporarily as  a judge of the Court, and  the person  so  appointed actually held histemporary  appointment from 16th April to  28th July 1921.  After he vacated his appointment  the question was raised whether in view of the terms of section 101 (3) (d)quoted above, and of the face that Mr. Moti Sagar (the person so appointed) had beena pleader of a High Court for only two years, i.e., from the date on which the LahoreHigh Court was constituted, although he had been for many years previously a pleaderof the pre-existing Chief Court, the appointment was valid.   The matter was  referredto the Law Officers  of the  Crown who  answered  this question in the negative andadvised that  every  judicial act done or  assisted  in  by Mr. Moti  Sagar during the.period 16th  April  to 28th July  1921 when he sat as Judge of the High Court wasinvalid.  They further advised that  no valid appointment of  a  pleader of the LahoreHigh Court to a seat on the bench can he made  until the Court  has been at  least10 years in existence, and it follows from this opinion  that a similar position will ariseunless the law is changed, in the case of any High Court created to take the  place ofany  other form of supreme judicial tribunal in the future.     It is  essential, therefore, to validate Mr. Moti Sagar&apos;s appointment,  and thejtidicial actions in -which he took part, and it is  equally necessary  to remove the banwhich the present law places on  the appointment of  pleaders of  newly created  HighCourts wdrether in the Punjab or elsewhere in similar circumstances in  future.     The short Bill annexed has this  two-fold object, and I think it can  safely beregarded as entirety uncontroversial; in fact, in order to preserve  this character forthe  Bill I have  avoided  any attempt  to  include  within its scope various  other amendments  of section 101 which are in contemplation.10 years.E.

Indian High Courts Bill.                 MEMORANDUM.    Under  the  Government of India  Act,  one of the qualifications for appointment as a judge of a high courtis enrolment for ten years as a pleader of a high court;hut it is not  clear that, where a chief  court is converted into a high court, previous enrolment as a pleader in thechief court  counts towards the ten years.  The present bill makes  this clear both as to the  past and  as to thefuture, and thereby removes doubts which have  arisen inconnection with a recent  appointment to  a temporaryjudgeship of the high court of the Punjab.23-2
