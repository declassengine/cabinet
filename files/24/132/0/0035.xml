Mr. Cecil Harmsworth, acting British Representative on the Council of the League of Nations, presents his compliments to the Secretary to the Cabinet, and forwards herewith a copy of the Report presented by him to the Council at its meeting on the morning of the 14th inst: relative to the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the Council should appoint the Chairman of the Commission which is to be appointed, in accordance with Article 14 of the draft mandate, to study and regulate all questions and claims relating to the different religious communities in Palestine.

2. Mr. Harmsworth had ascortained before the meeting that the Italian Representative on the Council had categorical instructions from his government not to consent to any proposal affecting the future status of Palestine pending

the conclusion of a definite treaty of peace between the Principal Allied Powers and Turkey.

3. The Marquis Imperiali undertook to telegraph to his government in Rome requesting a modification of his instructions, so as to enable him to accept the resolution put forward in the annexed report, but such a request, if actually made, met with no response.

4. Mr. Harmsworth sent a telegram to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on January 13th, suggesting that in all probability a word to the Marquis Torretta, who was then attending the meeting of the Supreme Council at Cannes, might have some good result, but this telegram cannot have reached Lord Curzon in time to be of service.

5. The attitude of the French Representative on the Council was typical. It was intimated privately to Mr. Harmsworth that the French Delegate sympathised warmly with the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government for the setting up of this Commission in Palestine, but that he had categorical instructions to suggest a postponement of the matter; he said he would willingly telegraph to Paris for fresh instructions, but feared it would be useless in view of the fall of the French Government and the temporary lack of a Minister for Foreign Affairs to issue instructions on such a matter.

6. In these circumstances Mr. Harmsworth foresaw that there was no chance of unanimity being obtained, but he thought it better to let the matter come before the Council and be recorded in the minutes with his observations, to the effect that as he was aware that certain Members of the Council were not prepared to discuss the question at the present session, consideration of the matter should be




postpone d until tho next nice ting  of tho Council,  whichwill, in the ordinary courso  of events, take  placo  towardstho ond of April.?.    This suggestion was.  ad opto a, by  the-  Counoil.8.    Tho en close a report  makes no mention,  it will honoticed, of the payment  of. the incidents. 1   expenses of.  theproposed commission.   Mr.  Harmswor th was  convinced fromenquiries which ho had.been ahlo  to make, whilst in - Geneva,.that there was no likelihood  whatever of  tho  Council being- .willing to accept as a charge on  tho  funds of tho League theexpenses connected with  a  commission  which the- mandatorypower is hound hy the terms of its mandate to set up.9.    It is possible that  the. Council might agree to provide,out of league, funds,-.the.-salary and travelling;expenses of  theChairman, appointed by it,  hut in  that case the Chairman, -wouldho more closely, dependent  upon the  League  than perhaps  wouldin all cir cams tan cos he  desired by  His Majesty*s Government..Mr. Harmswor.th,- after careful consideration,  decided therefore to omit all reference  to the question of,  expense, beingprovido-d by-- the Leaguo,  and he recommends, that the  matter be.ro-considered by Hie Majesty&quot;s Government before tho next session of the Counoil in  April.10.   Difficulty will also bo. encountered in persuading theCouncil, to appoint a British -s abject  as Chairman of a commissionall tho other members of which, including the Vice-Chairman,are to be nominated by His Majesty&apos;s  Government.  - The  best way of: proceeding, however, will  be  to put forward  to -the:Socrotary-General of the League the names ,of persons. whom
ILLs Majesty-3 s Government would  like  to  see appointed,, withthoir q_ua.lificati.Dns, which  should he  as preeminent aspossible, so as  to  foarostall oritlplsra and opposition.11. -  She (juoErk&apos;von  of oVtu^ning tho  provisional approval ofthe Oouncil for  the draft  mandate, for Palestine,&apos; which itwas thought at  one  time  could be dealt with at this sessionof the Council,  did not  oeme up for  consideration as no reply has yet been  recefivea  from the United States Ckrrernmentto the recent representations made to them fcy LordCur a on on the subject.-  4 .-Geneva,,  ,. .Jen^-j 15th, 1923
                   0.63,1982.                                              Geneva,                                                January 13th, 1922 i        APPOINTMENT pjg OEgXRHAM Off SPE 01AL 0010138108,                        la BA:GBsa?iiiB.           Report hy tha British Representative.     The Council have had before them tho letter from theBritish Representative on the Council, dated January 3r(3,1922,Inviting the Council to appoint tho Chairman of tho special commission which is to be set up In Palestine to study andregulate all questions and claims relating to the differentreligious communities in that oountry.     Tha delay &amp;a putting through the draft mandate forPalestine has unfortunately given rise locally to criticism of the intentions of His Majesty1 s Government in regard tothe eventual establishment ef the Commission, but no steps for its formation can well be taken until the Chairman him-self has been appointed, or at any rate, until the Councilof the league has definitely stated its willingness to appoint the person  who is to preside over the Commission.     Some evldenoe is required of tho firm intention of his majesty s Government not to let the question lapse, and itis for this reason alone that the Counoil is now invited toact in the manner suggested in Mr. Fisher&apos;s latter.     The President of the Council, it will bo recollected,has expressed in the name of the Council, the hope that theMandatories will continue to conduct the administration ofthe territory in the spirit of the draft mandate, and  HisMajesty7s Government rely with some confidence on the Council^willingness to facilitate their task in Palestine.
     ,1 have therefore the honour  to propose thg followingBosolution:-          The COUNCIL, having -taken note cf the letter     addressed to the Seore-tar y-Gonor al -on January  3rd     regarding the appointment  of the Chairman  of the Commission     in Palestine provided for  in Article 14  of the draft     mandate, and being desirous  of f aoilitating :ih any sray     possible the task of the mandatory  in Palestine., agrees     to appoint the Chairman of the afceve-mentioned Commission     and invitos the Members of the Council &quot;to consider names     and qualifications of persons suitable,  with a view to     making an appointment at its next  session.          The COUNCIL also invites the  British Government     to ccmmoiicato to it, confidentially if  necessary, the     exact composition of the Commission they have  :in mind,,     together - with the -names of Individuals who will he     invited &quot;to sit :r.p.on it.f
