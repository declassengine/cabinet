Coroners  (Emergency Provisions              Continuance).                 MEMORANDUM.    The  Coroners  (Emergency Provisions)  Act,  1917,reduced the minimum number of jurors to be summonedby a coroner from  12 to 7 and the maximum numberfrom &quot;23  to  12.   Section 7  of the Juries  Act,  1918,enables a coroner &apos;s inquest to be held  in certain classesof cases without a jury if the coroner is satisfied that,having regard to all the  circumstances of the  case, it isproper to do so.    Both these enactments  continue in force only untilsix  months after the termination  of the war,  i.e., untilthe  28th February next.   It is intended to introduce inthe  present session  a Bill  consolidating and amending the  law relating to coroners.  In the meantime,  it isdesirable, in the interests of  economy, that  the presenttemporary provisions should remain in force.24-2a
