Now that the holidays are over there is a feeling of optimism, but no signs atpresent of a general revival.  The improvement recorded in coal-mining is continued with the exception of Lancashire, where there has been a set-back.  The iron andsteel industry still shows no real signs of revival.  There has been some slightrevival in iron-ore mining.  Shipbuilding and marine engineering show no change.The improvement in the woollen industry continues, and the hosiery  section is stillbrisk.  There is a slight improvement in the cotton industry.  There  has been some improvement in  the  wholesale  clothing  industry.  General engineering remainsdepressed,  but an improvement has been recorded in the  motor and cycle section,small numbers being  re-engaged.  In the boot and shoe industry there has  been achange for the better, particularly in Stafford and Leicester.  The  revival in thetinplate industry is maintained.  There is an improvement in iron and  steel  wiremanufacture.                                      T.  J.  MACNAMARA,                                                   Ministry of Labour,,

I. SUMMARY OF ACTION TAKEN BY  THE GOVERNMENT.                    [From Autumn 1920 to Autumn 1921.]                      Cabinet Unemployment Committee.    The  prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, there was a special discussion at a meetingof the Cabinet, when  the Cabinet  Unemployment Committee was  appointed toconsider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment.    [This  Committee  has since been in constant session and has up to the 13thJanuary, 1922, held 41 meetings.    The problem of unemployment in one form or another has also been before theCabinet on 56 occasions between the  13th August, 1920, and the  13th January,1922.]                       (A.) Unemployment Insurance.    An Unemployment Insurance  Bill  of general scope was introduced  on the23rd December, 1919, reintroduced  on the 16th February, 1920, received  a third reading in the Commons on the 19th July, 1920, passed into law on the 9th August,1920,  and came into operation on the 8th November, 1920.    This Act  applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000persons as  compared with  4,000,000 previously.  The weekly rates of benefit, paid out of contributions  from employers,  employed and the State, were 15s. for men and12s. for women, after a &quot;waiting period &quot; of three days.  In general, the amount ofbenefit was limited to one week for every six contributions paid, but during the first year eight weeks&apos;  benefit could be drawn after four contributions had been paid.    An Amending Act of the 23rd December, 1920. granted eight weeks&apos; benefit, upto the 31st March..  1921, to persons who had paid no contributions but had beenemployed for a certain minimum period  in an insured trade in 1920.    A further Amending Act of the 3rd March, 1.921,  increased the rate of benefitto 20s. for men and 16s. for women.  It further provided that during  each of the periods March-October 1921 and November 1921-July 1922  16 weeks&apos; benefit couldbe drawn by persons who had been employed in an insured trade in 20 weeks sincethe end of 1919 and were normally  employed in  an insured trade genuinely seekingwhole-time employment and unable  to obtain  it.    A third Amending Act of the 1st July, 1921, reduced  the rate of benefit to 15s.for men and 1.2s. for women and increased the &quot; waiting period&quot; to six days.  this change was necessitated  by exhaustion  of funds owing  to  the great amount ofunemployment and was-coupled with a heavy increase in contributions and authorityto borrow money from the  Treasury  to the extent of  20,000,000, as compared with 10,000,000  previously.   At the same  time power was taken to allow 22 weeks&apos;benefit (instead of 16)  in each of the periods March-October  1921  and November1921-July 1922.    Between the 8th November, 1920, and the 6th January, 1922, the amount paidin  unemployment benefit was   59,809,000.   Of this amount the contribution ofemployers since the  8th November, 1920, was  12,202,000, that of employed persons 11,172,000 and that  of the State  5,988,000, in addition to  1,594,000 in respectof benefit for ex-regular sailors,  soldiers and airmen.   The balance was providedmainly out of the  accumulated reserve fund of over 20 millions and advances by theTreasury amounting to  8,000,000.    The  number of persons in receipt of benefit was on the 1st July, 1921, 2,062,012wholly unemployed and 988,364 on part-time, and on the 10th January,  1922,1,838,000* wholly unemployed and  304,000* on part-time.                 (B.) Emergency  Works and other Measures.    A sum of  10,400,000 was provided for expenditure  on arterial roads, half tobe  given  by way of actual grant and half by way of a loan to Local Authorities.This money is administered by the Ministry of Transport and is expended by LocalAuthorities under their supervision.  The men  to be employed are selected by theLocal Employment Committee of the Employment Exchange and preference is givento ex-Service men.    A further sum of  3,000,000 was allocated to the  Unemployment GrantsCommittee, presided over  by Lord  St. Davids, for the purpose of  assisting LocalAuthorities to carry out at once works on which a substantial number of unemployed                                  * Estimated.    &apos;   [7679]                                                    B 2
 could be engaged.  The conditions imposed with regard to the expenditure of this money were that works could only be approved in areas where there existed serious unemployment which was not otherwise provided for, that the men employed should be taken from the registers of the Employment Exchanges, preference being given to ex-Service men,  and that any grant paid should not exceed  60 per cent,  (originally 30 per cent.)  of the wages bill of additional men taken on for the work.  Further, the works had to be such as were approved by the appropriate Department of  the Government as suitable works of public utility. The condition as to recruitment of labour through  the Employment Exchanges  was  subsequently  modified so as to permit Local  Authorities to draw all or a portion  of  the  labour  from Boards of Guardians.  A condition has also been imposed by which Local Authorities carrying out schemes by means of direct labour may not, during a probationary period of  six months, pay to unskilled men wages higher than 75 per cent, (or, in the case of men employed only  half-time, 87-^ per   cent.)  of the authorities&apos; rate for  unskilled workmen.    In  addition to the items outlined  above,  assistance from the ministry^ of Transport  has enabled Local Authorities to maintain in  employment on  road maintenance  a number of men beyond those ordinarily employed  on this work. Additional employment has  also been  provided by expediting work on sites and sewers for housing schemes.  An emergency programme undertaken by the Office of Works,  and the introduction of alternative work and a system  of short-time working in Government Industrial Establishments hav-; further assisted towards relief of the situation.    In addition, Local Authorities have been  encouraged by the Government to put work in  hand without receiving definite Government assistance.    From the autumn of  1920 to  autumn,  1921, in this  way, a sum of at  least 25 millions was set  aside by the Government and the Local  Authorities for schemes of work which are still continuing.  At least 200,QOO men have had employment on these schemes at various times,  and at the  present time  over 122,000 men are employed (see table below).                         II. LATER  MEASURES.                         [Autumn, 1921, onwards.]    Before rising for the recess, the Cabinet  agreed that the position with regard to unemployment was so serious that the  Cabinet  Unemployment Committee mustdevote special attention to it, with special reference to the exhaustion of benefit underthe Unemployment  Insurance Acts.    On  the 19th  August,  1921, the Cabinet, on  the  recommendation  of  the Committee, agreed  that assistance could  be given to Local  Poor Law Authorities, either by way of expediting the sanction for   loans or permitting the loans to bespread over a  number of years, in cases in which  the Local Authority could prove that there were exceptional circumstances due to the abnormal unemployment andthat they were exercising their powers with due care and discretion.    The whole matter was again discussed at the Cabinet which met at Inverness onthe 7th September,  1921.    On  the 16th September, 1921, the Cabinet Committee further agreed that     &quot; (1.) Where, for the purpose of providing employment in the present emergency,Local Authorities (including statutory bodies who do not trade for profit) put inhand  or  accelerate  approved works  (other than revenue-producing works), whichwould not otherwise&apos; have been proceeded with, or so accelerated at the present time,the State will  give financial assistance on the following basis.    &quot; Grants  equal to  50 per cent,  (since increased to 65 per cent.) of the interestand sinking fund charges on loans raised by Local Authorities to meet  expenditure on schemes actively commenced before the 1st January, 1922, will be paid by the State for a period of one-half the term of the  loans subject to a maximum of fifteen years.  The expenditure to be taken into account will be all approved  expenditure incurred within the period ending the 31st March, 1923.    &quot; In approving schemes, special regard will be had to the direct employment ofunemployed persons and to a preference being given to ex-Service men.    &quot; (2.) In the case of revenue-producing works, grants will be paid, in approvedcases, equivalent to 50  per cent, of the interest on loans, raised for a period of not less than ten years,  in respect of expenditure  on schemes actively commenced before the 1st January, 1922. provided that such expenditure is incurred within the period ending the 31st  March. 1923.   These interest grants will be paid for  a period of five years.
     &quot; (3.)  Schemes shall not be authorised exceeding a total capital expenditure of10 millions without consultation between the Minister of Health and the Chancellorof the Exchequer (since increased to 13 millions).     &quot; (4.)  Schemes must.be approved by the Ministry of Health  or other appro-priate Government Department as schemes  which will provide employment  andmust be certified by the Ministry of Labour for districts where unemployment issevere.&quot;     Subsequently it was decided that  Local Authorities carrying  out schemes bymeans of direct labour may not, during a probationary period of six months, pay tounskilled men wages higher-than 75  per cent, (or, in the case of men employed onlyhalf-time, 87^ per cent.) of the authorities&apos;rates for unskilled workmen.                III.-FURTHER  REMEDIAL  MEASURES.     During the Autumn Session, 1921, the following measures were submitted toParliament and approved :      (1.) Amendments to Exports Credits Scheme. (a.)  Government guarantee tobe increased from 85 per cent, of the cost to 100 per cent, with recourse against theexporter for 57-^ per cent.     (b.) Maximum  guarantee  for each   firm to be  fixed by special  AdvisoryGommittee.     (c.) Extension of scheme to all countries, including the British Empire.     (d.) Extension of period of credit in certain cases to 1927.     (2.)  Government Guarantee of  Payment of Interest and Principal  of loans raised by Dominions, Colonies, foreign Governments, public authorities, &amp;c, where such loans  are to be applied towards the carrying out of any capital undertaking orin the purchase of articles to be manufactured in the United Kingdom required forthe purposes of any such undertaking, the  British Governments  liability  underthis scheme not to exceed  25,000,000.  It is to be a condition of the guarantee thatthe  application of the loan  is calculated to promote  employment in  the UnitedKingdom.     (3.) A Sum of  5-Jj Millions for  General Unemployment Relief. Subject to treasury approval, the money will be used in connection with schemes for providing employment on land improvement and drainage ( 650,000), forestry ( 250,000),light railways, and also by way of loans to Boards of Guardians or  Parish  councils in necessitous areas who are unable to meet claims for relief  (see Cabinet decision ofthe 19th August above).     (4.) &quot;  The  Unemployed  Workers&apos; Dependants&apos;  Fund,&quot;  to be established by legislation  for a period of six months for the purpose of making grants towards themaintenance of the wives and dependent children of unemployed workers in receiptof unemployment benefit.  The grants will be at  the weekly rate of 5s. for the wife and Is. for each child.  The necessary money.will be obtained by means of further contributions paid by those now contributing to the  Unemployment Fund (both employers and workmen) together with a grant from the State.  The total amount available will be approximately 6^ millions.     (5.) Overseas Settlement. A further  330,000 was voted  to assist ex-Servicemen desiring to emigrate to the Dominions.     (6.) Acceleration  of  Government Contracts. The position  with  regard toGovernment contracts is being examined to see whether, in  any cases,  a reasonableanticipation of requirements can be  made with advantage from the  point of view ofincreasing  employment.     (7.) Ministry of Transport. A further sum ( 2,000,000) will be available.fromthe Road Fund for expenditure on roads to  relieve unemployment in necessitousareas.     (8.) Unemployment Grants Committee. A further sum of  600,000 was placed at the disposal of this Committee for dealing with Schemes  on the original basis of60 per cent, of the Wages Bill.     (9.) Office of  Works. A sum  of   50.000 has been voted for unemploymentrelief works in the Royal Parks.     For the above schemes  (apart  from  the assistance  to Local Authorities withregard to Loan Charges, the Export Credits Scheme and the Governments liability under the  Guarantee of Loans for Capital Undertakings)  the Government  has undertaken to  find  12.000,000. the greater portion  Avithin  the current financialyear.
