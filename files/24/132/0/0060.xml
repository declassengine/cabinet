THE following extract  from  an Egyptian  newspaper  is  circulated to theCabinet at the request of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.                                        (Signed)       T. JONES,                                                           Acting Secretary.    2,  Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,         January 27, 1922.THE  ARABIC  PRESS.                 ENGLISH STATESMEN GIVE  WAY TO  THE STRONG.                                &quot;Al Akhbar.&quot;     English statesmen do not give what they like,  but what  circumstances andevents force them to give; this is not their policy only as regards the nations theyrule, but with all the other Powers.     In Anatolia, for instance, they did not recognise the Government of mustapha kemal, which great leader they considered a rebel, but they soon altered their policyand asked to negotiate with  the representatives of that  Government, who actuallywent to London to attend the Conference of the Near East.     This, was the case also with the Russian Soviet Government.   The Englishstatesmen at first fought it in order to destroy it, but when they found such a waruseless  and the position of Lenin more  secure, they entered into negotiations withhis representatives and concluded a commercial treaty with them.  They even didmore;  they  decided at  the Cannes Conference to invite the Russian Government  toattend the International Economic  Conference which will be held in Genoa, whenLenin will sit by the side of the British representatives at that conference.     If  we also examine the  relations of England with  France, her Ally, we find that they were not uniform,  but  changed according  to the position  of the FrenchGovernment.  When this Government  was weak the British statesmen managedinternational affairs, but when the French Government was strict, England did not hesitate to follow the policy of the  French Government.     This principle was evident at first in the question of reparations and afterwardsin that of the guarantees.   In this latter case, the English refused to  conclude atreaty  with France to  engage to oppose attacks on their Ally by the Germans, onthe plea that  the original idea was that the  United States,  England and france should all take part in that treaty, and as the American Senate refused  to approvethis treaty England was no longer bound by it.     But this refusal was converted into acceptance during the Cannes Conference,and it  was decided in principle to conclude an agreement between France and england on the basis of both  countries taking  part in repulsing German attacks onthe French the very same basis which the English had previously refused to accept.     In  a word, the future of nations and the settlement of political questions do&apos;not depend on the will  of the English, but lie in the hands of the nation interested.If the  will  of the nation is strong,  and if the nation is determined, the English      [7738]
statesmen will be obliged to satisfy it, but if they find tbe will of  the nation weakthey will have their own way.     Those,  therefore,  who  advise the Egyptians  to submit  only popularise  theEnglish imperialist policy.                      EGYPT AND IRELAND :  THE  LESSON.                                 &quot; Al Watari.&quot;     When the Irish Sinn Eein Parliament approved the proposed treaty betweenIreland and England the  treaty by  which  Ireland will be a Free State tied toEngland only by the oath of allegiance to the Crown some of our confreres hastenedto efface.the effect of this news  on the Egyptians by saying  that, if the Irish have approved this treaty, it  does not  necessarily  follow that we should do likewise oraccept less than complete independence.     We  have no doubt  that these confreres were  right, if they  meant  that  the egyptians should solve their question as the Irish have  solved theirs, for the two questions are not identical, as Egypt is not as close to England as Ireland, nor was it at any time part  of the British Empire.     But notwithstanding this fact, the attitude of the Irish people and of its leadersconstitutes a useful lesson that  the Egyptians would do  well to read.  We do  not mean to  say that this lesson should be followed literally, but that  we should  profitby the experience of others.     The Irish people for  750 years fought for their liberty and independence, andresorted to murder and other means as if they were at war with the English, sufferingat  the same time  heavy losses this brave nation,  which  was the  object  ofthe  admiration of the  whole  world.    But  as soon  as  they saw a  gleam  of light  betokening   liberty,  they  did  not  lose the  opportunity and   did  not hesitate to take it,  rather than  continue  to fight the  English and shed their ownblood.  Their act in accepting this treaty was wise, for they  did not consider  it  thefinal solution of the Irish question.     The Irish  also were trained  in  constitutional systems  by  their  unofficialParliament, and were  able to unite in a single  institution which represented themand spoke in their  name, so that  when the critical moment came  this Parliamentspoke for all the nations and became the kernel of their coming free  Government.   Ifit,had not been for this Parliament it would have been difficult to obtain the opinionof the whole country with regard  to the treaty.   Those who  followed the march ofevents in Ireland must have noticed that the Parliament did its duty well in thosecritical times, and gave its decision on the subject in a few days.     It is worthy of note that  Mr. Griffith,  one of the leaders  who approved  thetreaty, rose, when the treaty was passed, and said in a loud voice  that  this successwas not against Mr. de Valera, of  whom they were in need to work  with them.  Hethus was  not proud of his victory, which is an excellent lesson showing us howgreat the Irish are  and how well trained in statesmanship.     It is these lessons which we should take as  a light to guide us in our struggle.A wise man is he who learns by the experience of others to attain his end.                              TO-DAY&apos;s  PROTEST.                               &quot; Al Mokattam.&quot;    Ahmed Yehia Pasha and others have addressed the following  petition to the sultan :      &quot; The  undersigned notables  and merchants  of  Alexandria have  the honouragain to protest very strongly against the acts of the British military authorities,who have robbed personal liberty from Egypt, and once more to call the attention ofYour Highness to the various dangers resulting from these acts  to all the principalinterests of the country.    &quot; Does the English nation allow  its good reputation, obtained by the honourablestruggle  of. its right-thinking men, to be  tarnished by the disgrace of taking  partin the  tyranny, committed in its name, against a nation determined fully to  take all the legal means it can to defend its existence and liberty ?    &quot; Have the English not learned a lesson by that fall of the giant, on the morrow
of the great war which liberated the nations from his might %   Do they not rememberthe historical co-operation between nations, and bear in mind that the strong  willbe punished for  their crimes by the supreme justice of God, which is called the justice of events ?    &quot; Egypt,  which is offended by the injustice done  it, restrains its indignationin the face of the severe law  under which the British  authorities  treat it;   andalthough it suffers, it still hesitates to believe that Great Britain thinks of going back to savage times. What a strange return in  the  twentieth century, to try toenslave a nation  like ours, upon which England wishes to impose an authority towhich the nation will not submit and which it does not recognise!    &quot; Fully believing that Your Highness  shares our feelings, we beg you to  put an  end to  this painful,  sad situation, from  which England cannot expect  the friendship of the Egyptians,  as she believes, nor is it  in her interest to continue  thisenmity which she is labouring to secure.                                                       &quot;We are, Ac.&quot;
