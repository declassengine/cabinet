[This Document is the Property  of His  Britannic  Majestys Government!]Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1922.SECRET.C.P.-3685.CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OF  THE  STATE  OF  IRELAND.              MEMORANDUM BY THE CHIEF SECRETARY  FOR IRELAND.     I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 30th ultimo.                        GENERAL STATE OF  THE COUNTRY. Police Reports  of the Week.     The Police Reports of the week present no new feature.  The number of outrages reported is approximately  the same  as in recent weeks,  and I am afraid that no permanent improvement is  to be looked for until the authority of the Provisional Government is  more firmly established.   It is obvious  that  the dual role  which members of the new Government are compelled to fill as Ministers both of  the Irish Free State and of Dail Eireann is attended with grave practical disadvantages, particularly in the matter of maintaining law and order.  The imperative need of the country at the present moment is for an  active  and efficient police force, having behind it the moral support and confidence  of the civilian population.  While the efficiency of the Royal  Irish Constabulary leaves nothing to be desired, it  is  now a moribund force, and its use in the hands of the Free State Government is necessarily restricted by political  considerations.   Pending the creation of a new civil  police, the suppression of lawlessness is being left to a large extent to the I.R.A., but where the local units of this organisation are mainly composed of members of the extreme Republican  section, the Provisional  Government can only obtain  recognition and obedience for their decrees  by issuing them  in their  capacity as Ministers of Dail Eireann.   When regard is had  to the formidable  and  implacable nature  of the opposition to the Treaty, it is perhaps surprising that the discipline of the  I.R.A. has been so well maintained, but until a General Election enables a decisive popular verdict to be given in  favour of the acceptance  of  the Free State Constitution, the situation will continue to be fraught with a considerable element of danger.     The outrages reported  during the week included a number of attacks upon members of the Crown Forces, of which the most serious were the firing at a police escort of a Sub-Sheriff who was executing Civil Bill Decrees at Ballywilliam, Nenagh District,  Co. Tipperary, on  the 25th ultimo, one member of the escort being slightly wounded; the firing at a constable near Money lawn, Gorey District,  Co. Wexford. and at a police car at Killarnett, Manorhamilton District, Co.  Leitrim, both  on the 26th ultimo;  the firing at a police sentry at Ennis on the 27th ultimo; the ambush of a small military party at Correal, Co. Roscommon,  on the same date;  and a series of attacks upon soldiers in Dublin on the 28th ultimo,  in  which one  soldier was seriously wounded.- Immediate action was taken under  the local liaison  arrange- ments in each of these cases, and full satisfaction will be demanded.  In the case of the attacks on soldiers  in Dublin on the night of the 28th ultimo, a strong remon- strance has been sent to the Chief Sinn Fein  Liaison Officer, pointing out that these outrages  bore all the appearance of having been deliberately organised by  a section of the I.R.A., who are known to be actively working in the interests qf the Republican* opposition to the Provisional Government, and that serious trouble is likely to arise in the event of such attacks being repeated.   It may be mentioned, however, that the record  of the I.R.A. in Dublin in regard to the maintenance of  the Truce  has hitherto  been remarkably good.  Not  only have breaches been infrequent, but the       [7782]
I.R.A. have  shown themselves ready to co-operate  with the  Dublin MetropolitanPolice in the detection of criminals, and  have  handed over to them a number ofprisoners to be dealt with under the ordinary law.    Two  other serious outrages of the nature of breaches of the  Truce were thekidnapping of Mr. Watters, Crown Solicitor for Kilkenny, who was taken from his home  to an unknown destination by a party of armed men about 11 A.M. on the 22ndultimo, and the kidnapping of Mr. Carroll, Crown Solicitor for Cork, while on his way to attend Fermoy Petty Sessions on the 23rd ultimo.  Both these gentlemen have since  been released as a  result of representations made to  the Chief Sinn FeinLiaison Officer, who has given an  assurance that the offenders have been punished.Ten other cases of kidnapping were reported during the week, in two of which thepersons kidnapped are known to have been since released.    Highway robberies of motor cars and bicycles have again been  frequent, and Iunderstand that the Provisional Government are considering the necessity for takingdrastic action for the suppression  of these outrages.  Eight motor cars  and thirty-three  bicycles belonging to the military or the police, were included in the seizures ofthe past week.  Other  cases of highway robbery included four  raids on mail cars.                         STATE OF THE POLICE  FORCES.    The following figures show the present strength of the Irish Police Forces :                            Royal  Irish Constabulary.Regular Force.

The present strength of this Division    is 140.                          Dublin Metropolitan Police.    The strength of the Dublin Metropolitan Police remained unchanged through-out the week at 1,134.                              RAILWAY SITUATION.    A settlement  of the strike on the Dublin and South-Eastern Railway, mentionedin my last report, was reached on the  27th ultimo,  through the intervention of  theLabour Minister  of  the Provisional Government, and a  full  train service  was resumed on  the following  day.   On  the  29th ultimo,  however, further  sectionalstrikes broke out on  the Great Western and  Southern  Railway, resulting  in  theentire suspension of the services to Mallow, Queenstown, Bandon and Youghal, andon the same day the engine-cleaning  staff employed  at the Broadstone  Terminus(Dublin) of the Midland Great Western Railway also left work, and the whole goodsservice, including cattle trains, on the main line of this  railway has in consequence been suspended.  The cause of the trouble in every case is the dissatisfaction felt with the wage-reduction provisions of the Carrigan Award, which were recently brought intooperation under an agreement whereby the provisions relating to hours and condi-tions  of  service were  held in abeyance until the 14th  instant in order to  afford  theProvisional  Government an opportunity of making a full investigation of the whole position.  In breaking this agreement, the men are acting in defiance of  their ownrepresentatives, and a strong manifesto has been  issued by the  National Emergency Committee of the Irish Railway Workers condemning the strikes  as a  breach of faith  with the Provisional Government and calling for  an immediate  return to work.
An important step towards the settlement of the whole labour question on the IrishRailways was taken yesterday, when the Ministers of Labour for the ProvisionalGovernment and the Northern Government met in Dublin, and, after consultationwith the representatives of the men&apos;s Union, arranged for the opening up of negotia-tions with the Companies with a view to framing an agreement on a uniform basis for the whole of Ireland.                    CREATION OF IRISH FREE STATE ARMY.    The Provisional Government have lost no time in  turning their attention to thecreation of a Military Defence Force in accordance with Clause 8 of the Treaty.By arrangement with  the  British Military Authorities, the Military Barrack atBeggars Bush,  Dublin, until lately the Headquarters  of the Auxiliary Division ofthe Royal Irish Constabulary, has been  taken over, and a detachment of the newIrish Army formally entered into possession to-day after marching in full uniformthrough the streets of Dublin amid great public enthusiasm.                 .  PRESENT POLITICAL SITUATION IN IRELAND.    In the absence of Mr. de Valera and other prominent leaders of the Oppositionat the Irish Conference in Paris, the Provisional Government have been faced with little public criticism, and there have been no indications that their political positionis in any way weaker  than when  they assumed office.  In one  direction, at least,substantial progress has been made, viz., that of an understanding with Ulster, andit is to be hoped that a further advance may be made at the next  meeting of the twoPremiers, which has been arranged for  to-day.  It is generally agreed that a GeneralElection, if held now or in the near future, would result in the  return by a strongmajority of Mr. Griffiths Party.
