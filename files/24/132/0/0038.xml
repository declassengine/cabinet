[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government]Printed for  the Cabinet.   January .1922.SECRET.CP.-3638.                                                \iCABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY  OF  THE  STATE  OF  IRELAND.              MEMORANDUM BY THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND.    I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 16th instant.                      GENERAL STATE OF THE COUNTRY. Observance of Truce.    Although the political developments of the past week have been  eminentlysatisfactory, the observance  of  the Truce by  Sinn Fein in  many parts of thecountry presents a by no means creditable record.  The number of serious breacheshas been much in excess of that  of  recent weeks and would  appear to  indicate ageneral weakening of discipline among the siibordinate officers and rank and file ofthe I.R.A., as a result of  the  dissensions in Dail  Eireann on  the  subject of theTreaty.   While it would be easy to exaggerate the significance  of these incidents,they must be  accepted as evidence of  the presence of a considerable element of revolutionary  restlessness among the youth of the country which the ProvisionalGovernment will find great difficulty in controlling in the trying  and uncertainperiod which  must  elapse before  the  new Irish  Constitution  in its completestatutory form has  been  submitted to and definitely accepted by the people ofSouthern Ireland at a General Election.    The gravest breaches  of  the Truce reported during the week were a savageassault  upon  a Constable at Abbeydorney, Tralee District,  Co.  Kerry, on  the6th instant, the firing at a military officer at Martinstown, Co. Kildare, on  the8th instant, apparently an act of revenge on the part of a released internee ;  thefiring  at five military officers in mufti  at Fermoy, Co. Cork, on the 11th instant;the firing at and wounding of a  Constable at  Rathcroghan,  Co. Roscommon, andthe kidnapping of two Constables at Tulla, Co. Clare, on the 12th instant; and thefiring  at  and wounding of a military cyclist despatch  bearer near  Athenry,Co. Galway,  on the 14th instant.&apos; In the first mentioned case  the  Constable-was attacked by  a  party  of armed and masked men near the railway  station and was rendered  unconscious  by a  blow on  the head with a  bar of iron.   When  herecovered consciousness, he found  himself lying across the  line  as  a  train was approaching the  station, but  succeeded in crawling  on to  the  platform and inboarding the train  for Tralee, where  his  wounds were dressed.   Neither of theother  two cases of  wounding was of a serious nature.   The kidnapping of thetwo Constables at Tulla was apparently an act of retaliation for the arrest  of two members of  the I.R.A. for an offence against the licensing laws. Their immediaterelease has been demanded from the local Sinn  Fein liaison officer, but I have notyet been informed of the result of this action.    Other offences committed against the Crown Forces during the week included the seizure of twenty-eight military bicycles from a goods  train  at Ballyhooly,Co. Cork, on the .10th  instant;  the seizure of a  military motor  car  at  TraleeRailway  Station and of a number of bicycles and a. quantity of other military stores at Ennistymon Railway Station,  Co. Clare, on the same  date, the seizure ofa military officers charger from a soldier, in whose custody  it was travelling, atMulgrave, Killarney  District, Co. Kerry, on the 11th instant, and the thefts ofmilitary motor cars at Donoghmore, Queen&apos;s Co., Templemore, Co.  Tipperary, and-Brittas Inn, Dundrum, Co. Dublin, on the  13th instant.      [7692]                                    -   ;-  &apos;
     The latest reported outrage is a raid committed last night (16th instant) by a party of about fifty armed men upon the police barrack at Charlestown, Swinford District, Co. Mayo, full particulars of which have  not yet come to hand.  All the arms and ammunition belonging  to the barrack are stated to have been seized by the raiders, and a Sergeant and two Constables are missing.     Six cases of illegal arrest, in addition to the kidnapping of the  two Constables, were reported during the week.  The motive in three of these cases was  to prevent the person arrested from attending at Petty Sessions.  In  one of  the other cases the victim was the wife of a Head Constable of the Royal Irish Constabulary, and her arrest was an  act  of  reprisal for the arrest and imprisonment of  another woman  for non-payment of  a fine imposed  for  an offence  under the  Dogs Act. Two of  the  persons arrested, one of them being  the Head Constable&apos;s wife, are reported to have been since released. Trials of Civilians by Court Martial.     The only Court Martial sentences promulgated during the week were on two members of the Royal  Irish Constabulary.  In one case sentence of  a  months imprisonment   with hard labour  was imposed for theft,  the accused  being  a Constable of the  Regular Constabulary, and in the other case sentence of six months&apos; imprisonment without hard labour for the falsifica,tion of R.I.C. accounts, the accused being a Temporary Cadet of the Auxiliary Division. Release of Political Prisoners.     In  accordance with the general amnesty granted by His Majesty the  King, all  prisoners convicted  of offences committed in  Ireland  from political motives prior  to the  operation  of  the Truce, on  the 11th July  last, have  now  been unconditionally released.  The reception  of  this act of clemency by the  Irish press  and public wae fully appreciative, but  it is clear  that Sinn Fein will not rest content with  the  exclusion from  the   scope of the amnesty of  Irishmen convicted of offences  committed from  political motives in England.  Mr. Griffith has already voiced  the  general dissatisfaction felt with  this limitation,  and has stated that &quot;it will be the business of  the  Provisional Government to see that all Irish prisoners who have been arrested or incarcerated in  connection with the recent hostilities are restored to liberty.&quot;  It is  generally agreed, however, that the limitation  of the amnesty to exclude persons convicted of offences committed since the Truce is just and reasonable.                         STATE OF THE POLICE FORCES. Demobilisation  of the Auxiliary Division.     The demobilisation of the Auxiliary Division of the Royal Irish Constabulary..is now proceeding.  Bight of the  sixteen companies comprising the Division have already left Ireland for dispersal at Holyhead  and  the remainder will follow in the course of the next few days.  I regret  to state that a certain section of the  men, whose contracts are nearing expiration, were  found to be labouring under a sense of  injustice  on account of their position being less favourable than  that of men whose contracts have still several months to run, and complaints were  received that the terms of  their disbandment which provided for their  being paid a sum of  MBO (less Income Tax) in lieu of a month&apos;s notice from the date of dispersal, fell short of the  Governments promise that  they would be accorded fair  and generous treatment.  Suggestions were made that all  members  of the  Division should be placed upon an equal footing by the  pooling and equal distribution  of all moneys  due on unexpired contracts, but it is obvious that an  arrangement of this kind could only be carried out on  a voluntary basis, and naturally enough, the men to  whom payment in respect  of  considerable periods of unexpired service is still due were not  disposed to forego their  full  contractual rights. After several consultations  between  representatives of  the  Government  and  of  the men, a settlement  was arrived  at on  the basis that all  existing contracts terminating before the 31st March, 1922, should be regarded as terminating on that date, the effect  being to ensure that no man shall receive an outstanding balance of pay of a less amount  than  70, and I am informed that this concession has been accepted by the men concerned as fully meeting the justice  of their case.

The strength of the Dublin Metropolitan Police remained unchanged throughoutthe week at 1,134.                              RAILWAY SITUATION.    The first administrative act of the new Provisional Government has been to avert, at least for  the moment, the threatened  general  strike  in  the  SouthernIrish  Railways  on the issues raised by the Carrigan Arbitration Award.   this result was  secured by an Order addressed  to the Company Directors suspending the application  of  the Award so far as it relates to  bonus  and  conditions ofservice, in  order that the  Provisional Government  &quot; should  have time   and opportunity to  institute  investigations and  endeavour to bring about a  settle-ment.&quot;   Their prompt and  successful handling  of  this  crisis  has  undoubtedlystrengthened the position of the new Government in the eyes of the Irish public.                   PRESENT POLITICAL SITUATION IN IRELAND.    The ratification of the Treaty by &quot; the members  elected to  sit  in the  Houseof Commons of  Southern Ireland,&quot;  as  required  by Article 18, was  unanimouslycarried  through  at a  meeting of that assembly  convened  by  Mr. Griffith  at  the dublin  Mansion House on Saturday, the 14th instant, and at the same meeting a provisional Government  was  constituted,  in accordance with  the  provisions ofArticle  17,  consisting of the  following members :              Mr. Michael Collins.             Mr. W. T. Cosgrave.             Mr. Edmund Duggan.             Mr. Patrick  Hogan.             Mr. Finian Lynch.             Mr. Joseph McGrath.             Mr. Kevin 0&apos;Higgins.    No member of Mr. De Valera&apos;s following in  Dail Eireann was present at  themeeting.  In  the absence of Mr. Griffith,  whose  position  as &quot; President  of DailEireann&quot; during the transitional period until the Irish  Free State  is established,      [7692]                                                         B 2
is regarded as incompatible with his being a member of the Provisional Government.Mr. Michael Collins will act as Prime Minister, but he has not formally assumed that title, and in a Press interview is reported as having defined his positionand that of his colleagues in the following terms :          &quot; The idea is that there is a Governing Committee in which members will    not have distinct portfolios.  It is quite possible and quite likely tha,t certain    functions may be assigned to individual members, but the same man may look    after Home Affairs one week, for instance, and Defence the  next.&quot;    On the 10th instant the members of  the new Government  attended upon theLord  Lieutenant at  Dublin  Castle,  and handed  to  his  Excellency  a copy  ofthe Treaty, on which their acceptance  of  its  provisions had been endorsed.  HisExcellency, after congratulating Mr.  Collins  and his  colleagues, informed themthat they were now duly installed as the Provisional  Government, and  that thenecessary steps would be taken without delay for the  transfer to them of the powersand machinery requisite for the discharge  of their duties.  In a proclamationissued the following day the members of the Provisional  Government  announcedthat they had entered upon  their  duties as  a Government, and that all  public servants would be retained in their offices for the present, and would continue  tocarry  out their  functions, unless otherwise diiected, pending the constitution ofthe Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State.
