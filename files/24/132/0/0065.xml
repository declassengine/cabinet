tion.FRENCH EMBASSYJanuary 27th, 1922.My Lord Marquis:-     I have the honour to address to you herewith amemorandum explaining broadly the proposals which inthe opinion of the French government might serve  asa basis for the conversations which are to take placeon February 1st respecting the revision of the treatyof Sevres.     This memorandum has been drawn up, not as an answer to the British memorandum, but to explain  theFrench point of view of which M. Poincare has alreadyspoken to Your Excellency,  As the British memorandumtook into account the Greek attitude which was made plain by M. Gcunaris in his Ionic interviews with  YourExcellency,, the French document takes account of  theTurkish attitude which ws know from the indicationsgiven by an high commissioner at Constantinople,  byM, Franklin-Bouillon and by Fevid Bey, the unofficialrepresentative of Angora at Paris0     As Mo Poincare undoubtedly informed Your Excel-lency neither ths French parliament nor French publicopinion would admit that coercive measures should betaken against the Turks to compel them to accept con-ditions which would be accepted in favour of thepresent Greek government or that the French governmentshould in any way participate in action of any naturewhatever*...
whatever tending to impose on them such conditions.In his interview of January 16th with Your ExcellencyM. Poincare&quot; also emphasized the fact that in the impending negotiations it was not so much a questionof discussing the respective interests of the alliesas of reconciling the Greeks and the Turks.     Now when the allies drafted the treaty of Sevresthe respective situations of Greece and Turkey were very different from what they are at present.     Greece was ruled by a government which, havingdetermined the intervention of that country on the side of the allies, had given to the entente proofs  ofits friendship and participated at that time in the moral authority conferred by victory.  Greece was un-animously supported by the opinion excited by thedisorders of Turkish administration and by the crimescommitted, notably against the Armenians, in complicitywith German authority.   From the material point ofview, the Greek army, which had occupied without diffi-culty the region of Smyrna, appeared capable of givingthe allies powerful assistance in imposing on Turkeyconditions of peace.  At that time it was legitimate to entertain the idea of only leaving a Turkeyterritorially much diminished, militarily disarmed andin general subjected to an international controlconsiderably restricting its sovereign rights.     The present situation is very different. Greeceis now ruled by the monarch and the ministers who en-deavoured during the war to maintain a neutralitythat ill concealed a secret connivance with the enemiesof the entente and who remain responsible for the out-rages  against the allied armies in Macedonia and against British and French marines at AthenB itself.                                              On
On the other hand, the excesses and ah.us.es committed by the Greek army and authorities in Asia Miner,  con-rirmed by international commissions of enquiry,  have still further reduced that share of moral authority which Greece derived from hor position as one of theallies. Finally, the Greek army has proved itselfincapable of playing the part that seemed to be assigned to it0  In the struggle which it undertookagainst tho Nationalist forces, it has met with  twochecks and its present situation now seems seriouslycompromised.     Turkey, on the other hand, has displayed a. vitalityand a power of resistance that were under-estimated.The government of Angora that two years ago seemednothing but an improvised organisation with a veryprecarious existence, has no3T oeaoed to grow incohesion and power*  Turkish national sentiment  haspronounced in its favour and has given it wholeheartedsupport,     This national sentiment is reinforced by the re-ligious sentiment of Moslems as a whole, for whom it isessential that the Caliph should remain at constantinople and be sufficiently strong and independent to carry out his r61e as defender of Islam-.     The allies would find themselves in opposition tothe very conscience of Moslem peoples if they did not take into account these necessities.  The Britishgovernment is assuredly no less alive than the Frenchgovernment to the gravity of the resultant difficultiesof the two countries most deeply interested in main-talning tranquillity in the Moslem world,                                  Mustapha.....
                 - 4 -     Mustapha Kemal has been able to create an army which, notwithstanding its inferiority in numbers andmaterial, has victoriously resisted the Greek army0This inferiority in material and effectives is about to disappear and there is every reason to believethat if in tho spring military operations are recom-menced, the problem of peace in the East would becomeinsoluble for the alliesf and would create a mostdelicate situation in their eastern dependencies.     The re-establishment of peace is, therefore, an urgent necessity; and a renewed failure of alliedeffort to attain it would be deplorable.  The Frenchgovernment has accordingly desired to examine in themost impartial spirit the actual respective situation of the Greeks and Turks as they are at presents TheFrench government cannot conceal its opinion that the modifications in the treaty of Sevres proposed inMarch 1921, and communicated to the conflictingparties, are no longer sufficient to ensure the ac-oeptance of the Turks, who can justifiably point tothe fact that since then the Greeks have suffered asesious military reverse and have,-by refusing the march proposal for a commission of enquiry, by re-jecting, in June, the intervention of the powers, -committed two grave political errors of which theymust bear the consequences,     The new conditions of peace can,therefore,it would seem, only involve very slight diminutions
of Turkish territory, -  (the fate of the Arabregions remaining unmodified) -  a limitationof military forces  rather than disarmament anda supervision of Turkish administration com-patible with their  rights of sovereignty.                I have,  etc*
          Proposals in view of theMeeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairsrelative to the revision of the Treaty of                  Sevres.     As we are reminded by the  British memorandumof the 30th December,1921, three unsuccessfulattempts have already been made by the allies,in AugUst 1920, and in March and June 1921,  tosecure the conclusion of peace  with Turkey.  Theproposals made on the last two  occasions were re-fused by the Greek government.     In order to ensure the success, which is re-cognised to be essential, of a fourth attempt,  itis necessary that a preliminary agreement betweenthe three allied governments should be established,the terms of which should be so precise  as tosecure complete unanimity in the views of theallies.     With this in view, the British Government,in their memorandum of December 30th, have statedtheir views on the principal questions which willhave to be examined in considering any revisionof the treaty of Sevres.  The French governmenthas the honour to state,  in the following memorandum,their point of view on the various subjects dealtwith in the British memorandum referred to above.
     SMYRNA.     It is clear that,  In the interests of a  general settlement, the fullest possible effect must  be  givento the wishes and aspirations expressed by the Turkson the question of Smyrna.  The existence  of  theGreek administration, and above all,  the presence  of greek troops in the Smyrna zone, have been principallyresponsible for stimulating Turkish nationalism, andhave formed an insurmountable obstacle to  any peace-ful solution.   On the other hand,  it is necessarythat this zone should not be evacuated by  the Greek forces without special measures being taken toprotect the numerous Christian population  which  in-h&amp;bits it.     Now the complete return of Smyrna under  Ottomanrule seems to be a condition in regard to  which  theTurks will prove quite unyielding.   It would  bevery difficult to reconcile any direct intervention by a foreign authority with such sovereignty. Finally,it is well known what determined hostility Turkeyhas always shown to any delimitation of zones withinher territory, since she interprets any such  delimitertion as the prelude of dismemberment.     Provisional measures with the object  of  safe-guarding persons and property in the region of smyrna will have to be considered,  in order thatthey may be applied during a definite period afterthe evacuation of Smyrna by the Greek forces  hasbeen completed.   The evacuation by the Greeks mustbe immediate and complete.  Mixed commissions corn-posed of allied officers and officials, with  amilitary guard, could be&quot; set up in the principalcentres.  They would exercise supervision for ^a^nAc,
periods differing according to the different zones.Outside the Smyrna zone, whether on the line of Ismid,Brusa, Eskesheir, Kutaia and Afium Karahissar, the commissions might remain three months.  In the Smyrnazone, they might remain a year. No detachment of turkish gendarmerie or of Turkish troops would re-occupy the territory before the arrival of inter-alliedcommissions. On the other hand, it would not seem  -necessary to contemplate the establishment of a specialregime for the Christian populations of the Smyrnaregion, or the creation for them of guarantees differ-in g from these which will be granted to the minoritiesof the Ottoman Empire as a whole.  Perhaps,in viewof the very numerous foreign elements which the popu-latlon of Smyrna contains, one might consider thepossibility of this city being granted, as in thecase  of Alexandria, a municipal administration inwhich the foreign elements would take part; such amunicipal organisation, however, would of course, be under the authority of the Ottoman government.       The status of Western Thrace was establishedby the treaty of Neuilly.  Having been detached from bulgaria, and ceded to the principal allied powers,Western Thrace was retroceded by them to Greece,  in virtue of a separate treaty, signed in August 1920,but not yet ratified.  The district has been  occupiedsince 1914 by Greek troops.  This question cannot  bere-opened without endangering  the whole Balkan  settle-                                         ment,
settlement, established by the treaties of St,Germain,of Neuilly and of Trianon, on which it is not possibleto go back.      The population of Eastern Thrace up to theM&amp;ritza is mainly Turkish, excepting in that portionwhich Is contiguous to Western Thrace, and in the gallipoli Peninsula.  To have recourse to a plebiscitewould involve difficulties in a country where the populations are so mixed, and where the personal status of the inhabitants is so doubtful,  On the other hand,the necessity of assuring strategic security forConstantinople renders desirable  the re**establishmenton European soil of a zone such as to render thecapital free from  immediate danger, in the event of  a sudden attack.  The line dividing Turkish and Greekterritory might therefore follow  the course of  theTundza down to Adrianople, and then the course  of the maritza down to Kuleli Burgas, and thence rejoin theSea of Marmora near Eodosto.  The territory given backto Turkey would be immediately evacuated by the greeks and controlled during six months  by an inter-allied commission, as in  the case of the Smyrna zone,       CONSTANTINOPLE.       The French  government considers that it  isdesirable that no  conditions should be proposed makingthe future of Constantinople dependent on the  executionof the Peace Treaty.  Constantinople should be  returned                                             to
                    M 5 **to the Ottoman government without any limitation of&quot; the  latter&apos;s powers.  The transfer to some place in theinterior of Anatolia of the capital of the Ottoman Empire, in so much as it would withdraw the Turkishgovernment from Western influences, would be opposedto the desire of the Powers to see Turkey confoim herattitude to their general policy of peace and to seeher gradually establish an internal regime compatible with the existence on her territory of numerousChristian populations.  The retention, until the rati-fication of peace, of allied troops in the city ofConstantinople itself, does not present any real ad-vantages to the Powers.  These troops, if re-groupedat once  in the outskirts of the town, would find them-selves in Just as strong a position as they are in atpresent.  If they were removed to the Sea of Marmoraand to the Dardanelles ponding the signature of peace,they would constitute a sufficient guarantee for itsultimate ratification.      The following  observations are  suggested by  theBritish  proposals for the reduction of the zone to bedemilitarized, in accordance with the views exchangedin London in March,  1921, and for-the diminution of  theallied garrisons  to  be maintained on  the nortnern  and southern shores of the Dardanelles.   It is not to  beexpected that the Turks will accept a completedemilitarization  of  the Straits, which for that matter                                           is
is not indispensable In order to ensure the freedomof transit.    The maintenance of allied troops on theAnatolian shore would be incompatible with thatOttoman sovereignty which the Turks desire to pre^serve intact in Asia Minor,     In so far as the Straits Commission is concerned.the modifications contemplated in London in 1921,would give satisfaction to Turkey,     The intervention of the League of Nations, both to ensure the ultimate demilitarisation of the zone of the Straits, and to exercise a superior authority over the Straits Commission, would seem to meet not -only the needs of the present situation but also theopinion of all the countries which have maritimeinterests in the Near East,,    The attitude adoptedby the United States towards the League of Nationscreates, however, a difficulty in the adoption of this measure which it does not seem possible top remove bythe same means as those which France and Great Britainproposed to the United States in the matter of the mandates.     It would seem desirable to connect the admissionof Turkey to the League of Nations with the sub-stitution for the allied garrisons at the straits of a League of Nations&apos; commission.     The French government does not see, any morethan does the British government, how it would bepossible to re-open the question of Turkish Armenia;                                                  but
but it has examined with the most careful attentionthe British proposal for the creation in Cilicia ofan.Armenian automony.    It cannot conceal its opinionthat this proposal involves rather an aggravationthan a mitigation of the original peace conditions,since all geographical delimitation on Turkishterritory must appear as a prelude of a new dis-memberment.     There is no analogy between the situation ofCilicia and that of the Lebanon before the war.Instead of constituting, as did the latter, a compactgroup of 500,000 Christians collected together in amountanous region which was so poor that Turkey had ceased to levy taxes in it, Cilicia forms, with the smyrna region, the richest portion of Ottoman territory.The Christian populations did not constitute in it,after the war, more than a very small minority.   the emigration which has just taken place as a consequenceof the evacuation of this district by the French troopshas rendered it possible to establish this fact pre-&apos;cisely:  the Christian population, amounted to thetotal-number of 43,884 persons, of whom 40s 000 wereArmenians. to which must be added about a hundredfamilies who were able to evade the statistical control.The French authorities have been obliged to note thefact that, notwithstanding the guarantees which hadbeen given to the populations, and notwithstanding the complete maintenance of order, only 4,000 Christianshave remained in Cilicia.   Even supposing that all thepersons who have emigrated should return to Cilicia,                                                   and
and that they should he joined there by a certainnumber of their compatriots, who are at presentscattered all over the world, the numberof Armenianswho might ultimately establish themselves in this region would still remain Infinetlsimal in comparison v-to that of the Armenians (even now estimated at amillion and a half) who live on the confines of turkey and of Russian Trans-Caucasia.     In this latter region there exists an Armenianstate.   This state is recognised as such by the Powerseven though its present government is not.   Inview of the fact that its territory constitutes thecradle of their race and includes the seat of theCatholicos, the supreme head of their religion andsymbol of their nationality, it Is difficult tobelieve that the Armenians, reduced as they havebeen by the war, could dissipate their emsrgies ina region which is separated from the Armenian state by the whole breadth of Anatolia.     The French government which, true to its resolU&quot;tions, which have long been formed and publishedjhas just restored Cilicia to the Turkish administra-tion, does not, for its part, consider that is anyground for the allies to bring the present positionof this province under discussion.                                     MINORITIES.
                   -  9  -              MINORITIES.     His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to maintain thesubstance of the clauses Included in Section IV of theTreaty of Sevres,  to insert the clause of the Treatiesrelative to the European Minorities placing theirexecution under the guarantee of the League of Nations,and. to insert a special clause appointing a League ofNations High Commissioner with power to assure theapplication of the guarantees granted to TurkishMinorities,     The French government, which is animated by thesame sentiments of humanity and justice as have in-spired His Majesty5e Government, end desires to obtainpractical results in this respect, agrees that it is expedient to give the provisions of the Treaty of sevres a form which may facilitate their acceptance by turkey.   This, moreover, was the intention withwhich the Allied Governments in March 1921 manifested,their readiness to modify Articlerl44 of the Treaty.     The French government also recommends that, forthe protection of minorities in Turkey, the provi-sions of the Treaties concluded with the variousEuropean States should be adopted, without prejudice to the possibility of defining the Powers of theLeague of Nations under whose guarantee they are placed, in such a way as to assure their completeapplication.   The drafting of the final clause ofthe European Treaties might be rendered more complete                                               and
 and precise;   the execution  or  the  obligations would be placed under the guarantee and the  superintendence&quot;of the  League of Nations.    Such superintendence could only terminate after the  admission of Turkey tc the League of Nations, and in the same way, a commis- sion of experts of the League of Nations might, at this Juncture,  be substituted for the  garrisons en- trusted with  the custody of  the Straits.      It would be particularly opportune if at the time of the  signature of the Treaty  of peace, League of Nations Commission were sent to other  countries which have signed Minorities Treaties.               TRIPARTITE AGREEMENT.      Ths French government agrees with His Majesty&apos;s Government, as it did in June 1921,  that the sub- stance  of this convention must  not  be  modified, and that it should be maintained in the  form of an engagement which would bind  only the three Powers and would not be  notified to Turkey.    But there is no doubt that Turkey will make  the application of the Agreement extremely difficult and that it would be preferable to delay its conclusion  until after the signature of  the peace Treaty.   It  is necessary to learn the Italian proposals  upon this  subject.                FINANCIAL CLAUSES.      As the two governments  recognised In March and June 1921, when they agreed  to  a reduction (which                                             now
now would be inadequate) of the powers of theFinancial Commission,  certain provisions of Part viii of the Treaty of Sevres must be modified not only inorder that they may harmonise with existing circurn-stances but also that  they may answer the purposeoriginally contemplated by the Allies.   If no con-cession can be made in respect of the maintenance of pre-war engagements and institutions, it is neverthe-less possible to reduce considerably the powers ofcontrol of a financial commission in which Turkey would now participate, and to limit them to the period during  which Turkey may be unable to satisfy the obligations which she incurs under the Treaty of peace.     On the other hand, the importance and the specialcharacter of the military expenditure incurred byGreece in Anatolia during the two years which have passed since the Treaty of Sevres was drawn up, will no doubt involve a reduction of the amount payable tothe Principal Powers in respect of their costs of occu-pation and will necessitate a differentiation asagainst the Military expenditure of Greece.   unless such modifications are introduced, it seems indubit-able that the relative position assigned by the Treatyof Sevres to the war claims of allied Nationals will leave these persons without any prospect of evenpartial indemnification,                  MILITARY&apos; CLAUSES.     The French government agrees with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that over and above the concessions pro-                                          posed
proposed at the London Conference, the military clauses of the Treaty of Sevres must forn the subjectof a fresh examination by the Allies.   Limitationof the Turkish forces is a matter of especial diffi-culty at a moment when the whole effort of Anatoliahas been directed towards organising an army in whichthe most active elements of the nation have foundtheir livelihood and with which they, more or less,hold the Nationalist government at their mercy.Nevertheless, it appears that such limitation mightbe arrived at if it were coupled with the limitationof the armaments of the neighbouring countries whichTurkey considers that she has chief reason to fear,and among which Bulgaria has already had to subscribe to a similar obligation.     The maintenance of conscription is in harmony with Turkey&apos;s desire to establish equal treatmentamong all her subjects Sn accordance with theprinciples of modern states.   It must also be ad-mitted that the support of a voluntary army would constitute an excessive financial burden for Turkey,and that if composed only of Moslems, such an armymight cause anxiety to the Christian Inhabitants ofTurkey.   certain guarantees for the non-Moslemsenrolled in the Turkish forces might be secured byorganizing recruitment and by the presence offoreign officers.   AS regards the introduction offoreign officers into the Turkish forces, the French                                       government
government considers that the Ottoman government shouldhave the power controlling the choice of these officersand should maintain a certain degree of authority overthem.     The various military Commissions might perhaps he maintained if the Ottoman government were to partici-pate in them upon conditions at least as favourable asthose upon which it participates in the Straits Corn-mission.                 OTHER CLAUSES.     As His Majesty&apos;s Government remark, other modlfi-cations would have to be introduced into the termspreviously elaborated.   Among these, one to which theFrench Government feel bound to call attention is the abrogation of the capitulations, the principle ofwhich should be more precisely stated.   It might bedecided to appoint a large commission to study allthe  measures necessary in order to regularise thestatus of foreigners in Turkey.   It would be neces-sary to abandon any extension of the capitulations tothe Nationals of States which did not enjoy them before the war.
