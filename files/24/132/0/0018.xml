(Copy of a fetterfron Lord. Si,payids -, t ?                                           7,  Park Orescent, 1s 10    My dear- Prime Minister,.                      &apos;15th ^nnuary, 1922,.          I. think you ought  to know- that a good-deal; of trouble  and    difficulty is. likCfly to  be caused, to the  Government by  the cur-    tallment  of the scheme-for assisting Local Authorities  to find    work for  unemployed, which was started in Octoberlast0.          Local Authorities  were then- invited by the Government, and    even urged,, to send in schemes as rapidly as they could in order    to relieve, the situation, and my Committee was, asked to deal with    thorn as expeditiously as.-possible so that &quot;ro-rk could be star-ted.    without delays          So  rapidly was the work got through, that b-r the end of last    year schemes to the value-of about  9,.500,.000 had been  approved,    all of which will be started-: this, months if they have not been    already begun,.          But Local Authorities have submitted: schemes to the. value of    over-  20,000,.000, and as I am only- authorised-, to s anction schemes    up to  the value of  13,000,000,. I have to turn down really good    and useful schemes to the value of about  5,000 5.000,, quite apart    from rejecting about  2,000,000 worth, of;,less deserving bases.  All    this work Is of a valuable character-,. e0g* water Undertakings,, gas    and electricity supply,  roads,, tramways,, 3,ewerage,. etcoetc*          In  addition, the Electricity Commissioners tell me that at.    least   2,000,000 of good schemes&apos; have been proposed,, and have had    to.be  thrown out, of course, as the have not yet. been formally    submittedc          Unemployment is unfortunately showing no material signs of    decrease, end the unrest caused by this&apos; will be accentuated by                                                             /the feelin
the feeling engendered in Local Authorities that  they have beenunfairly, treated in being asked to submit schemes.. and having then been told  that  they  cannot-;  be agreed to for no  apparently validreason.,,      Further,,  I have come to the end of the  2.,650,000 which my committee  was authorised to  expend in Grants to Local authorities on the  basis of 60$ of tho wages cost) for schemes started to relieve unemployment and I am having to reject.hundreds&apos; of schemes under this plan also - although Parliament and  Local authorities were told  in December 1920 that  3,000,000 would be aval lablOo      The  effect of -all this will fall on  the head of the Goverrtmenand I feel bound to warn you that&apos; it is likely  to be considerable^      I have now had some considerable experionce-of schemes fordealing with Unemployment and I have no hesitation in say ing thatthe system of cheap Loans .to Local Authorities  is far- an-1 a*my thebest one yet evolved.  The Government only pays a part of the cost,and that part is spread over a varying number of  years.  Thescheme  is  really -a popular one, ,and has been warrvly taken up byLocal Authorities. . There is no  reason  whatever to suppose that the 20,00&quot;,000 of  schemes so far proposed to us are-anything like thefull number that would come-.  moreover the schemes aro most ofthem really excellent ones,  and there is; comparatively very little of tho  throwing about of mud in so-called  &quot;improvements&quot; in&apos; parks and pleasure.groundsc.      I certainly think that everybody connected  with the Unemploywwent Schemes will agree with my contention that the Loans to LocalAuthorities are the best.  .      The  Government is to-day in&apos;this position,  - that the 60/?Grants  have, stopped, and unless our- funds &apos;nre add d. to ?ithin the  &quot;!next three or four weeks the Unemployment  Loans will also come to .Ian  end.   The Chancellor of  the Exchequersays, and do doubt truly.that he cannot   afford to go -further,-yet nobody can seriouslycontend that the unemployed  are to &apos; starve-v.. .Either they must be
 given  work,  or  they  must be  granted relief by  the Guardians, or  some  system  of  Government doles must be adopted.  Ho Government can leave   1,800,000 men out of work  to starve.  After all, the feeding  of  the people  is the  first charge  on a State.- It  must  surely &quot;come  before Elementary Education, or  payment of Debt,  or almost anything.  It  is  a first necessity.       At the moment &apos;there  Is ho&apos;great outcry, &quot;because the  general public have  not&quot;yet  discovered that our funds  are  at an end, but&apos;every  day  more  of  the  Local  Authorities have to be told of it, and In a few weeks you  must  have  a great outbreak of popular clamour. &quot;&quot;                                  &apos;;&apos; .,&quot;     3)on&apos;t think for a  moment  that I  am writing this because the work&apos;of  my Committee is coming to an  end, for  when the end Is reached  it will be an  immense  relief  to me.  I am only writing to  warn  you  of  the trouble ahead  of you, and to post you as to the facts.     -        &apos;&apos;&apos;-&quot;-     &apos;.-  &apos; v-           &quot;                           I am,  -                             Yours very sincerely,                                  (Signed) ST.DAVIDS.
