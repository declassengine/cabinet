The financial position of the Communist Pe.rty is somewhat. easier.  MacEanus and Bell intend to visit Moscow for a Communist conference on February 1st.

EES UKEIJPIOYED          Practically no improvement  in  tho unemployment     situation has been  reported  during  tho week but there has     been rather less extremist agitation  owing to tho severe     weather -which has caused  smaller attendance at demonstra-     tions and meetings.          Processions of unemployed have visited some of the     Guardians&apos;  offices  in  the  Metropolitan area but no disorder     has  been reported:   on January  3rd about  500 people who     assembled in the Central Hall, Peckhara, were addressed by     Mrs.  Thring,  Vincent,  King and a London County Council     electrician named Bolton.  Mrs.  Thring appealed to her     audienoe to bring more women  into the movement and to organise     big  demonstrations.          My correspondent  reports that unemployment and short     time are widespread in the Lancashire and Cheshire coalfields     where few miners are earning  more than 35s. a week.  There is     a possibility cf a  slight  improvement at Barrow and in the     Mersey district  Where  Messrs. Vickers and Cammel Laird have     each received an order for a  ship.  Ellen Wilkinson is     attempting  to organise unemployed women in the Manchester     district and advooates the formation of women sub-commit tea     wherever unemployment  committees are in existenoe.  She is in     communication on this  subject with Helen Crawfurd who iB shortly     going to 3orlin  to  attend  a Women&apos;s Conference.          There is much  dissension among the Gateshead unemployed     who  have deposed their reoently  elected chairman, Waister,     and  eleoted W. J. Cogan.   George Wheeler and ether Newcastle     extremists  have  aggravated the situation by participating in     Gateshead meetings.  An attempt  is  being made to form a     divisional  unemployed  council comprising&apos; Newcastle, Gate ahead .                                                      Jar r
Jarrow, Sunderland, South  Shields  and Hartlepool, but  thoorganisers are very disappointed with the lack  of progress made so far.     There is not much improvement among tho  organisedunemployed in the Midlands but in  Coventry a  propagandacommittee has been formed  chiefly  with the object of puttinga stop to the working of overtime  in local factories.  There                                           in  the Potteries,is a distinct decrease in the number of unemployed/although105OOO workers, half of whom are women, are still out  of wonThe Leicester unemployed are restless.     The organised unemployed in Sheffield are  somewhat quietiowing to the. decision of the Guardians to abolish taskworkuntil the end of February.  There  have been no  demonstrationsduring the week..     John MacLean? s unemployed committee is very short ofmoney and the activities of this body have consequentlydecreased of late.   .       ....TEE COMMUNISTS     As stated in previous reports the  Communist Party hasbeen for some weeks in considerable financial difficulties:at the beginning of January  &quot;The Communist&apos; Review&quot; was losing! 80 per month and there was  some question as  to its continuant!affairs became so difficult  that the  reduction of paid officialto one organiser and a chairman was under consideration.  KowJhowever, the Party&apos;s affairs seom to  have taken a temporaryturn for the better for on Janxiary 20th the acting general secretary s  when sending  18  for the weeli^s salaries for the glasgow officials, wrote :                                            &quot;Referring/
           &quot;Referring  to  tho letter  Bent  out to the members of      the  staff on  December 2nd, we  are pleased to say that      everyone  ooncorned  immadlately responded in the      affirmative to the  suggestion  that wo should make a weekly      contribution  of  one-sixth of our salaries to the Party      Maintenance Fund it was then decided to establish.  This      action has materially assisted the Party in tiding over a      difficult financial situation  during the past six weeks,      and  has been  of  help to us in  our enquiries as to how the      work of the Party can be reconstructed in view of a probable      reduction in  its general income during the ooming year.           &quot;The general finanoial situation is now somewhat easier,      and  it has therefore been decided to return to the normal      salaries payable to tho staff, commencing with payment due      in respect of this week.  We hope to continue these payments      until the General Conference of the Party, which is being      called for the second week in  March, when the whole      administrative and organisational side of the party  a work      will  be considered in the light of such changes as the      Executive Committee may then feel it necessary. to recommend.&quot;      The conference to which Peet refers is to be held in london on March 11th and  12th and is considered of some importance bythe officials.  A  whip has been sent to.all branches, in which Peetsays :           &quot;It is specially desirable to have the fullest possible      representation end branches should immediately commence a      fund  to meet  the expenses of their delegates.  The Executive      Committee whilst not being able to meet all expenses are     prepared to assist those branches where the distance from      London involves  a heavy rail fare.  VJhere the fare reaches      beyond three pounds the difference between that  sum and the      total fare will  be advanced to the Branch.&quot;  .,      The entry of  &quot;Rosta Wion&quot; into this, country has long beenprohibited and the English edition,  which was published in Vienna,has now been stopped.   Interesting confirmation of the connection between &quot;Rosta Wion&quot; and the Soviot is contained in the followingcircular letter from the Russian Trading Delegation,  InformationDepartment, 68a,  Lincoln&apos;s Inn Field:           t                      %         &quot;13th January,  1922.           &quot;In view of the fact that the English edition of      1 Rosta Wien&apos;,  to which you subscribed,  has now been     discontinued,  I am sending you a specimen copy of &quot;Russian      Information &amp; Review&apos;,  of which I hope  you will  become a     subscriber.           &quot;Each number contains the latest information about      (l)  the famine in the Volga provinces,  and  the  work  of relief      (2)  the economic situation and tho Soviet Government&apos;s          measures  to  improve it;  and  the results obtained in          imnortant industries;

The Communist &quot;International is  again turning itsattention to the co-operative movement end Cf. Kramarov writesin the English edition of the &quot;International PressCorrospondenoe&quot; dated January 17th:          &quot;At tho Third Congress, following a report delivered     by Comrade Mesherjakoff, a resolution was adopted pointing     out the necessity for forming a Co-operative Section in     order to unite and guide the Communist and revolutionary     elements In the co-operatives.          &quot;This Section must,, in accordance with the Thesis on     tho Co-operatives adopted by the Congress,  look for     support in the nuclei and groups existing both legally     and illegally in the co-operatives  throughout Hie world.          &quot;The Section must endeavour to establish communicatioii     between the oo-operatives on oneshand and the Communist     Parties and revolutionary trade-unions on the other;  it     must also oppose the opportunist elements at present     controlling the co-operatives.  .          &quot;The Section was created and commenced activities     in August last.   It cannot be maintained, however,  that     the conditions for these activities are very favourable.          &quot;Apart from its political -activities,  the Section     must deal with the trade and.credit operations between     the co-operatives in various countries.   This,  however,     leads to the setting up  of an international wholesale     buying  agency,  and an international co-operative  bank.          &quot;Two representatives of the Russian co-operativeshaving/
     having  joined  tha Central Committee of the     International  Federation of Co-operatives it became     necessary for  them to formulate the differences between     their political position and that of the co-operativos     which are all  for &quot;political neutrality&apos; and which in     their 3asla convention declared their solidarity with     tho principles of the Leaguo of Nations, clamoring     for admittance to its Labour Bureau ...          &quot;Wherever workers&apos; oo-operatives exist wo must     form Communist nuclei within them.  All Communist     Parties must entrust the work within these nuclei     to special sections which must be in closest     communication with the Intornational Section in Moscow.&quot;     W. P. Coates.of the &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; Committee, hasbeen informed by the Finnish Legation that the finnish government has intimated willingness to &quot;receive the delegates which your Committee wish to send to Relsiogforsas well as. to Moscow to make independent enquiries regardingthe dispute  over the Carelian question.&quot;     Sylvia Pinkhurst, who practically represents thefourth or Syndicalist International in this country, is inclose touch with Hermann Gorter, who has offered to print andpublish at his own  expense an English edition of his book&quot;Historical Materialism&quot; if she has it translated from theGerman: he will send her tho complete edition to sell onbehalf of the &quot;Workers&apos;  Dreadnought&quot;.     Ex-Colonel Malone appears to have resumed his communistactivities: , on January 22nd he addressed the local branchof the Communist Party in Ley-ton Town.Hall:  the meeting was attended by about .800 people.. He ,said that he though^tha differences between the. Labour party and the CommunistParty would soon be settled and attempted to ridicule thevarious European conferences describing members of theGovernment as &quot;wandering minstrels&quot;.  Maclfenus was in the chair.&apos; ..                               ........ .     Edgar Whitehead has sent  the following letter,&apos; headed                                                  2nd/

Please publish this item of news - the more anti-     Ellis Island publicity got going the better. &quot;     It is reported  on the authority of a single informantthat Mrs. Thring is receiving a salary of  4 per week from theCommunist Party of Great Britain.     Mrs. Helen Crawfurd, who is a popular speaker in communistoircles, has addressed a series of meetings in the North Easternarea, some of which have been fairly well attended.  W. Geehas also spoken at three meetings in South Shields where the communists claim to have set up a Federated Board which controlsfour collieries (Marsden, Harton, Hilda and Boldon).  Thayre isa good deal of dissension in the Newcastle branch of theCommunist Party.     On January 22nd about 400 people, the majority of whom were Jews and foreigners, attended a oommunist meeting inStevenson Square, Manchester:  a somewhat inflammatory speechwas delivered by Ealstead, the chairman of the ManchesterCentral Unemployed Committee.                                   j     There has not been much activity during the week amongcommunists in the Midlands: the membership of the Coventry      jbranch has fallen from 130 to 54 in the last six months: it     Ih&amp;B been decided that Jack Leekie shall be the communistcandidate for Coventry at the next election.  Jack Ganley,  the  jyoung Birmingham communist, is in Coventry for a fortnight&apos;s   jpropaganda on behalf of the Young Communist League: he                                               addressed/      j
      addressed a communist meeting  of  about 40O on  January  22nd      and- an unemployed meeting of about  500 on  January&apos; 23rd..      Leckie, wh&apos;o visited West  Sromwich in connection with the      conviction of five unemployed,  to whose  oase referenoe is      made in another part of this report,  has spoken at meetings      In the Birmingham Bull Ring during, the week.    ;           There is praotically no surface  activity  among the      communists in South Wales but  the live members of the Party    &apos;  are working steadily inside the trade unions.COMMUNIST &quot;PARLIAMENTARY POLICY AND  TAP TIPS&quot;     The Executive of the. Communist Party recently drew up astatement on the above polioy and sent it to Walton Newbold,who is one of the better educated communists, for criticism.Newbold, In returning the document to Tom Bell, said that itwas &quot;a grammatical terror and top full of the hackneyedphrases of our crowd&apos;&apos; and enclosed a new statement, written by himself, in which he &quot;carefully avoided Russian phraseology&quot;.Newbold&apos;s statement, which is not without-interest in that itis a lucid exposition of the communist attitude towardsParliament and the Labour Party, contains the followingpassages: .                                          , .               &quot;Parliamentary Polioy and Tactics&quot;.               We regard Parliament - that combination of     King,  Lords and Commoners,who together and not     separately constitute Parliament - as a historic survival,     as the political reflex of landed and bourgeois property     and as the authorised expression of these elements in     society.   It represents the economic systom and the     interests of the classes which  the system has in its     evolution successively elevated to wealth and eminence.     It embodies in its most dramatic form the hypocritical     tyranny of olass rule.   It stands as the symbol, nay     more,  as  the instrument of that social order which it is     the  historic mission of the Communist party of Great     Britain  utterly and irrevocably to extirpate from, the     life of the people of this country ...          &quot;The Communist Party will  encourage the, workers     to try the efficacy of  returning members to Parliament.     It will,  generally speaking but with no  blind adherence to/
 to on unvarying tactic, urge the workers to vote for anil return the. Labour Party to office.  It will do so, cleerly and definitely stating its own disbelief in the final utility of parliamentary action to achieve the reality of Working-class rule.   It will do s,o, telling the workers what in its belief will be the fate of a Labour    . Party Governmovit,  viz., either to fail -ignominious].y to   t achieve anything of worth or to be hurled from power by its olass enemies.   It &quot;will do so calling upon the workers to prepare to sup iloment political action in t ne Parliamentary arena by political action of an industrial character.  It ma do so,,, meanwhile rallying the v/orkers in industrial and socl - committees so&quot;-that in the moment of crisis the shock troops I of Communism may advance between the broken ranks of the Labour Party to the real and decisive assault upon the cltE. - state.                -   .,      &quot;Tho Communist Party desires to exploit the parliamen- turian opportunism-of the Labour Party, a tendency which already.marked,will become  continuously more conspicuous..wit its advrnce to  popularity,  to make plain to the working clasI the fatuity of  such conceptions of political strategy and tactics ...      &quot; Th e&apos; Comrauni st P or t y will;&apos;ss a party and through its-members inside  the unions,  trades councils and co-operative ! societies,  iff ilia ted to th&amp; Labour Party, continue this advocacy until  it  has transformed that Party into a veritalil replica of itself. : It in no way minimises the gigantic character,which  such a task at. this juncture appears to present ..,      &quot;The Communist Party will  infeerever conditions &apos;are favourable.and  with  the means at its disposal,  viz: the enthusiasm and  activity of  its rank, and&apos;file and their read: ; noss to make sacrifices for their ideal,, contest-ParliamentsI elections with  the single end of furthering its own conquest! of.;power ..,      &quot;Tho Communist Party will, at this juncture,  put up its -f parliamentary candidates in constituencies situated in th\  I very, heart of great industrial  areas and with  all the &apos; prestige that still attaches to a parliamentary candidate^  I they may exploit every crisis in politics  and in industry  j to  put before the  masses in the constituency and the surrounding  area the ultimate objective&apos; and the immediate and concrete proposals of the Communist Party.   Having regari 1 to  the, fact  that custom permits a considerable freedom of  I speech to a  prospective  candidate ?and the  lav/ supposedly protects him after the issue-of the writ in making  as clear as  he  wishes the nature  of  the  advice.which he  desires to gh I to  His Majesty  in  Parliament, the party proposes to avail itself of these  opportunities for  plain speaking.   If its daring results  in  the capitalist  government interfering with I theFreedom  of  Election,  BO much  the better., . We shall then be  able  to take  the  field in defence of the liberties of our country whioh our  masters have  taught the  workers  to believe are &apos;a  reality..&quot;. &apos;.   ,  &quot;We  must and&apos;we shall -compel  the:-capitalist government and .the  capitalist class, officially andjuhpffidaily, to set  on  one  side  the  custom of the  Constitution   -Jnd  employ &quot;all the  civil  and military forces of the  Crown&quot;,  all thelimitless powers of  the  Royal Prerogative  to stem end,  at all  costs  attempt  to  back the resolute  might  of the organised j                                             masses/

On the following day about 2,000people attendee&quot; a meeting in the City Hall at whioh TomMann was tha principal speaker end J, iloBain of the GlasgowCentral Branch of the Communist Party was chairman:  thefirst collection at the seoond meetlnr: realised! 15. 10-, 0.     Harry Pollitt has applied for a passport and will probablyattend /

SCOTTISH ROME RULE           The Scottish Home Rule Association, which has for some time      held meetings in Scotland, appears to have been encouraged by      the Irish settlement: the movement,  as far as Scotland is      concerned, is in the main an outlet for a small section of verloi      middle-class Scots but has the nominal support of various labour      organisations.           On January 14th the London branch of the Scots National      League held a meeting, in Essex Hall: an address was given by the      branch president,  Angus Clark:  the other speakers, with the      exception of one man who was insulted because he avowed his      readiness to fight for England as well as Scotland, were      Socialists.  Fifty-one people were present, one of whom declared      himself to be a &quot;communist and an out and out bolshevist.&quot;CONVICTIONS           On January 18th Robert Dawson,  the Rochdale communist,      was bound over in  10 to keep the peace for 12 months and In      the event of non-compliance was sentenced to one month&apos;s      imprisonment.  P.  J. Kealey, Lancashire divisional organiser of      the employed, was refused permission to take charge of his case,      and the Chairman of the 3ench also refused to allow him to make      a statement.           On January 23rd the five members of the V7est Bromwich      unemployed organisetion, to whose case reference was made in my      last report, appeared before the Stipendiary:  Swain was sentences      to one month&apos;s imprisonment, Rigby and :3aggott tc 21 days&apos;  and      Tanner and Carpenter were fined 20s. each,  A crowd of extremists      collected outside the Law Courts and hold up a tram car,
 but  was dispersed by the  police:   one  youth  wa/s  arrested and  fined 20/-  for obstruction.   Leckie  and  Brain of the Communist Party engaged a lawyer  for the defenoe and worked actively on the prisoners&apos;  behalf.      On January 9th the appeal  of Albert Inkpija, secretary of the Communist Party, was heard in the King&apos;3  Head Divisional Court:  the convictions were  upheld with costs against the appellant.      The Free Speech Committee,  of which Neil Maclean, M.P., is chairman, Jack Mills,  M.P., Treasurer,  and the Rev. Herbert Dunnico, secretary,  has issued a circular to trade union, Labour, Co-operative and Liberal organisations,  urging them to co-operate in  an effort to secure BInkpin&apos;s release,  &quot;by forwarding  resolutions to the  Prime Minister and, if occasion requires, direct to the  King as head of the Government.&quot;  The committee states in the circular that it does not, as  a committee, endorse the opinions expressed by Inkpin,  but considers his  punishment &quot;a gross violation of the rights  of free speeoh.&quot;   The above mentioned officials are, however, extremists&quot;DAILY HBRALD&quot; *                                         *   *      On January 21st George Lansbury addressed a large &quot;Daily Herald&quot; meeting in the Memorial Hall:  he said that the circulation of the paper, which in  October (presumably 1920) was 370,000, was now between 170,000 and 180,000:  the more they sold, the more they lost and they were losing each week now;   if they lost their money, they got a return in circulation and  its  effect. They had raised about  10,000 since last September by the &quot;Bacl-c to a Penny&quot; campaign.  The Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain had invested moat money in  the paper,                                              nearly/
nearly  100,000:  the &quot;National Union of Railwaymen 20,000 (in paper):  the London Co-operative Society 5,030 and the Scottish Co-operative Society  1*,000:Havelock Wilson might be a &quot;Lib-Lab&quot; but he had,.reoomm 1,000 and no control.  Lansbury stated that the joint council of the Trades Union Congress has acquired thebest part of Victoria House and control and that Mrs.Besant had handed over her holdings and a power ofattorney to him:  in reply to a question regardingcirculation in the North, Lansbury said, &quot;The building in Manchester was a white elephant.&quot;   He added thathis special desire was to get into touch with theagricultural workers.- &quot;They count the raost.&quot;  In thisconnection interest attaches to the following circulardated January 14th, which has been sent to all branchesof the National Union of Agricultural Workers by thegeneral secretary, R.B. Walker, one of the signatories to the circular quoted in my last report:        &quot;  &quot;It is with pleasure that I have to inform     you that &apos;Tho Daily Herald&apos; will be reduced to     the price of Id. as from Monday, January 23rd,     and that being so I desire to appeal to you as     our Branch Secretary, and through you to every     member of your Branch, to consider seriously the     placing of an order with the local newsagent for     a copy to be supplied every day to every member.          &quot;I do sincerely hope your members will find     it possible to do this.  In our present fight     the&quot; only paper that has placed our case before     the Public and pleaded our Cetiso  fearlessly has     been Labour^ own paper  &apos;The Daily Herald&apos;.  One     cannot contemplate what our position is these     days, or at any time for that matter, would be,     had we not our own daily paper to champion our     Cause and state our case.          &quot;Again, a General Election cannot be far     distant now and all the other parties which     represent wealth and vested interests will pour     out their poison gas day by day and misrepresent     our Cause.  I confidently appeal to our members     therefore both from the Industrial and the     Political standpoint to rally to the support of     their own paper.  I say unhesitatingly that it in     the duty of every agricultural worker as it is the     duty of all other workers to stand by his own     Daily Journal, and now that the price of  TThe                                                 Daily/
13 -288     Daily Herald1 ia being reduced to Id. I am looking     forward to a huge circulation for the paper in     agricultural districts throughout the country.          &quot;With every good wish and trusting that this     appeal will be responded to in no uncertain way,&quot;     All the London and provincial Labour and extremistpapers contained large advertisements of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;last week and on January 24th an &quot;Appeal to TransportWorkers&quot; to &quot;Buy the Herald, Head the Herald, and Push theHerald,&quot; appeared in that paper over the signature ofRobert Williams.     The &quot;Communist&quot; of January 21st contained thefollowing comment on the &quot;Dally Herald&quot;:          &quot;We believe $t is the case that the Labour     Party ::as unable to raise the funds to take the     who.le paper over, and has merely handed it a     subvention and claims an advisory voice.  That     is to say, George Lansbury is running the paper     as before, and ta3d.ng the risk of going back to a     penny to give the paper a proper circulation and     make it solvent.          &quot;Under these circumstances we have no hesitation     in saying that the campaign has our good wishes.  So     long- as the paper keeps an open door for Left Wing     news (and let ua be fair and say that it has,     considering all things, behaved very well), Communists     would be insane not to support the only Labour daily.     While it remains independent, it can count on members     of the Communist party giving it full support in its     1 Back-to-a-Penny1 Campaign.&quot;IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IK THE UNITED KINGDOM     Irish political associations in Great Britain havebeen inactive during the week.  The question of the releaseof Irish political prisoners, convicted for offences inthis country, is receiving some attention, but,, generallyspeaking, little or nothing ia being done with regard to it.This is, possibly, because most people believe their release to be only a matter of time, and are content toleave it in the hands of representatives of theProvisional Government.     De Valera&apos;s visit to Paris is causing some uneasinessto supporters of the Treaty in this country.  They are                                                    afraid/
afraid of his  influence v/Ith the  American  delegates  to   ,the Race Congress.   The general opinion  ia  that  the  soonerthe elections  take  place  in Ireland  the  &quot;better,  and  thata speedy election would do  inuch to stabilize  the situation as most of the Republican Deputies are expected  to losotheir seats.     Labour troubles and  the increasing  number ofrobberies and  other outrages are  also a  matter of graveanxiety.  It is  suggested that disorderly  elements,  sucha3  Coraumnists and  other  extreme  revolutionaries fromthis country, are seizing the  opportunity  to  stir upstrife in Ireland,   A letter  passing between rauriceHealy, andlrish  Communist,  and Harry Pollitt, a  member  ofthe &quot;Inner Circle&quot;  of Conimuniets  and Red Labour  partjr,in  close touch  with Russia, says:          &quot;I have been making  coairades here for  the     past six  months inside the Sinn Fein  movement and     there has been good  work  done in this  country by     other oouirades,&quot; .     Everything  is  extremely quiet in the  Liverpoolarea and nothing of sufficient importance  to  note hasoccurred,     De Talora1s new paper  &quot;The Republic of Ireland&quot; isnot at present attracting much attention.     Maurice Frieze, Vice-President  of  the Connolly  Clnb.in Scotland persists in  his resignation, notwithstanding that he lias been asked  to withdraw  it pending the DublinArd Fheis.    Jack CSheehan has--.been offered the post of organising Secretary to  the Irish Race  Olympic Games which                               -J.J. V/alsh, one  of  the  M,P.s.  for Cork  City,  is  organising&quot;Walsh  is z. supporter of  the Treaty  and  his special business,at  the Paris  Conference  is  to  advocate  these  games  and arrange  the meeting for  the second  week in August next.Sinn Fein Headquarters  in Dublin are considering the                                               question/
question of a man to replace 0&apos;Sheehan.     Approval of the Treaty from the  I-ady  Hiberniansof Greenock, tho Irish labour Party of  Greanuck andthe Irish National Forestry Benefit Society  (West  ofScotland) shows that Sinn Fein by no  means speaks  forthe majority of the Irish in Scotland and  that, as inother places, opinion is divided on the  merits  of  theTreaty.
