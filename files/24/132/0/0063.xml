MEMORANDUM FOR CABINET.             Late in October,  1921,  and early In November 1921,  thebiiralty placed orders with Messrs. Eeardmore, Messrs.  John Brown.fssrs.  Swan Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson and The Fairfieid Shipbuild-jg Company for the construction of 4  Battle Cruisers.r             The Orders were provisional and final placing was de-mdent  upon execution of formal contracts, preparation of vhiohIs contingent upon settlement of certain technical details.j             The formal c ontracts would have contained a break,ause setting forth the terms under which the Admiralty had power cancel the contracts at any time.   No reference was  made in the!gotiat ions with the firms  to the possibility of  suspension of therk at  any time.             Provisional orders for  the gun mountings  for the fourips were plabed in August,  1921, and definite contracts for allI guns and armour were made in October.   No break clause waseluded in the armament orders, the circumstances being differentorn those for the ships .j             On 16th November, 1921, It was decided to suspendek on  the ships and. armament having  regard to the progress 6T the cussions at the Washington Conference and the firms were informed ord. ingly.             The firms have now become very anxious  to learn ther  the work is to be proceeded with at any future time or ther  the ships and armament are to  be regarded  as definitely celled.             The legal position as between the Admiralty and the ms due to the position reached is very uncertain and  the Admiralty  taking the advice of the  Treasury- Solicitor upon the patter.             In the meantime,  however, there can be no doubt that  it a hardship to the firms to leave them in their  present position uncertainty and that the  Admiralty  are incurring liability to an pown  extent to meet certain unproductive expenses during the period suspension, such as rent  of berths, etc.,  over  and  above any 4ms which may be rendered  if  and when the ships and armament are [nitely cancelled.             It has been ascertained by telegram from  Washington   Lord Lee anticipates that ratification by the U.S.A. Senate of. I Naval Agreement will take place in due course,  tut probably not lier  than two or three months from  the present  time .             If,  however,  It is already certain  that tho four ships  to be cancelled,  the Admiralty are of opinion  that it is desirable   the provisional contracts for those four ships should, he can-  .ed outright at once,  so  as to avoid increasing the liabilities  rred to above.     The early  selection of two of the  four firms,  i whom the orders  for hulls and machinery were  placed, r for orders  the  two battleships to be-built In lieu will enable  the Admiralty  legotiate a reduction of  the  claims from those  two.
           As  regards  Gun Mountings,  Guns and Armour, it will bedesirable,  if  possible,  to  combine any cancellation  of orders forthe  requirements  of  the  four ships with negotiations for supply ofthe  reduced requirements for  two ships .           In  the foregoing circumstances, the Admiralty seeks thedecision of the Cabinet  on  the  following questions:-1.          May it be assumed as certain, without waiting for the           ratification  of  the Washington agreement, that the           agreement will be ratified, and that the four Battle           Cruisers  can  consequently  be cancelled?   Failure of           the U.S.  Senate  to ratify would involve the removal           of  the suspension of the orders already placed.2.          If  so,  is there  any  objection to the Admiralty at once           cancelling  the orders for  the hulls and machinery of the           four ships  ?3.          As  regards  Gun Mountings, Guns and Armour, is there any           objection to.the Admiralty proceeding with negotiations           for the substitution of orders for the requirements of           the two smaller  ships, in place of the orders already           given  for requirements of  the four Battle Cruisers, on           the understanding that the details as to design and time           of  manufacture will not be determinable until a decision           has been  reached as to the design of the two smaller           ships,  and  as to the time when they are to belaid down ?
