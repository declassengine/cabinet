During the last three months the Washington Confere     on the question of disarmament and the Far East has     continued its Sessions9   A Treaty designed to maintain    peace in the Pacific has been signed by the representatives     of the British Empire, the United States, France and Japan     and awaits ratification.   while this Treaty replaces the    Anglo-Japanese Alliance I am happy to feel that the long-     standing concord between the two countries will remain as     cordial as ever under  the arrangements   thus concluded,  At     the same time our relations with the United States of     America enter upon a new and even closer phase of friendship,     2,   Agreement has also been reached on the question of dis-     armament and  (a^ a Treaty has been signed,                  (b) it is expected that a Treaty will shortly                                     be signed     providing a large measure of relief from the burden of     armaments.  In all these respects great result3 have been     attained;  and the success of the Conference, for which the     world will owe a deep  debt of gratitude to the initiative of     the United States Government, will be of the happiest     augury for the future  of International relations.     3.   The problem of securing the payment of reparations by     Germany  in the manner  most conformable to the general     interest engages the continuous  consideration of My Ministers     and  of our Allies.  The German Government at the request of     the Allies have themselves submitted proposals which are     now under  consideration.                                              /Discussions
