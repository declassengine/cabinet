[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1922SECRET.C.P-3649.CABINET.INDUSTRY AND THE  WEIGHT OF TAXATIONNOTE BY THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER.    I  desire  to  draw the  attention  of  my colleagues  to the  accompanyingmemorandum on Industry and the Weight of Taxation, which has been prepared bythe Board  of  Inland  Revenue  in  consultation  with  the  Board  of  customs and Excise.   It will be seen from the notes appended to the memorandum that theBoard of Trade are in general agreement with the conclusions arrived at.Treasury, S.W. 1, January 24, 1922.Memorandum  written by the Board of Inland Revenue in consultation with  the                        Board of Customs and Excise.    Taxpayers upon  whom the brunt  of  direct taxation falls are now callingloudly for relief.  The claim comes alike from the landowner, the man of business,the farmer, the employee, the professional man and the rentier, and alike from therich and from those in the middle ranges of income.  At the moment the cry is chieflyfor reduction of expenditure, but it is not unlikely that the note will change, and thecry become one for a readjustment of the burden of taxation.    2.  The general question of the readjustment of taxation, which is one of greatimportance and complexity, is not discussed here in its widest form; for instance,neither the justice nor the expediency of  the existing  scale of graduation of  theIncome Tax and Super-Tax as compared with possible alternative scales is discussed in detail.  The purpose of the present note is to review (a) the existing basis of direct taxation, and (b) the ultimate incidence of the increased indirect taxation of the war period, with particular reference to their effects upon industrial activity and nationalprosperity as a whole, and to draw therefrom conclusions as  to the expediency of immediate changes in  the relative weight of direct and indirect taxation.    3.  There is without question a very widespread opinion among business menthat the present weight of taxation is injurious to industry, and through industryinjurious  to the national  prosperity as a whole.  For instance, Mr. Alderman andSheriff H. J. de Courcy Moore, when entertaining a large company at &quot; breakfast &quot;in the Fishmongers&apos; Hall, in the City of London, on the 28th September, 1921, said :         &quot; The liverymen  of the  City of London were peculiarly fitted to lead and    influence public opinion, and it was to be regretted that at the present time they    did not bear a larger share in the counsels of the State.   In that event he was    sure their influence would be directed  to devising  some means for lifting the    heavy burden of direct taxation which was rapidly crushing out the commercialR. S. H.[7706]B
                     I. THE PRESENT ABNORMAL BURDENS.    5. In the first place, there  is hanging over industry the whole weight of the excess Profits Duty arrear.  It  is extremely difficult to estimate the amount of this   iarrear, but it seems probable that the net amount (after all repayments and reliefs)ultimately to be paid to and retained by the Exchequer will exceed  m200.   True,industry is not at the moment paying this debt, mainly because it is unable to do so,but this  fact only intensifies the burden.   In only  too many cases, the necessity ofredeeming the debt hangs as an incubus over all business thought.  In its effect uponthe mind, it is like a mortgage, fixed in amount,  upon assets constantly shrinking in money values.    6. The second burden is equally exceptional though its total weight is much lessoppressive   Under  the three years&apos; average system upon which  Income  Tax is assessed  upon the profits of trades and businesses, it must occur in a large number ofcases this Christmas, that the Income Tax payable in respect of the profits of a business so far  from representing the normal 6s.  in the pound! will swallow the whole, ormore than the whole, of the profits of the year of assessment.  Indeed, heavy charges of  Income Tax will&apos; often  be payable where heavy losses are at  the  time beingsustained.    7. These circumstances  arise directly from the abrupt  transition  from great  ;prosperity to general depression or, in a number of cases, to utter adversity, and itwould be useless to deny that for the moment the pressure upon industry of what may  Inot unfairly be called arrears of taxation is grave.    Some partial relief will  be given by the proposals which have been approved bythe Chancellor  for the funding of some part of the Excess Profits Duty arrears.    8. It must be pointed out, however, that these  present disabilities, great as tbe\are, are transient, and  at root  they can  only be remedied by heroic measures of  :transient kind.*  For example, if it were possible to abandon the system of assessment  1on the three years&apos; average in favour of a system of assessment on current profits, amto  remit a large part of the Excess Profits Duty arrears,  making corresponding  Irepayments to  businesses which have  paid the  whole of their  duty, the wholecomplexion of the case would be changed.   Although, of course, nobody would suggest  Ithat in the present condition of the  Exchequer heroic measures of that kind could be  Icontemplated, the transitory character of the present situation seems to need special   *The assumption on which this note is written is broadly that the Budget must be balanced, andthat it cannot be balanced during the next few years if taxation is reduced.     life of the trading and manufacturing community ....   Manufacturing and     trading interests were depressed and borne down by the weight of taxation ....     It was urged that there should be (1) relief of Income Tax, (2) abolition of useless     places and sinecures, and (3) rigid economy in every  public Department.  That     need existed to-day,  for those who knew business could not  fail to realise the     grinding nature of existing taxation.  It stifled enterprise, drove capital from     the country,  and  made  the  life  of  the  manufacturer  and  trader almost     intolerable.&quot;  (&quot; Daily  Telegraph,&quot; September 29, 1921.)     This view is widely supported by the press, e.g.:         &quot;The present  system of taxation is stifling industry.&quot;  (&quot;Financier and     Bullionist,&quot;  September 29, 1921.)  And again,  &quot;High taxation is strangling     industry  ....   This high taxation has to be added to the cost of everything     produced, and helps with dear coal and the collapsed  foreign&apos; exchanges to  drive     British goods from foreign markets.&quot;  (&quot; Daily Mail,&quot; September 29, 1921.)     4. These charges, while they naturally tend to be overstated, have, at the presenttime, a  measure of justification, though the basis of their partial  truth is  often not clearly apprehended.  At a moment when industry is endeavouring to keep itself afloatin the midst of an unparalleled depression, it finds itself subject,  not merely to thenormal duties, which on the basis of existing law it must expect continuously to  bear,but to two very great and exceptional burdens in addition.
emphasis.  Some small adjustment of the permanent basis of taxation would do verylittle to relieve  the present anxieties of  industry, while, in  the future as a whole, itmight be  found to  involve  altogether  disproportionate  embarrassment  to  theExchequer. *     9. In these circumstances it seems to the Board to be right, when considering the expediency of some limited adjustment of the permanent basis  of  taxation, to payregard not to the momentary embarrassment of industry on account of  arrears of taxes and depression of trade, but to the weight of taxation as it will fall upon tradeso soon as the unparalleled conditions of the present have passed away.  It is to thisquestion that the remaining paragraphs of this memorandum are directed.     10.  The point at issue is whether the present system of taxation in the UnitedKingdom  will, on the restoration of reasonably normal  conditions, clog  the wheelsof industry  and thereby reduce  the net aggregate of  goods  and services which is available for the economic welfare of the nation as a whole.  From the revenue pointof view,  the matter can only be considered upon the hypothesis that  every economy in expenditure  will be made, and that the State is faced, with the necessity of raising bytaxation a given amount of revenue, not materially different from the normal produce of existingtaxes at present rates.  The crux of the question is therefore to be  foundin the comparative effects of the different taxes now in force, and  the possibility ofnational advantage if changes are made in their relative weights, or if new taxes aresubstituted for old.   *                             11. Existing Taxation.     11.  Taxation is usually classified under two main heads direct and indirect. Clear definition of these two  kinds of  taxes is a matter of  difficulty,  but, broadly speaking,  direct taxes  may be described  as those of which the taxpayer is also the taxbearer, at least in the intention of the  legislature.  Indirect taxes, vice versa, are those of which the  taxpayer is not the ultimate taxbearer, or is not intended to be. The  difference  between the  two  classes is  therefore dependent  upon  the  intended incidence.     12.  In  the United Kingdom, the line  of division between direct  and  indirect taxes is broadly marked  by the provinces of  the  departments entrusted  with tax administration.  Customs and Excise taxes are mainly indirect,  and Inland  Eevenue taxes are  mainly direct.   In  both categories exceptions are to be found,  e.g., the Entertainments Duty  should perhaps be treated as a direct tax,  and some  of the Stamp Duties are certainly indirect taxes.     13. In 1920-21, the total revenue amounted to   ml,426, to which   ml,032 was drawn  from taxation.   The balance,  consisting  mainly  of interest on  loans  and capital transactions, does not affect industry for the present purpose.  Omitting  m7 received in respect of  Motor Vehicle Duties (as more than this sum was  paid to the Road Improvement Fund), there remains  ml,025,  which was collected as to  m691 by the Inland Revenue Department and as  to the balance of  m334 by the  Customs and  Excise  Department.    *  At first sight it may appear that the severity of the burden of the moment could be considerablymitigated if assessment on the preceding year basis were substituted for the three years&apos; average.  Ifthis were done retrospectively for the current year, the effect on industry as a whole and on theExchequer would be negligible, for the total assessments for 192.1-22 approximate to the total profits made  in 1920-21.  Its sole effect would be to give relief to concerns which did badly in 1920-21 atthe expense of concerns which did moderately well in that year.  If the change were made in the nextbudget, to come into force for 1922-23, it would cost the Exchequer some 45m40, and thus destroy any prospect of balancing that year&apos;s accounts.  Either of  these courses would moreover only touch thefringe  of the problem.  The embarrassment of business  lies in the discrepancy between assessments in1921-22 and profits in the same year, and a change from the three years&apos; average to a preceding yearbasis would not at the moment give industry any material help.  To give relief on the current yearbasis retrospectively  for 1921-22 would cost  the Exchequer  nearly 450)50, and it would almost inevitably have to be continued for the following year,  1922-23, when it would cost perhaps another45m30.  Finally, a remedy which deals only with  the abnormal  operation of the Income Tax in aperiod of trade depression without diminishing the debt of the Excess Profits  Duty  arrears is verypartial and is unlikely to strike the imagination of business men or to provide any substantial relief to their difficulties       [7706]                                                           B 2
       III. EFFECTS UPON INDUSTRY OF EXISTING DIRECT TAXES.14.  The  m691 of Inland  Revenue duties  was made up as follows :     Estate Duty    Succession Duty    Legacy  Duty    Corporation Duty    Total Death Duties ...Land TaxHouse DutyLand Values DutiesCompanies&apos;   Capital  DutyCheque DutyTransfersConveyancesReceiptsMarine PoliciesBills of ExchangeOther Stamp Duties    Total Stamp DutiesIncome TaxSuper-TaxCorporation Profits TaxExcess Profits Duty                         Grand    15. Excess Profits Duty has now been repealed, so that in a general discussion  1of the effect of taxation upon  industry its effects need not be examined.   As the  IExcess Profits Duty constituted a deduction  in computing Income Tax profits, theamount of Income Tax and Super-Tax above  ( m339 and  m55) should be regardedfor the present purpose as increased by the amount of Income Tax and  Super-tax on the Excess Profits Duty so  deducted.   This would increase the Income  Tax by m.80  and  the  Super-Tax by  mlO,  and  thus alter the  total Inland Revenue to m562*  ( m691  less  m219  Excess Profits Duty, plus   m90,  Income Tax  andSuper-Tax).                              (A.) Death Duties.    16. Little needs to be said of the Death  Duties.  The Estate Duty is levied on   ;the occasion of the passing of property by death.  The influence of its weight on the   Isaving of wealth, whether the  fruits of industrial  effort or otherwise, is extremelydifficult to  determine.    Generally speaking, it is not considered that the influences which stimulate mento  accumulate  large fortunes during their lives  are materially affected by thepayment of taxation after their death. The recipients of wealth passing on a death,whether  that wealth has been subjected to Estate Duty  or the  other death duties(Succession Duty and Legacy Duty) are not likely to reduce their industrial activitiesjust because they have received less than would have been the  case in the absence ofsuch taxation.  Indeed, if the taxation has any influence on their action, it is likelyto be a beneficial one, stimulating rather  than slackening their  pursuit of wealth.There is, however, the further question  whether the payment of Death Duty  (at ahigh  rate)  on the occasion of the death of a single owner of a large business may not seriously  impair the  financial resources  of the  successor  by  whom it  is  to becarried on. This point, while it has some validity,  is subject to important qualifica-tions. The number of large private businesses so  held is  comparatively small; theowners of  most of  them as has been established on a recent statistical analysis     * Though the yield of Inland Eevenue duties for  1920-21 thus adjusted to eliminate the ExcessProfits Duty, is taken in this note as a basis for judging the weight of  taxation on industry, it isthought, though the matter is  somewhat conjectural, that the probable normal yield of future years ismore likely to be in the neighbourhood of  m500.      6,037,000 3,475,000 3,747,000 6,077,000 1,330,000   906,000 1,800,000 3,219,00026,591,000     41,229,000 1,210,000 5,250,000    4Cf,00047,729,000   650,000 1,900,000    20,000)tal 26,591,000338,865,000 55,281,000    650,000219,181,000690,867,000
                                       ;)usually possess in addition a considerable volume of other wealth out of which the death Duty can be paid without trenching upon the business capital.   In the rarecases where such businesses pass on death on two or more occasions at short intervals of time, the difficulty referred to would indeed be gravely accentuated;  but in suchcases the law provides for a mitigation of the burden of duty normally imposed.       (B.) Land Tax, Inhabited House Duty and Mineral Rights Duty.     17.  These taxes are not of sufficient weight to call for detailed  analysis here.                              (C.)  Stamp Duties.     18.  Of the Stamp Duties, those on Companies&apos; Capital,  on Cheques, on MarineInsurance Policies and on  Bills  of Exchange  are indirect taxes affecting industry.While they have been long established, and their incidence is thus well settled, therates of duty (with the exception of the rates on Bills of Exchange) have been raised in the last year or so.  Their approximate normal future yield may be about  m8to  mlO annually, so that they  are not negligible.   On the other  hand, they areshifted  to the great  body of consumers, and  their distributed  weight on  any individual consumer is very small.   Their main drawback is the impediment theyoffer to industrial and commercial transactions with its accompanying possibility of friction and annoyance to those who pay them in the first place.  Companies&apos; CapitalDuty should perhaps be specially noted as a duty which, on the one hand, does nottend to be passed on to the consumer, and, on the other hand, by reason of its recentquadruplication,  does  no doubt discourage  reconstructions  and   other  financialoperations in industry.  If the revenue could be spared, or raised  by other means,there would, it is thought, be much to be said for sweeping away those stamp duties which particularly  affect  business  operations, e.g.,  the stamp duty  on bills ofexchange, on cheques  and on receipts,  and,  in particular, now that a specific tax(the Corporation Profits Tax) is imposed on the profits of limited liability companies,the Companies&apos; Capital Duty.   But in existing conditions,  of course, these taxesmust remain.                        (D.) Income Tax and Super-Tax.     19. The greatest Inland Revenue tax  is the Income Tax and Super-Tax.   Itsyield is  so  huge now estimated at   m.385  for the current year 1921-22 and individual taxpayers are so numerous, that  it has become the type and symbol ofBritish taxation.     20. The income on which tax is paid arises at many sources.  Excluding the yield which is derived from the rent or annual value of lands,  buildings, &amp;c, fromthe profits of farming, the interest on public debts (of foreign States and Dominions,as well  as of  the United Kingdom), from Dominion  and foreign  dividends, fromsalaries,   wages,  and professional  earnings,  and from bank deposit1 and otherinterest,  it may be roughly said that the net amount  of Income Tax (Schedule D)(excluding Super-Tax) drawn from the profits of manufactures, trades, &amp;c, amountsfor 1920-21 to about  m230 out of  the  m419 ( m339 plus  m80)  shown in para-graph 15.  The lower future level of industrial profits now anticipated would reducethis figure to, say,   ml50, during the next few years.  It is this figure which hasto be considered in relation to industry.     21. The persons carrying on industry fall into the following classes, viz. :          (a.)  Public joint stock  companies.         (&amp;.)&quot;&apos; Private joint stock  companies.         (c.)  Individuals, either  trading on their own sole account or in partnership.         (d.)  Local authorities.     The effect of taxation must be considered separately for the first three classes. The  fourth class,  local authorities \e.gv  municipal  and other councils) may be ignored,  as their industrial  activities  are mainly concerned with public  utility undertakings, such as gas and water works, &amp;c, which now  barely yield a moderatereturn on their capital invested.  The foundation of their existence is  co-operativesupply;   the  demand for  their   products and services is normally limited  by  thepopulation of the area administered by the local authority; and the basis of&quot;their charges is cost of production, plus the service of the local  debt incurred  for theirestablishment.   The normal  characteristics  of  ordinary   industry competition,desire for large profits, wide markets,  &amp;c. are not present.
     22. The  preponderant part of industrial activities in the United Kingdom is carried on by joint stock companies.  For instance, in 1919-20 nearly 68 per cent. of the Industrial Income Tax profits assessed under Schedule D was earned by joint stock  companies;  again,  the Board estimated in April 1920 that 77 per cent,  of the Excess Profits Duty assessed was drawn from the like source.     23. These companies are either public companies  or private ones.  Public joint stock  companies are those in which public ownership of shares is normally widely distributed,  whereas private joint stock companies usually comprise a few  share- holders only.-   No exact information  is available from direct  sources  as  to  the proportions  in  which the total Income  Tax profits of joint stock  companies  are attributable  to  public and private companies respectively, but it may be deduced with some confidence from the available data that some  55  per  cent, of the total profits of  all  industry is earned by the businesses of public joint stock companies. Public Joint  Stock Companies.     24. The  profits of these  companies do not include the salaries,  fees  and commissions paid to directors, managers and all the officials  of the company.   The managing spirits of these companies do not bear the tax on the profits of the company, except in  so far as they bear tax on the dividends arising from their personal share- holdings.  Apart from this point (normally not a  major one) they are assessed only in respect of their remuneration as employees of the company.  It  cannot be reasonably contended that  they diminish their work and activities on  behalf of the company because of the tax that the company bears on its profits, or even because they receive some proportion of that profit as dividends.  Their chief  interest and  anxiety is to earn profits as large as possible to maintain  or increase  dividends  and internal reserves, and so far as they receive commission on profits (a  very common practice)  to increase their personal  earnings.     25. Passing  from the question of salaries of  officials to that of the  profits of&apos; the business itself, it will be  recalled that the bulk of the profits made are distributed as dividends  to the shareholders, or as interest on the company&apos;s indebtedness, and from such interest and  dividends (directly or indirectly) Income Tax is deducted at the  full standard rate.  Thus,  the Income Tax which  is paid by a company on that part  of  its profits which is distributed in interest and dividends is  not borne by the company at all.     Each individual recipient  of interest or  dividend is liable to have the  tax so suffered by him  increased (by  the addition  of  Super-Tax)  if his income exceeds  2.000, or in the contrary event is entitled  to have  it reduced (by repayment)  by reference  to the  amount of his own personal income and the effective rate of Income Tax thereon.     .26. The  enterprise of the company itself is not affected by the weight of income taxation,  except  only so far as the profits made are retained in the business as reserves.   In 1919-20 the Board estimated that the  total undistributed  profits of all joint  stock  companies (of which the larger part related to  public companies) amounted to  some  ml63.   Income Tax is paid thereon at 6s.  in the  ,  amounting to  m48, and the expansion of  industry is undoubtedly affected.  This point, which is an important one, is discussed further in paragraph 37 below.  For the moment, it is sufficient to point  out  that  the question of taxation hindering the expansion of industry is a totally different question from that of taxation throttling industry, for the latter implies the death of industry, while the former means only  a reduced rate of expansion.     Moreover,  the widespread practice of  joint stock companies  in  retaining undistributed profits is  a means of national  saving which is constantly overlooked. Industry provides in this mariner a good deal of  its own needs for additional capital and does  it internally, apart from the volition of its shareholders. Private Joint Stock Companies and Individuals  and Firms.     27. Private joint stock  companies are to all intents and purposes partnerships with limited liability.   Their Income Tax profits (like those of  public joint stock companies) are computed after deduction of the  salaries, fees, &amp;c, paid to their working  proprietors.   On  the other hand,  in  their case, the bulk  of  the  profits assessed accrue to a small number of shareholders, who in most cases actively carry on  the business.   They may  be reasonably  considered  together  with  private&apos;
 individuals  and firms, subject to the one exception that undistributed profits* of private joint stock  companies are not income in the hands of the shareholders, and thus do not swell the total income of  individuals for purposes of either Income Tax or Super-Tax.     28.  In the case of individual concerns and  private companies  (excluding  from review the undistributed reserves of the latter), the Income Tax and Super-Tax are personal  taxes.  The  persons affected feel the weight of taxation,  but that weight varies from individual to  individual according to his total income, the  nature of the income, and his family responsibilities.  The question is, whether that varied taxation checks enterprise.   A strict economic analysis  would point out that the so-called profits of business  thus carried on consist, generally speaking,  of three  elements, viz. : (1) the gilt-edged rate of interest on the capital invested; (2) the  remuneration for the  individuals  time  and  business  ability  or management;  and  (3)  the remuneration for risk of the capital adventured.     29.  In theory,  the weight of  taxation  as it affects the first two ^elements  is of no great  importance,  for  the transfer of the capital to any other investment would involve the same liability to tax so far as the gilt-edged  interest  is involved,  and entrance  on  a  salaried  post instead  of independent  business  with  an  equal remuneration  for business ability  would not  diminish  the tax applicable to that element of profits.     In theory, therefore, attention must chiefly be directed to the effect of high income taxation on the third  element, viz., the remuneration for risk.  As  tax falls on that remuneration,  it diminishes the net yield in respect of risk,  and therefore it tends to  increase  the gross remuneration  which  the taxpayer  requires  before  he adventures further  business capital.   But in practice a  private  trader  does not analyse his profit into its various elements.  He looks at the matter  from a  practical point of view, and  if he  feels that the weight of  taxation makes a new adventure not worth while, he decides not to undertake it.     30.  It becomes desirable,  therefore, to consider  in what class  of cases this deterrent effect is likely to be realised.  Take in the  first  place the case of a man who draws his entire  income from a  business of  his own, which yields him between  500 and  2,000 a year,  a range of income  which covers a  large  section of those engaged  in  private industry or  trade.    Direct taxation of such incomes is not extremely heavy, for it is  always less and often very much less than 25 per cent, of the total.    Then again,  under the  present  scheme of income taxation,! the net benefit to such a trader of a given increase in income is the same whatever his  total income provided that the  latter is not brought over  2,000 a year,  the point where Super-Tax begins.  Thus the net benefit to him of an increase in income of  500 a year will be   365 a year, whether  his previous income was, say,.   800 or  1,200. In this range of income, moreover, the last pounds of income tend to be of very great utility, inaslnuch as they  often represent  a free spendable margin above  existing commitments.    For these reasons it is difficult to believe  that in these  medium ranges of income the  existing rate of Income Tax is a serious deterrent to private business enterprise.     31.  The case of a very rich business man is different.  The greater the income the smaller is the utility which attaches to  an increase of income, and, at  the same time, owing to  the effect of the present method of Super-Tax graduation, the greater is the percentage of that  increase which is taken by the State.   When a very rich man comes to consider, on the one hand, that if he adventures capital in enterprise, he  will retain only perhaps  one-half of his profits, and, on the other,  that he must take the  risk of depreciation, or even total loss, of his capital, he may well  regard a high rate of  taxation as a deterrent from adventure.  But although this may be the case, it must not be  forgotten that high taxation  is not the only consideration which may deter a wealthy man from taking trade risks.  The free moneys of such persons largely arise from a surplus  of income over the  amount needed to  satisfy  all their desires, and,  therefore, quite apart from considerations of high taxation, they have little incentive to expand  their income by adventure.    -These undistributed profits bear Income&apos; Tax but no  Super-Tax.   On the other hand, the totalprofits of an individual or partnership trader form part of his total income, whether he puts  them back into his business or not.  He must bear Super-Tax upon the whole of those profits, if his total income reaches the necessary point of liability.  This fact gives an illogical advantage, tempered only by theCorporation Profits Tax,  to these companies, and the Chancellor has asked  to have remedial proposalslaid before him for his consideration in this connection.    I Allowances for children, &amp;c, are ignored here.
b    82. Incidentally, it must be borne in mind in considering the case of the verywealthy that not more than 1,500 persons pay Income  Tax and Super-Tax at  therate of 12s. in the pound on even a small section of  their  income, though  it  issurprising to find how many persons are in the habit of speaking as if the taxation on the whole of their income reached that figure  or something  approaching it.  Theaggregate amount of income which is both taxed at the highest rates and also avail-able for employment in business enterprise is limited.    33. There remains the considerable body of  business men  whose incomes range,say, from  2,000 to  20,000 a year,  and are therefore liable to taxation on anyincrements of income, at rates rising from 7s. Qd. to 11s.  in the  .  As to these, itcan only be said that it  would be quite unwarrantable to assume that as the rate of income&apos; Tax on possible profits becomes heavier, business enterprise of the morespeculative kind is proportionately discouraged.  Much depends on the circumstancesof the individual concerned and on his particular character and disposition.Risk in Industry.    34. As  a  matter  of  fact, the great risks  in industry (for example, in goldmining), are normally taken by public joint stock companies, where the bulk of  thecapital at stake belongs to  a large number of shareholders (among  whom very richshareholders are proportionately few) and not to the few directing adventurers atthe helm.     The number  of very rich men who engage in  private enterprise isdistinctly  limited, and the validity of the view that taxation appreciably  diminishesrisky  profit-bearing enterprise on their part is correspondingly restricted.  So  faras concerns the exceedingly large number of  comparatively small men who engage in private trade, the  risks  they normally take are small risks rather than great risks,and in their case the weight of taxation  is but a  small deterrent from adventure.The Private Investor.    35. Turning now to the possible investor with money at  his disposal, whether his income falls  within the medium or  the higher ranges, the problem before him is whether to spend the money or to invest it, and  if the  latter,  whether to invest in industry or otherwise. As regards the primary question of spending or saving,  his decision will tend to be influenced by  the general circumstances in which he findshimself, e.g., his total capital accumulation,  his present  income, his family, the timewhen  he hopes to retire, and the other general causes which govern saving, ratherthan by the particular weight of the taxation attaching to  his total income at  thetime of his decision.  Whether he will invest in industry or something in the natureof a Government stock will depend largely on the return that he anticipates as  theresult of business enterprise.   A competent  business man is likely to secure a grossreturn of, say, 15 per cent., assuming a moderate risk only to  be involved.  The  netreturn after payment of Income  Tax, on every   100 of  capital, will be  15,  less 4 10s., i.e.,   10 10s. net.  On  the other hand, the net return from Governmentstock, &amp;c, is likely to be only  4 4s. ( 6 interest, less  1 16s.  tax).   The advantageof personal industrial  use of  free  capital will always given average businessability exceed that of any other use.  But it is recognised that even in  such caseshigh taxation may  deter a man from pushing the employment of his capital to its maximum intensity.    36. If a taxpayer has no available capital,  he may consider the expediency of borrowing in order to invest in industrial enterprise.   In that case, his decision islikely  to depend upon the  relation between the  net return after taxation  and  theamount of risk involved.   The considerations already indicated as to the deterrenteffects of  taxation then become applicable.Income Taxation and Savings.    37. Taxes the share taken by the State for the maintenance of national activi-ties, which are by hypothesis necessary activities must  come out of the capacity forsaving, which Dr. Gustav  Cassel defines as     The surplus of the produce &quot;of a society over and  above  the necessaries which        such a society  must consume  in order to maintain its actual standard of        efficiency.   (&quot;Nature and Necessity of Interest.&quot;)At no time is this capacity for saving  fully utilised, for luxurious spending consti-tutes  a considerable drain upon  it, and even to-day, the daily press and  commonobservation afford evidence of the persistence of this feature,, notwithstanding  the
                                       9 weight of taxation.  The limits of possible expansion of industry are fixed (a) by the magnitude of &apos;the capacity for saving, and so far it is a truism that taxation curtails those limits in the absolute magnitude of the amount at any moment avail- able to. the private investor, and (b) by the disinclination to invest even that lesser amount owing to the diminished future return from it.  But on the other hand, high income taxation does not always act in this direction, for it sets up a counter-current, for by diminishing personal spending power  it inevitably stimulates a large number of individuals to new or greater earning activities in order that they  may not lose their present  and prospective standards of living and saving.  This  counter-current is probably very strong in the medium ranges of income and less strong in the highest ranges. Possible Adjustments of Burden within the  Income Tax Area.     38. It is  not, of course, suggested that this necessary relation between taxation and savings is conclusive on the question whether the incidence of existing taxation is the most favourable one for  fostering savings.  Hence the  question  still remains whether the existing graduation of the Income Tax and  Super-Tax as  it falls upon incomes above the level of subsistence could advantageously be altered. For example, it is conceivable that  national saving  might be fostered it the  weight of taxation on incomes between, say,   500  per annum and, say,  1,500 per annum, and also upon the highest  incomes,  were somewhat  reduced  and  the  balance made good by an increase of the rates  of taxation falling on the intervening region.  But  any such proposal lies  at  present outside  the  range of practical politics,  and need not be argued here. Summary.     39. An endeavour has been made to show how  the present taxation of income would affect industry  in normal conditions, i.e., apart from  the abnormal burdens imposed to-day by  the arrears  of Excess Profits Duties and by  the  working of the three years&apos; average,  and it may be desirable to summarise the conclusions reached. The Income Tax levied on the profits of public joint stock companies limits the expansion of  industry, but only so fas as the tax is charged upon the part of the profits put to  reserve.  Similarly, the Income Tax levied on the profits  of businesses carried on by  individuals, firms, and private joint stock companies  limits the expan- sion of industry,  but only in so  far as it deters traders from undertaking new enter- prise by reducing the net return on the capital employed.   But amongst the exceed- ingly numerous  incomes in the middle range,  this deterrent effect is not large, and tends to be outweighed by the marginal utility of an increased income; it  is chiefly operative in the comparatively rare but much advertised instances of  very wealthy business men.  For the rest, the argument comes back to this.  Taxation  eats into savings and so reduces the  stream of wealth  available  for  conversion  into  new capital. It thus hinders the expansion of trade. But, true as this is, the argument does not apply only or peculiarly to taxation of industry; it  is of equal weight as regards the taxation  of personal earnings, of wages, and of the income from all other kinds of investment, including British-owned investments  in industry carried on abroad.     40. These conclusions would not, of course, be valid in all circumstances.   The question is one of  degree, and  if the rates of  Income Tax, instead  of  standing at their present  figure,  had been, say, 50 per cent, higher  throughout the scale, the Board would  not have hesitated to submit that at all costs an  escape  from that position must be found.  But  after  the closest enquiry  and consideration of the actual curtailment of opportunity, and the actual deterrent to action, as distinct from vague and generalised allegations, the Board are not prepared to admit that under existing conditions, apart  from the question of arrears  of  taxation  from  more prosperous times, the  disadvantages of the present rates are really greater  than has been indicated.Income Tax, Prices and Trade Depression.   &apos;41. In view  of the statements  persistently made  that  the  present industrialstagnation is directly due to strangling.taxation, it may be well to add an observationon the effect of Income Tax upon prices.  It  is urged, directly or indirectly, that alightening of  taxation will go  far to remove the present conditions of trade; that prices are high becarsp taxes are high; and that high taxes are added to high prices       [77067         &apos;                                                  C
with the result that British goods cannot compete with foreign goods simply becauseof the higher taxation in the United Kingdom.  A brief review of world conditions,which need not be attempted here, would show the shallowness of these views.  Apartfrom the special circumstances affecting direct  taxation at the moment, which are discussed above, Income Tax has no effect on the amount of profits (before taxation)secured by any trader, nor on the price at which  he can sell his goods under ordinarycompetitive conditions.  It is accepted by all economists that a general Income tax on  profits cannot  under normal  conditions be  shifted.   Profits are the differencebetween receipts (the price of the sale of goods) and expenses. Prices are determinedby forces quite independent of, and exclusive of,  taxation.   In a seller&apos;s market, suchas existed during  the war, the seller fixes his price at the highest point he can get,and whatever the amount of an Income Tax, he obviously cannot get more than thehighest price a buyer will bid.  The effect of high taxation then was only to make theseller more zealous and persistent in his search for the highest price the market would stand.   To-day, in a  buyer&apos;s market, stocks manufactured at high costs (excludingtaxation, for it is  not a cost), are so heavy that  their holders are extremely anxiousto get rid of them.  To do so they will not hold out for prices which they imaginewill cover Income  Tax.  If that  were the case,  it would  be difficult to explain the extraordinary  fall in prices during  the  past nineteen  months (the Statist index number of wholesale prices has fallen from 266 in April 1920 to 138 in October 1921),and the reductions in  profit,  or actual losses, which have accompanied this movement.Finally,  in. a normal  market which is neither a seller&apos;s nor a buyer&apos;s and  with  a graduated Income Tax payable almost entirely  by reference to  the total income ofan individual, Income Tax is only determinable after profit has been made, and also,for most profits, after they have been distributed to hundreds of  thousands of share-holders.  It is a common delusion of business men that they can  and do add IncomeTax to their costs, but on examination it invariably appears that it is not in fact done,on any recognised costing principles.                         (E.)  Corporation Profits Tax.    42.  To complete  the review of direct taxation, there  remains for  consideration the Corporation Profits Tax.  It is laid upon the total income of all limited liabilitycompanies, at the rate of Is,, in the pound, subject to a maximum of 2s. in the poundon tire total income less the total interest paid upon permanent loans.  It is, therefore,the one tax in the British system of taxation which is specifically and truly a taxupon industry.  Its yield for  1921-22 was estimated at   m30, although owing tothe trade depression  and administrative  difficulties that figure is not likely to berealised.  With industry languishing,  the  tax  no  doubt does  press  upon thepreponderant part of industry, viz., that part which is  in the hands of  limited liability companies.   Its justification was based on the privilege of limited liabilityaccorded by the State, and also upon the freedom  of such companies&apos; reserves  fromthe burden  of Super-Tax.   If industry has a real claim for some relief  from taxation, founded  not upon a selfish claim for its individual interest, but upon the wider ground that such relief would be of benefit to the nation as a whole, it is hereperhaps that a beginning should be made.   In the absence of full information  as tothe amount of the  undistributed reserves of limited liability companies out of whichthe tax  will tend to be paid, it is difficult to pronounce upon this question.  inasmuch as the tax is laid mainly upon net profits of business, the principles enunciated above as respects the impossibility of including Income Tax in price would probably apply in very large measure, and  particularly at such a time as the present, to this tax.Price here, as  there, will  tend  to be determined by the marginal producer who  is making  no profits and paying no tax.  Moreover,  as  there is a considerable  volumeof trade carried on by persons other than limited liability companies, there will in a normal market often be such competitive conditions as will tend to leave the incidence of the tax finally where it is placed, i.e., upon the limited companies paying it.    43.  Perhaps economic principles, however, should not constitute the sole and finaltest.  So far as the private limited liability companies  are concerned, there is themore subtle ground of psychology, where the working proprietors of such companies,in the conviction that taxation really makes things not worth  while, may persuadethemselves into a restriction of their business activities, by reason of this special tax on their industry.  If the state of the national finances permitted, and if the CompanyLaw difficulties involved could be overcome, it might be wise to confine the CorporationProfits  Tax to  the  public limited companies.
                  (F.) Taxation and the Service of the Debt.    44.  One  further  aspect  of the weight  of direct  taxation  upon  industry  is constantly overlooked.  That is the effect of taxation for the service and redemptionof the internal debt.   In  1921-22 the budget provision for interest on debt amountsto  m345, which exceeds one-third of the total taxation imposed.  In January 1920,when the war debt (excluding Savings Certificates, Treasury Bills, Ways and  MeansAdvances and other debt) amounted to  some   m3,900, the Board estimated for thepurposes of enquiry by the Select Committee on the Increase of Wealth (War) thatthe holdings of joint stock companies were about  mJ,300, or one-third of the total.In addition,  some considerable  proportion of the interest on Treasury  Bills  waspayable to these companies, either banks  or trading companies.  It has been estimated in paragraph 20, that out of a total normal  revenue of say  m900 millions, some ml50 of income taxation, i.e., one-sixth, will be paid by industry as a whole  duringthe next few years.  When industry protests so loudly against the burden of direct taxation, it is only too apt to take account of the  debit side (say  ml50 Income tax and  m25 Corporation Profits Tax), and to forget that there is a substantial credit(say upwards of  m50 for joint stock industry alone) to be set off against the taxpaid.   This view of course treats industry as one unit, and is not applicable to the complaint of one trader, who holds  no  war stocks (either because he did  not investor because he is just  starting in business), against taxation levied in  order  to payinterest on the war stocks held by another trader.  Throughout the popular discussionof this question there is a tendency to treat taxation for the service of debt as  thoughit were finally abstracted from production and so depleted saving power, whereas itactually returns to the community as war loan repayment and interest, and  thoughredistributed, is available  for the service of industrial capital requirements in the mass.                           IV.-INDIRECT TAXATION.                      The Shifting of Indirect Taxation.    45.  Indirect taxation in. the United Kingdom, taking it  as mainly represented by the taxes collected by the  Customs and Excise Department, amounted in 1920-21to  m334.  An approximate  classification of this revenue shows that:          60 per cent, was in  respect of liquor.         17     ,,         ,,      ,,       tobacco.          3^    ,,         ,,      ,,       entertainments.         15              .,      ,,       food.          4^    ,,         ,,      ,,       other items, including manufac-                                            tured articles.     46. Indirect taxes, as explained above, are those of which the burden, althoughlaid in the first instance upon some defined person, is not expected to  remain there.The expectation and, indeed, the intention of the legislature  is that the person firstcharged shall pass on the tax to other persons,  Where this&apos; expectation is satisfied,the defined person who first  pays the tax has no grievance against it.  He includes the amount of the tax in his price for the article or service, to  which the tax isattached, when he sells that  article or  service.  He also normally includes a chargein  respect of the use of  the  money which he has laid out in payment of the tax,and also, in many cases, a profit on the  tax so paid, as remuneration for his services.     47. The business man might argue that, so  far as the burden of indirect taxa-tion cuts down the purchasing power of consumers, the vendor of articles or  servicesso taxed is pro tanto damnified, or,  alternatively, if the purchaser buys just as muchof  the  taxed  article  as before,  other business men may claim  that  the  power  topurchase the untaxed articles they themselves sell has been reduced.   This con ten -tion would be valid, if it could be assumed that the abolition  of indirect taxes couldbe carried out by the State without  recourse to direct taxation.  This assumption is,however, barred by the  hypothesis above, namely, that the State needs to  raise adefinite sum.    Particular  industries  may  be damnified in  comparison with one another in this regard, but that does not appear  to be relevant to the question under examination, i.e., the effect of taxation on industry as a whole.     48. There is little doubt that the indirect taxes are shifted in  the first instance,as intended, to the consumer.  Grave doubts may, however, arise whether the viewthat indirect taxation is ultimately all shifted to the consumer  is true, in the abnormal
circumstances of the post-armistice period.  These doubts concern the wage-earningclasses, who constitute the bulk of the population, and who, it may be presumed, bearor are intended to bear the greater  part of indirect taxation.    This matter  isexamined in. the following paragraphs.  For the reasons  there explained, the Boardincline to the view that,  broadly speaking and subject  to  some  qualifications asregards the present period of abnormal trade depression, much of  the increases inindirect taxation which have been imposed since the outbreak of war, and any whichmight be imposed now, have been and will tend to be largely thrown back on to thestream of production as far as they first fall upon the wage-earning classes.                      Wage Earners and Indirect Taxation.    49.  The share of  the national dividend  taken  by  the  wage-earning classesdepends  upon many factors, but within  certain margins the  wages paid to labour are indeterminate.   Where wage agreements and settlements  are  negotiated bystrong combinations representing, on  the one hand, employers&apos; federations,  and, onthe other hand, labour unions, as, in fact, is the case in the main industries of theUnited Kingdom,  the  exact shares in which the excess of  earnings over expensesother than  labour disputes   is divided between capital  and labour,  between employers andemployed, is a matter of bargaining.  The limits within  which this bargaining may take place in anv industry are largely determined  by general economic factors, such.as the supply of capital  and business ability, and  the  remuneration of labour  inother industries, but the difference between the upper and lower limits so set is wide enough to permit of the influence of other considerations.  Among these considera-tions a prominent place must be given to the conception of a living wage.  -     50.  It  is an accepted conclusion based on the experience of the past,  that  inperiods of rising prices, rates of wages tend to rise after, and not before or concur-rently with, the rise in prices.  Since the outbreak of the war, prices have risen yearby year,  but there  is good  reason to believe that rates of wages rose as a consequenceof,  and  subsequent to,  such increases in  prices.   Not until about  the  time of thearmistice did the  increase in average rates  of wages catch  up with the  increase  inthe cost of living as measured by the Ministry of Labour index.     So far  as a general statement can be  made, we may  say that  rates of wages for         the same work increased less rapidly than the cost of  living in  the first         three years of the war, in the fourth year wages gained and their  increase      ..   over four years was nearly that of the modified index.  In 1918-19 wages         gained rapidly and reached the official  cost of living  measurement, and         they kept pace with it in the year 1919-20.             (Dr.  Bowley :  &quot; Wages and  the Cost of Living, 1914-20.&quot;  The modi-         fied index spoken of is one compiled by the author.)By July 1920 Dr.  Bowley concludes  that the general rough  average of percentage increases in rates  of wages for twelve large classes of labour  had increased slighty more than the  official cost of living index.  In the &quot; Labour Gazette &quot; of February1921, it  is estimated that  the average  increase in rates to the end  of 1920 was 170 to180 per  cent.,  as against  the official cost of living index increase of 165 per cent.,though it  is suggested that if  all increases could have been included the  averagepercentage  increase of rates might be a little lower.        *     51.  Prior to  the movement towards lower wages that has taken place in thecurrent year, it may therefore be taken that over a very large part of the employmentfield rates of real wages  were generally equal to, if not slightly greater than, realrates in  1914.  In other words, put of an equal general fund of consumable commodities-ties and services, which  constitutes  the  national  income or dividend,  labour was taking as great a  share in 1920 as in 1914.  Variations of total earnings of labourmay be  neglected  for  the present argument, for there are  broad reasons to believethat absolute earnings tended to be larger in 1920 than  in 1914,  while, on the otherhand, business men assert emphatically that output has fallen.  If both these views are true, then  labour&apos;s share of the national dividend had  increased both relativelyand absolutely and not diminished.     52.  It is therefore necessary to look at the nature of the expenditure covered bythe Ministry of Labour cost of&apos; living index, and to see how far it includes goodssubject to indirect taxation.  So far as food is concerned, increases of cost due to increased indirect taxation are  fully included  in the cost of  living index.  Food isthe main item of  the index, accounting for 60 per cent, of the total.  The indirect taxation on food has risen from  mlO in 1913-14 to over  m50 in 1920-21.  Tobaccoalso is included in the cost of living index, in the miscellaneous items, which together
account for 4 per cent, of the total.  Taxation  thereon has increased from  ml8to  m55.  The principal remaining goods and services on which indirect taxation islevied are alcoholic liquor and entertainments.  Liquor taxation  advanced from  m43in 1913-14 to  m201 in 1920-21.  The Entertainments Tax yielded nearly  ml2 in1920-21  and was non-existent in 1913-14.    Neither of these is  included in  the calculations for the  cost of living  index.  It is  clear, however, that  if wages  areadvanced pari pcmu with  the increase in price of certain  standard articles, thosewages  will advance sufficiently to cover equal increases  in price of other articles,although  those other articles  are excluded  from the standard..   It  follows that greater increases in price of the excluded  articles will not be entirely covered by  the advance in wages, and that smaller increases will  give surplus advantage on &quot;the newwage.  The price of alcoholic liquor has advanced proportionately more than wages,and entertainment costs have advanced less.   Labour has thus  no doubt borne partof the additional taxation  on  drink, but  little of the  additional  taxation  onentertainments.    53. Now as far as the increased  rates of  wages were sufficient to cover  theincrease  in  price of  (taxed) commodities due to the element  of  heavier indirect taxation,  so far labour was not truly bearing the increased taxation.  To this extent the worker was receiving an equivalent quantity of consumable goods; he was payingmore for  them by reason of the  heavier tax,  but  he was recovering that additional expenditure  in his increased wage.  The true incidence  of the greater part of  the heavier indirect tax rested therefore upon the stream of production from which bothprofits and wages are drawn; wages being free of the tax, it  could only rest uponprofits and/or salaries, as distinguished from wages.    54.  The general conclusion  drawn from these considerations is that labour  hasbeen successful, so far as indirect taxation affects  the working classes, who constitute the majority of the nation,  in throwing back on to profits and/or salaries a consider-able  proportion, though not the  whole, of the additional taxation imposed duringthe war, which it was intended that labour itself should  bear.    55.  The foregoing observations are directed  to the period  up to the commence-ment of the movement towards lower wages on the current year.  The question thenarises  whether, in the course  of  the downward movement of wages that  has takenplace during the current year, and in the continuation of that  movement  which thefuture may show, labour has been and will be successful in maintaining the advan-tage gained.   It is understood- that  at  least 2,000,000 wage earners (excludingGovernment employees) have their wages directly affected by the Ministry  of Labourcost of living figures.   In these  cases, it  would appear highly  probable that labour will  maintain  its position  as  respects indirect taxation.    Even where the cost ofliving  index is not  expressly adopted  as a basis for the  movement  of  wages, itundoubtedly exercised, on the minds of both employer and employee, a considerable influence in the downward  adjustment  of  wages.  So  far as this influence findsexpression in the new wage determined on any occasion, so far  do the considerations set out apply.    56.  The further question presents itself whether, if indirect  taxation is nowgreatly increased, with a consequent rise; or arrest of the fall,  in the cost of living,labour will still maintain its position  vis-a-vis the cost of living index and thus ineffect throw  back the tax wholly or partly on to the richer classes.  If an absoluterise in the cost of living  be  assumed, and  if regard be paid  exclusively to  thetemporary weakness of labour in face  of the present trade depression, a negativeanswer would probably be returned.   But, if on  a longer view regard  be had to thefuture beyond  the existing state  of trade, and to the power of organised labour inmore normal conditions, it would be bold to  assert that  heavy additional indirect taxation  could be kept upon the wage-earning classes in more than a modest degree.                               V. CONCLUSIONS.    57. Erom  considerations set  out  briefly in the foregoing paragraphs   has emerged  a conclusion (from which we know of no escape), viz., that the commontalk of taxation of industry is full of fallacies, and  that popular psychology has no good ground in actual facts.  There is only one  pure tax on industry, and that is confined to industry carried on by limited  liability companies.   This is the  Corpora-tion Profits Tax, now estimated  to yield   m20 in 1921-22, and, tentatively,  m25in 1922-23.  Viewed in relation to  the profits and income on which it is laid-some m550 it is obvious that the use of language such as &quot;crippling,&quot; &quot;throttling&quot;and &quot;strangling&quot; is unjustified.       [7706]                                                          D
     58. Those  stamp  taxes  which  might legitimately  be regarded  as impeding industry are of such old standing that their  incidence is well settled,  and little objection is nowadays raised to them.     59. It has  been shown that the allegations  that Income Tax &quot; stifles industry &quot; and &quot; has to be added to the cost of everything  produced &quot;  cannot bear examination in the light of accepted conclusions on the incidence of a graduated personal Income Tax.  The charge that  income taxation checks business enterprise and,  by making men refuse to take risks, diminishes the national dividend has been reduced to the weight properly due to it.     60.  The  root of the  demand for  diminished direct taxation,  it  has been suggested, lies  in the  abnormal  circumstances of  the  present  trade  situation; abnormal because  the period  of the basis of  assessment  and the  period for due collection are the poles  apart  in their  comparative prosperity.  Industry has been and is still passing from the crest of the huge profit-bearing wave occasioned by the war down into  the trough which inevitably follows such an expansion of industry as took place during the immediate post-armistice  period.  The system of income taxation on average profits of past  periods, and the existence of large undischarged liabilities of special war profits taxation, is putting on present industrial  profits an almost unbearable pressure.  The direct remedies would lie in a remission of arrears of Excess Profits Duty  (say,  m200), and a retrospective alteration of the basis of Income Tax assessment for the current year.   The latter would give relief only  if assessments were brought down to the level of profits in 1921-22, and then at a cost to the Exchequer of nearly some  m50.   Neither remedy appears to be a practicableone.    61. The same result is sought by industry by a different route.  Suggestions are pressed for a transfer of an appreciable amount of revenue from direct taxation  to indirect taxation.   The main conclusions  of this note upon this subject may be summarised as follows :     62. It has been shown in paragraphs 48 to 56 above that there is  good reason to conclude that  increased  indirect taxation, intended to be borne by the wage-earning classes, who constitute the majority of the nation,  tends beyond a certain limit to be thrown back by labour on to the remuneration of  investors and the salaried employers of industry.   We  are passing  through a period in which reductions of  wages aretaking place and must continue to take place.* How far in this process wage earners are maintaining or improving their  absolute standard of living may be open to doubt;that they will strenuously fight to do so  is obvious, and the progress of the fight will be largely affected by the movements of  the cost  of living.  In the present temper ofthe wage  earners, there is no doubt  that an  increase in the cost  of  living will immediately and sharply affect negotiations on the reduction of wages.  This means that labour will  attempt to fasten on to capital increased indirect taxation intended to be placed upon wage earners.   If labour  succeeds in this effort, industry will secure no  real  relief from taxation,  while it  will have to put up with  all the inconveniences of the new indirect taxation.  If labour fails, so.that  prices rise and the real wages of the earners  fall, then their tendency to  ca&apos;canny  is likely to  be strengthened, so that in the end industry may lose more by diminished output than it gains from diminished taxation.     63. Whether  the attempt of labour to avoid the burden of increased indirect taxation will be  immediately successful depends, it has been  suggested, largely on the question whether trade will quickly revive; but, however this may be, the difficulties that this  course is likely to lead to are obvious.  More harm is done  to the national dividend by wage disputes and lost working days than by any other means.  On the one hand, direct taxation, as has  been  shown, only  falls on profits when  they have been made  and does  not raise the  cost of production.  Its damage to existing industry principally consists of a restriction  of the expansion of industry.   On  the  other hand, increased wages and, above all, embittered disputes as to rates of wages  do raise the  cost of production. For these reasons, it is a matter for anxious considera- tion whether a  marked increase of indirect taxation may not at the  present time prove far more  injurious to industry than the continuance of existing taxes at their present rates.     Inland Revenue, Somerset House,              January 1922.   * During the ten months from January to October 1921, inclusive, some 6,800,000 wage earnershave borne reductions of wages, amounting to  4,370,000 a week.                - :.:v
Notes on  the Inland  Revenue Memorandum written by Sir  Sydney J. Chapman,       K.C.B., C.B.E., and Mr.  A. W. Flux, C.B., of the Board of Trade.    I  am  in general agreement with the  conclusions of  the  memorandum on&quot; Industry and the Weight of Taxation.&quot;                      DEFINITION OF A TAX ON INDUSTRY.    In order to avoid any misconception, it will be desirable, before commenting upon it, to state concisely what is understood to be the exact meaning of the idea of the taxation of industry which is discussed in  the memorandum.    It is understood that a tax is regarded as a tax on industry in the sense intendedin the memorandum if it has the effect of :      (a.) Discouraging the disposition to save and invest savings in industry; or    (6.) Discouraging people from doing as much in their businesses as they would           have done otherwise.                           Two Excluded Questions.    If this is a fair definition, two questions which might  be confused with theproblem examined in the memorandum are  excluded,  viz. :    1.  The bearing of the taxation of labour on the country&apos;s production; and    2.  The effect on the amount saved in the country of the appropriation of a large           proportion of the national income by the Government,  which may be           regarded as distinct  from the effect of a discouragement of the disposition           to save out of any given net income.    As regards the first of these two excluded questions, it will of course be  under-stood  that very  heavy taxation of the  wage  earners is apt to exert upon them sodepressing an effect, either  physical or mental, as to  reduce the national income; andin this connection the  significant fact pointed out in the memorandum may be noted,namely, that increased indirect taxes have, on the whole, been carried by increased wages  (any depressing effect thus being avoided), though,  of course, wages  do notnecessarily rise as indirect  taxes are raised.    As regards the other excluded question, viz., the fact that the amount of capitalthat can be saved is necessarily reduced when the State increases the share  that it takes of the  national income, it may be observed incidentally that this holds withreference to all taxes and not merely with reference to an Income Tax. But it  seldomor never happens that the whole of the contribution  to the Exchequer is made at theexpense of saving.  People may and do work harder or spend less to make up for whatthey have to pay in taxes.   Moreover, it has to be borne in mind that taxes cannot beregarded as a deduction from the national  income  in so far as their proceeds are paid back to nationals in the form of interest on loans; chough it would be fallaciousto maintain that on this account particular business is really  taxed to the extent towhich the taxes paid by it exceed the payments made to it on  any  Government stockheld by it, for there  is no reason  to regard  investments in Government stock asdifferent from other investments in this respect.    We may now  proceed  to an examination of the specific question raised in thememorandum, viz., whether the taxes under review, and in particular the IncomeTax, discourage the  saving of capital for industrial  investment  and discourageenterprise.  It will conduce to clearness  to keep these two  sides  of  the problemdistinct.   Effect  of the Income  Tax on the Disposition to Save and Invest Industrially.    Here  two questions are raised.  The first is Avhetber the Income Tax discouragessaving, and the second is whether it tends to reduce the proportion of savings putinto industry.    The determinants of saving are very obscure.  On the one hand, it may be  argued that if the rewards for  saving  (i.e., the interest on  investments) are diminished bytaxation, the inducement to save is diminished and there will therefore be a tendency to spend a larger proportion of  income than before.  But, on the other hand, there is       [7706]                                                      D 2
 some reason to suppose that in a large number  of cases the quantity of saving is governed mainly by the importance of having a certain sum laid by, or a certain income from  investment.  In so far as this is the case, the diminished yield from saving will tend to increase the amount saved from a given income. It is impossible to say which  influence predominates, taking the community as a whole, but there is much  to be said for the view that within a wide range the degree of taxation does not greatly affect one way or the other the proportion of a given income that is saved. There remains, of course, the consideration referred  to  above,  namely, that  State expenditure of most kinds takes away some wealth from the community, and less is saved  because there is less to save from, but, as has been argued, this consideration relates to all forms of taxes and not merely to the issue raised in the memorandum.     To the above line of argument it might be objected that the wealthiest save most, and that in their case the discouragement of saving is greatest (because of the Super- Tax),  while the personal necessity on their part not to relax the saving habit cannot be represented as pressing.  This is  true, but it is not  unlikely that the desire to maintain the  proportion of future to present means plays the part in the case of the wealthy which is played by necessity, or at least prudence, in the case of the poorer.     As regards the question of whether the taxes under review are of such a nature as to divert the stream of savings from industry to some other purpose (for instance into State loans here and abroad),  there is no apparent reason why this should be the case.  The taxes fall on incomes from investment regardless of the source from which the income is  derived, and therefore should have no effect one way or the other on the direction of investment.     There is  one argument in the memorandum  relating  to the above considerations which seems doubtful, viz., the suggestion that a tax on the undistributed profits of companies may be a tax on industry in the sense in which the other forms of  the Income Tax are not.  In deciding on  the proportion of  earnings  to be kept in  the&apos;business, companies must take into account the deductions to be made in the form of [ncome Tax from what is so retained.  They would be  disposed to hold back all that was necessary after payment of Income Tax. But it might be contended that they are not really  left  with a free hand because their action is limited  by what they feel they must distribute to keep their shareholders satisfied in view of the Income Tax on what is distributed.  This contention goes to show, however, that the Income Tax on shareholders is as much a check on the amount held back as the Income Tax on the amount held back.     (As a matter of fact the Super-Tax should serve as an inducement to certain companies to  reserve in the business  more than they would have done otherwise, because Super-Tax is nofcharged on what is not paid out.)  It is not denied, of course, that the special exemption  from taxation  of reserved earnings would operate as a direct encouragement  of the retention of a large part of business earnings in the business, but  as against this there would naturally be some reduction of the amounts saved  by persons who would otherwise have received large dividends.  On the whole, however,  saving and  the  extent  to  which  it was  devoted to  industry would be magnified.                         Effect of the Tax on Enterprise.     We have to  consider not merely the effect of the  tax on the supply of capital adventured in industry (as  has been done above), but also the effect of the tax on the use made of  the capital, that is on enterprise.  Thus, to take a simple case, a man might have a large business of his own earning a large income for him, and: might be in  doubt as to whether he should make some new departure, involving considerable work  and worry, or keep entirely to the old paths.  If the profits from the action he was in doubt about were to be diminished by one-half  through  taxation, he would probably be less inclined to take  it than he would be if  he retained much more for himself,  in so far as  his action was governed by considerations of personal gain  though it is  true  that he might accept some unusual risks in a desire to keep  up his net income, particularly if his income were not very large.  It is arguable, then that the Income  Tax, in its  incidence  on unearned income, may  be  an appreciable discouragement of the enterprise which  makes use of  capital.  Moreover,  it  is arguable in  addition that the Super-Tax,  in its incidence on earned income, so far as  it discourages enterprise, discourages  the enterprise  of those  who through  their success have shown themselves the fittest to direct the business of the country.  The same objection of course applies  indirectly to Super-Tax on the unearned  income from new savings in  so far as the new savings are made by anybody who is making
                     INDUSTRY AND BURDEN OF TAXATION.    The general lines of the argument contained in the memorandum prepared forthe Boards of Customs and Inland Revenue is one  to which it would be difficult totake exception.  The section relating to indirect taxation and wages would appearto need somewhat careful examination, however, before a detailed argument couldwhat extra he can out of his business in order to save he thinks of Iris extra earningsas dividends  resulting from their investment, and these are subject to Super-Tax.     This, however, is only one side of the case.  On the other side, it may be contended that the thought of personal gain probably plays a much smaller part in determining the action of business leaders than is sometimes supposed.  Anybody who has attaineda certain position is naturally inclined to make the most of what can be done in that position regardless of pecuniary rewards.     It is instinct in man and  the instinct is fostered by competition to  achieve the most he is capable of achieving.     In this connection, it is argued in the memorandum that the Corporation profits tax is in a special sense a tax on industry, inasmuch as it falls on business of one particular type of organisation.  But it may  be doubted whether it has any largeeffect in  discouraging  enterprises  of  that type.  The conveniences  of being in the limited-liability form are so great that the tax is not likely to deter  many businessesfrom assuming that form.   It is true that  those  who derive  their income  frombusinesses not in this  form pay tax at a lower rate, but against this there is the disadvantage of  being without limited-liability  protection as  is  argued  in thememorandum.              Effect of Income Tax on the General Level of Prices.     The view that  the Income Tax falling on businesses is passed on to costs ofproduction and so to price, thus placing industries  in this country at a disadvantage in  international  competition, is certainly fallacious.   If  only a few classes ofindustry were taxed, the taxation would have to  be based  on  the  price,  to enablethose industries  to get sufficient capital, and the price of their  products would risein relation to the price of the products of the  industries  not so heavily taxed.   Butthis cannot  hold when  all  industries  are subject to the same tax,  because  nodisadvantage is suffered by one as compared with others.  And in any event practicaltaxation problems are not complicated by having any appreciable bearing on thegeneral level of prices, which is obviously settled by the supply of money  and itsrate of circulation in relation to the  supply of what it is spent on.  It is needlessto go into the question of the  way in which  the  forms  of  taxation can indirectlyaffect these determinants.                   Impressions, though mistaken,  have Effects.     Finally,  it must be remembered that the whole of the above analysis holds onlyon  the  assumption that people&apos;s impressions about  the  effects of  certain taxescorrespond with the facts.  We cannot argue about human affairs as we do aboutphysical  facts.   If  people&apos;s ideas are mistaken their  mistaken  ideas may produceeconomic  consequences not unlike those that would be produced if their ideas werecorrect.   There is undoubtedly a general impression at the present  time that, whilethe country could stand in some form the taxation which is needed,  the  Income Taxis in some way putting a check on commerce and industry.  No amount of argument,however  inherently convincing,  will remove this impression. -  And as the impressionis there,  the detrimental effect on trade and industry  follows, for psychologicalreasons,  pretty  much  the  same  as it  would if  the  impression  were  correct.Consequently, the country&apos;s trade  and  industry  would  probably benefit if theIncome Tax  could be somewhat reduced and some  tax be substituted which was not seriously objectionable on the same or other grounds.     But it is questionable whether such a substitute  can be found.     It was necessary to put this point, but it is equally necessary not to  overstate it.Businesses have now been relieved, of the Excess Profits Duty, and in view of this itis not unlikely that the prejudice against raising  so much by means of the IncomeTax form of  taxation may die down in the near future.

ISbe accepted, though the general conclusion appears sound.   A few remarks on thissection are given later.     The real causes for the complaints made on behalf&apos;of  industry at the presenttime are possibly different from those alleged by the spokesman of the industrialists.It would appear that incomes on which Income Tax and Excess Profits Duty havebeen assessed have, in fact, been secured, and that owing to deferment in collectionof the taxes assessed, those into whose hands the profits have flowed have disposedof those profits in a manner which leaves  them without adequate funds to meet  the tax demands.   It is submitted that the source of trouble is not the mode of taxation,and that the taxpayers  who have had the  privilege of using for  their own purposessums which are ultimately due from them as taxes, should be the last to complain ofa procedure which has favoured them as against other classes of the community,and particularly that an attempt now to throw off on to other classes a part of  theburden justly assessed upon them should not receive any excessive sympathy.     In these remarks it is assumed that  the profits on  which the  taxes  have been assessed have actually been made, and that the question is not  one of charging to duty hypothetical profits.  If this latter were  the explanation of the situation  theappropriate mode of treatment would  have regard to  this point.   The  presentcomplaints, however, are understood not  to  have regard to the mode of assessingExcess Profits Duties, and to the depreciation of stocks in  hand, which is a matter that has received attention  and for which a remedy has been introduced.    A point of  very considerable  importance with reference  to  the  reaction  on industry of heavy taxation is  the distribution of wealth  and  of  income betweenpersons of  advanced  years and persons  in  the  more   active  period of life.Discouragement of active and energetic men engaged in the  building up of fortunesmay be of much greater importance to the welfare of industry than measures whichevoke protest mainly from the more mature.  The latter have, in large degree&apos;, formedhabits  which are  not readily  overcome.   The systematic  accumulation of wealthmay proceed, even though the rate of return on the.capital and the personal energiesinvolved  be less than would have furnished an adequate stimulus to independenteffort while a fortune still  remained  to be made.  Further, though the advice and guidance of the mature  experienced minds in industry  is of the  greatest value, and while in some cases men of advanced years show a great  readiness to undertakeindustrial  risks,  it  is  almost certainly  true that  the younger and  more  elasticintelligences are those which contribute most in the way of judicious venturesomenessin the expansion of business, whether industrial or mercantile.    The purpose of the  preceding remarks is to stress the point that taxation whichsuppresses  the energies  of the relatively young, and  taxation  which evokes protestfrom  the  distinctly mature,  may  have,  in practice,  effects of  widely differingimportance, since the wealth and the income from which the State claims its shareis in much greater degree in the hands of the elderly than in the hands of persons in what is commonly regarded as the  prime of life.  So far  as concerns wealth,  theevidence  of the  records of  assessments to Estate Duty is  very  instructive in this regard. The Report of  the Commissioners of Inland Revenue for the year 1914-15contains tables which classify estates  passing at dea,th according to the magnitude ofthe estate and the age of the owner, and from this table it appears that about seven-eights  of all property passing at death in England and Wales  in  a year which islikely to have included a somewhat unusual  proportion  of deaths to wealthy youngmen, was the property of persons of  55 years of age and upwards.  Even of estatesunder  50,000,  six-sevenths in value  were recorded as owned by  persons of 55 yearsand over, while  the  larger  estates were,  in  quite overwhelming proportion,  in  thehands of these  relatively elderly persons.    It is probably true that large incomes not associated with large  property may bereceived in considerably more substantial  degree by persons in the middle years of life, than corresponds to the distribution of property just alluded to, but it cannotbe without importance  in reference  to the  real effect  of taxation  upon  industrialprogress, that property and consequently the unearned portion  of  income is over-overwhelmingly in the hands of persons  whose  habits have been formed,  and who  arelikely to continue to devote themselves to those business  pursuits which have become the  habit of their lives, even though  the monetary reward obtained by them  should fall off in  consequence  of the burdens  falling on the  State,  which  involve heavytaxation of the citizens.    The point urged in  the Memorandum of the Revenue Departments cannot be  too strongly emphasised thai taxation is a matter of persons,  though  their relation to
industry may serve as the  basis of their individual assessments, and it is likely to lead to grave error to yield to the habit of referring to taxation as being a taxation of industry.  Even the point brought out in the Memorandum that undistributedprofits are charged to Income Tax, may not be quite conclusive, since the effect of this may be largely felt in the amounts of the distributions made to shareholders; that isto say, that if the rates of taxation to Income Tax were substantially reduced it would remain  to be proved that  the effect would  be found in a larger total  retained asundistributed profits rather than in a disproportionate increase in the profits whichare distributed.     The problems of the shifting  of taxation are extremely difficult to deal  withprecisely, since  the relations of classes involved are not free  from complicationsarising  out of other than tax considerations.   The question, for  example, of whetherIncome  Tax can be transferred  from intended bearer to other classes, is a questiondepending on the economic situation; and just as, for a period at least, the owners ofbusinesses found themselves in a position in which they were able so greatly to increasethe charges for  their products that Excess  Profits Duty and in many cases,  morethan the amount actually paid in Excess Profits Duty was transferred  to consumersof the goods, so, in a like situation would any burdens placed on the conductors ofindustry be capable of transference by them to the users of their product. If, in fact,the owners of capital and of managing ability are in a position  to say that they willnot co-operate with other sections of the Community unless they receive,  as net returnafter all charges are met,  at least  a certain minimum, any additional  charges thatmay be placed on them will be transferable.  The whole problem taken up in thelatter part of the Memorandum is complicated in this way,  since, in the course ofthe war, the wage earning classes of the Community claimed, and to a large extentsecured, a greater share  in  the  total available  stream of new wealth  than had previously fallen to them.  It is at least possible that some of the discontent nowfinding   expression  from   the  side  of   the   managers   of  industry,  is  in reality  a  discontent  with  the necessity  for  a new  proportion  between  whathand-workers receive  and what  brain-workers  receive.  Whether  the economicsituation  will,   in  the  near   future,  permit  the  latter  class  to  obtain as large a proportionate  share as before the war,  remains  to be seen; but if  theclaims of the hand-workers for a fuller life can be made good by them, the managingclasses  will have  to  adjust themselves to this new situation. .  If  they  refuse toco-operate on these terms, the nation may be  greatly impoverished before they realise that it is better  to give their assistance on less favourable terms  than to have nothingat all.  Any charges not directfy related to the current business, of production are naturally felt, at  such a time of readjustment, as peculiarly burdensome, and it isnot  difficult to  induce  careless thinkers to attribute most of their troubles to thsseother charges.   I  should be  disposed to say that it is the total burden of taxation,rather than the  particular form which it takes, which is the true reason for such ofthe  complaints made by industrialists as are well-founded, and the Memorandum ofthe Revenue Boards very justly stresses the danger that may arise from an attempt toredistribute the total of taxation so as to make more of it fall upon wage earners ina fashion in which they will be directly conscious of the burden.  The reduction  of theburden, rather than its redistribution (if by any means that is possible) appears the true direction in which to attempt to move,  though there are rather narrow  limits to such movement unless it should prove possible to adopt measures resulting in  aserious decrease in the very heavy  annual debt charges.
