HEAT-RESISTING GLASSES FOR MINERS  FLAME SAFETY LAMPS.;,p.3680.     Memorandum,by the President of the Board of Trade.     Under Section  33 of the  Coal Mines  Aot,  1911,  no safety lamp can legally he used in  any  mine  in  which naked lights are prohibited unless It is of a type approved by the Mines Depart- ment,  as successors to the Home  Office,    The tests applied to the  glasses of flame lamps are,  for obvious reasons,  severe. Before the war nearly all the glasses used in this country were Imported from Germany and Austria and the cessation of imports from these countries upon the out-break  of war rapidly resulted in an  acute shortage.   The  greatest  difficulty was experienced in inducing British firms to embark upon the manufacture on a large  scale of this description  of glass, which presented&apos;technioal difficulties and necessitated  heavy outlay on new plant, the obtaining of foreign  labour and long training of English labour, while it  offered inferior prospects of profit to those offered by develop;ixent  of the industry in other directions.  For this reason with the written approval of the Home Seoretary (Mr. MeKenna), the Home Office on the 14th October, 1914, gave an oral  undertaking  to the Managing Director of Messrs, Ackroyd  and Best  Ltd., one of the leading English Lamp Manufacturing firms, that,  &quot;as the German and Austrian&quot;manufacturers of safety lamp glasses  are no longer able to supply&quot;them,  their glasses will be  removed from the approved list, and&quot;provided English manufacturers are able  to supply sufficient&quot;number of suitable  glasses,  no German or Austrian glasses will&quot;be restored or added to the  list for a period of at least&quot;three  years from the conclusion of the war,&quot;  This undertaking was renewed in writing in August 1917 by the Ministry of Munitions which by that means contrived to work the British output up to a bare  sufficiency  in 1918 and  it has required continued Departmental effort up to quite recent days to  ensure
adequate supplies. The legality of the pledge has now been challenged by intending importors of German and Austrian glasses.  The question was referred to the Law Officers who advised that the whale pledge was ultra vires the Coal Mines Act and that a Mandamus would lie against the Department on a refusal to accept lamps for test on the sole ground of their being German or Austrian.

The British industry is in the hands of three firms. Their output is quite adequate in quantity and suitable in quality and there has been no pressure either from colliery companies or from lamp manufacturers for the importation of foreign glasses. The British manufacturers at present charge about 150/- per gross whereas an importer mentions 50/- per gross as his probable price for German and Austrian glasses. While this difference in price would represent an average saving to colliery companies of only 0.45 pence per ton of coal, it would undoubtedly have the effect of killing the home industry, and inclusion within the scope of the 33 1/3 per cent duty under the Safeguarding of Industries Act would not avail to protect it. The manufacture of these glasses cannot be brought under Part I of the Act.

The position is

(1) that the British Manufacturers accepted the pledge in good faith, that the pledge has been continually used by the Departments in pressing the manufacturers to increase the supply of glasses, and that there is no doubt the manufacturers were led to believe that the prohibition of German and Austrian glasses would continue until 31st August, 1924;

(2) that the pledge is ultra vires, that the Government cannot carry out its undertaking except by legislation, and that the only alternative to this is to commit a gross breach of faith.

A Draft Bill is accordingly submitted.

The dangers inherent in restricting the sources of supply are obviated -


       (a)   by the  proviso  in the  Bill  that  tho  Board of  Trade shall  be  satisfied  that  the  supply is  auffioient  in  quantity,  suitable  in quality, and reasonable  in  prioe, and,       (b)   by possible competition  from Belgium, franco,  and  America (two American makes have already been  approved),                         ...
